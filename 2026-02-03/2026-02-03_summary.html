A package of bills aims to combat federal immigration operations, including codifying the city's sanctuary protections.

At least 15 Philadelphia city councilmembers have backed a package of ”ICE Out” legislation aimed at combating ICE and federal immigration enforcement operations in Philadelphia, including codifying sanctuary protections and prohibiting federal immigration agents from concealing their identities or covering their faces. “We heard the cries from the community calling for something to be done,” says Kendra Brooks, a member of the Philadelphia City Council, where she serves as minority leader. “Our goal was to make sure that something is in place to prevent any undue harm.” Councilmembers will vote on the legislation in the coming weeks, and it is expected to pass with a veto-proof majority.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: As we continue to look at local resistance nationwide against Trump's crackdown, we go to Philadelphia, where a group of at least 15 city councilmembers have backed a package of seven bills aimed at combating federal immigration enforcement operations in Philadelphia, including codifying the city's sanctuary protections. The bill would also prohibit federal immigration agents from concealing their identities, covering their faces or using unmarked cars. It also requires judge-signed warrants and prohibits city workers from cooperating with ICE. The efforts are being led by Philadelphia City Councilmembers Kendra Brooks, who will join us in a minute, and Rue Landau. They co-authored the legislation package. All but two of the city's 17 councilmembers have co-sponsored the ”ICE Out” package, indicating the legislation may have a veto-proof majority.

In response to the legislation being introduced, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker made one of her first public statements about Trump's immigration raid, saying on social media, quote, “We are aware of the potential challenges that we face, and we understand the public's fear of the unknown, as it relates to federal policy associated with immigration,” unquote.

Meanwhile, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has launched a national coalition of prosecutors that would hold federal immigration agents accountable if they're found to have violated state or local laws and civil rights protections. The coalition includes prosecutors in Virginia, Arizona and Texas. Last week, DA Krasner issued this warning to federal immigration agents.

LARRY KRASNER: This is a small bunch of wannabe Nazis. That's what they are. In a country of 350 million, we outnumber them. … I, along with a bunch of other state prosecutors, are rallying around Mary Moriarty, who is the prosecutor in Minneapolis. I know for a fact she is working 24/7 to make sure that there is justice coming out of two, what appear to be, by all indications, criminal homicides, and what appears to be, by all indications, a criminal shooting of someone in the leg. I want — I want you to understand that just as you have come together, there are state prosecutors coming together right now to make sure that people understand there will be accountability. There will be accountability now. There will be accountability in the future. There will be accountability after Trump is out of office. If we have to hunt you down the way they hunted down Nazis for decades, we will find your identities. We will find you. We will achieve justice. And we will do so under the Constitution and the laws of the United States.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner.

For more, we're joined in Philadelphia by City Councilmember Kendra Brooks, sponsor of the ICE Out legislative package that's being voted on by the Philadelphia City Council. Powerful words by the DA. Can you explain exactly what's at the heart of your legislation and how it can be enforced, if in fact you and Rue Landau, the two of you sponsoring this legislation, get it passed?

KENDRA BROOKS: Well, we — thank you so much for having me, to start.

Councilmember Landau and I worked very closely with DA Larry Krasner and our sheriff's department to make sure this legislation will be able to be enforced once we move it forward. Part of it was just making sure our community members felt safe. As a community organizer myself, we heard the cries from the community calling for something to be done. So, we started out with a series of community trainings around how to protect yourself against ICE. And over the last couple of months, we've been crafting out this legislation with both local and national legislators and attorneys to make sure that this is something that we can actually implement here in the city of Philadelphia.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Councilwoman, how would these — this package actually work? Are you seeking to get criminal liability or civil liability by Philadelphians against ICE abuses?

KENDRA BROOKS: I think the determination on exactly how it will work will be up to the prosecutor, which will be the DA's Office, to determine exactly how that works. But for us, the goal was to get something on the books to codify our existing executive orders, to make sure that community members felt safe and that something was actually being done to protect, you know, our citizens here in Philadelphia, whether it's the number of folks who have experienced ICE agents being [masked] and in unmarked cars coming to the criminal justice center or to schools or to places of employment, or whether it was making sure that we're not participating and sharing data with ICE agents, and also making sure that they're unable to stage raids and attacks on our community in our public spaces, i.e. schools, recreation centers or any places owned by the city. So, our goal was to make sure that something is in place to prevent any undue harm and to work with existing law enforcement to make sure that we can do something to protect our citizens.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what about conditions in detention centers in Philadelphia? There was a death of a Cambodian American, Parady La, on January 9th. He was found unresponsive in a Philadelphia detention center and rushed to a hospital. What can the Philly city government do to regulate conditions inside a federal jail?

KENDRA BROOKS: I think, well, from my understanding, we have been looking into the — we heard it was two deaths in detention centers here in Pennsylvania, but they aren't actually in Philadelphia. We are working with legislators across the commonwealth to have this discussion, and we have a couple bills that are happening in our state House, as well, around regulations around ICE and detention centers. But we'll see what happens moving forward. We've been working very closely with a lot of our immigrant justice organizations in the city and across the commonwealth, and hopefully we'll see something come out of that soon.

AMY GOODMAN: The Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, has sued the Trump administration 19 times and successfully stopped the unlawful deployment of the National Guard. As we begin to wrap up, can you talk about the significance of this support from the state government, and also perhaps what you want to see more of, and the timing of your ICE Out legislation, when it's going to be voted on?

KENDRA BROOKS: I think it's good to see the state of Pennsylvania fighting back against the Trump administration, especially when it comes to our citizens, whether it's the multiple cases that the governor has brought against, whether it's the removing of our slave monument down at — on Market Street, or us implementing this ICE legislation. I think, collectively, as a commonwealth, we can work together to protect our citizens across the board.

And also, with our ICE Out legislation, we are waiting for it to get put into committee. It should take about four to six, maybe eight weeks before we can get a committee hearing, or maybe sooner. And our goal is just to move this as fast as possible, to make sure that, you know, we're doing all that we can to keep Philadelphians safe, and continue to work with our state and federal legislatures to make sure that Pennsylvania is a welcoming place for our immigrant neighbors.

The “decision to terminate Haiti's TPS designation was motivated, at least in part, by racial animus,” the judge ruled.

A federal judge is blocking the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian immigrants living in the U.S., finding that statements made by White House officials demonstrate that racial bias played a part in decision-making. 

Last fall, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that Secretary Kristi Noem had made a final determination to end TPS status for Haitians after claiming to have consulted with multiple agencies about the idea, stipulating that she had “determined that Haiti no longer meets the conditions for the designation for Temporary Protected Status.”

“The Secretary, therefore, is newly terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation of Haiti as required by statute,” the statement explained, adding that the status would end on February 3, 2026.

On Monday, U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes placed an indefinite stay on Noem's order, citing comments from Noem that made her question the DHS secretary's motivations.

In a social media post late last year, for example, Noem said she was recommending travel bans on multiple countries, including Haiti, using abhorrent and bigoted language to describe immigrants from those countries.

“I am recommending a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies,” Noem said in her tweet, further describing those people as “foreign invaders” who “slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS.”

“WE DON'T WANT THEM. NOT ONE,” Noem added. 

Reyes included a screengrab of Noem's social media post on the first page of her order. 

The judge noted in her ruling that the five Haitian plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit forward “are not…'killers, leeches, or entitlement junkies,'” but respected members of their communities, including a neuroscientist, a toxicology lab assistant, a college student, and a registered nurse.

“Plaintiffs charge that Secretary Noem preordained her termination decision and did so because of hostility to nonwhite immigrants. This seems substantially likely,” Reyes said in her ruling.

Reyes recognized that Noem “has terminated every TPS country designation to have reached her desk — twelve countries up, twelve countries down.” Despite the department saying otherwise, the DHS head also failed to review the current conditions in Haiti, and to consult with federal agencies that could inform her decision, Reyes said — which Noem is required to do by law under statutes governing TPS changes.

Reyes also pointed out that, while Noem claims that Haiti is hospitable enough for immigrants under TPS to return, the U.S. government advises against Americans traveling to the country “for any reason.”

“Do not travel to Haiti due to kidnapping, crime, terrorist activity, civil unrest, and limited health care,” the State Department's website currently reads.

That warning “does not exactly scream, as Secretary Noem concluded, suitable for return,” Reyes wrote.

Reyes noted in her ruling that President Donald Trump has made numerous racist comments about nonwhite immigrants, including those from Haiti, over the course of his two presidential terms. Noem's decisions about Haitian immigrants over the past year have come in close proximity to some of Trump's comments, the judge said, citing instances in February, June, and December of last year. 

Reyes also cited previous rulings against removing the TPS designation for Haitians in Trump's first term, showing that judges in those decisions had shown that his first administration was “motivated by the ‘discriminatory purpose of removing nonwhite immigrants from the United States.'”

Reyes stated:

Taken together, the record strongly suggests that Secretary Noem's decision to terminate Haiti's TPS designation was motivated, at least in part, by racial animus. The mismatch between what the Secretary said in the Termination and what the evidence shows confirms that the termination of Haiti's TPS designation was not the product of reasoned decision-making, but of a preordained outcome justified by pretextual reasons.

Officials from the Trump administration promised to appeal the ruling.

“Supreme Court, here we come,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said after the ruling was issued, describing Reyes's order as “lawless activism.”

Lawyers Geoff Pipoly and Andrew Tauber, who represented the Haitian plaintiffs in the case, called the ruling “a significant victory.”

“Haiti remains an extraordinarily dangerous place, marked by widespread gang violence, rampant disease, lack of access to clean drinking water, severe housing instability, and the absence of a functioning government,” they said in a statement. 

Trump's racism toward Haitian immigrants was perhaps most evident during his 2024 presidential campaign, when he peddled incendiary and dehumanizing lies about Haitian residents of Springfield, Ohio. 

“They're eating the dogs. They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump claimed, without evidence, during a debate with Democratic candidate for president Kamala Harris. 

Trump's running mate, and now vice president, JD Vance, seemed to acknowledge that Trump's racist tirade was a lie — but stated that he didn't care if the claims were false as long as they advanced his anti-immigrant agenda.

“If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do,” Vance said on the campaign trail.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            A US aircraft carrier shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively approached” the ship in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday hours before two gunboats operated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and threatened to board and seize the ship, according to a US military spokesman.
    


            The two incidents occurred days before US and Iranian officials are due to meet Friday for diplomatic negotiations meant to avert a military clash.
    


            In the first incident on Tuesday, US forces shot down an Iranian drone “as the unmanned aircraft aggressively approached” the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which was transiting the Arabian Sea about 500 miles from Iran's southern coast, said Capt. Tim Hawkins, a US Central Command spokesman.
    


            “The Iranian drone continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by US forces operating in international waters,” Hawkins said. An F-35C fighter jet from the Lincoln shot down the drone to protect the carrier and its personnel, he said.
    


            “No American service members were harmed during the incident, and no U.S. equipment was damaged,” Hawkins said.
    


            Hours later, two Iranian gunboats approached the M/V Stena Imperative — a chemical tanker operated by Americans flying under the US flag in the Strait of Hormuz — passing the ship three times at high speeds as an Iranian Mohajer drone also flew overhead, said Hawkins. During one of their passes, the Iranians threatened via radio call that they would board and seize the tanker. The tanker was in international waters, Hawkins said.
    


            US military forces operating in the area responded when they learned of the Iranian threats. The USS McFaul destroyer escorted the tanker away from the area along with defensive air support from the US Air Force, Hawkins added. The situation de-escalated as a result.
    


            Hawkins said the Iranian behavior was an example of the Iranians' “unprofessionalism and aggressive behavior” that increases the risk of miscalculation for vessels operating in the area and said their “harassment” in international waters won't be tolerated by the US.
    


            The incidents come as President Donald Trump has been weighing a major strike on Iran amid stalled discussions about limiting that nation's nuclear program and ballistic missile production.
    


            In the last week the US military has accelerated a buildup of military hardware in the Middle East, deploying the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to the region along with three guided-missile destroyers and the carrier air wing, which includes squadrons of F/A-18E Super Hornet fighters, F-35C Lightning II fighters, and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jets.
    


            The Navy also has three destroyers — the USS McFaul, the USS Delbert D. Black, and the USS Mitscher — in the region separate from the carrier strike group.

            The incidents come as President Donald Trump has been weighing a major strike on Iran amid discussions about limiting that nation's nuclear program and ballistic missile production.
    


            Talks between the US and Iran planned for later this week hit a snag Tuesday after Tehran requested they be relocated, that regional participants be excluded, and that the discussions' scope be limited to the country's nuclear program, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that the meetings, led on the US side by special envoy Steve Witkoff, are “still scheduled as of right now, but of course the president has always a range of options on the table, and that includes the use of military force.”
    


            In the last week the US military has accelerated a buildup of military hardware in the Middle East, deploying the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to the region along with three guided-missile destroyers and the carrier air wing, which includes squadrons of F/A-18E Super Hornet fighters, F-35C Lightning II fighters, and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare jets.
    


            The Navy also has three destroyers — the USS McFaul, the USS Delbert D. Black, and the USS Mitscher — in the region separate from the carrier strike group.
    


            The new demands by Iran could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions.
    


            The talks had been set for Istanbul, with foreign ministers from Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also expected to attend.
    


            Tehran is now asking for an alternate location: Oman, the small Gulf sultanate that has previous hosted talks between the US and Iran.
    


            And it has requested the scope of the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue. The US has said its demands for Iran extend beyond an end to its nuclear program to curbing its ballistic missiles and ending support for regional proxy groups.
    


            What the changes — first reported by Axios — portend for the diplomatic efforts wasn't immediately clear. Already, some American officials had privately warned that Iran may be using diplomacy to play for time in preventing military action.
    


            The two key US participants in the discussions — Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner — arrived in the region on Tuesday for talks with Israeli officials.
    


            Trump said Monday that talks were ongoing but continued to point to the large military buildup in the region as evidence of his willingness to order strikes.
    


            “Right now we're talking to them. We're talking to Iran, and if we can work something out that'll be great, and if we can't, probably bad things would happen,” he said.

House passes package of five funding bills and DHS stopgap measure 217-214; measure now goes to Trump for approval as battle looms over guardrails for immigration enforcement

Trump-Petro meeting could end in detente or discord with Colombia leader

The House narrowly passed a package of five annual funding bills, and a stopgap measure to keep the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) open for two weeks – ending the partial government shutdown.

By a vote of 217-214, the package funds most of the federal government through 30 September. It includes a short-term bill to fund DHS until 13 February.

The continuing resolution was met with severe pushback from House Democrats, who say that the Trump administration will not use the window to negotiate in good faith, and argue any guardrails on federal immigration enforcement (including the use of judicial warrants and the need for officers to remain identifiable) should be guaranteed now.

Minnesota governor Tim Walz slammed homeland security Kristi Noem at a press conference today. When asked about her latest update, that all immigration officers deployed will be issued with body cameras.

Walz said Noem is the “absolutely worst choice for any cabinet position”. The governor noted that he's asked for body camera footage of Alex Pretti's fatal shooting which he's yet to receive.

“This is called damage control,” Walz said. “I put no stake in what she says at all. But here's the good thing, every single Minnesotan has a camera. Keep filming. Keep keeping track of this.”

James Comer, the Republican chair of the House oversight committee, announced that former president Bill Clinton, and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, have agreed to appear for closed-door depositions as part of the committee's ongoing investigation into the handling of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's crimes. Hillary Clinton will give testimony first, on 26 February, and the former president will appear for his deposition on 27 February. Their respective testimonies will be transcribed and filmed.

The Clintons' concession follows a months long standoff between the pair and Republicans on the oversight committee, which included Comer marking up legislation to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress.

“Once it became clear that the House of Representatives would hold them in contempt, the Clintons completely caved,” Comer said in a statement. “We look forward to questioning the Clintons as part of our investigation into the horrific crimes of Epstein and Maxwell, to deliver transparency and accountability for the American people and for survivors.”

On Monday, the Clintons finally agreed to testify as part of the House investigation. “They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” Angel Ureña, a spokesperson for the Clintons, replied to Comer, in a post on social media. “They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care. But the former president and former secretary of state will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”

The man accused of spraying congresswoman Ilhan Omar with an unidentified substance at a Minneapolis town hall last week is appearing before a federal judge today.

The justice department charged Anthony James Kazmierczak, 55, on a single count of “forcibly assaulted, opposed, impeded, intimidated and interfered” with Omar – a crime that carries up to a year in prison.

A magistrate judge today denied Kazmierczak's request for release while he awaits trial.

In a criminal complaint and attached affidavit, signed by an FBI special agent, a forensic team determined that the substance sprayed at Omar was a mixture of “water and apple cider vinegar”. Court documents state that Kazmierczak rushed the lectern after Omar called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to be abolished “for good” and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, Kristi Noem, to resign. “She [Noem] is not resigning. You're splitting Minnesotans apart,” Kazmierczak said after he sprayed the lawmaker, according to the affadavit.

The House cleared a procedural hurdle for a five-bill funding package and stopgap measure for the Department of Homeland Security to avert an ongoing partial government shutdown. It will now head to the House floor for a debate and a final vote.

Republicans can only afford for one member of their party to defect, or they will need help from Democrats to pass the bills. Thomas Massie, a GOP congressman from Kentucky, voted against the legislation earlier and is expected to hold out again.

The US military has shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea in an incident first reported by Reuters.

The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” and was shot down by an F-35 US fighter jet, the US military said.

“An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defense and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,” said navy captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson at the US military's Central Command.

No American service members were harmed during the incident and no US equipment was damaged, he added.

The incident came as diplomats sought to arrange nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, and Donald Trump warned that with US warships heading toward Iran, “bad things” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

The Lincoln carrier strike group is the most visible part of a US military buildup in the region following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was “seriously talking,” while Tehran's top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were under way.

US Central Command said that in another incident today, hours later in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel.

“Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” Hawkins said.

With the key procedural vote on the funding package to end the partial government shutdown under way, GOP leaders are in a scurry to win over enough of their members on the House floor.

We've already had two “no” votes from Thomas Massie of Kentucky and John Rose of Tennessee.

With the full Democratic caucus currently voting against the package, speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose one GOP vote. So, to get the near-unanimous support that he needs from his Republican conference to proceed to a final vote, he would need one lawmaker to change their vote before the vote on the rule closes.

Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump's approval, the Guardian has learned, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week.

Her presence at the raid drew criticism from Democrats and former intelligence officials, who questioned why the country's top intelligence officer with no domestic law enforcement powers would appear at the scene of an FBI raid.

But Gabbard, whose role ordinarily focuses on overseeing the intelligence agencies, has played only a minimal role in the criminal investigation, according to three administration officials. “She's doing her own thing,” one of the officials said.

The parallel investigations into the 2020 election underscore the extent to which it has returned as a priority to the president. And Gabbard being sent to the raid showed the interest on voting machine manipulation claims that Trump has cited as evidence the election was stolen.

The review led by the office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI), authorized on the basis that it is assessing election integrity, has been focused for months on potential vulnerabilities in voting machines and the possibility of foreign interference.

As part of that effort, Gabbard has been briefing Trump and senior White House advisers every few weeks. Officials said Trump directed her to travel to Fulton county, Georgia, so she could observe the FBI executing a search warrant on Wednesday.

The raid itself was overseen by Andrew Bailey, the deputy FBI director, who was also sent by Trump to Georgia. A copy of the search warrant cited possible violations of federal laws governing the preservation of election records and the procurement of false ballots or voter registrations.

The warrant authorized agents to seize sweeping amounts of voter data from Fulton county, including all physical ballots from the 2020 election, voting machine tabulator tapes, images produced during the ballot count and voter rolls from that year.

The target of the criminal investigation was not immediately clear. Spokespeople for the justice department and the FBI did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the investigation or Gabbard's role.

More than 40 Democratic members of Congress have written a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) inspector general (IG), to expedite its investigation into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents' use of force.

This comes after two US citizens – Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good – were fatally shot my federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, and protests continue to grip the Twin Cities.

The lawmakers write that agents are using “needlessly violent force against community members who are exercising their First Amendment rights and pose no threat”.

Last year, several Democratic lawmakers urged the IG to launch an investigation into the department's practices and use of force. In January, the IG launched a new audit along the lines of the lawmakers' request. However, the members of Congress note, these probes usually take more than a year to complete.

“Given the urgency of this situation – with communities facing severe, and sometimes fatal, harm from ICE's tactics on American streets every day – we request that your office conduct this review expeditiously and share any preliminary findings with Congress and the public on an expedited basis,” they wrote.

The press pool notes that Colombian president, Gustav Petro, has arrived at the White House for his meeting with Donald Trump. There was no traditional military honor guard or ceremonial protocol, reporters at the White House note.

Just a note on the vote to end the partial government shutdown, and pass a five-bill package, as well as a stopgap measure to keep the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for two weeks while Democrats negotiate guardrails on federal immigration enforcement.

Right now, there is a procedural vote in the House. This will set the parameters of the debate on the legislation. A reminder that Trump called on “no changes” when urging Republican lawmakers to pass the bills, noting that a longer shutdown was out of the question.

Later today, the whole House will vote on the legislation. Republicans can only afford one defector, after the balance shifted to 218-214 on Monday when speaker Mike Johnson swore in Christian Menefee, the newly elected Democrat from Houston.

A quick reminder that last year, just months into his second administration, Trump signed an executive order to enact sweeping restrictions and conditions on voting rights throughout the country. Again, changes that constitution prevents the executive branch from carrying out.

Most notably, Trump signed an order that directs states to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote. It's in line with his claims that non-citizens are voting in droves, despite election officials repeatedly refuting these assertions. However, a federal judge blocked this effort last year, ruling that it was a “violation of the separation of powers”. Also part of Trump's directive was an effort to block states accepting ballots after election day, despite the fact that many accept mail-in votes as long as they have been postmarked in time. The president has routinely derided mail-in ballots as fraudulent, despite having used the method to vote in the past.

My colleague, Andrew Gumbel, has been tracking Trump's attack on elections and voting. Read more below:

Per my earlier post about Trump's comments that Republicans should “nationalize” voting in certain places, it's worth remembering that the president, and many members of his administration, have repeated the baseless claims that he won the 2020 election.

Even on Bongino's podcast the president doubled down. “We have states so crooked, counting votes, that I won that show I didn't win,” he said. “2020, I won that election by so much.”

Trump also teased more about the FBI's operation in Georgia last week which saw the seizure of hundreds of boxes of 2020 ballots from Fulton County. “You're gonna see something in Georgia … the ballots, you will see some interesting things come out,” Trump said.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has vowed to challenge a federal judge's ruling that blocks the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians in the US.

“Supreme Court, here we come,” said assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This is lawless activism that we will be vindicated on.”

Judge Ana Reyes, a Joe Biden appointee, issued a halt on the expiration of the program for more than 300,000 Haitian immigrants who are living and working with authorization in the US.

“Haiti's TPS was granted following an earthquake that took place over 15 years ago, it was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program,” McLaughlin added. “Yet that's how previous administrations have used it for decades. Temporary means temporary and the final word will not be from an activist judge legislating from the bench.”

Bezos has not publicly responded to several letters sent by Post staffers urging him to curb potential layoffs

While Washington Post employees remain in the dark about an impending round of cuts that could dramatically reshape the publication, the man that many hoped could soften or stop the blow, owner Jeff Bezos, has remained silent.

So far, three staff-organized letters sent by Post employees to Bezos imploring him to protect the Post's robust coverage have gone unanswered.

The first plea went to Bezos on 25 January, when about 60 people signed a letter asking him to protect the company's foreign news operation, which is rumored to be a major target of cost-cutting.

Two days later, employees sent Bezos a letter asking him to preserve the newspaper's local coverage, which is also said to be at risk for heavy cuts.

“Should you allow Post management to lay off the local staff, which has been cut in half in the last five years, the effect on this region and the people in it will be immeasurable,” the staffers wrote. “We care deeply about the DC area, and we know you do, too.”

At the end of last week, the publication's White House reporters sent a letter to Bezos urging him to avoid cutting coverage areas central to its readership. Post staffers have also filmed and posted videos on social media urging Bezos to “#savethepost”.

While Post chief executive, Will Lewis, has been included on at least one of the emails, the letters have been addressed to Bezos, who some staffers hope might be more persuadable. (Matt Murray, the Post's top editor, has had private discussions with several Post journalists in recent weeks, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.)

“As the Post's [owner], Bezos is ultimately making the call on these cuts,” said a Post staffer who signed one of the letters but was not authorized to comment. “He also has enough money to do whatever he chooses here. Reporters across the newsroom want to be sure he understands the magnitude of the devastating cuts that we all expect are coming.”

Emails sent by the Guardian to Bezos and a representative at the company he founded, Amazon, have not been returned. A Post spokesperson declined to comment on the rumored cuts.

The Post staffer described the mood at the paper as “funereal”, with many expecting the cuts to come in the next few days – though the publication still has not acknowledged or confirmed that anything is happening. A rally to protest the cuts has been scheduled for outside the Post's headquarters on Thursday.

On Monday, the union representing most Post employees called out Bezos in a series of posts on X. “If @JeffBezos follows through with his reported plan to decimate the Post's newsroom, it will be a huge indictment of his supposed business prowess,” the account wrote. “How else to explain his failure to monetize some of the world's most award-winning, agenda-setting journalism?”

Some Post staffers also noted that Bezos has not yet commented on the 14 January raid of a Post reporter's home, even though many groups that advocate for journalists decried the government's tactics as unprecedented and dangerous. Cameron Barr, a former managing editor of the Post, called out Bezos for his silence in a post on LinkedIn, writing: “It's not just the chest-thumping overreach of the Trump administration that will crush American freedoms – it's the silence of its enablers.”

Amazon and Bezos have also faced criticism for spending approximately $75m to acquire and promote a documentary about Melania Trump – particularly after Bezos faced accusations of cozying up to Trump by killing the Post's planned endorsement last fall of Kamala Harris for president.

Glenn Kessler, who ended a 27-year-long career at the Post last year, expressed cautious optimism about the campaign to reach Bezos. “That kind of pushback might have an impact,” he said. “We don't really know until we see what the actual result is.”

Kessler said he and a few other reporters had lunch with Bezos, who purchased the paper in 2013, after Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 election. “He wanted to hear war stories and that sort of thing,” he recalled. “He was quite interested in what people did. He had this great laugh, and he seemed quite engaged.”

But Kessler was heavily critical of Bezos's handling of the Harris endorsement and his decision to refocus the section's opinion page to prioritize writing “in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets”, decisions that led to the resignation of a top editor and quickly cost the Post hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

“Even before these cuts, you can question the quality of Bezos's stewardship,” Kessler said. “The sense I get is that he's not nearly as engaged with the Post as he once was. If you're not really that engaged or invested in the thing that you own, the easiest thing to do is to cut back the money you're losing on it.”

“I think it's hard to overestimate how excited the journalists and editors were when Bezos bought the company,” recalled political journalist Chris Cillizza, who worked at the Post from 2006 to 2017. “The richest man in the world buys the company and he says all the right things. I think people were slower to see that something had changed because they wanted to believe so badly that the original sense we had of Bezos was it.”

Cillizza remembered being skeptical when Bezos said he intended the Post to be profitable. “I remember thinking to myself even then, in 2013: ‘Man, that's going to be tough.'”

While Bezos has stayed silent about potential cuts to the Post and ignored an effort by the union last year to get him to visit the newspaper, he was more visibly engaged with one of his other companies on Monday, the spaceflight startup Blue Origin.

Bezos was on hand to meet secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, who last November called the Post's reporting “fake news”, during a visit to the company's facility in Florida. “Great to see you,” Bezos told Hegseth. “Welcome – it's an honor to have you.”

Assistant secretary calls judge's decision ‘lawless activism' as she orders halt on expiration of Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Haitian immigrants

Trump-Petro meeting could end in detente or discord with Colombia leader

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has vowed to challenge a federal judge's ruling that blocks the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians in the US.

Temporary means temporary and the final word will not be from an activist judge legislating from the bench.”

Donald Trump has continued to sow doubt in the election system. While appearing on former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino's podcast on Monday, the president called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting,” in at least “15 places”, although he did not clarify which ones.

“The Republicans should say, ‘we want to take over',” Trump said in the interview.

The constitution confers authority over elections to states, and Trump didn't elaborate on what legal mechanism he thinks nationalizing elections would be possible.

In the interview, Trump repeated baseless claims that undocumented immigrants being “brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally”.

Georgia's Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi this morning, inquiring into the presence of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, at the scene last week of an FBI seizure of Fulton County election records from 2020.

The letter from Senator Raphael Warnock and representatives Lucy McBath and Nikema Williams asks “whether the Trump administration is investigating a legitimate foreign intelligence nexus, which would legally require immediate Congressional briefing.” The group requested a briefing from the Department of Justice “concerning this activity and its related investigation by February 13, 2026.”

Williams serves on the House oversight and investigations subcommittee. McBath is the ranking Democratic member on the House subcommittee on crime and federal government surveillance. Both represent part of Fulton County.

The letter comes after the FBI executed a criminal search warrant at the county's election offices on 28 January to seize almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documentation.

The president has yet to respond to a federal judge's ruling on Monday to block the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for more than 300,000 Haitians in the US, that was set to expire today. However, one of his top advisers, Stephen Miller, has weighed in. “An unelected judge has just ruled that elections, laws and borders don't exist,” he said of Ana Reyes, the DC federal judge who was appointed by Joe Biden.

A reminder, TPS is a type of status that allows nationals fleeing designated countries for various humanitarian reasons — such as war or natural disaster — to attain temporary authorization live and and work in the country without risk of deportation. In that period a TPS beneficiary is able to apply for a visa or permanent residency if eligible.

The Trump administration has long deemed these immigrants as “illegal”, but they are – by definition — living in the country legally and have documented proof with federal immigration services that they are present in the US.

As we noted, Donald Trump is in Washington today, per his official schedule. He'll meet with Gustav Petro at 11am ET, but as of now this isn't open to the press.

We'll make sure to bring you the latest lines if that does open up. The president will also have time to executive orders and legislation this afternoon, so we'll check back to see if he invites reporters for the Oval Office for that too.

President Donald Trump said yesterday that his administration would seek $1 billion in damages from Harvard University after a New York Times report said the college had won some concessions in ongoing settlement negotiations with the government.

Trump administration officials have accused Harvard and other colleges of promoting so-called “woke” ideology while failing to sufficiently protect Jewish students during pro-Palestinian protests, filing legal complaints and demanding exorbitant payouts.

Critics have called it a pressure campaign by the administration on liberal universities.

“We are now seeking One Billion Dollars in damages, and want nothing further to do, into the future, with Harvard University,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from stripping temporary protected status from up to 350,000 Haitians, a status that allows them to legally live and work in the United States amid the turmoil in their homeland.

Judge Ana Reyes issued a temporary stay that prevents Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, from implementing her decision to remove the status known as TPS, which was scheduled to expire on Tuesday.

Reyes notes that Noem, in announcing her decision to revoke TPS for Haitians, referred to those seeking refuge in the US as “killers, leeches, or entitlement junkies”.

She then notes that the plaintiffs who asked her to block the order, five Haitian TPS holders, “are not, it emerges, ‘killers, leeches, or entitlement junkies'”.

“They are instead: Fritz Emmanuel Lesly Miot, a neuroscientist researching Alzheimer's disease; Rudolph Civil, a software engineer at a national bank; Marlene Gail Noble, a laboratory assistant in a toxicology department; Marica Merline Laguerre, a college economics major; and Vilbrun Dorsainvil, a full-time registered nurse”, the judge added.

The release of about 3m Jeffrey Epstein investigative files has failed to quell outrage over justice department officials' handling of these disclosures, with advocates claiming potentially millions of documents are still being withheld.

Donald Trump's Department of Justice was required to disclose all investigative files by 19 December under The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA). While the justice department did release some documents on that date, last week's disclosure came nearly six weeks after this deadline.

Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, who served as Trump's criminal defense lawyer, told reporters last week that this disclosure marked “the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people and compliance with the act”.

“After submitting the final report to Congress as required under the act and publishing the written justifications for redactions in the Federal Register, the department's obligations under the act will be completed,” Blanche said.

He also said that while the justice department had found “more than 6m pages being identified as potentially responsive” that was because “we erred on the side of over-collection of materials from various sources to best ensure maximum transparency”.

“The number of responsive pages is significantly smaller than the total number of pages initially collected,” Blanche added. “That's why I mentioned a moment ago we're releasing more than 3m pages today and not the 6m pages that we collected.”

The missed deadline and up to 3m files that remain unreleased have prompted criticism and calls for further disclosure to answer how Epstein sexually abused girls with impunity for decades and landed a sweetheart plea deal about 20 years ago that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution.

“The government continues to avoid accountability and has argued that they are not responsible for Epstein's abuse of hundreds of victims,” said Jennifer Plotkin of Merson Law, which represents more than 30 victims, said. “The release of the files proves the government failed the victims over and over again.”

A federal judge said he would hear a request to block access to investigative files linked to Epstein on Wednesday, after lawyers flagged unredacted names of victims.

The Justice Department released more than three million files last week related to the investigation into the disgraced financier, including his links to high-profile figures.

The department was left scrambling after names of alleged victims, who were supposed to be anonymized, were left unredacted, AFP reported.

In a letter to judges overseeing the case, lawyers representing the victims listed documents in the latest cache they said revealed victims' names and some personal details.

Bill and Hillary Clinton agreed on Monday to testify in a House investigation into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, days before the chamber was expected to vote to hold them in contempt of Congress.

The concession follows a tense back-and-forth between the Clintons and the Republican James Comer, chair of the House oversight committee, who on Monday said that he would insist both Clintons sit for a sworn deposition before the committee in order to fulfill the panel's subpoenas.

“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” Angel Ureña, a spokesman for the Clintons, replied to Comer, in a post on social media. “They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care. But the former president and former secretary of state will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”

The House was headed towards potential votes this week on criminal contempt of Congress charges against the Clintons. If passed, the charges threatened the Clintons with substantial fines and even incarceration if they were convicted.

“The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” Comer said.

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I'm Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.

President Donald Trump is set to welcome Colombian president Gustavo Petro to the White House on Tuesday for talks just weeks after threatening military action against the South American country and accusing the leader of pumping cocaine into the United States.

US administration officials say the meeting will focus on regional security cooperation and counternarcotics efforts, AP reported.

And Trump on Monday suggested that Petro - who has continued to criticize Trump and the US operation to capture Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro - is more willing to work with his administration to stem the flow of illegal drugs from Colombia.

“Somehow after the Venezuelan raid, he became very nice,” Trump told reporters. “He changed his attitude very much.”

However, in recent days, Petro has continued to criticize the US president, calling Trump an “accomplice to genocide” in the Gaza Strip, while asserting that the capture of Maduro was a kidnapping.

And ahead of his departure for Washington, Petro called on Colombians to take to the streets of Bogotá during the White House meeting.

In other developments:

Grammys host Trevor Noah has been threatened with legal action by Donald Trump for a joke during Sunday's awards ceremony about the president's connection to the disgraced late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

A US disaster response firm submitted a plan to White House officials that would guarantee 300% profits and a seven-year monopoly over a new trucking and logistics plan for Donald Trump's board of peace in Gaza, according to a November proposal obtained by the Guardian.

The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said that all federal agents in Minneapolis will immediately begin wearing body cameras and that the program will be expanded nationwide “as funding is available”.

Iran's top diplomat has said the government is ready for negotiations with the US as the two countries reportedly prepared to send top envoys to Istanbul for high-stakes talks on the Iranian nuclear programme later this week.

Donald Trump has been accused of “corruption, plain and simple” after it was revealed that a member of the Emirati royal family was behind a $500m investment into the Trump family's cryptocurrency company.

Immediately after a US border patrol agent shot two people in Oregon last month, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the targets were “vicious” gang members connected to a prior shooting and alleged they had “attempted to run over” officers with their vehicle.

A selloff in European and North American software, data analytics and advertising stocks deepened on Tuesday after new artificial intelligence models raised concerns over the ‍potential ​impact on sectors once seen as AI beneficiaries.

One catalyst was the launch of Anthropic's legal plug-in for its Claude generative AI chatbot, according to traders and analysts.

The move sent Britain's RELX and the Netherlands' Wolters Kluwer, both providers of legal analytics services, down as much as 17 per cent and 13 per cent respectively. Toronto-based Thomson Reuters (TRI-T, TRI-Q), which owns the Westlaw legal database, ⁠fell over 14 per cent.

“The software companies were assumed to be winners from AI,” said Lars Skovgaard, senior investment strategist at Danske Bank. “But all of a sudden, you start to worry about whether you can earn the money back (from your AI investments), and/or will you be outsmarted by updates coming in.”

RELX shares have now almost halved from their ‌peak last February and on Tuesday ‍were set for their biggest drop since 1988. Its dramatic reversal highlights the pressure AI ‍is exerting on Europe's software sector.

Germany's SAP, which less than ‌a year ago was Europe's most valuable company, slumped over 16 per cent last week after its ⁠cloud revenue forecast missed expectations, wiping about US$40-billion off its market value in one day. Its shares were down 4.9 per cent ​on Tuesday and more than 41 per cent below 2025's high.

“Artificial intelligence is increasingly able to perform exactly the sort of programming and knowledge-based services that underpin these business models, so parts of the sector have been under pressure for some time,” said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia.

U.S. software and cloud computing stocks also fell. Microsoft (MSFT-Q) and ​Oracle (ORCL-N) were down 2 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. Salesforce (CRM-N), ServiceNow (NOW-N) and Photoshop maker Adobe (ADBE-Q) all fell over 5 per cent in early trading.

Other professional services firms were also sharply lower. In London, Experian, Sage Group, London Stock Exchange Group and Pearson fell between 4 per cent and 10 per cent. Traders and analysts said fear often outweighed company fundamentals.

Advertising companies were also under pressure. France's Publicis shares dived over 9 per cent after the company's results, while U.S.-based Omnicom slumped nearly 6 per cent.

Publicis, the ⁠world's largest advertising group by market capitalization, said it had earmarked approximately 900 million euros (US$1.06-billion) for acquisitions ⁠in 2026, focusing on AI-powered technologies and data assets.

According to a Barclays survey of buy-side investors published on Monday, advertising agencies are ‌seen as the most exposed part of European media to artificial intelligence, with WPP, Omnicom and Publicis ranked the top “AI losers”.

Analysts at the bank said companies could most effectively shake off an “AI loser” label by launching and clearly promoting revenue-generating AI products.

Other firms that rely heavily on advertising were also hammered, with Pinterest slipping 4 per cent and Snap falling more than 5 per cent. Ad-dependent Big Tech ‌companies Meta and Alphabet's Google, however, were down only marginally.

Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov has condemned France, saying it is “not a free country” after a raid on Elon Musk's X offices in Paris.

The search was part of a probe into the social media platform's Grok AI and its alleged generation of sexualized deepfake images of women and children, and comes amid a broader crackdown on X across the EU.

“French police is currently raiding X's office in Paris. France is the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom (Telegram, X, TikTok…),” Durov wrote on X on Tuesday.

Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country.

According to the Paris prosecutor's office, the raid on the X offices was carried out in cooperation with French cybercrime authorities and Europol, as part of an investigation launched last month.

The authorities are investigating a long list of alleged offenses, including the possession and organized distribution of child pornography, the creation of sexualized deepfakes, the spread of Holocaust denial content, and fraudulent data gathering, the prosecutor's office said in a press release on Tuesday.

Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino have been summoned to Paris for “voluntary interviews” in April, the press release said.

X has also faced scrutiny in the broader EU and in the UK.

Last month, the European Commission and British telecommunications watchdog Ofcom announced they were investigating the platform after a recent integration of its chatbot Grok allowed users to generate sexualized deepfake images, including of minors.

The probes followed a €150 million ($177 million) fine the commission issued X in December for breaching transparency obligations under digital regulations.

According to Durov, the probes are part of a broader push by the EU to beat into line those social media platforms “that refuse to silently censor free speech.”

The Russian-born tech mogul was arrested in Paris in 2024 over allegations that Telegram had failed to deter criminal activity on the platform. Durov has maintained that his detention was politically motivated, and accused French authorities of attempting to force him to use his platform to curb “conservative voices” ahead of the election in Romania.

Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) yesterday called for an “equal and orderly multipolar world” in the face of “unilateral bullying,” in an apparent jab at the US.

Xi was speaking during talks in Beijing with Uruguayan President Yamandu Orsi, the first South American leader to visit China since US special forces captured then-Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro last month — an operation that Beijing condemned as a violation of sovereignty.

Orsi follows a slew of leaders to have visited China seeking to boost ties with the world's second-largest economy to hedge against US President Donald Trump's increasingly unpredictable administration.

“The international situation is fraught with intertwined turmoil, and unilateral bullying is intensifying,” Xi told Orsi, China Central Television reported.

China “is willing to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with Uruguay in the global south, jointly promote an equal and orderly multipolar world, and inclusive economic globalization,” he said.

Beijing “supports Latin American and Caribbean countries in safeguarding their sovereignty, security and development interests,” he added.

During the meeting, Orsi warned of risks from the “challenging international and regional scenario.”

China is Uruguay's top trading partner, largest export destination and a key buyer of agricultural products such as soybeans and beef.

Chinese electric vehicle brands have also grown their market share in Uruguay, accounting for almost one-third of sales last year.

Beijing has invested billions of dollars in Latin America as part of its quest for natural resources and through its Belt and Road Initiative.

China and Uruguay would “seek to increase and diversify our bilateral trade,” Orsi said at the meeting, adding that they both supported a “standard-based international trade system.”

The two leaders signed agreements on science, technology, environmental cooperation and other areas.

Xi said the two sides would explore cooperation in emerging fields such as green technology, the digital economy and artificial intelligence.

Uruguay is part of South America's Mercosur trade bloc, along with Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, which limits its ability to strike unilateral trade deals with Beijing.

Montevideo has previously expressed interest in an independent commercial deal with China, which sparked opposition from fellow members.

Mercosur signed a trade deal — two decades in the making — with the EU last month, eliminating tariffs on more than 90 percent of bilateral trade.

Orsi was also due to hold talks with Chinese Premier Li Qiang (李強) and Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee Chairman Zhao Leji (趙樂際) yesterday before traveling to Shanghai.


MAKING WAVES: 
                                        China's maritime militia could become a nontraditional threat in war, clogging up shipping lanes to prevent US or Japanese intervention, a report said                                        About 1,900 Chinese ships flying flags of convenience and fishing vessels that participated in China's military exercises around Taiwan last month and in January have been listed for monitoring, Coast Guard Administration (CGA) Deputy Director-General Hsieh Ching-chin (謝慶欽) said yesterday.
Following amendments to the Commercial Port Act (商港法) and the Law of Ships (船舶法) last month, the CGA can designate possible berthing areas or deny ports of call for vessels suspected of loitering around areas where undersea cables can be accessed, Oceans Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling (管碧玲) said.
The list of suspected ships, originally 300, had risen to about 1,900 as                                    



                                                                                Right-wing political scientist Laura Fernandez on Sunday won Costa Rica's presidential election by a landslide, after promising to crack down on rising violence linked to the cocaine trade.
Fernandez's nearest rival,  economist Alvaro Ramos, conceded defeat as results showed the ruling party far exceeding the threshold of 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff.
With 94 percent of polling stations counted, the political heir of outgoing Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves had captured 48.3 percent of the vote compared with Ramos' 33.4 percent, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal said.
As soon as the first results were announced, members of Fernandez's Sovereign People's Party                                    


MORE RESPONSIBILITY: 
                                        Draftees would be expected to fight alongside professional soldiers, likely requiring the transformation of some training brigades into combat units                                        The armed forces are to start incorporating new conscripts into combined arms brigades this year to enhance combat readiness, the Executive Yuan's latest policy report said.
The new policy would affect Taiwanese men entering the military for their compulsory service, which was extended to one year under reforms by then-president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) in 2022.
The conscripts would be trained to operate machine guns, uncrewed aerial vehicles, anti-tank guided missile launchers and Stinger air defense systems, the report said, adding that the basic training would be lengthened to eight weeks.
After basic training, conscripts would be sorted into infantry battalions that would take                                    


GROWING AMBITIONS: 
                                        The scale and tempo of the operations show that the Strait has become the core theater for China to expand its security interests,  the report said                                        Chinese military aircraft incursions around Taiwan have surged nearly 15-fold over the past five years, according to a report released yesterday by the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) Department of China Affairs.
Sorties in the Taiwan Strait were previously irregular, totaling 380 in 2020, but have since evolved into routine operations, the report showed.
“This demonstrates that the Taiwan Strait has become both the starting point and testing ground for Beijing's expansionist ambitions,” it said.
Driven by military expansionism, China is systematically pursuing actions aimed at altering the regional “status quo,” the department said, adding that Taiwan represents the most critical link in China's

Letter comes after FBI executed criminal search warrant to seize almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documentation

Georgia's Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, this morning, inquiring into the presence of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, at the scene last week of an FBI seizure of Fulton county election records from 2020.

The letter from Senator Raphael Warnock and representatives Lucy McBath and Nikema Williams asks “whether the Trump administration is investigating a legitimate foreign intelligence nexus, which would legally require immediate congressional briefing”. The group requested a briefing from the Department of Justice “concerning this activity and its related investigation by February 13, 2026”.

Williams serves on the House oversight and investigations subcommittee. McBath is the ranking Democratic member on the House subcommittee on crime and federal government surveillance. Both represent part of Fulton county.

The letter comes after the FBI executed a criminal search warrant at the county's election offices on 28 January to seize almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documentation. The lawmakers note that “unusually, the warrant was filed by the US attorney for the eastern district of Missouri and follows the reported firing of the Atlanta FBI special agent in charge Paul Brown after expressing concern about this search”.

The lawmakers also expressed concern about Donald Trump's repeated – and repeatedly refuted – claims that the 2020 election in Georgia was “rigged”, as he again said in Davos at the World Economic Forum last month. “People will soon be prosecuted,” Trump said last month, referring to the 2020 election.

“We are deeply concerned that President Trump's consistent spreading of misinformation and dangerous conspiracy theories about the 2020 election fundamentally undermines the electoral process, endangers election workers, and erodes public trust in our democracy,” the lawmakers wrote. “This unprecedented seizure only heightens those concerns.”

            On Thursday evenings, Tehran's largest cemetery comes to life as people flock to pay their respects to lost loved ones.
    


            Weeks after thousands were killed in a bloody crackdown on protests against the government, the ritual has taken on new significance as families of the dead grieve.
    


            “I've never seen the cemetery so busy in my life,” one woman tells CNN.
    


            Alongside the bodies of martyrs from Iran's past wars, the dusty earth of Behesht-e Zahra cemetery now cradles the remains of protesters killed in January's protests, the latest conflict to rake Iran's streets.
    


            In one small patch, nestled among the graves of Iranian soldiers killed by Israeli bombs last year, a handful of new graves marks security officers killed during the demonstrations.
    


            Relatives hum around the graves, many of them women clad in the black ankle-length chadors favored by Iranian conservatives.
    


            A few minutes' drive away, at the far edge of the cemetery, small crowds stand gathered across the wide plain of headstones. Rectangular graves lie covered with flowers and petals, awaiting their monotone stone slabs. On some, a photo of a young man or smiling young woman looks out at the nearby carpet of gravestones.
    


            More cars roll past, disgorging mourners.
    


            As we walk among them, families offer trays of sweets and tea.
    


            Around the grave of one young man, his mother and grandmother quietly sob, his friends crouched down by the small mat of flower stems. One relative, her eyes wet with tears, says they searched for four hours for his body in Kahrizak morgue, where the remains of many protesters were taken.
    


            Fearful the violence of the state would pursue his family even in death, she asked us not to film the gathering.
    


            Meters away, around another young man's final resting place, we observe a similar huddle.
    


            “We have so many words to say,” his friend blurts out to us, quickly silenced by the anxious whispers of his father, stepping between us.
    


            CNN was allowed into the country with the government's permission to get a limited view of what's happening on the ground.
    


            Outside Tehran's Grand Bazaar, locals are more ready to talk.
    


            Iranians have two choices, one young woman who gives her name only as Sagher, tells CNN: “They either go on the street and get killed by weapons or stay at home and die of hunger.”
    


            “Trump made some promises to us,” she said of the US president's early-January posts promising backing for protesters against Iran's government. “All the young people came to the streets relying on his words,” she added.
    


            Hadis, a shopkeeper visiting the bazaar to buy supplies, says nothing the government does now can restore trust following January's violent crackdown. CNN is only using her first name for safety reasons.
    


            “There is a sense of despair among people,” she says. “We have taken this course several times. I believe this will be the end of everything.”
    


            The bazaar was ground zero for the protests, which were sparked by the country's dire economic situation and hyper-inflation.
    


            Hadis says vendors have recently stopped accepting business cheques and that growing geopolitical tensions are causing sudden shifts in the price of Iran's currency against the dollar.
    


            With prices that day﻿ up 20-30% on the day before, she said she wasn't able to purchase anything for her shop selling accessories.
    


            “Dollar and gold prices are increasing every day and the inflation is crazy high,” Tehran resident Sagher said. “The price of a single item may be 100,000 tomans ($0.77) today and it may increase to 200,000 tomorrow.”

            A 13-year-old boy who was swept out to sea with his mother and two siblings saved his family by swimming four kilometers (2.5 miles) to shore for help “in rough conditions,” police in Australia said.
    


            The group were kayaking and paddleboarding off the coast of Quindalup, Western Australia, on Friday afternoon when they were carried out to sea, said the WA Police Force in a statement published on Facebook on Monday.
    


            The boy “decided to return to shore in fading light,” and paddled a short distance in his kayak before it took on water, leaving him to swim back and alert authorities at around 6 p.m. local time (5 a.m. ET), said police.
    


            A search and rescue operation was then launched, and a 47-year-old woman, a 12-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl were “located by the rescue helicopter clinging to a paddleboard,” according to the statement.
    


            “A volunteer marine rescue vessel was directed to their location and all three were successfully rescued and returned to shore,” said police.
    


            The boy, Austin Appelbee, told CNN affiliate 9News that thinking of his family drove him on.
    


            “I just said ‘alright. Not today, not today, not today,'” he said. “I had to keep on going.”
    


            “The waves were massive. I did breaststroke, I did freestyle, I did survival backstroke,” Austin told the outlet.
    


            “I hit the bottom of the beach and I just collapsed and then after that I had to sprint two kilometers to go get to the phone,” he added.
    


            The boy's feat was a “superhuman effort,” Marine Rescue commander Paul Bresland told 9News.
    


            “Two hours without a life jacket on and yeah, he made it,” said Bresland.
    


            Austin's mother Joanne Appelbee said that all of her children had been swimming since they were young.
    


            “I'm speechless at his efforts, but at the same time, I knew he could do it,” she told 9News.
    


            Marine Rescue Busselton said that it was “a great outcome” in a separate statement published on Facebook on Saturday.
    


            “Fantastic effort from all involved in trying conditions,” read the statement.
    


            “Please be mindful of the strong offshore winds that can occur this time of year,” it added.

            Josh D'Amaro, who chairs Disney's hugely successful parks division, will succeed Bob Iger as The Walt Disney Company's next chief executive next month.
    


            Disney TV and streaming boss Dana Walden, who was thought to be the other leading contender for the CEO role, will become the company's president and chief creative officer.
    


            Disney announced the succession plan Tuesday morning, ending years of speculation about who would take the place of Iger, 74, atop one of the world's biggest entertainment companies.
    


            D'Amaro, 54, is the second parks chief to ascend to the top job after Bob Chapek, whose brief tenure as CEO interrupted Iger's two stretches at the helm.
    


            Iger handed off to Chapek in 2020 but soon soured on his successor, causing a behind-the-scenes power struggle that ended with Iger's return as CEO in 2022.



            That ugly chapter for the usually squeaky-clean Disney put added pressure on this succession process.
    


            “Josh D'Amaro is an exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO,” Iger said in a statement. “He has an instinctive appreciation of the Disney brand, and a deep understanding of what resonates with our audiences, paired with the rigor and attention to detail required to deliver some of our most ambitious projects.”
    


            “His ability to combine creativity with operational excellence is exemplary and I am thrilled for Josh and the company,” Iger added.
    


            D'Amaro, who has overseen Disney Experiences since 2020, is already well known to Disney super-fans. He frequently tours the parks and highlights cast members (Disney's moniker for employees) on social media.
    


            His promotion to CEO emphasizes just how important theme parks and cruises have become to Disney.
    


            The company is spending tens of billions of dollars to expand its parks and build more ships, recognizing growing demand for in-person experiences and believing that the attractions deepen customers' affection for the Disney brand as a whole.
    


            D'Amaro was with Iger last month on a tour of Disney's planned resort destination in Abu Dhabi, its first new theme park in 15 years, a person familiar with both men told CNN.
    


            Iger boasted about Disney's parks business on the company's quarterly earnings call on Monday.
    


            “When you look at the footprint of the business today, it's never been more broad or more diverse, and the projects that we have underway are going to make it even more so,” Iger said. “As I look ahead, I actually am very, very bullish on that business and its ability to grow.”
    


            On Tuesday morning, the Disney board said that D'Amaro will take the reins on March 18, following the company's annual meeting.
    


            Iger, meanwhile, will stay on as a senior adviser and board member until his retirement at the end of his contract, on December 31.
    


            Disney chairman James Gorman said Tuesday morning on CNBC that while Iger felt he could remain CEO through the end of the year, “he had developed the talent” to replace himself and felt that retiring “sooner was better.”
    


            Disney said Walden's new role, reporting to D'Amaro, is a “historic first.”
    


            She will “ensure that storytelling and creative expression across every audience touchpoint consistently reflect the brand, engage audiences at scale, and advance core business objectives, while driving enterprise-wide initiatives and translating vision into action,” the company said.

Winnipeg's incoming Water Tower District, named after a 1936 water tower that will be located in the enclave's central retail area, will take over 165 acres of vacant industrial land.Shindico Realty/Supplied

Winnipeg's eastern St. Boniface neighbourhood is poised for a major transformation as a large-scale mixed-use development moves into its early construction phase, blending commercial, industrial, residential and parkland uses into one area.

The Water Tower District, a 165-acre stretch of former industrial land, aims to convert the long-vacant former Union Stockyards space, a large livestock-handling facility, into a flexible, centrally located district that easily connects to the city's core.

Led by Alberta-based Olexa Developments, the project is one of many examples of Canadian developers transforming former industrial sites into vibrant, thriving communities.

Similar conversions are underway nationwide, including Montreal's former Molson Brewery site, which is being redeveloped into a mixed-use district called Quartier Molson, and Toronto's former Downsview Airport, set to become YZD, a 370-acre site that will connect 66,000 residents across seven neighbourhoods.

Founded in 1818, St. Boniface is one of Winnipeg's oldest neighbourhoods, long defined by its strong francophone roots and sense of community. When the Union Stockyards closed in 1988, it left behind a vast brownfield site in a prime, centrally located part of the city that has sat empty until now.

“St. Boniface has evolved from legacy livestock and manufacturing uses into mixed employment and residential hubs that are anchored by health care, education and small-to-mid-scale industry,” says Hazel Borys, director of planning, property and development at the City of Winnipeg. “With existing services in place, growing multimodal access and a strong francophone cultural fabric, it's a good place to transform 165 acres into a complete community.“

The Water Tower District builds on the existing strengths of St. Boniface, she adds. Designated as a major redevelopment site under the city's development plan policies, it advances three goals from the city's Complete Communities Direction Strategy 2.0. These include developing communities guided by an inclusive planning process, strong multimodal links to downtown, parks and employment areas, and a balanced mix of employment, housing, retail and services.

The Water Tower District takes its name from a historic 1936 water tower, which will be a featured landmark in the neighbourhood's central retail area.

The Water Tower District plan allocates roughly 21 acres to commercial, retail and office uses, 25 acres to residential development, 70 acres to light industrial and 22 acres to parkland.

Shindico Realty is overseeing the district's marketing, sales and leasing. According to Robert Scaletta, the firm's senior vice-president of industrial, internal roadways are already in place and utility installations are underway.

With a growing and evolving population, Mr. Scaletta says a mixed-use approach is essential for St. Boniface - especially as housing demand continues to outpace supply. Driven largely by record immigration, Manitoba's population growth has surged in recent years, adding 34,946 residents in 2024, while new housing starts that year totalled just 7,191 units, according to the Fraser Institute, a Canadian think tank.

“There's not very much land in this community, and every apartment that's been built has leased up quickly with waiting lists,” Mr. Scaletta says. “That's why we're saying we need more housing here because the demand is there.”

The plan for Winnipeg's Water Tower District allocates roughly 21 acres to commercial, retail and office space, 25 acres to residential development, 70 acres to light industrial space and 22 acres to parkland.Shindico Realty/Supplied

The Water Tower District's development will roll out in phases, with construction on the first 500 residential units beginning this year. The project is currently approved for 2,000 units overall, and a rezoning application is currently being finalized to convert a portion of industrial land into multifamily housing, which would add 800 units.

Under an agreement with the city, 10 per cent of all residential units will be designated as affordable housing, Mr. Scaletta says.

Supporting that population growth will also require employment opportunities, as well as access to services, retail and shared community space - all of which are essential to fostering a sense of belonging in a deeply rooted neighbourhood.

“We're putting in three parks, two larger ones and a smaller acre lot, along with community gardens,” Mr. Scaletta says, adding that play areas will be accessible for families. There are also discussions around potential non-profit cultural centres, including spaces for seniors, youth groups and offices.

With proximity to St. Boniface Hospital, the University of Winnipeg and a major city highway, the neighbourhood offers close access to daily needs while remaining connected to the city's core.

Across Canada, similar infill redevelopments are underway, including The Quarters in Edmonton, reflecting how cities are rethinking under-used land.

“The…approach offers a replicable template for other legacy industrial conversions in Winnipeg and in other mid-sized Canadian cities,” Ms. Borys says of the Water Tower District.

She points to five transferable lessons emerging from the project: start with a strong network of stakeholders; retain central employment; phase development to manage risk; plan collaboratively; and monitor progress and adjust over time.

Ms. Borys says the district's scale and central location are among its key strengths, allowing it to accommodate new housing while retaining employment land alongside existing services and infrastructure.

“Winnipeg is moving toward corridor and node intensification, modernizing employment lands while adding missing middle and mid-rise housing,” Ms. Borys adds. “The Water Tower District is a district-scale expression of that shift.”

Elon Musk attends the Viva Technology conference in Paris, France. The tech leader is looking to unify his AI and space ambitions ahead of an anticipated SpaceX IPO.GONZALO FUENTES/Reuters

Elon Musk said on Monday that SpaceX has acquired his artificial-intelligence startup xAI in a record-setting deal that unifies Musk's AI and space ambitions by combining the rocket-and-satellite company with the maker of the Grok chatbot. 

The deal, first reported by Reuters last week, represents one of the most ambitious tie-ups in the technology sector yet, combining a space-and-defence contractor with a fast-growing AI developer whose costs are largely driven by chips, data centres and energy. It could also bolster SpaceX's data-centre ambitions as Musk competes with rivals like Alphabet's Google GOOGL-Q, Meta META-Q, Amazon-backed Anthropic and OpenAI in the AI sector.

The transaction values SpaceX at US$1-trillion and xAI at US$250-billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. Investors in xAI will receive 0.1433 shares of SpaceX for every share of xAI as part of the acquisition, this person said. Some xAI executives may also opt for cash instead of SpaceX stock at US$75.46 per share, the person said.

“This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!” Musk said.

The purchase of xAI sets a new record for the world's largest M&A deal, a distinction held for more than 25 years when Vodafone bought Germany's Mannesmann in a hostile takeover valued at US$203-billion in 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG. 

The combined company of SpaceX and xAI is expected to price shares at about US$527 each, another person familiar with the matter said. SpaceX was already the world's most valuable privately held company, last valued at US$800-billion in a recent insider share sale. XAI was last valued at US$230-billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal. The merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over US$1.5-trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.

SpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the “Muskonomy” – which already includes Tesla, brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.

“Starlink was already a cash flow engine and now it adds an AI revenue layer on top while also becoming a distribution surface for AI services and data,” said Ali Javaheri, PitchBook Senior Emerging Spaces Analyst.

“With policy changes that allow certain customer data to be used for model training and the prospect of orbital data centres, SpaceX is positioning itself as an integrated infrastructure platform that can serve commercial and government use cases, which is a much stronger narrative heading into a public offering.”

The world's richest man has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform's data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's TSLA-Q stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.

The agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.

SpaceX also holds billions of dollars in federal contracts with NASA, the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies, which all have some authority to review M&A transactions for national security and other risks.

This is Chris York reporting from Kyiv on day 1,441 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far:

Ukraine's Armed Forces have regained positions in the embattled city of Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState said on Feb. 3.

Russia has been trying  to push across the front by launching heavy offensive operations on multiple axes, including in the Kupiansk sector, to recapture the city it lost to a 2022 Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Russian troops had attempted to close in on Kupiansk from the north and east, aiming to solidify their presence on the western side of the Oskil River.

On Nov. 20, Russia's chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, said Russia had captured Kupiansk, a claim that Ukraine's Armed Forces refuted, which was followed by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 12 recording a video from the city.

DeepState also reported Russian forces have advanced near the settlements of Udachne, Hryshyne, and Pryvillia in Donetsk Oblast.

Last updated 4:34 p.m. Kyiv time.

Denmark and Sweden announced on Feb. 3 they will procure and supply Ukraine with additional air defense systems in the face of Russia's devastating winter bombing campaign.

Speaking jointly at a press conference, the countries' defense ministers said the military aid supplied will total $290 million and be spent on Tridon air defense systems developed by BAE Systems Bofors.

The Tridon is a self-propelled and remotely controlled 40 mm anti-aircraft artillery gun, which its manufacturer says can combat "drones and cruise missiles, to aircraft and armoured vehicles."

"This means that Ukraine can develop an air defense battalion if they so wish," Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said.

"The purchase doesn't just support Ukraine on the battlefield with more material, but also strengthens our production capacity in Sweden."

A shortage of air defense missiles has left some Ukrainian air defense systems empty at times amid the threat of further Russian attacks, Yurii Ihnat, head of the Air Force's communications department, said in an interview with RBC Ukraine published on Feb. 2.

With the onset of winter, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in an effort to plunge the country into a nationwide blackout. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air defense forces lack sufficient resources to intercept all Russian missiles and drones.

Ihnat said that Ukrainian authorities, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have repeatedly stressed the shortage of missiles for air defense systems, noting that some of them are depleted and not ready to repel Russian attacks.

"Indeed, before one such attack, we were provided with the necessary means a day in advance," Ihnat said. "Ukrainian forces repelled that massive strike quite successfully, thanks to missiles for F-16s, NASAMS, IRIS-T, and Patriot."

"There were moments when there was a serious shortage of these missiles. I won't reveal any secrets. For example, there is a NASAMS system, but instead of six missiles in the launcher, there are only two."

Last updated 2:20 p.m. Kyiv time.

A Russian first-person view (FPV) drone training center was among several targets hit by Ukrainian forces over the past day, the General Staff reported on Feb. 3.

"In the temporarily occupied territory of the Zaporizhia region, near the settlement of Komysh-Zorya, the enemy's pilot training and FPV drone production training center was hit" it said in a post on Telegram.

The General Staff also reported successful strikes on a TOS-1A Solntsepyok heavy flamethrower system, an electronic warfare station, and a "manpower concentration near the settlement of Terebreno, Belgorod region, Russia."

No further details were reported. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.

Last updated 1:07 p.m. Kyiv time.

Russian forces launched a mass ballistic missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight on Feb. 3, the largest this winter and involving the highest number of missiles launched in a single attack this season.

The strikes came amid a larger attack on Ukrainian cities, including those located hundreds of kilometers from the front line, with dozens of missiles and hundreds of drones reported over Ukraine's night sky.

Russia's latest assault signals the end of a brief energy ceasefire, under which Moscow had agreed to temporarily pause strikes on Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure. The resumed attacks on the capital come days after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 29 that he personally asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from attacking Kyiv.

The Kremlin previously said it would pause strikes on energy facilities, but only until Feb. 1.

Seven people have been injured after a Russian strike on a "dense residential development," Governor Oleh Syniehubov said.

Last updated 3:21 p.m. Kyiv time.

NATO Secretary Mark Rutte said on Feb. 3 that he is confident the allies would allocate $15 billion this year under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL).

"I'm absolutely confident that the money will be there," Rutte said during a press conference alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv when asked about the figure requested by Ukraine.

Kyiv was set to receive around $4-$5 billion by the end of 2025 under the initiative, which allows NATO members to buy air defenses, ammunition, and other hardware for Ukraine from the U.S.

"I know that more is urgently needed," Rutte said, urging allies to "dig in their stockpiles to offer whatever they can to meet Ukraine's needs, particularly air defense."

The NATO chief underscored that two-thirds of NATO allies are now participating in the initiative. He also called for fairer burden-sharing while underscoring contributions from the Nordic nations, the Baltic countries, the Netherlands, Canada, and Germany.

Last updated 12:05 p.m. Kyiv time.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte arrived in Kyiv on Feb. 3 as Russia launched a large-scale strike on Ukraine overnight.

The news comes as Ukraine and Russia prepare for another round of talks this week aimed at ending Russia's full-scale invasion. Representatives of Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia are set to meet in Abu Dhabi on Feb. 4-5.

Rutte and President Volodymyr Zelensky placed candles and paid tribute to fallen Ukrainian soldiers at a memorial on Maidan Nezalezhnosti, according to the President's Office.

Rutte also spoke at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament.

"Direct talks are now underway, and this is important progress," he said at the Rada. "But Russian attacks, like those last night, do not signal seriousness about peace."

Rutte also said that strong security guarantees must be provided to Ukraine as part of a peace deal.

At least four people have been killed and 32 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Feb. 3.

Russia launched 71 missiles and 450 drones, including nearly 300 Shahed-type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 38 missiles and 412 drones. At least 27 missiles and 31 drones made it through, striking 27 locations. The fall of debris was recorded at 17 locations, with information on other aerial targets still being clarified.

Russian forces struck thermal power plants operated by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, marking the ninth mass attack on its thermal facilities since October 2025. The attack caused significant damage to equipment, DTEK said.

Following the strikes, Kyiv introduced emergency power outages on the left bank of the Dnipro River in the city's eastern districts, according to the company.

Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal said Russia attacked eight regions overnight, launching drones and missiles at high-rise residential buildings as well as thermal power plants and combined heat and power facilities supplying Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Dnipro.

No casualties were reported in Odesa Oblast but Russian attacks left 50,000 residents without power, Governor Oleh Kiper reported.

At least five people were injured in the attack against Kyiv, the National Police said.

In Kharkiv Oblast, one person died and five others were injured, Governor Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram.

One person was killed and three others injured in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov said.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian strikes killed a 67-year-old man in the Synelnykove district and injured two others in the Nikopol district, Governor Oleksandr Hanzha said.

In Donetsk Oblast, one person was killed and another injured, local Governor Vadym Filaskin reported.

In Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported nine people were injured in Russian attacks.

In Sumy Oblast, four people were injured, Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported.

In Kyiv Oblast, three people suffered injuries due to the Feb. 3 mass strike on Ukraine, Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said.

Russia has lost around 1,242,290 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Feb. 3

The number includes 760 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,633 tanks, 23,985 armored fighting vehicles, 76,738 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,855 artillery systems, 1,633 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,292 air defense systems, 435 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 122,388 drones, 28 ships and boats, and two submarines.

Elon Musk has been summoned to a hearing about his social-media platform X on April 20.Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters

French police raided the offices of Elon Musk's social-media network X and prosecutors ordered the tech billionaire to face questions in April related to a widening investigation into the platform, the Paris prosecutor's office said on Tuesday.

The raid and the summoning of Musk – which could further increase tensions between Europe and the U.S. over big tech and free speech – are linked to a year-long investigation into suspected abuse of algorithms and fraudulent data extraction by X or its executives.

In a statement the Paris prosecutor's office said it was widening that investigation following complaints over the functioning of X's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok.

The probe will now also investigate alleged complicity in the “detention and diffusion” of images of a child‑pornographic nature and the violation of a person's image rights with sexually explicit deepfakes, among other potential crimes.

Musk and former CEO Linda Yaccarino were summoned to a hearing on April 20. Other X staff were also summoned as witnesses.

There was no immediate comment from X. In July, Musk denied the initial accusations and said French prosecutors were launching a “politically-motivated criminal investigation.”

“At this stage, the conduct of this investigation is part of a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French laws, insofar as it operates on national territory,” the prosecutor's office said.

Such summons are mandatory, though they are harder to enforce on people who do not live in France.

After such a hearing, authorities can decide to either shelve or continue the probe, and potentially put suspects in custody.

Ottawa not banning X despite sexual deepfake controversy, AI minister says

The Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit is conducting the investigation in France, together with the French police's own cybercrime unit and Europol. The unit previously arrested Telegram founder Pavel Durov in 2024 over charges including complicity in organized crime carried out on the messaging app, charges his lawyer has described as “absurd.”

The prosecutor's office said it launched the investigation after being contacted by a lawmaker alleging that biased algorithms in X were likely to have distorted the operation of an automated data processing system.

“Glad to see that my complaint from January 2025 is yielding results!” that lawmaker, Eric Bothorel, said on X. “In Europe, and particularly in France, the Rule of Law means that no one is above the law.”

The prosecutor's office also said it was leaving the X social media platform and would communicate on LinkedIn and Instagram from now on. LinkedIn belongs to Microsoft and Instagram to Meta.

MOSCOW, February 3. /TASS/. The United Nations proposes more flexible nuclear arms control, while the UAE seeks to assume civilian control of Gaza. Meanwhile, China's Xi Jinping looks to make the yuan a global reserve currency. These stories topped Tuesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

With just days remaining before the expiration of the New START Treaty, the world is on the brink of a nuclear vacuum, as the United Nations warned that the risk of using nukes has risen to a decades-high. It would be necessary to establish an arms control regime that would match the rapidly changing situation, the office of the UN Secretary-General told Izvestia. While there is no constructive dialogue on the issue between Moscow and Washington, the other members of the five largest nuclear powers, or the P5, are not in a hurry to join the negotiations. However, experts from Russia and NATO are discussing the future of strategic arms control, with a scenario of exchanging data amid looser quantitative restrictions.

"Washington does not consider the treaty useful to itself. And the track record of recent decades (the exit from the INF and other treaties) shows that the United States has effectively adjusted its approach to policy in this extremely sensitive sphere," Natalya Kharitonova, professor with the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration and senior researcher at the Russian State University for the Humanities, noted in an interview with Izvestia.

A situation may occur where negotiations on New START are no longer held and nuclear tests begin. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) made it clear to Izvestia that it cannot force the issue in any way.

The expert community argues that the current version of New START no longer reflects reality and that it would not be enough for just Russia and the US to adhere to the quantitative limits, and everybody in the P5 should be invited to join.

"I don't think the UN or any other international organization will be able to play a significant role in finding a solution here. The START treaty series has been the result of bilateral efforts by the two countries in the wake of a sensitive crisis when they stopped short of exchanging nuclear strikes (during the Caribbean Crisis). Therefore, this practice can only be continued through the efforts of Moscow and Washington. The countries that the United States or Russia would like to see as signatories are hesitant to participate," Kharitonova maintained.

The situation around New START has clearly reached an impasse, and a fundamentally new solution is needed. "A potential modification of the concept of limiting nuclear weapons, rather than an extension, should be discussed. And the concept is not clear, as everybody - the Americans, the Chinese, the French and the British - has its own approaches," diplomat Andrey Baklanov told Izvestia.

 

The United Arab Emirates is seeking to assume civilian control over the Gaza Strip. At the same time, the country is ready to allocate part of its funds for reconstruction of infrastructure destroyed in the war in the Palestinian enclave and attract additional investments in the future. Abu Dhabi is currently discussing the implementation of this plan with Israel, the Jewish state's Channel 12 reported, citing Israeli government officials. The UAE is planning to take control of the local markets and trade, the TV channel said.

The Emirati authorities have proposed assuming civilian control of the enclave, a source told Channel 12. The two sides are currently busy agreeing on an interstate agreement and have already exchanged draft documents. However, the final details of a potential deal will need to be approved by Israel.

A potential role for the UAE in Gaza administration would be the most acceptable option for Israel, as Abu Dhabi is one of the Jewish state's key partners in the Middle East, Lyudmila Samarskaya, a research fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' World Economy and International Relations Institute, told Vedomosti. Another thing is that such measures would make sense given the likelihood of long-term stability in the region, which has not been the case so far, the expert continued. "It would be no use making any financial or organizational investments in the enclave as long as Hamas maintains its military capabilities there. These are perhaps hypothetical scenarios of how the situation may develop," she contended.

Orientalists argue that there is currently intensifying competition between the leading Muslim states for a leading role in resolving the Palestinian issue.

 

Chinese leader Xi Jinping wrote in Qiushi Journal that the yuan will be given the status of a global reserve currency. According to him, the Chinese state would need a "powerful currency" for international trade and investment. By setting this goal, Xi challenged the hegemony of the US dollar, economists told Rossiyskaya Gazeta.

China would need a "powerful central bank" and competitive financial institutions capable of attracting foreign capital and influencing prices in global markets to achieve the goal, Xi added.

While assigning the status of a global reserve currency alone will not help the yuan substitute the USD, Washington may take changes in the global financial system hard, for the United States will have a weaker influence on global trade if there is a serious alternative to the dollar.

In practice, the yuan is already the world's second-largest currency for global trade after the dollar, but it has a limited share in foreign reserves. The main reason for this is because the yuan is not a freely convertible currency due to the specifics of national regulation in China.

Russia and China have almost 99% embraced settlements in the yuan and the ruble in bilateral trade already, and the Chinese currency has a large share in Russia's foreign reserves. However, the dollar looks more preferable to many other countries that do not maintain such a close trade relationship with China.

Xi's statement came as the United States released a new report on foreign exchange policy in which the Americans again called on China to strengthen "its substantially undervalued exchange rate," economist Yegor Susin told the newspaper. A weak yuan exchange rate gives China an advantage in global trade, which irritates the United States.

While China has already laid the necessary groundwork for the yuan to become a global reserve currency by making its economy one of the world's largest, this will not be enough, Pavel Seleznyov, head of the Department of International Economic Relations at the Financial University under the Russian Government, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta. "For a legal tender to become a reserve currency, the issuing country must not only be an active participant in international trade but also play a powerful role in the investment and FX markets. Currently, almost all pricing globally is underpinned by the dollar, and this gives the United States a key advantage. This could change, for example, at BRICS or the SCO, which seek to have an alternative to the dollar as a strategic counterbalance to US influence," Seleznyov explained.

 

The European Union is weighing a ban on a number of platinum group metal and copper imports from Russia as part of a new sanctions package, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing sources. According to the agency, the measure may affect platinum, iridium, and rhodium, among other metals. The EU may impose a 20th sanctions package on Russia later this month. The European Commission declined to comment on this to Bloomberg.

Restrictions, if any, will mostly affect Nornickel, Bloomberg warned. In 2024, Russia's top miner had an 11% share of the global platinum market, and a 2% share of the global copper market, as it accounted for 40% of global palladium supplies and 11% of nickel exports. Nornickel refused to comment. A source familiar with the situation told Kommersant that it is too early to jump to conclusions yet, as everything will depend on the final wording.

Akhmed Aliyev, a senior analyst at T-Investments, argued that Nornickel might have expected such an outcome and been prepared for potential restrictions. "While it could be affected in the short term, sales in the longer term are unlikely to come under pressure, for global demand for such metals has been sustainable enough, and the company is certain to find consumers in other countries," he said.

Vasily Danilov, an analyst at Veles Capital, said, referring to data from Eurostat, that Russian iridium imports to the EU ended back in December 2022, and that Russia has not sold platinum and rhodium to the bloc since December 2023. Meanwhile, Russian copper supplies in 2025 will hardly exceed 30,000 metric tons, or around 3% of the volume produced in Russia. At the same time, Nornickel does not account for the whole of it, Danilov added, as he surmised that the company may have successfully diverted its exports to other markets.

 

European countries have increased purchases of Russian gas. In January, Russia supplied a record 2.1 billion to 2.3 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe. In addition, gas volumes pumped through the Balkan Stream have reached a maximum: the average daily volume through this pipeline reached 56 million cubic meters in January, exceeding the design capacity by almost a quarter. Among the reasons for this are a frosty winter, gas extraction from underground storage facilities, and a decrease in LNG imports from the United States, where cold weather has also set in. Despite the fact that fuel prices in Europe have so far decreased from $500 to $418 per 1,000 cubic meters, experts believe that the cost of Russian natural gas will increase in the second quarter of 2026.

Last month, Russia sold a record 1.5 million to 1.7 million metric tons of LNG to Europe, which is equivalent to roughly 2.1 billion to 2.3 billion cubic meters, Valery Andrianov, Associate Professor at the Financial University, told Izvestia. "As a result, the share of Russian LNG in the overall EU imports reached about 19%, European media acknowledged, as local traders bought up ‘the whole of Yamal LNG' in January. Our country will not be able to help Europe in any other way, for there are currently no other opportunities for supplies to the Old World (after Nord Streams were sabotaged, and Kiev blocked gas transit through Ukraine)," he said.

In the second quarter, Russian gas prices may rise amid the impact of exchange indicators on the final figures, which are calculated based on formulas included in contracts, Alexander Frolov, deputy director general of the National Energy Institute, told Izvestia.

According to Tamara Safonova, CEO of NAANS-Media, an independent think tank that specializes in the oil and gas sphere, the European Commission's ambitions to reduce its reliance on Russian energy have damaged energy security systems built over decades. This has propped up gas prices, hurting the European economy, she added. Rising gas prices on European exchanges will have a positive impact on the revenues of Russian gas giants, which continue to supply LNG and pipeline gas to Europe, she argued.

Editor's note: this story is being updated. 

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte arrived in Kyiv on Feb. 3 as Russia launched a large-scale strike on Ukraine overnight. 

The news comes as Ukraine and Russia prepare for another round of talks this week aimed at ending Russia's full-scale invasion. Representatives of Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia are set to meet in Abu Dhabi on Feb. 4-5. 

Rutte and President Volodymyr Zelensky placed candles and paid tribute to fallen Ukrainian soldiers at a memorial on Maidan Nezalezhnosti, according to the President's Office. 

Rutte also spoke at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament.

"Direct talks are now underway, and this is important progress," he said at the Rada. "But Russian attacks, like those last night, do not signal seriousness about peace." 

Rutte also said that strong security guarantees must be provided to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. 

"You need to know that this peace will be lasting not because papers have been signed but because there is hard power to back it up," he added. 

Some European allies have announced that they will deploy troops to Ukraine after a deal is reached, and the U.S. is expected to provide a backstop, Rutte said. These will include "troops on the ground, jets in the air, and ships on the Black Sea," he added. 

Rutte also called for increasing military aid to Ukraine. 

"I know that more is urgently needed," he said. "And we're working to ensure that more comes quickly through PURL (Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List) and through every means possible. I urge allies to dig in their stockpiles to offer whatever they can to meet Ukraine's needs, particularly air defense."

Rutte said on Jan. 21 that Ukraine, not Greenland, should be the main priority for NATO. U.S. President Donald Trump has pressed Danish and Greenlandic authorities to sell the strategically important island to the U.S., not ruling out the use of military force and threatening tariffs on eight European countries opposing the move.

Previously Rutte visited Kyiv in August 2025.

He moved to Ukraine in 2014 due to the crackdown on independent media in Russia and covered war, corruption, reforms and law enforcement for the Kyiv Post.

Pavel K., a 50-year old resident of the town of Hrubieszów, had been charged with espionage.









Russian forces launched a mass ballistic missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Feb. 3, striking multiple residential buildings across the city and injuring at least three people, officials said.



Rutte spoke at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament.

"I'm absolutely confident that the money will be there," Rutte said during a press conference alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv when asked about the figure requested by Ukraine.

The U.S. believes launching three projects under a joint U.S.-Ukrainian investment fund created under the so-called minerals deal last year is achievable, but ambitious, a senior U.S. official told reporters on Feb. 2.



A more extensive Russian attack would trigger a coordinated Western-led military response backed by U.S. forces, initiated 72 hours after the initial breach, the Financial Times reported.

"Six-hundred seventy-nine Ukrainian girls and boys will never be able to play football — Russia killed them," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said after FIFA President Gianni Infantino backed lifting the ban on Russian athletes.  

"Ukraine has not forgotten any of the thousands of Shaheds that attack our cities and villages, our people," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 2.

MOSCOW, February 3. /TASS/. The published US case files on US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who is accused of child molestation, reveal that Vladimir Zelensky is involved in trafficking women and children, according to documents reviewed by TASS.

Zelensky is mentioned in one of the published emails, which dates back to 2024. The identities of both the author and the recipient are concealed. The letter claims that Zelensky is involved in trafficking women and children from Ukraine and suggests that he may have been associated with modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel. The latter was charged in France in 2020 with raping minors and committed suicide in his cell before the court's decision.

"Zelensky, in light of the trafficking that is occurring in Ukraine, set up by Jean-Luc Brunel, I want all your assets investigated at JP Morgan!" the author of the letter wrote. Elsewhere, he or she wondered whether Zelensky intended to stop the trafficking of women and children and asked why the Ukrainian media is silent on this issue.

Zelensky is mentioned in Epstein's files for other reasons as well. In one of them, Epstein himself and Miroslav Lajcak, who was then Slovakia's foreign minister and OSCE chairman, discuss the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election on a messaging app, two days after Zelensky's victory. Epstein noted that the situation looked like a good opportunity to intervene. His interlocutor expressed doubts about Zelensky's ability to lead Ukraine.

On a separate note, Epstein pointed out that "Ukraine upheaval should provide many opportunities, many."

Zelensky is mentioned at least several dozen times in the documents, which contain different spellings of his name due to transcription errors. Many of the references are excerpts from news articles that Epstein shared with people on his contact list. A number of documents are currently unavailable.

European-led forces supported by the U.S. would be deployed in Ukraine in case of repeated ceasefire violations by Russia, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Feb. 3, citing undisclosed sources.

Between December and January, Ukrainian, European, and U.S. officials discussed a "multi-tiered" response plan to be put in place in the event of a potential ceasefire with Moscow, according to the FT.

Based on the proposal, any Russian breach of the truce would first trigger a diplomatic warning and an appropriate response by the Ukrainian military within the first 24 hours.

Continued violations would lead to the deployment of forces from the U.K.- and French-led Coalition of the Willing.

A more extensive Russian attack would trigger a coordinated Western-led military response backed by the U.S. military, initiated 72 hours after the initial breach.

The news comes shortly before another round of trilateral peace talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. in Abu Dhabi between Feb. 3 and 5.

France and the U.K. agreed with Ukraine on Jan. 6 to deploy forces in the country after the war as part of a security guarantees package designed to deter future Russian aggression.

The plan would involve a U.S. backstop for the European-led multinational force, though the Trump administration has been vague about the capabilities it is ready to offer. Washington is also expected to oversee monitoring of the ceasefire along the contact line.

U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration has drastically reduced military aid to Kyiv, has repeatedly said that it is primarily up to Europe to help maintain sustainable peace in Ukraine.

Earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he considers discussions with the U.S. on security guarantees concluded.

President Donald Trump said in a podcast interview with former FBI deputy director Dan Bongino on Feb. 2 that Republicans should “take over” the voting process in certain areas and place it under national authority.

In the interview on “The Dan Bongino Show,” Trump alleged that election outcomes were being distorted by noncitizen voting and suggested that Republicans should do more to address it.

            • Government shutdown: The House passed a massive funding bill that will fully reopen the government. It now heads to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature.
    


• Petro in Washington: Colombian President Gustavo Petro met with Trump today, a visit comes after a yearlong public quarrel between the two leaders over immigration and drug trafficking.
    


            • Trump's call to “nationalize” voting: In comments slammed by Democrats, Trump said Republicans should “take over” elections in at least 15 states ahead of the midterms. The White House claims Trump was referring to support for a voter ID law.
    


            • Iran tensions: Talks between the US and Iran will still be held at the end of the week, despite changes requested by Tehran, according to the White House. It comes as a US carrier shot down an Iranian drone in the Arabian Sea and armed boats threatened a US tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson said the SAVE Act “will be part of the discussion over the next couple of weeks” as they hammer out a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            “It will be part of the discussion over the next couple of weeks, and we'll see how that shakes out. But I suspect that some of the changes – the procedural modifications with ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement – will be codified,” Johnson said when asked if he needed assurances on the SAVE Act attached to the DHS funding deal.
    


            Johnson stopped short of saying he would attach it to DHS funding, saying, “I'm not going to tell you in advance how this negotiation will go. There's a lot of discussion to be held.”
    


            Johnson did not say he agreed with President Donald Trump on his call to “nationalize” voting but chalked the comment up to “frustration” with Democrat-led States.
    


            “What you're hearing from the president is his frustration about the lack of some of the blue states, frankly, of enforcing these things and making sure that they are free and fair elections. We need constant improvement on that front. I don't know what the ultimate solution is going to be,” he said.
    


            He said he would “not get ahead of the negotiations here” but said it would be a “continuing theme.
    


            The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said Tuesday that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's presence at an FBI search of an elections office in Georgia is part of a broader Trump administration effort to interfere in free and fair elections in the US.
    


            “When you put all of this together, it is clear that what happened in Fulton County is not about revisiting the past,” Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said at a press conference on Capitol Hill. “It's about shaping the outcome of future elections, and quite honestly dismantling the very guardrails that were put in place to keep them free and fair.”
    


            “I am deeply concerned about it spreading to other states,” he added.
    


            Gabbard last week put President Donald Trump on the phone with some of the FBI agents who conducted the search.
    


            “He did not ask any questions, nor did he or I issue any directives,” Gabbard wrote in a letter this week to Warner and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. She said her office's general counsel found her actions to be within her lawful authority.
    


            Gabbard argued that she had “broad statutory authority” to coordinate, integrate and analyze intelligence related to election security.
    


            “That phone call alone should concern every American because it didn't occur in a vacuum,” Warner said. “Broad authority to analyze intelligence is not a license to participate in a sham investigation.”
    


            “I want to underscore a core legal boundary: US intelligence agencies are structured to operate overseas, not on domestic soil,” Warner said Tuesday.
    


            A classified whistleblower complaint alleging wrongdoing by Gabbard had yet to be transmitted to Congress, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Gabbard's office has called the complaint “baseless and politically motivated.”
    


            Warner said Tuesday that he expected to receive the complaint “today or tomorrow.”
    


            The House on Tuesday passed a sprawling spending package that will end the partial government shutdown — but created another funding cliff for the Department of Homeland Security in two weeks.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to sign the funding bill quickly, ending the shutdown after three days. Trump and GOP leaders had pushed hard for their GOP members to fall in line despite their own private grumblings about the bill, eager to avoid a debilitating shutdown like the one that paralyzed Washington for 43 days last fall.
    


            The vote was a hard-fought victory for both Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who had to cajole the fractious GOP conference to back a deal that only temporarily funds DHS and excludes certain conservative priorities.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that President Donald Trump tapped Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to oversee election security while describing her unusual involvement in an FBI search of a Georgia elections office.
    


            “Tulsi Gabbard has been tapped by the president of the United States to oversee the sanctity and the security of our American elections. She's working directly alongside the FBI director, Kash Patel,” Leavitt said.
    


            “This is a coordinated whole-of-government effort to ensure that our elections again are fair and transparent moving forward. I don't see anything wrong with the president tasking a Cabinet member to pursue an issue that most people want to see solved,” she added.
    


Some background: After the administration gave conflicting accounts on Gabbard's involvement in the controversial search, the DNI in a letter released Monday night said she had accompanied top FBI agents at Trump's request. She also said she facilitated a call between the president and some of the FBI agents involved — while claiming the conversation included no questions or directives from Trump or her.
    


            The director of national intelligence oversees all foreign intelligence collection. Their traditional role in US elections is to protect them from foreign interference.
    


            After widespread pushback over comments suggesting she will target gun owners in Washington, DC, for prosecution, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said in a video that she is focused on taking firearms “out of the hands of criminals.”
    


            Pirro found herself in hot water after saying in a Fox News interview Monday evening that “you're going to jail” if you bring a gun into DC, whether or not you have a license in another district.

            DC requires gun owners to register their firearms with the district and does not recognize concealed carry permits from other states.
    


            In the video posted on X Tuesday, Pirro said that she wanted to be “crystal clear” about her support for the Second Amendment.
    


            “However, you need to be responsible,” Pirro said, “and every responsible gun owner that I know makes sure that they understand the laws where they are going and understand whatever registration requirements there might be.”
    


            She concluded, “You're responsible, you follow the laws, you're not going to have a problem with me.”
    


            The House is voting now on a sprawling funding package that will end the partial government shutdown.
    


            President Donald Trump, who supports the package, is expected to sign the bill quickly.
    


            The bill funds a number of critical departments, but also creates another funding cliff for the Department of Homeland Security in two weeks.
    


            President Donald Trump was “unsurprised” by Russia's major missile and drone attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the White House said Tuesday, even after he took credit for convincing President Vladimir Putin to temporarily pause such assaults.
    


            Speaking to reporters at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said planned negotiations between Russia and Ukraine would proceed later this week in Abu Dhabi, with the US in a mediating role.
    


            “I spoke with the president about it this morning, and his reaction was, unfortunately, unsurprised,” she said when asked about the fresh round of bombardment. “These are two countries who have been engaged in a very brutal war for several years, a war that have would have never started if the president were still in office.”
    


            The overnight assault cut heat to tens of thousands of people and ended a brief reprieve agreed to by Moscow and Washington as Ukrainians grapple with plummeting winter temperatures.
    


            Trump had taken credit for arranging the pause, saying he made a personal request to Putin to stop striking Ukrainian cities amid a cold snap.
    


            But Tuesday's assault made clear the break was short-lived. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's attack was focused on energy facilities across at least six regions and involved 70 missiles and 450 attack drones.
    


            “Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than turning to diplomacy,” Zelensky said.
    


            The White House said Tuesday that President Donald Trump was talking about the need for a national voter ID requirement when he called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting.”
    


            “What the president was referring to is the SAVE Act,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that Trump had spoken with GOP congressional leaders about the legislation, which would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. “It provides very commonsense measures for voting in our country, such as voter ID.”
    


            Trump, in a radio interview that aired Monday, also advocated for Republicans to take over the voting in “at least” 15 places. Leavitt said that was also tied to his desire for a voter ID law, insisting he was referring to states where he believes there's been a “high degree” of election fraud.
    


            Some House conservatives pushed to attach the SAVE Act to a government funding bill ahead of a vote on the package today. But Trump declined to support that effort over concerns about a lengthy shutdown. Leavitt said he'll instead push for a separate vote on the measure.
    


            “There are millions of people who have questions about that,” she said of alleged election fraud. “He wants to make it right, and the SAVE Act is a solution to doing it.”
    


The SAVE Act: Critics have warned that the bill threatens to restrict voting access by creating unnecessary hurdles that will make it harder to register to vote and wrongfully disenfranchise legitimate voters.
    


            It is already against the law for people who aren't US citizens to vote in federal elections, and experts say it rarely happens.
    


            Talks between the US and Iran will proceed this week, despite changes requested by Tehran to the venue and format, according to the White House.
    


            “I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks, as of right now, are still scheduled,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in the White House driveway.
    


            “President Trump is always wanting to pursue diplomacy first, but obviously it takes two to tango,” she went on. “You need a willing partner to achieve diplomacy, and that's something that special envoy Witkoff is intent on exploring and discussing.”
    


            The planned talks hit a snag Tuesday after Tehran requested they be relocated to a different city, that regional participants be excluded and that the scope of the discussions be limited to just the country's nuclear program, CNN reported earlier.
    


            The new demands could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions.
    


            Leavitt said Trump was still keeping open the option of military strikes if diplomacy fails.
    


            “The president has a range of options on the table with respect to Iran as commander in chief,” she said.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday expressed optimism that the government will reopen and that the president will sign Congress' funding deal later today.
    


                    “We're extremely optimistic the government is going to reopen, that all Republicans are going to stick together and vote accordingly, and that bill to reopen the government will be right here at the White House, we hope in just a few short hours, to the president's desk for signature,” Leavitt said on Fox News. 
                





            Leavitt's comments came shortly after the House GOP cleared a key procedural vote on the massive funding bill, putting Congress on a path to reopen the government within hours. It follows a fierce lobbying push by President Donald Trump on Republican holdouts.
    


            A US aircraft carrier shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively approached” the ship in the Arabian Sea today, hours before two gunboats operated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and threatened to board and seize the ship, according to a US military spokesperson.
    


The two incidents occurred days before US and Iranian officials are due to meet Friday for diplomatic negotiations meant to avert a military clash.
    


In the first incident: US forces shot down an Iranian drone “as the unmanned aircraft aggressively approached” the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which was transiting the Arabian Sea about 500 miles from Iran's southern coast, said Capt. Tim Hawkins, a US Central Command spokesperson.
    


                    “The Iranian drone continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by US forces operating in international waters,” Hawkins said. An F-35C fighter jet from the Lincoln shot down the drone to protect the carrier and its personnel, he said.
                





            “No American service members were harmed during the incident, and no U.S. equipment was damaged,” Hawkins said.
    


The second incident: Hours later, two Iranian gunboats approached the M/V Stena Imperative — a chemical tanker operated by Americans flying under the US flag in the Strait of Hormuz — passing the ship three times at high speeds as an Iranian Mohajer drone also flew overhead, said Hawkins. During one of their passes, the Iranians threatened via radio call that they would board and seize the tanker. The tanker was in international waters, Hawkins said.
    


            US military forces operating in the area responded when they learned of the Iranian threats. The USS McFaul destroyer escorted the tanker away from the area along with defensive air support from the US Air Force, Hawkins added. The situation de-escalated as a result.
    


            Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, backed Bill and Hillary Clinton's request to testify publicly to the panel.
    


            “They've also requested that the hearings be public hearings. They just made that request today. I strongly support that. I think the idea of moving that deposition from being a private to public, is good for the for the American people. And I support that,” he told reporters on Tuesday.
    


            The Clintons reached an agreement on Tuesday to appear for depositions before the House oversight committee.
    


            The former president is scheduled to appear on February 27 and the former Secretary of State to appear on February 26.
    


            Fulton Police Department body-camera video, obtained exclusively by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, shows a chaotic scene in the hours after the FBI arrived at the Fulton County elections warehouse last Wednesday.
    


            The FBI served a warrant at the Fulton County election office, near Atlanta, taking 700 boxes of election materials as it probes alleged voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.
    


            “All right so we were given very limited information,” the unidentified Fulton Police officer told Peter Ellis, acting special agent in charge at the FBI's Atlanta field office after the two men exchanged a handshake.
    


            “So we have a search warrant for this like, one for the like entire location,” Ellis told the officer.
    


            “But now we're getting it, we may need another search warrant for another location,” he told the officer. “So we'll have that soon.”
    


            The Fulton police officer asked if the warrant had to do with “election stuff.”
    


            “Well you know why we're here, right? So we can't, I can't discuss more,” Ellis responded.
    


            Another FBI employee, who is not named in the video, told the officer that the warrant will be adjusted.
    


            The FBI staffer told the Fulton officer that he wanted election warehouse employees to help them unlock gates in the building so they didn't have to “breach it.”
    


            “Because one way or another the records are coming with us today,” he said.
    


            An FBI spokesperson at the scene on Wednesday told CNN that the materials would be taken to the FBI Central Records Complex in Virginia.
    


            Talks between the US and Iran planned for later this week hit a snag Tuesday after Tehran requested they be relocated, that regional participants be excluded, and that the discussions' scope be limited to the country's nuclear program, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The new demands could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions.
    


            The talks had been set for Istanbul, with foreign ministers from Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also expected to attend.
    


            Tehran is now asking for an alternate location: Oman, the small Gulf sultanate that has previous hosted talks between the US and Iran.
    


            Iran is also stipulating the talks be conducted bilaterally, without the other nations' representatives.
    


            And it has requested the scope of the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue. The US has said its demands for Iran extend beyond an end to its nuclear program to curbing its ballistic missiles and ending support for regional proxy groups.
    


            What the changes — first reported by Axios — portend for the diplomatic efforts wasn't clear. Already, some American officials had privately warned that Iran may be using diplomacy to play for time in preventing military action.
    


            The two US participants in the discussions — foreign envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner — arrived in the region on Tuesday for talks with Israeli officials.
    


            Trump said Monday that talks were ongoing but continued to point to the large military buildup in the region as evidence of his willingness to order strikes.
    


            “Right now we're talking to them. We're talking to Iran, and if we can work something out that'll be great, and if we can't, probably bad things would happen,” he said.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday successfully quelled a conservative rebellion within his own party that threatened to block a massive funding bill, putting Congress on a path to reopening the government within hours.
    


            Johnson and his leadership team – with help from President Donald Trump — convinced all but one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, to back the procedural vote on the floor Tuesday. The House will vote on final passage of the funding package early Tuesday afternoon.
    


            Trump and his team leaned hard on those rogue Republicans who had vowed to block the funding bill unless GOP leaders agreed to attach a strict voter ID bill to the package.
    


            House Oversight Chair James Comer has agreed to the dates Bill and Hillary Clinton proposed for depositions in the panel's Jeffrey Epstein probe, putting an end to the contempt of Congress proceedings that had been moving forward against them.
    


            The former president is scheduled to appear on February 27 and the former Secretary of State to appear on February 26 under the terms that Comer had previously set.
    


            Two sources had earlier told CNN that the Clintons agreed to appear for depositions on the panel's terms, but also suggested they wanted public hearings.
    


            Several senior Senate Democrats this morning slammed President Donald Trump's call to “nationalize” elections as an unconstitutional attempt to control the outcome of future elections.
    


Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal argued that “it's grounds for impeachment.”
    


                    “Trump shouts the quiet part out loud,” Blumenthal said in a post on X. “Nationalizing elections would be brazenly unconstitutional & totalitarian—the threat itself deeply chilling (…) America should be afraid, very afraid.”
                





Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, agreed with Blumenthal's warnings, though he did not go so far as to suggest impeachment.
    


            “Outrageous and not unexpected. He's been building up to this. He wants to put his enforcers, whoever they may be, ICE or National Guard, that are loyal to him, at the polling places, to intimidate voters in the next election,” Durbin said.“What it tells us is he's very worried about the outcome of that election.”
    


GOP Rep. Don Bacon also expressed his opposition to the idea. “I opposed nationalizing elections when Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi wanted major changes to elections in all 50 states. I'll oppose this now as well,” the congressman from Nebraska said in a post on X.
    


            Meanwhile, Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley downplayed the president's remarks, telling reporters he believed Trump was pushing for a Republican-led voter ID law known as the SAVE Act, rather than saying that the federal government should administer elections.
    


                    “Everybody understands that the states are in charge of administering the elections. The Constitution says that, but the due process clause, as well as other federal statutes, provide some ground rules about what you can and cannot do, and Congress has been legislating basic ground rules for federal elections since Reconstruction,” he told reporters.
                





            GOP leaders are working their members on the House floor, as a key procedural vote on the funding package to reopen the federal government is underway.
    


            With the full Democratic caucus currently voting against the package, House Speaker Johnson can only afford to lose one Republican vote. The little wiggle room has left Johnson and his leadership team scrambling to win over needed lawmakers.
    


            GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and John Rose of Tennessee cast “no” votes and several members of the conference's right flank were holding out their votes altogether.
    


            Lawmakers can ultimately change their votes until the vote on the rule is closed.
    


            If leaders can clear the procedural hurdle, the House will vote on passage of the government funding package later this afternoon.
    


            Senate GOP Leader John Thune says he supports components of the SAVE Act, a bill to require only citizens to vote and photo IDs at polling places, that some House Republicans have suggested could prompt Thune to change filibuster rules to pass his chamber.
    


            “I'm supportive of, you know, only citizens voting and showing ID at the polling places. I think that makes sense, which is what the bill that is under consideration would do. But I'm not in favor federalizing elections, no,” he said.
    


            Thune said he and members of his conference will discuss the SAVE Act and the desire of some to change filibuster rules at their weekly policy lunch today, but said he's made no commitments to those House members on changes to the filibuster. Some House members said they switched their positions in favor of voting for a massive federal funding bill based on their belief Thune would do so.
    


                    “So, we're going to have a conversation about that but there weren't any commitments made, no,” Thune said.
                





            GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah is advocating changing the filibuster by requiring senators to stand or talk during a filibuster and not simply block action by verbally objecting to moving forward.
    


            But Thune said the complicated rules of the proposal could mean the filibuster “would go on for an indefinite period of time,” possibly two to three months before a final vote.
    


            “It ties up the floor indefinitely. So, it means you're not doing other things. So, there's always an opportunity cost,” he said. “There are some important things that we do want to do.”
    


            Thune did promise to force a floor vote on the SAVE Act, though unless the filibuster rules are changed, it won't get the 60 votes it would need to advance because Democrats strongly oppose it.
    


            “We will have that vote. Exactly when I can't give you a hard answer on that,” he said.
    


            As Colombian President Gustavo Petro meets with President Donald Trump in the White House, get caught up on what led to him being sanctioned last year.
    


            Petro and Trump had public clashes over drugs and migration, and Petro was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department sanctioned in October 2025.
    


            Trump accused Petro of playing a role in the global illicit drug trade, encouraging narcotics production, and of being an “illegal drug leader,” allegations that the Colombian president has repeatedly rejected.
    


                    “Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at the time the sanctions were announced.
                





            The move added Petro to the government's list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDN), which is maintained by the US Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).
    


            The list was established in 1995 via an executive order from then-President Bill Clinton, with the goal of fighting money laundering from narcotics traffickers in Colombia. It is known informally as the “Clinton list.”
    


            The SDN List targets entities and individuals who act on behalf of countries that are adversarial to the US, along with US-designated terrorists and criminals.
    


            Petro's wife and son, and Colombia's interior minister were also added to this list, which includes Russian President Vladimir Putin and Venezuela's ousted former leader Nicolas Maduro.

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Investigators found signs of forced entry at the Arizona home of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie's mother, a person familiar with the investigation said Tuesday, as the host asked for prayers to help bring back the 84-year-old, who is believed to have been taken against her will.

The host described her mother as “a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant” in a social media post late Monday. She asked supporters to “raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment. Bring her home.”

Nancy Guthrie must be found soon because she could die without her medication, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said, urging whoever has her to free her.

“If she's alive right now, her meds are vital. I can't stress that enough. It's been better than 24 hours, and the family tells us if she doesn't have those meds, it can become fatal,” Nanos said.

Investigators also found specific evidence in the home showing there was a nighttime kidnapping, the person told The Associated Press. Several of Guthrie's personal items, including her cellphone, wallet and her car, were still there after she disappeared.

Investigators are reviewing surveillance video from nearby homes and working to analyze data from cellphone towers. Police are also reviewing information from license plate cameras in the area, according to the person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the case and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.




The motive remains a mystery. Investigators do not believe at this point that the abduction was part of a robbery, home invasion or kidnapping-for-ransom plot, the person said.

The sheriff and the local FBI chief held a news conference and urged the public to offer tips, but they revealed few new details about the investigation. Nanos declined to say whether Guthrie's disappearance was thought to be random or targeted or to describe the evidence found at her home.

For a second day, “Today” opened Tuesday with Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, but Savannah Guthrie was not at the anchor's desk. Nanos said Monday that she is in Arizona. The host grew up in Tucson, graduated from the University of Arizona and previously worked as a reporter and anchor at Tucson television station KVOA.

Nancy Guthrie was last seen Saturday night at her home in the Tucson area, where she lived alone and was reported missing Sunday. Someone at her church called a family member to say she was not there, leading family to search her home and then call 911, Nanos said.

Nancy Guthrie has limited mobility, and officials do not believe she left on her own. Nanos said she is of sound mind.

In the hours after she disappeared, searchers used drones and dogs and were supported by volunteers and Border Patrol. The homicide team was also involved, Nanos said.

On Monday morning, search crews were pulled back.

“We don't see this as a search mission so much as it is a crime scene,” the sheriff said.

Nancy Guthrie's home is in the affluent Catalina Foothills area on the northern edge of Tucson. Her brick home has a gravel driveway and a yard covered in prickly pear and saguaro cactus.

Savannah Guthrie's parents settled in Tucson in the 1970s when she was a young child. The youngest of three siblings, she credits her mom with holding their family together after her father died of a heart attack at age 49, when Savannah was just 16.

“When my dad died, our family just hung onto each other for dear life because it was such a shock. We were just trying to figure out how to become a family of four when we'd always been a family of five,” she said on “Today” in 2017.

Nancy Guthrie raised them on her own. The host often brought her mother on “Today” as a guest.

“She has met unthinkable challenges in her life with grit, without self-pity, with determination and always, always with unshakeable faith,” Savannah said on the show in 2022 on Nancy Guthrie's 80th birthday.

“She loves us, her family, fiercely, and her selflessness and sacrifice for us, her steadfastness and her unmovable confidence is the reason any of us grew up to do anything.”

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Immigration officers with guns drawn arrested some activists who were trailing their vehicles on Tuesday in Minneapolis, a sign that tensions have not eased since the departure last week of a high-profile commander.

At least one person who had an anti-ICE message on clothing was handcuffed while face-down on the ground. An Associated Press photographer witnessed the arrests.

Federal agents lately have been conducting more targeted immigration arrests at homes and neighborhoods, rather than staging in parking lots. The convoys have been harder to find and less aggressive. Alerts in activist group chats have been more about sightings than immigration-related detainments. 

Several cars followed officers through south Minneapolis after there were reports of them knocking at homes. Officers stopped their vehicles and ordered activists to come out of a car at gunpoint. Agents told reporters at the scene to stay back and threatened to use pepper spray.

There was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

A federal judge last month put limits on how officers treat motorists who are following them but not obstructing their operations. Safely following agents “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” the judge said. An appeals court, however, set the order aside.

At a news conference, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says she is grateful for the judges order not halting the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota as a lawsuit proceeds.




Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who was leading an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and other big U.S. cities, left town last week, shortly after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, the second local killing of a U.S. citizen in January. 

Trump administration border czar Tom Homan was dispatched to Minnesota instead. He warned that protesters could face consequences if they interfere with officers.

Meanwhile, a man charged with squirting apple cider vinegar on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar will remain in jail. U.S. Magistrate Judge David Schultz granted a federal prosecutor's request to deny bond to Anthony Kazmierczak. 

“We simply cannot have protesters and people — whatever side of the aisle they're on — running up to representatives who are conducting official business, and holding town halls, and assaulting them,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Bejar said Tuesday.

Defense attorney John Fossum said the vinegar posed a low risk to Omar. He said Kazmierczak's health problems weren't being properly addressed in jail and that his release would be appropriate.

Live Updates


            • Government shutdown: The House passed a massive funding bill that will fully reopen the government. It now heads to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature.
    


• Petro in Washington: Colombian President Gustavo Petro met with Trump today, a visit comes after a yearlong public quarrel between the two leaders over immigration and drug trafficking.
    


            • Trump's call to “nationalize” voting: In comments slammed by Democrats, Trump said Republicans should “take over” elections in at least 15 states ahead of the midterms. The White House claims Trump was referring to support for a voter ID law.
    


            • Iran tensions: Talks between the US and Iran will still be held at the end of the week, despite changes requested by Tehran, according to the White House. It comes as a US carrier shot down an Iranian drone in the Arabian Sea and armed boats threatened a US tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.
    


            The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said Tuesday that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's presence at an FBI search of an elections office in Georgia is part of a broader Trump administration effort to interfere in free and fair elections in the US.
    


            “When you put all of this together, it is clear that what happened in Fulton County is not about revisiting the past,” Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said at a press conference on Capitol Hill. “It's about shaping the outcome of future elections, and quite honestly dismantling the very guardrails that were put in place to keep them free and fair.”
    


            “I am deeply concerned about it spreading to other states,” he added.
    


            Gabbard last week put President Donald Trump on the phone with some of the FBI agents who conducted the search.
    


            “He did not ask any questions, nor did he or I issue any directives,” Gabbard wrote in a letter this week to Warner and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. She said her office's general counsel found her actions to be within her lawful authority.
    


            Gabbard argued that she had “broad statutory authority” to coordinate, integrate and analyze intelligence related to election security.
    


            “That phone call alone should concern every American because it didn't occur in a vacuum,” Warner said. “Broad authority to analyze intelligence is not a license to participate in a sham investigation.”
    


            “I want to underscore a core legal boundary: US intelligence agencies are structured to operate overseas, not on domestic soil,” Warner said Tuesday.
    


            A classified whistleblower complaint alleging wrongdoing by Gabbard had yet to be transmitted to Congress, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Gabbard's office has called the complaint “baseless and politically motivated.”
    


            Warner said Tuesday that he expected to receive the complaint “today or tomorrow.”
    


            The House on Tuesday passed a sprawling spending package that will end the partial government shutdown — but created another funding cliff for the Department of Homeland Security in two weeks.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to sign the funding bill quickly, ending the shutdown after three days. Trump and GOP leaders had pushed hard for their GOP members to fall in line despite their own private grumblings about the bill, eager to avoid a debilitating shutdown like the one that paralyzed Washington for 43 days last fall.
    


            The vote was a hard-fought victory for both Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who had to cajole the fractious GOP conference to back a deal that only temporarily funds DHS and excludes certain conservative priorities.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that President Donald Trump tapped Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to oversee election security while describing her unusual involvement in an FBI search of a Georgia elections office.
    


            “Tulsi Gabbard has been tapped by the president of the United States to oversee the sanctity and the security of our American elections. She's working directly alongside the FBI director, Kash Patel,” Leavitt said.
    


            “This is a coordinated whole-of-government effort to ensure that our elections again are fair and transparent moving forward. I don't see anything wrong with the president tasking a Cabinet member to pursue an issue that most people want to see solved,” she added.
    


Some background: After the administration gave conflicting accounts on Gabbard's involvement in the controversial search, the DNI in a letter released Monday night said she had accompanied top FBI agents at Trump's request. She also said she facilitated a call between the president and some of the FBI agents involved — while claiming the conversation included no questions or directives from Trump or her.
    


            The director of national intelligence oversees all foreign intelligence collection. Their traditional role in US elections is to protect them from foreign interference.
    


            After widespread pushback over comments suggesting she will target gun owners in Washington, DC, for prosecution, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said in a video that she is focused on taking firearms “out of the hands of criminals.”
    


            Pirro found herself in hot water after saying in a Fox News interview Monday evening that “you're going to jail” if you bring a gun into DC, whether or not you have a license in another district.
    

Even the NRA recognizes congress needs to act here. https://t.co/5J55pW9grv


            DC requires gun owners to register their firearms with the district and does not recognize concealed carry permits from other states.
    


            In the video posted on X Tuesday, Pirro said that she wanted to be “crystal clear” about her support for the Second Amendment.
    


            “However, you need to be responsible,” Pirro said, “and every responsible gun owner that I know makes sure that they understand the laws where they are going and understand whatever registration requirements there might be.”
    


            She concluded, “You're responsible, you follow the laws, you're not going to have a problem with me.”
    


            The House is voting now on a sprawling funding package that will end the partial government shutdown.
    


            President Donald Trump, who supports the package, is expected to sign the bill quickly.
    


            The bill funds a number of critical departments, but also creates another funding cliff for the Department of Homeland Security in two weeks.
    


            President Donald Trump was “unsurprised” by Russia's major missile and drone attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the White House said Tuesday, even after he took credit for convincing President Vladimir Putin to temporarily pause such assaults.
    


            Speaking to reporters at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said planned negotiations between Russia and Ukraine would proceed later this week in Abu Dhabi, with the US in a mediating role.
    


            “I spoke with the president about it this morning, and his reaction was, unfortunately, unsurprised,” she said when asked about the fresh round of bombardment. “These are two countries who have been engaged in a very brutal war for several years, a war that have would have never started if the president were still in office.”
    


            The overnight assault cut heat to tens of thousands of people and ended a brief reprieve agreed to by Moscow and Washington as Ukrainians grapple with plummeting winter temperatures.
    


            Trump had taken credit for arranging the pause, saying he made a personal request to Putin to stop striking Ukrainian cities amid a cold snap.
    


            But Tuesday's assault made clear the break was short-lived. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's attack was focused on energy facilities across at least six regions and involved 70 missiles and 450 attack drones.
    


            “Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than turning to diplomacy,” Zelensky said.
    


            The White House said Tuesday that President Donald Trump was talking about the need for a national voter ID requirement when he called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting.”
    


            “What the president was referring to is the SAVE Act,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that Trump had spoken with GOP congressional leaders about the legislation, which would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. “It provides very commonsense measures for voting in our country, such as voter ID.”
    


            Trump, in a radio interview that aired Monday, also advocated for Republicans to take over the voting in “at least” 15 places. Leavitt said that was also tied to his desire for a voter ID law, insisting he was referring to states where he believes there's been a “high degree” of election fraud.
    


            Some House conservatives pushed to attach the SAVE Act to a government funding bill ahead of a vote on the package today. But Trump declined to support that effort over concerns about a lengthy shutdown. Leavitt said he'll instead push for a separate vote on the measure.
    


            “There are millions of people who have questions about that,” she said of alleged election fraud. “He wants to make it right, and the SAVE Act is a solution to doing it.”
    


The SAVE Act: Critics have warned that the bill threatens to restrict voting access by creating unnecessary hurdles that will make it harder to register to vote and wrongfully disenfranchise legitimate voters.
    


            It is already against the law for people who aren't US citizens to vote in federal elections, and experts say it rarely happens.
    


            Talks between the US and Iran will proceed this week, despite changes requested by Tehran to the venue and format, according to the White House.
    


            “I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks, as of right now, are still scheduled,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in the White House driveway.
    


            “President Trump is always wanting to pursue diplomacy first, but obviously it takes two to tango,” she went on. “You need a willing partner to achieve diplomacy, and that's something that special envoy Witkoff is intent on exploring and discussing.”
    


            The planned talks hit a snag Tuesday after Tehran requested they be relocated to a different city, that regional participants be excluded and that the scope of the discussions be limited to just the country's nuclear program, CNN reported earlier.
    


            The new demands could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions.
    


            Leavitt said Trump was still keeping open the option of military strikes if diplomacy fails.
    


            “The president has a range of options on the table with respect to Iran as commander in chief,” she said.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday expressed optimism that the government will reopen and that the president will sign Congress' funding deal later today.
    


                    “We're extremely optimistic the government is going to reopen, that all Republicans are going to stick together and vote accordingly, and that bill to reopen the government will be right here at the White House, we hope in just a few short hours, to the president's desk for signature,” Leavitt said on Fox News. 
                





            Leavitt's comments came shortly after the House GOP cleared a key procedural vote on the massive funding bill, putting Congress on a path to reopen the government within hours. It follows a fierce lobbying push by President Donald Trump on Republican holdouts.
    


            A US aircraft carrier shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively approached” the ship in the Arabian Sea today, hours before two gunboats operated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and threatened to board and seize the ship, according to a US military spokesperson.
    


The two incidents occurred days before US and Iranian officials are due to meet Friday for diplomatic negotiations meant to avert a military clash.
    


In the first incident: US forces shot down an Iranian drone “as the unmanned aircraft aggressively approached” the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which was transiting the Arabian Sea about 500 miles from Iran's southern coast, said Capt. Tim Hawkins, a US Central Command spokesperson.
    


                    “The Iranian drone continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by US forces operating in international waters,” Hawkins said. An F-35C fighter jet from the Lincoln shot down the drone to protect the carrier and its personnel, he said.
                





            “No American service members were harmed during the incident, and no U.S. equipment was damaged,” Hawkins said.
    


The second incident: Hours later, two Iranian gunboats approached the M/V Stena Imperative — a chemical tanker operated by Americans flying under the US flag in the Strait of Hormuz — passing the ship three times at high speeds as an Iranian Mohajer drone also flew overhead, said Hawkins. During one of their passes, the Iranians threatened via radio call that they would board and seize the tanker. The tanker was in international waters, Hawkins said.
    


            US military forces operating in the area responded when they learned of the Iranian threats. The USS McFaul destroyer escorted the tanker away from the area along with defensive air support from the US Air Force, Hawkins added. The situation de-escalated as a result.
    


            Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, backed Bill and Hillary Clinton's request to testify publicly to the panel.
    


            “They've also requested that the hearings be public hearings. They just made that request today. I strongly support that. I think the idea of moving that deposition from being a private to public, is good for the for the American people. And I support that,” he told reporters on Tuesday.
    


            The Clintons reached an agreement on Tuesday to appear for depositions before the House oversight committee.
    


            The former president is scheduled to appear on February 27 and the former Secretary of State to appear on February 26.
    


            Fulton Police Department body-camera video, obtained exclusively by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, shows a chaotic scene in the hours after the FBI arrived at the Fulton County elections warehouse last Wednesday.
    


            The FBI served a warrant at the Fulton County election office, near Atlanta, taking 700 boxes of election materials as it probes alleged voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.
    


            “All right so we were given very limited information,” the unidentified Fulton Police officer told Peter Ellis, acting special agent in charge at the FBI's Atlanta field office after the two men exchanged a handshake.
    


            “So we have a search warrant for this like, one for the like entire location,” Ellis told the officer.
    


            “But now we're getting it, we may need another search warrant for another location,” he told the officer. “So we'll have that soon.”
    


            The Fulton police officer asked if the warrant had to do with “election stuff.”
    


            “Well you know why we're here, right? So we can't, I can't discuss more,” Ellis responded.
    


            Another FBI employee, who is not named in the video, told the officer that the warrant will be adjusted.
    


            The FBI staffer told the Fulton officer that he wanted election warehouse employees to help them unlock gates in the building so they didn't have to “breach it.”
    


            “Because one way or another the records are coming with us today,” he said.
    


            An FBI spokesperson at the scene on Wednesday told CNN that the materials would be taken to the FBI Central Records Complex in Virginia.
    


            Talks between the US and Iran planned for later this week hit a snag Tuesday after Tehran requested they be relocated, that regional participants be excluded, and that the discussions' scope be limited to the country's nuclear program, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The new demands could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions.
    


            The talks had been set for Istanbul, with foreign ministers from Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also expected to attend.
    


            Tehran is now asking for an alternate location: Oman, the small Gulf sultanate that has previous hosted talks between the US and Iran.
    


            Iran is also stipulating the talks be conducted bilaterally, without the other nations' representatives.
    


            And it has requested the scope of the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue. The US has said its demands for Iran extend beyond an end to its nuclear program to curbing its ballistic missiles and ending support for regional proxy groups.
    


            What the changes — first reported by Axios — portend for the diplomatic efforts wasn't clear. Already, some American officials had privately warned that Iran may be using diplomacy to play for time in preventing military action.
    


            The two US participants in the discussions — foreign envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner — arrived in the region on Tuesday for talks with Israeli officials.
    


            Trump said Monday that talks were ongoing but continued to point to the large military buildup in the region as evidence of his willingness to order strikes.
    


            “Right now we're talking to them. We're talking to Iran, and if we can work something out that'll be great, and if we can't, probably bad things would happen,” he said.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday successfully quelled a conservative rebellion within his own party that threatened to block a massive funding bill, putting Congress on a path to reopening the government within hours.
    


            Johnson and his leadership team – with help from President Donald Trump — convinced all but one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, to back the procedural vote on the floor Tuesday. The House will vote on final passage of the funding package early Tuesday afternoon.
    


            Trump and his team leaned hard on those rogue Republicans who had vowed to block the funding bill unless GOP leaders agreed to attach a strict voter ID bill to the package.
    


            House Oversight Chair James Comer has agreed to the dates Bill and Hillary Clinton proposed for depositions in the panel's Jeffrey Epstein probe, putting an end to the contempt of Congress proceedings that had been moving forward against them.
    


            The former president is scheduled to appear on February 27 and the former Secretary of State to appear on February 26 under the terms that Comer had previously set.
    


            Two sources had earlier told CNN that the Clintons agreed to appear for depositions on the panel's terms, but also suggested they wanted public hearings.
    


            Several senior Senate Democrats this morning slammed President Donald Trump's call to “nationalize” elections as an unconstitutional attempt to control the outcome of future elections.
    


Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal argued that “it's grounds for impeachment.”
    


                    “Trump shouts the quiet part out loud,” Blumenthal said in a post on X. “Nationalizing elections would be brazenly unconstitutional & totalitarian—the threat itself deeply chilling (…) America should be afraid, very afraid.”
                





Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, agreed with Blumenthal's warnings, though he did not go so far as to suggest impeachment.
    


            “Outrageous and not unexpected. He's been building up to this. He wants to put his enforcers, whoever they may be, ICE or National Guard, that are loyal to him, at the polling places, to intimidate voters in the next election,” Durbin said.“What it tells us is he's very worried about the outcome of that election.”
    


GOP Rep. Don Bacon also expressed his opposition to the idea. “I opposed nationalizing elections when Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi wanted major changes to elections in all 50 states. I'll oppose this now as well,” the congressman from Nebraska said in a post on X.
    


            Meanwhile, Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley downplayed the president's remarks, telling reporters he believed Trump was pushing for a Republican-led voter ID law known as the SAVE Act, rather than saying that the federal government should administer elections.
    


                    “Everybody understands that the states are in charge of administering the elections. The Constitution says that, but the due process clause, as well as other federal statutes, provide some ground rules about what you can and cannot do, and Congress has been legislating basic ground rules for federal elections since Reconstruction,” he told reporters.
                





            GOP leaders are working their members on the House floor, as a key procedural vote on the funding package to reopen the federal government is underway.
    


            With the full Democratic caucus currently voting against the package, House Speaker Johnson can only afford to lose one Republican vote. The little wiggle room has left Johnson and his leadership team scrambling to win over needed lawmakers.
    


            GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and John Rose of Tennessee cast “no” votes and several members of the conference's right flank were holding out their votes altogether.
    


            Lawmakers can ultimately change their votes until the vote on the rule is closed.
    


            If leaders can clear the procedural hurdle, the House will vote on passage of the government funding package later this afternoon.
    


            Senate GOP Leader John Thune says he supports components of the SAVE Act, a bill to require only citizens to vote and photo IDs at polling places, that some House Republicans have suggested could prompt Thune to change filibuster rules to pass his chamber.
    


            “I'm supportive of, you know, only citizens voting and showing ID at the polling places. I think that makes sense, which is what the bill that is under consideration would do. But I'm not in favor federalizing elections, no,” he said.
    


            Thune said he and members of his conference will discuss the SAVE Act and the desire of some to change filibuster rules at their weekly policy lunch today, but said he's made no commitments to those House members on changes to the filibuster. Some House members said they switched their positions in favor of voting for a massive federal funding bill based on their belief Thune would do so.
    


                    “So, we're going to have a conversation about that but there weren't any commitments made, no,” Thune said.
                





            GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah is advocating changing the filibuster by requiring senators to stand or talk during a filibuster and not simply block action by verbally objecting to moving forward.
    


            But Thune said the complicated rules of the proposal could mean the filibuster “would go on for an indefinite period of time,” possibly two to three months before a final vote.
    


            “It ties up the floor indefinitely. So, it means you're not doing other things. So, there's always an opportunity cost,” he said. “There are some important things that we do want to do.”
    


            Thune did promise to force a floor vote on the SAVE Act, though unless the filibuster rules are changed, it won't get the 60 votes it would need to advance because Democrats strongly oppose it.
    


            “We will have that vote. Exactly when I can't give you a hard answer on that,” he said.
    


            As Colombian President Gustavo Petro meets with President Donald Trump in the White House, get caught up on what led to him being sanctioned last year.
    


            Petro and Trump had public clashes over drugs and migration, and Petro was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department sanctioned in October 2025.
    


            Trump accused Petro of playing a role in the global illicit drug trade, encouraging narcotics production, and of being an “illegal drug leader,” allegations that the Colombian president has repeatedly rejected.
    


                    “Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at the time the sanctions were announced.
                





            The move added Petro to the government's list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDN), which is maintained by the US Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).
    


            The list was established in 1995 via an executive order from then-President Bill Clinton, with the goal of fighting money laundering from narcotics traffickers in Colombia. It is known informally as the “Clinton list.”
    


            The SDN List targets entities and individuals who act on behalf of countries that are adversarial to the US, along with US-designated terrorists and criminals.
    


            Petro's wife and son, and Colombia's interior minister were also added to this list, which includes Russian President Vladimir Putin and Venezuela's ousted former leader Nicolas Maduro.
    


            US President Donald Trump and his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro have started their meeting at the Oval Office, Colombia's presidency said.
    


            They are joined by other officials including US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Colombian Foreign Minister Rosa Yolanda Villavicencio, Ambassador Daniel García-Peña and Defense Minister Pedro Sánchez.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton finalized an agreement with House Republicans Tuesday to testify in a House investigation into Jeffrey Epstein this month, bowing to the threat of a contempt of Congress vote against them.

Hillary Clinton will testify before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 26 and Bill Clinton will appear on Feb. 27. It will mark the first time that lawmakers have compelled a former president to testify.

The arrangement comes after months of negotiating between the two sides as Republicans sought to make the Clintons a focal point in a House committee's investigation into Epstein, a convicted sex offender who killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019, and Ghislaine Maxwell, his former girlfriend.

“We look forward to now questioning the Clintons as part of our investigation into the horrific crimes of Epstein and Maxwell, to deliver transparency and accountability for the American people and for survivors,” Rep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement.

For months, the Clintons resisted subpoenas from the committee, but House Republicans — with support from a few Democrats — had advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges to a potential vote this week. It threatened the Clintons with the potential for substantial fines and even prison time if they had been convicted.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that any effort to hold them in contempt of Congress were “on pause.”




Even as the Clintons bowed to the pressure, the negotiating between GOP lawmakers and attorneys for the Clintons was marked by distrust as they wrangled over the details of the deposition. They agreed to have the depositions transcribed and recorded on video, Comer said.

The belligerence is likely to only grow as Republicans relish the opportunity to grill longtime political foes under oath.

Clinton, like a number of other high-powered men, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with the late financier.

Both Clintons have said they had no knowledge that Epstein was sexually abusing underage girls.

The Clintons argued the subpoenas for their testimony were invalid and offered to submit sworn declarations on their limited knowledge of Epstein's crimes. But as Comer threatened to proceed with contempt of Congress charges, they began looking for an off-ramp.

Both Clintons have remained highly critical of how Comer has handled the Epstein investigation and argue that he is more focused on bringing them in for testimony rather than holding the Trump administration accountable for how it has handled the release of its files on Epstein.

Still, the threat of a vote on contempt charges raised the potential for Congress to use one of its most severe punishments against a former president for the first time. Historically, Congress has shown deference to former presidents. None has ever been forced to testify before lawmakers, although a few have voluntarily done so.

Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume discusses President Donald Trump increasing pressure on Iran and the U.S. military presence in the Middle East on ‘Special Report.' 

The U.S. military shot down an unmanned Iranian drone Tuesday after it "aggressively approached a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier with unclear intent," a U.S. Central Command spokesman told Fox News.

"USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) was transiting the Arabian Sea approximately 500 miles from Iran's southern coast when an Iranian Shahed-139 drone unnecessarily maneuvered toward the ship," Capt. Tim Hawkins added.

"The Iranian drone continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by U.S. forces operating in international waters," CENTCOM also said. " An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defense and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board."

Hawkins said no U.S. service members were injured and no U.S. equipment was damaged during the incident.

Hawkins also told Fox News on Tuesday that, "During a separate incident hours later in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) forces harassed a U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed merchant vessel lawfully transiting the international sea passage."

"Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker," the CENTCOM spokesman said. "Guided-missile destroyer USS McFaul (DDG 74) was operating in the area and immediately responded to the scene to escort M/V Stena Imperative with defensive air support from the U.S. Air Force. The situation de-escalated as a result, and the U.S.-flagged tanker is proceeding safely."

"It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela. Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Hopefully, Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal — NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS — one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!"

Independent journalist Don Lemon said about a dozen federal agents came to his Los Angeles hotel to arrest him last week, even though his attorney had told authorities he would turn himself in to face federal civil rights charges over his coverage of an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church.

Lemon told ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel that sending the agents was a waste of resources because law enforcement wouldn't have had to dispatch agents to follow him if he had been allowed to surrender to authorities. 

“I was walking up to the room and I pressed the elevator button, and then all of a sudden, I feel myself being jostled and and people trying to grab me and put me in handcuffs,” he said Monday on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” 

He asked the agents who they were and said they identified themselves. Lemon asked to see a warrant and was told they didn't have it. The agents then summoned an FBI agent to come from outside to show Lemon the warrant on a cellphone. 

The Department of Justice and FBI didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. 

Kimmel introduced Lemon, his first guest of the night, by saying he “was arrested for committing journalism.” 

Lemon's attorney has said Lemon plans to plead not guilty. He told reporters “I will not be silenced” after he was released in response to a judge's orders. 

A grand jury in Minnesota indicted Lemon, another independent journalist, Georgia Fort, and others on charges of conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshippers during the Jan. 18 protest at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.




Fort, in an interview with MS NOW's Rachel Maddow on Monday, said it was “extremely traumatic” for her family when nearly two dozen agents came to her house to arrest her. She has three daughters, and initially thought the youngest two — aged seven and eight — slept through most of it.

“I did find out at some point my eight-year-old woke up but she was so terrified, she just laid in her bed and cried,” Fort said. “Now what we're seeing from them, they're afraid to be alone. They're having issues going through their normal routines. And so we're just — we're trying to recover from this.”

Fort said there's been a strategic attack on the press for some time, but the arrests of her and Lemon takes things to a new level. “I really want American people to understand, attacking the press is not simply attacking journalists,” she said. “It's attacking the public's right to know.”

Lemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023 following a bumpy run as a morning host, has said he had no affiliation to the group that disrupted the Sunday service by entering the church. 

Lemon said he couldn't say much about the case but he said he was not a protester. 

“I went there to be a journalist. I went there to chronicle and document and record what was happening. I was following that one group around, and so that's what I did. I reported on them,” Lemon said. 

Lemon said he asked the arresting officers if they would let him make a phone call. He said he was told no and that he could talk to his attorney the next day. He tried to use Siri on his Apple Watch to call his husband and his attorney but neither picked up. 

A diamond bracelet he was wearing kept getting caught on his handcuffs, which hurt, and the agents told Lemon they would take it off. Lemon said he asked if the agent would mind taking it up to Lemon's husband in his hotel room and they agreed to do that. 

“And that's how my husband found out. Otherwise, no one would have known where I was,” Lemon said. 

Lemon said he was kept in a holding room at the federal courthouse from midnight until 1 p.m. the following day. 

Kimmel himself became a symbol of a fight against censorship last year, when ABC suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for remarks made following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr pressured broadcasters to take Kimmel off the air shortly before that. 

ABC lifted the suspension after a public outcry, and Kimmel returned to the air with much stronger ratings than before. In Congress, Democratic senators raised concerns that Carr's actions trampled on the First Amendment.

            • Government shutdown: The House GOP cleared a key procedural vote on a massive funding bill, putting Congress on a path to reopen the government within hours. It follows a fierce lobbying push by President Donald Trump on Republican holdouts.
    


• Petro in Washington, DC: Colombian President Gustavo Petro arrived at the White House this morning to meet Trump. The visit comes after a yearlong public quarrel between the two leaders over immigration and drug trafficking, with threats of tariffs and sanctions from the Trump administration.
    


            • Epstein files: House Oversight Chair James Comer has agreed to the dates later this month that Bill and Hillary Clinton proposed for depositions in the panel's Jeffrey Epstein probe.
    


            • Trump's call to “nationalize” voting: In comments that are being slammed by Democrats, Trump said Republicans should “take over” elections in at least 15 states ahead of the midterm elections.  



            Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, backed Bill and Hillary Clinton's request to testify publicly to the panel.
    


            “They've also requested that the hearings be public hearings. They just made that request today. I strongly support that. I think the idea of moving that deposition from being a private to public, is good for the for the American people. And I support that,” he told reporters on Tuesday.
    


            The Clintons reached an agreement on Tuesday to appear for depositions before the House oversight committee.
    


            The former president is scheduled to appear on February 27 and the former Secretary of State to appear on February 26.
    


            Fulton Police Department body camera video, obtained exclusively by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, shows a chaotic scene in the hours after the FBI arrived at the Fulton County elections warehouse last Wednesday.
    


            The FBI served a warrant at the Fulton County election office, near Atlanta, Georgia, taking 700 boxes of election materials as it probes alleged voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.
    


            “All right so we were given very limited information,” the unidentified Fulton Police officer told Peter Ellis, acting special agent in charge at the FBI's Atlanta field office after the two men exchanged a handshake.
    


            “So we have a search warrant for this like, one for the like entire location,” Ellis told the officer.
    


            “But now we're getting it, we may need another search warrant for another location,” he told the officer. “So we'll have that soon.”
    


            The Fulton police officer asked if the warrant had to do with “election stuff.”
    


            “Well you know why we're here, right? So we can't, I can't discuss more,” Ellis responded.
    


            Another FBI employee, who is not named in the video, told the officer that the warrant will be adjusted.
    


            The FBI staffer told the Fulton officer that he wanted election warehouse employees to help them unlock gates in the building so they didn't have to “breach it.”
    


            “Because one way or another the records are coming with us today,” he said.
    


            An FBI spokesperson at the scene on Wednesday told CNN that the materials would be taken to the FBI Central Records Complex in Virginia.
    


            Talks between the US and Iran planned for later this week hit a snag Tuesday after Tehran requested they be relocated, that regional participants be excluded, and that the discussions' scope be limited to the country's nuclear program, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The new demands could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions.
    


            The talks had been set for Istanbul, with foreign ministers from Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also expected to attend.
    


            Tehran is now asking for an alternate location: Oman, the small Gulf sultanate that has previous hosted talks between the US and Iran.
    


            Iran is also stipulating the talks be conducted bilaterally, without the other nations' representatives.
    


            And it has requested the scope of the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue. The US has said its demands for Iran extend beyond an end to its nuclear program to curbing its ballistic missiles and ending support for regional proxy groups.
    


            What the changes — first reported by Axios — portend for the diplomatic efforts wasn't clear. Already, some American officials had privately warned that Iran may be using diplomacy to play for time in preventing military action.
    


            The two US participants in the discussions — foreign envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner — arrived in the region on Tuesday for talks with Israeli officials.
    


            Trump said Monday that talks were ongoing but continued to point to the large military buildup in the region as evidence of his willingness to order strikes.
    


            “Right now we're talking to them. We're talking to Iran, and if we can work something out that'll be great, and if we can't, probably bad things would happen,” he said.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday successfully quelled a conservative rebellion within his own party that threatened to block a massive funding bill, putting Congress on a path to reopening the government within hours.
    


            Johnson and his leadership team – with help from President Donald Trump — convinced all but one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, to back the procedural vote on the floor Tuesday. The House will vote on final passage of the funding package early Tuesday afternoon.
    


            Trump and his team leaned hard on those rogue Republicans who had vowed to block the funding bill unless GOP leaders agreed to attach a strict voter ID bill to the package.
    


            House Oversight Chair James Comer has agreed to the dates Bill and Hillary Clinton proposed for depositions in the panel's Jeffrey Epstein probe, putting an end to the contempt of Congress proceedings that had been moving forward against them.
    


            The former president is scheduled to appear on February 27 and the former Secretary of State to appear on February 26 under the terms that Comer had previously set.
    


            Two sources had earlier told CNN that the Clintons agreed to appear for depositions on the panel's terms, but also suggested they wanted public hearings.
    


            Several senior Senate Democrats this morning slammed President Donald Trump's call to “nationalize” elections as an unconstitutional attempt to control the outcome of future elections.
    


Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal argued that “it's grounds for impeachment.”
    


                    “Trump shouts the quiet part out loud,” Blumenthal said in a post on X. “Nationalizing elections would be brazenly unconstitutional & totalitarian—the threat itself deeply chilling (…) America should be afraid, very afraid.”
                





Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, agreed with Blumenthal's warnings, though he did not go so far as to suggest impeachment.
    


            “Outrageous and not unexpected. He's been building up to this. He wants to put his enforcers, whoever they may be, ICE or National Guard, that are loyal to him, at the polling places, to intimidate voters in the next election,” Durbin said.“What it tells us is he's very worried about the outcome of that election.”
    


GOP Rep. Don Bacon also expressed his opposition to the idea. “I opposed nationalizing elections when Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi wanted major changes to elections in all 50 states. I'll oppose this now as well,” the congressman from Nebraska said in a post on X.
    


            Meanwhile, Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley downplayed the president's remarks, telling reporters he believed Trump was pushing for a Republican-led voter ID law known as the SAVE Act, rather than saying that the federal government should administer elections.
    


                    “Everybody understands that the states are in charge of administering the elections. The Constitution says that, but the due process clause, as well as other federal statutes, provide some ground rules about what you can and cannot do, and Congress has been legislating basic ground rules for federal elections since Reconstruction,” he told reporters.
                





            GOP leaders are working their members on the House floor, as a key procedural vote on the funding package to reopen the federal government is underway.
    


            With the full Democratic caucus currently voting against the package, House Speaker Johnson can only afford to lose one Republican vote. The little wiggle room has left Johnson and his leadership team scrambling to win over needed lawmakers.
    


            GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and John Rose of Tennessee cast “no” votes and several members of the conference's right flank were holding out their votes altogether.
    


            Lawmakers can ultimately change their votes until the vote on the rule is closed.
    


            If leaders can clear the procedural hurdle, the House will vote on passage of the government funding package later this afternoon.
    


            Senate GOP Leader John Thune says he supports components of the SAVE Act, a bill to require only citizens to vote and photo IDs at polling places, that some House Republicans have suggested could prompt Thune to change filibuster rules to pass his chamber.
    


            “I'm supportive of, you know, only citizens voting and showing ID at the polling places. I think that makes sense, which is what the bill that is under consideration would do. But I'm not in favor federalizing elections, no,” he said.
    


            Thune said he and members of his conference will discuss the SAVE Act and the desire of some to change filibuster rules at their weekly policy lunch today, but said he's made no commitments to those House members on changes to the filibuster. Some House members said they switched their positions in favor of voting for a massive federal funding bill based on their belief Thune would do so.
    


                    “So, we're going to have a conversation about that but there weren't any commitments made, no,” Thune said.
                





            GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah is advocating changing the filibuster by requiring senators to stand or talk during a filibuster and not simply block action by verbally objecting to moving forward.
    


            But Thune said the complicated rules of the proposal could mean the filibuster “would go on for an indefinite period of time,” possibly two to three months before a final vote.
    


            “It ties up the floor indefinitely. So, it means you're not doing other things. So, there's always an opportunity cost,” he said. “There are some important things that we do want to do.”
    


            Thune did promise to force a floor vote on the SAVE Act, though unless the filibuster rules are changed, it won't get the 60 votes it would need to advance because Democrats strongly oppose it.
    


            “We will have that vote. Exactly when I can't give you a hard answer on that,” he said.
    


            As Colombian President Gustavo Petro meets with President Donald Trump in the White House, get caught up on what led to him being sanctioned last year.
    


            Petro and Trump had public clashes over drugs and migration, and Petro was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department sanctioned in October 2025.
    


            Trump accused Petro of playing a role in the global illicit drug trade, encouraging narcotics production, and of being an “illegal drug leader,” allegations that the Colombian president has repeatedly rejected.
    


                    “Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at the time the sanctions were announced.
                





            The move added Petro to the government's list of Specially Designated Nationals (SDN), which is maintained by the US Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).
    


            The list was established in 1995 via an executive order from then-President Bill Clinton, with the goal of fighting money laundering from narcotics traffickers in Colombia. It is known informally as the “Clinton list.”
    


            The SDN List targets entities and individuals who act on behalf of countries that are adversarial to the US, along with US-designated terrorists and criminals.
    


            Petro's wife and son, and Colombia's interior minister were also added to this list, which includes Russian President Vladimir Putin and Venezuela's ousted former leader Nicolas Maduro.
    


            US President Donald Trump and his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro have started their meeting at the Oval Office, Colombia's presidency said.
    


            They are joined by other officials including US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Colombian Foreign Minister Rosa Yolanda Villavicencio, Ambassador Daniel García-Peña and Defense Minister Pedro Sánchez.

            GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis suggested she's open to a change in leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, expressing concerns about how Secretary Kristi Noem has run the agency.
    


            “I do, and I have concerns just in general,” she told CNN when asked if she's concerned about Noem.
    


            The New York Republican highlighted her efforts last year to restore funding for the NYPD counterterrorism unit after it was stripped due to the administration's sanctuary city policies.
    


            “We worked with the president, got that money restored. But things like that, these, these decisions that are being made, sometimes they are questionable,” she said, adding that sending White House border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis has “really brought down the temperature.
    


            Asked by CNN if Trump should consider a change in leadership at DHS, Malliotakis responded “look, that's the president's decision. I'll just say that's the president's decision, and perhaps he should be looking at all options.”
    


            Malliotakis didn't directly answer whether she has confidence in Noem, but said, “I think that a lot of people question her ability to lead this agency, particularly after what has happened.”
    


            The New York Republican said DHS stripping funds from the NYPD counterterrorism unit was a “horrific decision.”
    


            “Now, I'm not saying she should be necessarily replaced but I think that all options need to be on the table to find the best person, if there's somebody better,” she continued.
    


            President Donald Trump called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting” in an interview with former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino that aired yesterday.
    


            Watch Tapper's take on why Trump's latest effort is about future elections, both for this year's midterms and 2028.
    

President Donald Trump called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting” in an interview that aired Monday. CNN's Jake Tapper explains why Trump is making this push and how it could affect future elections.


            The House is taking a key procedural vote ahead of a final vote on the funding package to end the partial government shutdown.
    


            Known as a “rule” vote, it's a critical step in the process that – if successful – will set up a final vote on the package this afternoon.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday defended President Donald Trump's call for Republicans to “nationalize” elections, but suggested it's unlikely to happen.
    


            “The president is expressing his frustration about the problems we have in some of these blue states where election integrity is not always guaranteed,” he told CNN.
    


            “So we have to, we have to figure out solutions to that problem,” he said, arguing that passing the SAVE Act into law would accomplish that.
    


            He did not say whether he supports the president's calls to “take over” the voting in some states.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday argued that requiring US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to obtain a judicial warrant for apprehensions is an “unworkable proposal” – rejecting a key demand from Democrats ahead of a fight over Department of Homeland Security funding.
    


                    “I'll tell you what the Democrats want to do and what we cannot do, and that is, they want to add an entirely new layer of warrant requirement,” Johnson said during a press conference on Tuesday. 
                





            The House is expected to pass a spending measure that would provide short-term funding for DHS and allow for further negotiations over ICE. Democrats are pushing for reforms to ICE that include officers remove their masks, end roving patrols, tighten parameters around warrants for searches.
    


            But Johnson said Tuesday that Republicans are “never going to go along with adding an entirely new layer of judicial warrants,” a sign that reaching a deal within two weeks before DHS funding runs out will be difficult.
    


                    “It is unimplementable. It cannot be done, and it should not be done. It's not necessary,” Johnson said.
                





            He argued that an administrative warrant, issued by an immigration judge, is “sufficient legal authority” to apprehend an individual in the United States illegally.
    


            He also argued that requiring ICE to go through the process of obtaining a judicial warrant would take “decades” and accused Democrats advocating for this provision of not wanting immigration enforcement.
    


            “The controversy has erupt where if someone is, you know, they're going to be apprehended and they run behind a closed door and lock the door. I mean, what is ICE supposed to do?” he argued.
    


            House Republicans made clear today that while they don't plan on standing in the way of advancing a package to end the partial government shutdown, lawmakers face an uphill battle to reach a bipartisan compromise to fund the Department of Homeland Security and reform immigration enforcement in two weeks.
    


GOP Rep. Eric Burlison, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, said he plans to vote against the bill, though he will not block it from coming to the floor.
    


            The Missouri Republican said he fears losing “leverage” against Democrats in upcoming negotiations over DHS funding, calling it “foolish” to pass a two-week bill to keep the department open while lawmakers attempt to reach a compromise.
    


            “I think in two weeks, it's we're going to be taking a lot of the Democrat demands, because we have no leverage,” he said, adding that he thinks requiring immigration agents to wear body cameras is “pretty reasonable.”
    


Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, who represents a swing state in New York, said she thinks some of Democrats' demands to reform ICE are “reasonable,” and “there is a ability here to come to an agreement where … we can protect our law enforcement, we can protect the immigrant community, and we can protect the safety of the public.”
    


            However, Malliotakis said the “biggest sticking point” is Democratic mayors and governors not cooperating with federal agents and “handing over criminals,” noting her own city's mayor, Zohran Mamdani vowing to protect undocumented immigrants against ICE raids.
    


            “If that was done, instead of, instead of having to go on the street to find these individuals, which makes it less safe for everybody involved, you'd be able to get the individuals directly from the jails,” she said.
    


            GOP leaders have indicated that targeting sanctuary city policies will be a key demand they'll make in DHS funding negotiations.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized President Donald Trump's call to “nationalize the voting,” calling it “dangerous autocratic poison.”
    


                    “Never in American history have we had a president so hostile to democratic traditions. Even worse, never have we had a president who breaks the norms that have made this country strong and held them together for centuries,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday.
                





            His comments come after Trump told Dan Bongino, the former deputy director of the FBI, in a podcast appearance that “Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.”
    


            Schumer also criticized his Republican colleagues for their silence on the issue.
    


            “Republican senators are silent, quaking in their boots that they can never criticize Donald Trump, no matter how outrageous what he says,” Schumer said.
    


            “Republicans ought to fiercely condemn Donald Trump's vicious attacks against our democratic systems. They're not only vicious, they're dangerous,” he added.
    


            Colombian President Gustavo Petro has arrived at the White House for his meeting with US President Donald Trump, following a turbulent year between the two countries.



            Petro arrived at 10:55 a.m. ET in a US Secret Service vehicle bearing the Colombian flag. It entered the White House grounds via West Executive Avenue.
    


            Among the topics both leaders are expected to discuss are drugs and the sovereignty of Latin American countries.
    


            Ahead of the meeting, Petro said he's determined to continue to strengthen bilateral ties. He asserted that both nations share the common goal of fighting drug trafficking “from an approach that prioritizes life and peace in our territories.”

            The US government's counter-narcotics partnership with Colombia is still considered one of the closest in South America despite a public feud the countries' leaders had last year.
    


            Officials at the Colombian National Police's anti-narcotics directorate and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have told CNN they have a close working relationship that includes the exchange of intelligence and having US agents embedded with Colombian forces. The result, they say, is record drug seizures and increased pressure on cocaine producers and trafficking organizations.
    


            Colombian Brig. Gen. Ricardo Sánchez-Silvestre told CNN last month that the country seized 446 tons of cocaine hydrochloride last year.
    


            In recent years, the DEA presence in Colombia has grown to become the agency's largest foreign operation, and agents say that has yielded fruit as Colombia has boosted drug seizures and arrests.
    


            DEA agents highly regard the Colombian National Police, including its specialized DIRAN anti-narcotics unit, which has DEA agents embedded for joint missions, current and former law enforcement officials told CNN.
    


            Sánchez says stopping the cooperation would be damaging to both countries.
    


                    “Well, if this cooperation between our two countries did not exist, criminal organizations dedicated to drug trafficking would definitely be the ones winning. They would strengthen their finances and their armed groups, and that would be catastrophic,” he said.
                





            President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro are scheduled to meet in the White House at 11 a.m. ET today. In October, Trump called Petro a “thug,” but yesterday said he was looking forward to a “good meeting” between the two.
    


            Petro became Colombia's first leftist leader after winning the country's presidential race in 2022. He won by a slim margin after two failed presidential bids in 2010 and 2018, overcoming hesitation from voters who once saw him a radical left-wing outsider.
    


More about him: ﻿Born in the rural north Colombian town of Ciénaga de Oro, he spent his youth in the ranks of a leftist guerrilla movement, the 19th of April Movement (M19) — founded to protest allegations of election fraud in 1970. He was released from military jail in 1987, two years after being detained by police for concealing weapons.
    


            Petro said he later realized that an armed revolution was not the best strategy to win popular support.
    


A key moment: Today's meeting with Trump comes at an important moment for Petro. His government intends to prove to Washington that it has an effective grip on drug trafficking following the unprecedented US military operation in neighboring Venezuela to capture President Nicolás Maduro, whom the US accused of cartel ties.
    


            The US Treasury Department in October had announced sanctions against the Colombian leader, accusing him of playing a role in the global drug trade.
    


            Petro is also aiming to have those sanctions against him overturned. He has repeatedly rejected accusations by the Trump administration, blaming him for the production of illicit drugs that reach the United States.

Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., criticizes House Democrats' calls to abolish ICE, arguing it undermines the Constitution on ‘The Story.'

House Democrats are at a breaking point on whether to support a compromise funding package that would end the government shutdown — or leverage the moment to secure reforms for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

"If they're not going to make any serious reforms, there's just a sense in the House that we're not co-signing on that," Rep Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said of the spending package passed out of the Senate late last week.

But Swalwell's view isn't universal among Democrats.

"Yes," Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, answered simply when asked if he would vote to end the shutdown.

After reaching an impasse over immigration enforcement reforms in the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., cut a deal with the White House last week to advance outstanding spending for 2026 while extending funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for two weeks.

The bill would fund the yearlong needs for the departments of War, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Health and Human Services.

In addition to ending a four-day funding lapse for those departments, it would also give lawmakers time to negotiate over provisions for ICE.

That compromise passed out of the Senate in a bipartisan 71-29 vote.

In its current form, the bill does not include several key demands that Democrats have made in the wake of two fatal confrontations in Minneapolis between immigration enforcement and civilians. Among other elements, Democrats have demanded legislation to end ICE's roaming patrols, strengthen warrant requirement protections, ban masks and require visible identification for ICE agents.

Without their inclusion, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., made it clear he believes the legislation falls short.

REPUBLICANS, DEMS BREAK THROUGH RESISTANCE, MOVE FORWARD WITH TRUMP-BACKED FUNDING PACKAGE

"We've made a clear line in the sand. We've articulated the things that will be necessary for there to be a full-year appropriations bill connected to ICE funding," Jeffries said Monday when asked if he would support the two-week extension.

Even in the absence of key Democrat demands, Cuellar said he thinks the bill is consistent with his previous positions.

"I'm looking at the bills. It's the bill that we voted on with a two-week extension to Homeland [Security]," Cuellar said, referring to legislation that already passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support in January.

Cuellar was one of the seven Democrats who broke with his party to advance the original bill. That package included limited reforms to DHS operations — such as requiring body cameras for ICE agents and additional training on interacting with civilians.

Cuellar said he is holding out hope that additional reforms can be negotiated in the two-week window.

"Hopefully, we can add more things that we wanted," Cuellar said. "We added some things, but we need a lot more. I think the dynamics have changed a little bit. There will be more wiggle room in the future."

Cuellar's view is shared by other Democrats wary of a longer government shutdown — the second government funding lapse in just three months.

Notably, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., also said she would support the spending deal.

"The House should quickly clear those bills, minimizing a lapse in funding that would shutter, at least partially, eight cabinet departments and dozens of agencies within them," DeLauro said in a press release last week.

Democrats approached by Fox News Digital did not speak about how Jeffries and Schumer differ on their shutdown strategies.

Rep. Jarred Moskowitz, D-Fla., did not say how he would vote but pointed out he's not surprised by the divide on an issue as charged as immigration enforcement.

"I think we are at a time where we're out of sync with our Senate colleagues," Moskowitz said. "It happens. House Republicans and Senate Republicans are out of sync all the time."

"It was a deal made with Senate Dems. House Dems were not involved," Moskowitz said of the spending extension bill. "But that's a process thing. The American people care about whether U.S. citizens are being shot in the face."

Moskowitz said he understands why Democrats like Swalwell and Jeffries oppose punting negotiations on ICE.

Moskowitz believes that as the White House begins to pull ICE out of Minnesota and requires its agents in the states to begin wearing body cameras, the pressure Democrats can exert on reforms may be diminished in two weeks as the national focus goes elsewhere.

"It'll become less of a national news story, so it'll be much better to negotiate a deal for the White House at that point in time," Moskowitz said.

The House will vote on Tuesday to advance the shutdown-ending spending legislation. It's unclear how many Democrats may ultimately join Cuellar and DeLauro in supporting the package.

Because of razor-thin margins for Republicans in the House, the legislation may depend on the support of a handful of Democrats amid GOP concerns over DHS, earmarks included in the package, and the lack of voting security legislation.

PARIS (AP) — French prosecutors raided the offices of social media platform X on Tuesday as part of a preliminary investigation into allegations including spreading child sexual abuse images and deepfakes. They have also summoned billionaire owner Elon Musk for questioning.

X and Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI also face intensifying scrutiny from Britain's data privacy regulator, which opened formal investigations into how they handled personal data when they developed and deployed Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok. 

Grok, which was built by xAI and is available through X, sparked global outrage last month after it pumped out a torrent of sexualized nonconsensual deepfake images in response to requests from X users. 

The French investigation was opened in January last year by the prosecutors' cybercrime unit, the Paris prosecutors' office said in a statement. It's looking into alleged “complicity” in possessing and spreading pornographic images of minors, sexually explicit deepfakes, denial of crimes against humanity and manipulation of an automated data processing system as part of an organized group, among other charges.

Prosecutors asked Musk and former CEO Linda Yaccarino to attend “voluntary interviews” on April 20. Employees of X have also been summoned that same week to be heard as witnesses, the statement said. Yaccarino was CEO from May 2023 until July 2025.

A spokesperson for X did not respond to multiple requests for comment. X's lawyer in France, Kami Haeri, told The Associated Press: ″We are not making any comment at this stage.”




In a message posted on X, the Paris prosecutors' office announced the ongoing searches at the company's offices in France and said it was leaving the platform while calling on followers to join it on other social media.

“At this stage, the conduct of the investigation is based on a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French law, as it operates on the national territory,” the prosecutors' statement said.

European Union police agency Europol “is supporting the French authorities in this,” Europol spokesperson Jan Op Gen Oorth told the AP, without elaborating.

French authorities opened their investigation after reports from a French lawmaker alleging that biased algorithms on X likely distorted the functioning of an automated data processing system.

It expanded after Grok generated posts that allegedly denied the Holocaust, a crime in France, and spread sexually explicit deepfakes, the statement said. 

Grok wrote in a widely shared post in French that gas chambers at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp were designed for “disinfection with Zyklon B against typhus” rather than for mass murder — language long associated with Holocaust denial. 

In later posts on X, the chatbot reversed itself and acknowledged that its earlier reply was wrong, saying it had been deleted and pointed to historical evidence that Zyklon B was used to kill more than 1 million people in Auschwitz gas chambers.

The chatbot also appeared to praise Adolf Hitler last year, in comments that X took down after complaints.

In Britain, the Information Commissioner's Office said it's looking into whether X and xAI followed the law when processing personal data and whether Grok had any measures in place to prevent its use to generate “harmful manipulated images.”

“The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” said William Malcolm, an executive director at the watchdog.

He didn't specify what the penalty would be if the probe found the companies didn't comply with data protection laws.

A separate investigation into Grok launched last month by the U.K. media regulator, Ofcom, is ongoing. 

Ofcom said Tuesday it's still gathering evidence and warned the probe could take months. 

X has also been under pressure from the EU. The 27-nation bloc's executive arm opened an investigation last month after Grok spewed nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images on the platform. 

Brussels has already hit X with a 120-million euro (then-$140 million) fine for shortcomings under the bloc's sweeping digital regulations, including blue checkmarks that broke the rules on “deceptive design practices” that risked exposing users to scams and manipulation.

On Monday, Musk 's space exploration and rocket business, SpaceX, announced that it acquired xAI in a deal that will also combine Grok, X and his satellite communication company Starlink.

Sec. Noem spoke with Fox News Digital about the music awards show, saying celebrities don't realize the positive impacts operations make in their respective communities.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem spoke out after Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish and other celebrities bashed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the Grammy Awards, telling Fox News Digital that their criticism is "ill-informed." 

"I wish they knew what wonderful, amazing people our ICE officers are. Many of these officers live in these communities where they are doing enforcement activities," Noem told Fox News Digital during an interview at a Mississippi National Guard facility in Tupelo on Monday. The secretary was visiting the governor, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials and military members in the aftermath of Winter Storm Fern.

"Their families live there and that's their neighbors they are protecting by getting dangerous criminals off the streets. They are going after those murderers and rapists, people that are trafficking drugs, and protecting America," Noem continued. 

"That is what President Trump said he would do, he said he would make us safer, and he has done that. We have reached historic lows in crime rates in this country, the lowest rate of murder and crime since we have been recording it for over 100 years," Noem also told Fox News Digital. "So it's real results, people are feeling it in their communities, and it's too bad that ill-informed famous musicians make statements like that without truly knowing what great Americans our ICE and Border Patrol officers are."

Pop star Billie Eilish was among several celebrities who used the stage at Sunday's Grammy Awards to criticize the Trump administration and ICE.

"No one is illegal on stolen land," Eilish said while accepting the Grammy for Song of the Year. "I feel really hopeful in this room, and I feel like we need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting. Our voices really do matter, and the people matter." 

"And f--- ICE, that's all I'm gonna say, sorry," she added.

            Ifunanya Nwangene, a budding singer who captivated audiences with her performance of Rihanna's “Take a Bow” on “The Voice Nigeria,” has died from a snake bite. She was 26.
    


            The incident occurred at her home in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, on Saturday when she was bitten on the wrist by a cobra while sleeping, according to Sam Ezugwu, the leader of the Amemuso Choir, of which she was a member.
    


            Footage circulating on social media shows a snake handler removing a medium-sized snake from her apartment. Two snakes were extracted in total, Ezugwu said.
    


            “She died in my hands,” said her closest friend, Paschal Nworgu.
    


            Nworgu told CNN he was by her bedside at the hospital she visited after a nearby clinic, where she'd initially sought treatment, informed her that they had no antivenom.
    


            Nworgu said that he'd arrived at the hospital, Federal Medical Center, Jabi, with Ezugwu at around noon on Saturday, two hours after receiving a WhatsApp message from Nwangene informing him that a snake had bitten her.
    


            Upon their arrival, Nworgu said, they'd met her gasping for breath as doctors tried to stabilize her. “She was not talking. She was only giving hand gestures,” Nworgu said.
    


            Ezugwu said that, although Nwangene received one necessary antivenom at Federal Medical Center, Jabi, another needed for her treatment was unavailable at the facility.
    


            “Unfortunately, the one they injected her (with) was the last dose left in the pharmacy of the hospital, so they requested us to buy more,” he told CNN.
    


            The Federal Medical Center, Jabi has disputed that it ran out of antivenom and stood by the care its staff provided.
    


            Ezugwu said he went in search of the antivenom, only to learn of Nwangene's death moments later.
    


            The hospital said in a statement Sunday that staff had “acted promptly and with the utmost care” upon Nwagene's arrival, but it said she was suffering from severe neurotoxic complications.
    


            “Our medical staff provided immediate and appropriate treatment, including resuscitation efforts, intravenous fluids, intranasal oxygen, and the administration of polyvalent snake antivenom,” the statement added.
    


            However, Nwagene “experienced a sudden deterioration” just before being transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, the hospital said, adding that staff tried CPR and “other life-saving measures,” but were unable to save her.
    


            “We stand by the quality of care and dedication our team demonstrates daily. The claims of non-availability of anti-snake venom and inadequate response are unfounded and do not reflect the reality of the situation,” the hospital statement said.
    


            The Amemuso Choir mourned the loss of Nwangene, describing her as “a rising star” who “was on the cusp of sharing her incredible talent with the world.”
    


            Ezugwu paid tribute to her as “an embodiment of music,” highlighting her versatility in both classical and pop genres. Nworgu, who often performed alongside her, shared that one of her biggest dreams was to sing on Broadway.
    


            Recently, Nwangene had completed French classes and left her job as an architect to focus on her music career, Nworgu said.
    


            “I feel dead, I can't count how many times I've broken down,” he said, calling her death “the most traumatizing thing of my life.”
    


            Nwangene's death has sparked widespread outrage among Nigerians, many expressing their discontent with the country's health care system.
    


            Human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong, wrote on X: “The tragic death of Ifunanya Nwangene from snake bite is a reminder of the poor state of healthcare in Nigeria. Emergency medical care in this country is terrible. Her death isn't due to spiritual attack, it's as a result of failure of get quick care.”
    


            In response to the public outcry, Nigeria's health ministry shared the statement from the Federal Medical Centre, Jabi expressing condolences to Nwangene's family.
    


            Last month, Nigeria's Health Minister Muhammad Ali Pate acknowledged that the country's health care system faces “systemic challenges in ensuring consistent quality of care and patient safety” and announced the formation of a national task force to address these issues.
    


            The creation of this task force came after widespread outrage over the death of renowned author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 21-month-old son at a Lagos hospital. The novelist's legal representatives accused the hospital of negligence, a claim that the hospital has denied.

            “Snake bite is a neglected public health issue in many tropical and subtropical countries,” according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which estimates that more than 5 million people are bitten by snakes each year, resulting in about 100,000 deaths annually.
    


            “Most of these occur in Africa, Asia and Latin America,” the WHO said. It noted in a 2018 report that there had been concerns about the “low availability of safe, effective antivenom immunoglobulin products for the Sub-Saharan African region.”

Investigations by Credit Suisse have uncovered hundreds of Nazi-linked accounts at the bank, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, announced Tuesday.

Multiple reports provided to Grassley have identified 890 accounts linked to the Nazi regime, including wartime accounts for the German Foreign Office, a German arms manufacturing company and the German Red Cross, Grassley told reporters Monday.

The new accounts are coming to light after UBS acquired Credit Suisse in a 2023 takeover. The bank then hired U.S. prosecutor Neil Barofsky to identify any Nazi-linked accounts.

Grassley and representatives of UBS will dig deeper into the findings during a Senate Judiciary hearing on connections between various Swiss banks and the Nazis later Tuesday morning.

"We approach today's topic with solemn respect," Robert Karofsky, president of UBS Americas, is expected to say at the hearing, according to a copy of his remarks obtained by NBC News.

"Now, with three years of experience, our priority is to complete this review so that the world can benefit from the findings in the coming final report," the remarks continue.

Grassley's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Tuesday's hearing comes a week after International Holocaust Remembrance Day, during which President Donald Trump's administration reflected on the genocide committed by Nazi Germany during World War II.

"Today, we pay respect to the blessed memories of the millions of Jewish people, who were murdered at the hands of the Nazi Regime and its collaborators during the Holocaust— as well as the Slavs and the Roma, people with disabilities, religious leaders, persons targeted based on their sexual orientation, and political prisoners who were also targeted for systematic slaughter," Trump said in a statement.

"On January 27, 1945, 81 years ago today, Allied forces liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Nazi Regime's largest concentration and death camp in World War II, where over one million people were marched to their senseless deaths," the presidential message, released by the White House, noted.

Trump noted that since returning to the presidency last year he has sought to use the federal government to battle antisemitism.

"After I took office as the 47th President of the United States, I proudly made it this administration's priority directing the Federal Government to use all appropriate legal tools to combat the scourge of antisemitism. My Administration will remain a steadfast and unequivocal champion for Jewish Americans and the God-given right of every American to practice their faith freely, openly, and without fear," he asserted.

﻿We're about to lose our last nuclear arms control treaty with Russia. What does that mean?

Barring a major unforeseen announcement from Washington or Moscow, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia will expire on Wednesday.

It's been a long, slow death for the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which went into force in 2011 to replace the earlier post-Cold War START treaty and place limits on both countries' arsenals of deployed nuclear warheads and launchers. Originally slated to expire in 2021, it was extended for five years after an agreement between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, with just two days left before the deadline.

That proved to be one of the last moments of productive diplomacy between the two countries before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In February 2023, Putin announced that Russia was suspending its participation in the verification measures under the treaty, but would continue to abide by its numerical limits. Now, neither side is bound by those limits, raising concerns of a return to the era of arms races.

The world today is a much different place than it was in 2010, when New START was negotiated. The treaty was a product of the short-lived “reset” in US-Russian relations, during the President Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev presidencies, as well the optimistic era for arms control that followed Obama's landmark 2009 Prague speech calling for a world without nuclear weapons.

Now, the world is on the precipice of what some call a new nuclear age, one in which these weapons are returning to the center of global politics after a post-Cold War lull. Russia has routinely threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine; Trump has called for a resumption of nuclear testing in the United States; and US allies, concerned about the reliability of American security guarantees, are more openly discussing developing their own nuclear capabilities. Meanwhile, the US and Russia still possess the overwhelming majority of the world's nukes — but that could change. China's rapid nuclear build-up is threatening to create a complex “three-body problem” for arms control. And the integration of new technologies like artificial intelligence into nuclear systems could lead to destabilizing new dynamics for deterrence.

It's a pretty bleak picture overall, and the disappearance of the last major arms control agreement binding the world's two nuclear superpowers only makes it bleaker. Still, for all his bluster, and the antipathy he showed to arms control agreements in his first term, President Donald Trump has suggested in the past that he's open to “denuclearization” talks. And compared to other presidents, he's certainly not averse to cutting a deal with the Russians. “When you take off nuclear restrictions, that's a big problem,” Trump told reporters in July, and he hasn't made clear what he's actually going to do once the deal expires.

So, is there any hope for getting nuclear talks back on track, or are doomed to a new arms race? To get some perspective on that question, Vox spoke with Rose Gottemoeller, who, as assistant secretary of state for arms control in the Obama administration, was the chief US negotiator in the talks that led to New START. Gottemoeller later served as deputy secretary general of NATO from 2016 to 2019 and is now a lecturer at the Stanford University Freeman Spogli Institute and a fellow at the Hoover Institution.

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What does New START actually do?

Well, the New START Treaty limited the strategic offensive nuclear forces of the United States and Russia to 1,550 deployed warheads and 700 delivery vehicles — those are missiles and bombers that are used to deliver nuclear weapons. Those basic limits have held now for about 15 years.

As of Wednesday, unless something else happens, and there's no agreement by President Trump and his administration to extend the limits of the treaty, then we will be in a situation where there will be no limits.

Is there any chance of it being extended? 

People have been talking kind of loosely about this, but the treaty cannot be extended. It's a legally binding document, and it goes out of force next Wednesday. But what President Putin proposed back in September was to extend the limits of the treaty for another year in order, as he said, to prepare time for further negotiations.

That's a political handshake. We've done that before. Indeed, when I was negotiating the New START Treaty, START went out of force in December of 2009, and we — on the basis of a political handshake with Moscow — agreed to extend the limits of START for what turned out to be another year plus.

So, what could actually happen now that these limits are no longer in place? 

A couple of things could happen. The United States could quickly announce that it's going to proceed with a campaign to upload its warheads. You could put more warheads on our intercontinental ballistic missiles and on our strategic strike submarines.

Or, maybe, the United States will take some time to make that announcement. [Russian Foreign Minister Sergei] Lavrov and [Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri] Peskov have said that, as long as the United States stays within the limits of New START, Russia will stay within the limits of New START. So, the administration really doesn't need to make any announcement. If it wants to, it can just let the status quo remain.

President Trump has spoken repeatedly about wanting to hold talks about reducing the number of nuclear weapons with Russia, China, and other countries. Is there any evidence diplomacy like that is actually taking place? 

You're right. Even going back to the 1980s, the president has been very interested in nuclear disarmament, and since he returned to office last January, he's been very out there saying that he's interested in what he calls “denuclearization.” He's been very clear that he wants to negotiate with Xi Jinping and with Vladimir Putin to control nuclear weapons, and he's hinted several times, in his recent conversations with those two men, that he's talked to them about nuclear negotiations. But at the moment, I don't see any signs that those negotiations are being prepared. I don't see any signs out of Washington or any diplomatic activity that would suggest that there are some quiet behind the scenes talks going on.

If there were actually serious energy being devoted to this, do you think that it's even realistic we could have meaningful arms control talks with the Russians right now given the war in Ukraine?

“We need to be thinking together with other nuclear armed states about how to sustain nuclear stability going forward, given everything we can see coming at us in the technology race.”

That's certainly the linkage that Putin established in February of 2023, when he declared that Russia would no longer implement the monitoring and verification measures of the treaty. And the Trump administration, at least at the moment, seems to be saying that, yes, until we get Ukraine resolved, we can't really move forward on these new talks with the Russians on nuclear matters.

But I keep reminding people that, in the past, we used to deconflict nuclear negotiations from anything else going on in the relationship. We had a terrible time during the Cold War with severe differences over the war in Vietnam, over the wars in the Middle East, and still, we were able to establish the first detente and agree to the first strategic arms deals with the USSR.

So, historically, we've always said these weapons are weapons of mass destruction. They are existential to human survival. So, they are so important that we need to talk no matter what. I think we could return to that approach pretty easily if we wanted to. We've known each other and been in this business together for a long time.

How does China's rapid nuclear build-up complicate this picture? An argument you sometimes hear is that we need to bring the Chinese into the discussion, because otherwise they will just keep expanding their arsenal while we limit ours.

The first thing I'll say is that, unlike the USSR and Russia, where we've had this 55-year relationship at the nuclear negotiating table, we don't have that with the Chinese, and that creates a different overall comfort level for both sides. We're just not used to talking to each other about these issues, and the Chinese, in particular, have been very, very resistant to discussing in detail what their objectives are with their nuclear modernization.

And I really fault them for that. If they're looking for nuclear weapons and nuclear deterrence to provide them some stability in the relationship, they need to come clean on what their intentions are, because otherwise, there's always a worry about them arms racing and seeking strategic advantage. So, that's an important difference between Russia and China.

I will say, I don't believe that we should try to shoehorn China into nuclear negotiations with the United States and Russia, because the numbers are still too disparate. They have, at this moment, approximately 600 total nuclear warheads. The United States and Russia each hold a total of approximately 4,000 warheads and deploy approximately 1,550. So, the numbers are still vastly different, and that's why I keep saying to people that we have no need to panic about this Chinese buildup.

We've seen it coming. We've received strategic warning that they are doing something different now. So, let's take the time and make the effort to figure out what their objectives are and take control of this build-up so we don't end up with the kind of two-nuclear-peer threat that so worries Washington. That's my bottom line: Let's take a chill pill here. We've got time to work on this problem.

How might new technology — whether it's hypersonic missiles or the integration of artificial intelligence into command-and-control systems — complicate future arms control negotiations or change the type of agreements we might seek going forward? 

I've generally looked at new technologies as an opportunity for the nuclear arms control arena, because I think it can improve the sophistication of how we've done monitoring and verification and accounting for nuclear systems. There are technologies that will help us in maintaining stable nuclear deterrence.

I do worry about what the effects [of artificial intelligence] will be on first-strike stability, and that's why President Biden sat down with Xi Jinping in Lima and agreed to make sure there's always a person in the loop for nuclear command and control decision making. That was an early and important step.

And then, I also worry that the very same technology that improves our ability to find and track mobile missiles could eventually, at some point, be an issue, even for our submarine-based forces.

So, yeah, I think there's downsides and upsides to the technology revolution, and we need to be thinking together with other nuclear armed states about how to sustain nuclear stability going forward, given everything we can see coming at us in the technology race.

The nuclear threat was constantly discussed in the early months following the invasion of Ukraine, when it seemed quite plausible that Putin might follow through on his threats to use nuclear weapons in the conflict. Do you still think that's a concern, or are you less worried about it now? 

I think it's gone way down. There was real concern in our government in the fall of 2022 that the Russian army was being defeated, and therefore, Putin was very tempted to use nuclear weapons. Some have even said there was a 50-50 chance nuclear weapons could be used as the Russian army was fleeing Ukrainian advances in the southeast of the country. I think a couple of things have happened since then.

First, Putin now feels like he's got the momentum. He keeps pressing hard in the Donbas along the front lines. He keeps losing troops, but he's not going away anytime soon. I do hope these talks that Trump and his administration have been pushing can produce results, but Putin's in a much more confident place than he was back at the beginning of the war.

The second thing I think is a really interesting phenomenon, and it's the way both Xi Jinping in Beijing and also Narendra Modi in Delhi pressed Putin back during that period in late 2022 not to use nuclear weapons. Those two men even spoke publicly to Putin in November of 2022 during a summit meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Kazakhstan; they reproved him publicly. And I said, “Wow, that never happens.” They never say anything in public to reprove each other. But both of them stated that nuclear weapons should not be used in Ukraine. So, I do think that that has been effective, and it has perhaps tamped down the nuclear saber rattling among the top leadership.

Looking back over the past 15 years, are there steps that could have been taken so that we didn't get to this point — so that we're not left, effectively, without any arms control between the US and Russia? 

People don't remember this anymore, but you may recollect President Obama was quite ambitious. He had this so-called Prague Initiative. New START was supposed to be the first of several nuclear arms control and reduction agreements that he wanted to negotiate in his time in office.

And, you know, once Dmitry Medvedev was removed from the presidency [in 2012], and Putin stepped back into that role, there was no love lost between Obama and Putin, and Putin simply declared that he was not willing to negotiate anymore with the United States until the limits of New START were achieved in 2018. The treaty entered into force in 2011, and we had the period between 2011 and 2018 to achieve those reductions. And, by saying that, Putin very clearly signaled to Obama: “I'm not talking to anybody — forget about it.”

That was essentially the death of the Prague Initiative, from my perspective. So, yeah, we could have had other agreements in place by this time if that more positive trajectory in the US-Russia relationship had continued. By 2014, with the seizure of Crimea by the Russians, and destabilization of the Donbas, the relationship between Washington and Moscow was sliding downhill fast. And it's only gotten worse over the ensuing decade-plus.

William Foege helped give us a world without smallpox. We're marking his death by letting measles come back.

Had William Foege been a military general or a CEO or a politician, his death on January 24 would have been bold-type, front-page news. Elementary schools and highways would have been named after him.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Instead, Foege's passing registered the way the deaths of many public health giants do: as a quiet tremor among the people who know what they did, and a barely-noticed headline for the rest of us.

Which, perhaps, is the perfect epitaph for his life's work. Foege's greatest accomplishment was that we don't have to think about his greatest accomplishment: developing the ring vaccination strategy that helped eradicate smallpox from the face of the Earth.

It makes sense if you're only passingly familiar with smallpox. The disease was declared eradicated in the US in 1949, and Americans haven't been routinely vaccinated against it for more than 50 years. But smallpox was one of the deadliest viruses in human history, killing an estimated 300 million people in the 20th century alone. For centuries smallpox was simply a background fact of civilization, the way “flu season” is a background fact now — except with grotesquely higher stakes.

The eradication of smallpox, which was formally declared on May 8, 1980, is a civilizational achievement I'd put on par with any other, all the more so because it was a collaborative global effort. Humanity took a disease that had been killing us for thousands of years, one so merciless that it single-handedly destroyed empires, and eliminated it forever. If you asked me to identify the height of what human beings can do when they work together on a single goal, I would point to this.

The cruel irony, though, is that Foege's death comes at a moment when the US government is turning its back on vaccination, and standing idly by while long-conquered diseases like measles come roaring back. And it's happening in part because we've mistaken the quiet of victory — the victory won by Foege and his colleagues — for proof that there never was a war.

We couldn't be more wrong.

Smallpox had been killing human beings for at least 3,000 years; the mummified head of the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses V, who died 1157 BCE, shows evidence of the distinct, bumpy rash that made smallpox so horrifyingly visible. Three in 10 people who contracted the highly contagious disease died, while survivors were often left scarred and even blinded.

So terrifying was smallpox, which was caused by the variola virus, that many religions and cultures had the equivalent of a “smallpox demon,” like India's Shitala Mata. Smallpox was particularly dangerous to children, and in 17th-century England children were even not considered full members of the family until they had survived their smallpox infection.

The war against smallpox is almost as old as the disease itself. A thousand years ago, people in Asia were practicing a kind of vaccination-lite called variolation, deliberately infecting people with a mild case of the disease to guarantee immunity, though the process came with the risk of developing severe smallpox. And smallpox was the first disease to have a formal vaccine: in 1796 the British doctor Edward Jenner developed what he would call a vaccine from cowpox, a very mild version of the disease found in cows, which had the benefits of variolation without the risks.

Yet just having an incredibly effective vaccine wasn't enough to fully defeat the disease, especially in poor countries. As late as 1967 — nearly 200 years after Jenner's discovery — there were an estimated 10 to 15 million smallpox cases and as many as 2 million deaths per year. Even as some human beings were preparing to go to the moon, others were dying of the same disease that had killed pharaohs — and few people thought that would ever change.

That very same year, a previously abandoned World Health Organization effort to eradicate smallpox was revived. Its chances of success, however, seemed slim. Scientists believed that at least 80 percent of every population had to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, but in high-density or war-torn areas like India or Nigeria, that seemed an impossible task.

William Foege made it possible. He was serving as a Lutheran missionary doctor when he began working for the effort in eastern Nigeria, where he and his team struggled to control outbreaks in isolated rural areas and with limited supplies of vaccine. But those limitations inspired him to change tactics. Instead of aiming for mass vaccination, his team prioritized finding people with smallpox, isolating them, and vaccinating their contacts and nearby communities.

The strategy became known as “ring vaccination,” and it was essential to the ultimate success of the smallpox eradication campaign. Foege's team could stop an outbreak in its tracks by vaccinating as little as 7 percent of the population, simply by ensuring they were vaccinating the right 7 percent. Suddenly a goal that had seemed impossible — a world without smallpox — became realistic.

There were other advances that made eradication possible, like the bifurcated needle, which made vaccination campaigns cheaper and easier to deploy, as well as the development of a heat-stable, freeze-dried vaccine that could be stored without refrigeration. And very much unlike today, the smallpox campaign saw geopolitical enemies work together. The Soviet Union supplied freeze-dried vaccine that became foundational to eradication efforts in China and India, while the CDC's Donald Henderson directed the international program.

In 1977, just 10 years after the intensified program was launched, a hospital cook in Somalia named Ali Maow Maalin became the last person on Earth to naturally contract smallpox. (The final person to die was Janet Parker, a medical photographer in the British city of Birmingham who tragically contracted the disease in a lab accident in 1978.) On May 8, 1980, after enough time had passed to be sure, the World Health Assembly declared that “the world and all its peoples had won freedom from smallpox.” A virus that had haunted humanity for thousands of years was gone.

Foege's career didn't end with smallpox eradication. He would serve as CDC director under Presidents Carter and Reagan, and he was instrumental in pushing for global campaigns around childhood immunization. At each stop he was motivated by the belief that, with enough effort, infectious diseases could be rolled back.

As he once wrote: “Humanity does not have to live in a world of plagues, disastrous governments, conflict, and uncontrolled health risks. The coordinated action of a group of dedicated people can plan for and bring about a better future. The fact of smallpox eradication remains a constant reminder that we should settle for nothing less.”

But today, that “better future” seems further off than ever. The Trump administration has overhauled the childhood immunization schedule in the name of “aligning with peer countries,” shifting some shots away from routine recommendations and into murkier, more discretionary territory — the kind of ambiguity that reliably leads to fewer kids getting their shots. As of January 29, the CDC had counted 588 measles cases already in 2026, with the vast majority linked to outbreaks that started last year; meanwhile, kindergarten measles vaccine coverage has fallen to 92.5 percent — well below the roughly 95 percent level that keeps measles from finding oxygen.

We are going in reverse, in part because we've forgotten the past we once lived with.

The point of smallpox eradication — the point of vaccination itself — is that when it's working, nothing happens. No outbreaks, no headlines, no scars, no funerals. But “nothing happening” is not nature; it's deliberate and difficult maintenance. If we want to honor William Foege, we don't need to rename a highway. We need to defend the quiet he helped win — and refuse to relearn, the hard way, what the world looked like before people like him made it safer.

Colombian leader Gustavo Petro says his decertification by President Donald Trump was politically motivated, alleging that U.S. policy in Latin America is shaped by allies of drug traffickers. (Presidencia de la República - Colombia via YouTube)

Relations between President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro have swung sharply from open confrontation to cautious engagement over the past year, setting the stage for a pivotal White House meeting scheduled for Tuesday.

Once considered a model partnership in the Western Hemisphere, U.S.–Colombia ties are now being tested by deep disagreements over drug policy, security cooperation and migration.

Speaking to reporters ahead of the visit, President Donald Trump suggested the tone between the two leaders has shifted in recent weeks, while underscoring that drug trafficking will dominate the talks.

"I mean, he's been very nice over the last month or two," Trump said during a press availability. "They were certainly critical before that. But somehow after the Venezuelan raid, he became very nice. He changed his attitude. Very much so."

LATIN AMERICA FRACTURES OVER TRUMP'S MADURO CAPTURE AS REGIONAL ALLIES SHIFT RIGHT

Trump said he is looking forward to meeting Petro in person, while making clear that narcotics remain a central concern. "He's coming in. We're going to be talking about drugs because tremendous amounts of drugs come out of his country," Trump said. "And I look forward to seeing him. We're going to have a good meeting."

Colombia has long been one of Washington's closest partners in South America, particularly on counternarcotics and security. Bilateral cooperation expanded dramatically under Plan Colombia beginning in 2000, with U.S. military and law-enforcement assistance playing a central role in Colombia's fight against insurgent groups and drug trafficking networks. That cooperation helped stabilize the country and eventually led the United States to designate Colombia a major Non-NATO ally. U.S. officials and analysts say that foundation has eroded in recent years amid diverging priorities and growing mistrust.

Tensions first erupted in January 2025, when Petro initially refused to allow U.S. deportation flights carrying Colombian nationals to land. The standoff prompted Trump to threaten tariffs, travel bans and visa restrictions before Colombia reversed course and agreed to accept the flights. The episode marked the first major rupture between the two leaders following Trump's return to office.

Relations deteriorated further in September 2025, when Petro traveled to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, participated in protests and publicly urged U.S. soldiers to "disobey the orders of Trump." The remarks prompted the U.S. State Department to revoke Petro's visa on Sept. 27, 2025. The following month, the Trump administration announced punitive measures targeting Petro and members of his inner circle, citing concerns about drug trafficking and security cooperation.

Colombian officials denounced the moves as politically motivated. Trump publicly labeled Petro a "drug leader," suspended U.S. aid and threatened additional punitive measures, pushing relations to what observers described as their lowest point in decades.

Signs of de-escalation emerged last month when the two leaders spoke by phone for the first time since the diplomatic breakdown. Trump later described the call as a "great honor," saying he appreciated Petro's tone and looked forward to meeting him in person. Both sides agreed to restart dialogue on contentious issues, including counternarcotics, migration and trade. Colombia subsequently resumed U.S. deportation flights as part of broader efforts to stabilize relations, paving the way for Tuesday's face-to-face meeting.

Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, said the visit highlights how much is now at stake for both countries.

"Colombia remains the most important U.S. partner in South America, but that status is conditional, and lately it's been under real strain, largely because of President Gustavo Petro's tolerance for criminal networks that threaten both Colombian sovereignty and American security," Maldonado told Fox News Digital.

She said the Trump administration's objectives heading into the meeting are likely focused on restoring what she described as "real cooperation" on counternarcotics and security after years of drift.

"Counternarcotics and security cooperation will likely dominate the conversation," Maldonado said, pointing to record cocaine production and what she described as growing tolerance within parts of the Colombian state for criminal networks. She argued that Washington has increasingly treated Colombia as failing to meet U.S. expectations in the fight against illegal drugs.

Maldonado said the administration has signaled it is no longer willing to accommodate governments it believes enable narco-criminal ecosystems.

"What to watch going forward is whether Colombia chooses to course-correct or continues drifting toward the model next door, which blurred the line between the state and organized crime," she said. "Colombia earned its status as a major Non-NATO Ally through decades of sacrifice. That trust has been badly damaged, but it is not beyond repair if Colombia demonstrates genuine resolve against cartels, rejects political cover for criminal groups and realigns clearly with the United States on hemispheric security."

She added, "This visit should make one thing unmistakable: the United States wants a strong, sovereign Colombia. It is in America's best interest. However, it will not tolerate ambiguity when it comes to narco-terrorism, regional security or the safety of the American people," Maldonado said.

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the partial government shutdown amid disputes over DHS funding and the U.S. armada deployed in the Middle East as tensions with Iran grow.

Domestic governance and politics continue even as the world waits for President Trump's decision on how to best defang the reckless and bloodthirsty regime that holds the Iranian population captive. No one not in the rooms with the president and his innermost circle of advisers knows what are the options before President Trump or what our intelligence and military say and how our regional allies actually feel. It is "wilderness of mirrors" time on all things Iran.

The president's resolute actions against Iran and Venezuela in 2025 ought to have earned him enormous credibility on national security decisions, unlike Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, who knew only how to retreat. President 45-47 is not the retreating type. He could, of course, disappoint and do nothing about the despots terrorizing Iranians, thereby forfeiting some, if not all, of that accumulated credit from the past year. But no one can render that judgment yet, although partisans on the left are eager to class him with the 44th and 46th presidents as appeasers. We have no idea how this crisis will resolve, and likely won't for weeks, if not months.

In the meantime, the ongoing negotiations over the appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have gifted President Trump an unprecedented opportunity to turn the deep divisions over illegal immigration into a consensus-building breakthrough, one that will put his second term into the history books without equal in post-World War II history. A domestic "Nixon-to-China" moment stands before him.

Hard-left Democrats are demanding their congressional members push for the effective neutering of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by requiring judicial warrants prior to the detention of immigrants in the country without permission — either because they crossed the border illegally as "got-aways," entered with the consent of the Biden administration as asylum or refugee seekers or overstayed a visa.

GO BIG, THEN GO SMART: TRUMP, ICE AND THE LAW. HOW TO SKIP THE LEFT'S PR TRAP

The Democrats denied that the border could be closed, but Trump has shown it can be and has been. Rather than recognize how badly Team Biden broke the immigration system, now the left now wants to deny ICE the long-standing procedures by which illegal immigrants are deported. The Republicans can never agree to this. If the Democrats shutter DHS for six months by denying the entire department funding, it will be an issue for November.

Voters, however, do not like the dragnet approach to illegal immigrants. They are fueled in their discontent by legacy media misrepresenting every case involving a sympathy-evoking migrant and by the tragedies in Minnesota.

It is pretty easy to see what super-majorities want: the rapid deportation of criminals and violent immigrants — including those not yet convicted but arrested for suspected criminal behavior. Easy to see but very difficult to execute.

DEMOCRATS CAN RUN, BUT THEY CAN'T HIDE: AN IMMIGRATION RECKONING IS NEXT IN 2028

Voters are not generally in favor of deporting hardworking migrants who came here and found work. A very loud but small slice of the right wants deportation of 100% of people in the country illegally, but that policy will boomerang in November.

America is a welcoming country, especially for the law-abiding and hard-working. Now is the moment to continue to demonstrate resolve at the border, focus on who must be deported and, crucially, compassion for specific categories of illegal immigrants determined to build a legitimate life here.

By providing ‘regularization' for a few million of the tens of millions of illegal immigrants in the country, President Trump will again underscore that he is the president who stands for ‘common sense.' 

President Trump should go on the offensive with the immigration equivalent of The First Step Act success from his first term. The president can demand right now that the final appropriations bill taking shape for DHS to maintain the current deportation process —including administrative warrants for detention— while fully funding the Department of Homeland Security, with some additional sections of new law.

THE SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO GIVE PRESIDENT TRUMP A MAJOR OPENING ON IMMIGRATION

He should flip the messaging script and demand of the Congress that this appropriations bill regularize all "Dreamers" — illegal immigrants brought to the country as minors — as well as other discrete categories of illegal immigrants, such as those who can present a record of work and tax returns for 10 years with no arrests, and all illegal immigrants over the age of 50 who do not have an arrest on their records. Immunity from deportation by categories, based on common sense, makes the operational workload of DHS smaller while reducing the political cost of unpopular deportations of low-skilled but dedicated labor that hardly anyone objects to when they are on the receiving end of the services provided by those migrants.

All the Dreamers — which is an "80-20" common sense issue — and other categories of illegal immigrants who should be "regularized," should receive a five year "blue card," a status renewable every five years provided the holder does not violate the criminal law.

The compromise President Trump puts forward should also articulate that there is no path to citizenship for anyone who entered the country illegally and thus the right to vote will never be theirs. This is a bedrock principle as important as the wall along the border: No one should be able to break the law and thereby gain the right to citizenship. Residency on terms of good behavior, yes, but voting and entitlements: No. A hard no.

TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN SPARKS BIPARTISAN CALL FOR ASYLUM FIXES, PROTECTION FOR LONGTIME MIGRANTS

"Regularization" should not be "amnesty" of the sort President Ronald Reagan delivered in 1986, which proved to be a disaster. A grant of regularization to an individual should explicitly bar that individual from qualifying another person outside the country for favorable status in any application for immigration benefits.

Democrats have unwittingly placed illegal immigrants front and center as the only issue presently impeding the ordinary operations of the government. President Trump should take the spotlight the Democrats have created on DHS funding and turn it on to a demand that cannot be rejected. Trump needs to make the Democrats an offer they cannot refuse.

Most Americans are not eager to eject Dreamers or illegal immigrants who have been here for decades working to build their families and the country. Most Americans are also not sympathetic to the millions who rushed the border during the collapse of border controls during the Biden years.

By taking large numbers of illegal immigrants who arrived long before Biden off the target list for deportation, ICE can focus on the actual problem, which is, in the minds of most Americans, violent and usually criminally violent young men as well as illegal immigrants who arrived in the past five years and immediately imposed enormous costs on the social safety net.

President Trump has proven himself completely capable of managing international crises and legislative achievement at the same time. Even as the crisis continues to unfold in Iran, he should demand that Congress do more than fund the Department of Homeland Security. He should also make the bill providing the funds a first step towards a rational set of rules for the tens of millions of people in the country without any right to be here.

By providing "regularization" for a few million of the tens of millions of illegal immigrants in the country, President Trump will again underscore that he is the president who stands for "common sense." He's the president who sealed the border. He can also be the one to finally settle the issue of the Dreamers and long-settled immigrants who have been here for decades and decades working and building lives.

China is banning hidden door handles on all cars sold in the country, becoming the first country in the world to target the feature – which was popularized by Tesla but has for years drawn concern over safety risks.
    


            The hidden door handles are a signature feature of Tesla's vehicles, and the ban comes as Elon Musk's company reports declining worldwide sales and struggles with fierce competition in China, its second-biggest market.
    


            On the outside, electric door handles sit flush against the side of the door, requiring a user to press down on the handle to release the lever; from the inside, riders press a button to open the door again.
    


            Though Tesla is the company best-known for this type of door handle, other electric vehicle makers in China have adopted similar designs, including some models by heavyweights Xiaomi and Aion.
    


            The new policy, which does not single out any specific company, now demands that all cars sold in China must have a mechanical release feature for both interior and exterior door handles.
    


            In a statement released Monday, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology cited “the inconvenience with operating the exterior door handles and their inability to open after an accident,” and laid out specific requirements for how these handles should function.
    


            Exterior door handles should have enough space for a hand to operate its mechanical release from any angle. And interior handles should be “clearly visible from the corresponding occupant's position,” it said.
    


            The new rules come into effect on January 1, 2027.
    


Tesla is looking to redesign its door handles following trapped-passenger reports



            CNN has reached out to Xiaomi, Aion, and Tesla for comment on the new regulations.
    


            The feature has previously come under heavy scrutiny, both in China and elsewhere.
    


            Last September, Tesla said it was looking into redesigning the way to open its car doors in an emergency, after several accidents where passengers were reportedly killed or severely injured in burning vehicles because rescuers could not open them.
    


            Other Tesla owners have reported having to break their own car windows after buckling their children in and then being unable to get in the car again, according to an investigation by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
    


            An investigation by Bloomberg found 140 incidents of people being trapped in their Teslas due to problems with the door handles, including several that resulted in horrific injuries.
    


            Tesla cars do have a manual door release inside the vehicle, for when the regular handles fail.
    


            Similar problems have cropped up in China. Xiaomi saw its stock value tumble last year after a fatal crash involving its sedan killed three people in March – with local media and government-affiliated outlets reporting there had been issues unlocking the car door.
    


            Afterward, the Chinese government tightened rules around the marketing and testing of driver-assistance features.

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) — A federal judge on Monday blocked the end of protections that have allowed roughly 350,000 Haitians to live in the U.S., dealing President Donald Trump's immigration agenda another legal, though perhaps temporary, setback.

U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington granted a request to pause the termination of Temporary Protected Status for Haitians while a lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The termination, which was set for Tuesday, “shall be null, void, and of no legal effect,” she wrote.

“We can breathe for a little bit,” said Rose-Thamar Joseph, the operations director of the Haitian Support Center in Springfield, Ohio.

Reyes said in an 83-page opinion that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on the merits of the case, and that she found it “substantially likely” that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem preordained her termination decision because of “hostility to nonwhite immigrants.”

The judge, an appointee of President Joe Biden, said Noem did not have “unbounded discretion” and was required to consult with other agencies on conditions in Haiti. The ruling cited Noem's own words three days after announcing an end to Haitian protections, calling for a travel ban from Haiti and “every damn country that has been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

While the ruling grants temporary relief to Haitians, the next legal steps were unclear. 




Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin denounced the ruling as “lawless activism.”

“Haiti's TPS was granted following an earthquake that took place over 15 years ago,” she said. “It was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program, yet that's how previous administrations have used it for decades.”

Temporary Protected Status can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary if conditions in home countries are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangers. While it grants TPS holders the right to live and work in the U.S., it does not provide a legal pathway to citizenship. 

Haiti's TPS status was initially activated in 2010 after a catastrophic earthquake and has been extended multiple times. The country is racked by gang violence that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people.

The Trump administration has aggressively sought to remove the protection, making more people eligible for deportation. The moves are part of the administration's wider, mass deportation effort. 

In addition to the migrants from Haiti, Noem has terminated protections for about 600,000 Venezuelans, 60,000 people from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits in federal courts.

“If the termination stands, people will almost certainly die,” attorneys for Haitian TPS holders wrote in a court filing in December. “Some will likely be killed, others will likely die from disease, and yet others will likely starve to death.”

They say the decision to end Haiti's status was motivated by racial animus, and Noem failed to consider whether there was an ongoing armed conflict that would pose a “serious threat” to personal safety, as required by law.

DHS said conditions in Haiti had improved. In a court filing in December, attorneys for the administration said the plaintiffs' claims of racial animus were based on statements “taken out of context, often from other speakers and from years ago, and without direct links to the Secretary's determinations.”

“Rather, Secretary Noem provided reasoned, facially sufficient explanations for her determinations.” they said.

A government notice in November announcing the termination said there had been some positive developments for Haiti, including authorization of a new, multinational force to combat gangs. Noem determined allowing Haitians to remain in the U.S. was against the national interest, the notice said. 

Jerome Bazard, a member of the First Haitian Evangelical Church of Springfield, said it's still too dangerous for many in his community to return to Haiti.

“They can't go to Haiti because it's not safe. Without the TPS, they can't work. And if they can't work, they can't eat, they can't pay bills. You're killing the people,” he said.

Earlier Monday, two dozen faith leaders and hundreds of congregants in Springfield sang and prayed together in support of Haitian migrants who feared their protected status could end this week. They were hopeful that the federal judge might intervene.

Uncertainty over TPS has deepened worries for the city's already embattled Haitian community. 

Trump denigrated the community of about 15,000 Haitians while campaigning in 2024 for a second term, falsely accusing its members of eating their neighbor's cats and dogs as he pitched voters  on his plans for an immigration crackdown. The false claims exacerbated fears about division and anti-immigrant sentiment in the mostly white, working class city of about 59,000 people. 

In the weeks after his comments, schools, government buildings and the homes of elected officials received  bomb threats.

Since then, Haitians in Springfield have lived in constant fear that has only been exacerbated by the federal immigration crackdowns happening in Minneapolis and other cities, said Viles Dorsainvil, a leader of Springfield's Haitian Community Help and Support Center.

Many of the Haitian children in Springfield are U.S. citizens who have parents in the country illegally. Some families are too afraid to send their kids to school, Dorsainvil said. If they are detained, he said, some parents have signed caregiver affidavits that designate a legal guardian in hopes of keeping their kids out of foster care.

Volunteers from nearby towns have offered to deliver food to those afraid to leave home, Dorsainvil said. Others have been stockpiling groceries in case immigration officers flood the area.

Some, he said, have been receiving desperate calls from family members abroad urging them to leave. “They keep telling them that Springfield is not a safe place now for them to stay.”

Lynn Tramonte, executive director of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said the court's “11th-hour reprieve is, of course, welcome. But people can't live their lives like this, pegging their families' futures to a court case.”

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard arranged a call between President Donald Trump and FBI agents who took part in a raid on a Georgia election facility, multiple outlets reported.

Sources said that Gabbard brokered a short call after the raid, which lasted about one minute. On the call, Trump asked a few questions and praised the agents, with one source likening it to a halftime pep talk for players, though he didn't give them any substantial direction.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche acknowledged that Gabbard had brokered the call on Monday in an appearance on Fox News, noting it with approval.

“The president talks to law enforcement all week long, and so the fact that he talked with agents working hard doesn't surprise me, and actually, I love it. It's great,” he said.

Blanche said he didn't have much more information, though he offered up that Gabbard was simply in the area rather than part of the investigation.

After agents raided an election center in Fulton County, the DNI raised eyebrows for being at the site of the operation despite her office not directly overseeing the issue. Trump praised her role the day after, saying she was working to keep elections secure.

“She's working very hard on trying to keep the election safe, and she's done a very good job,” he said of Gabbard. “They got into the votes with a signed judge's order in Georgia, and you're going to see some interesting things happening. They've been trying to get there for a long time.”

DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS ‘I DON'T KNOW' WHY GABBARD WAS PRESENT AT GEORGIA FBI RAID

Democrats quickly cried foul over Gabbard's role, with Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) claiming it was a preamble to an assault on voting rights.

“This is a seismic event. This should have people across the country absolutely shook. This is a huge deal,” Ossoff said. “And here's the thing: This is a shot across the bow at the midterm elections. [Trump] tried to steal power when he lost it in 2020. We have to be prepared for all kinds of schemes and shenanigans. We have to be prepared for him to try to deprive people of their voting rights.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers in a letter Monday that she attended an FBI search of the elections hub in Fulton County, Georgia, last week because President Donald Trump asked for her to be there.

She also acknowledged that she “facilitated” what she described as a brief phone call between Trump and FBI agents who carried out the search but insisted that neither she nor the president had issued any directives.

The letter to top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees marked Gabbard's first detailed explanation for her unusual presence at an FBI search during which agents armed with a warrant seized hundreds of boxes containing ballots and other documents related to the 2020 election in Georgia's most populous county. 

Fulton County, which votes overwhelmingly Democratic, has been a frequent target of the president's ire. He has long insisted without evidence that widespread voter fraud in the county cost him victory in Georgia in his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.

Gabbard's arrival in Georgia raised immediate questions among Democratic officials because the FBI search of the election center was a law enforcement, not intelligence, activity and because the position of national intelligence director is typically focused on foreign threats rather than domestic concerns.

In her letter, Gabbard said her presence was specifically requested by Trump and she accompanied senior FBI officials “under my broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security.”




Gabbard has been central to Trump administration efforts to cast doubt on intelligence community conclusions of Russian interference on Trump's behalf during his successful 2016 campaign, and her presence in Georgia has been feared by Democrats as laying the groundwork for the federal government to assert that the 2020 race he lost was somehow tainted by foreign meddling or to cast doubt on the integrity of future elections.

Gabbard in her letter suggested that election systems are at risk of foreign interference, citing what she said was intelligence showing that electronic voting systems “have been vulnerable to exploitation” that could result in the manipulation of votes. 

She said that in order to “preserve the integrity of our elections, we must understand whether there has been foreign or other malign interference in our elections, and whether vulnerabilities exist in our election infrastructure that could be exploited in future elections.” She did not explain why Fulton County was singled out for scrutiny, saying she had not seen the warrant that investigators submitted to a judge for approval.

Audits, state officials, courts and Trump's own former attorney general have rejected the idea that there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election that could have altered the outcome. The 2024 election that Trump won was also seen as relatively trouble-free at the polls.

Gabbard also appeared to confirm a report earlier Monday from The New York Times that she had helped arrange a call between Trump and FBI agents. It is rare for a president to communicate directly with rank-and-file FBI personnel about specific investigations.

“While visiting the FBI Field Office in Atlanta, I thanked the FBI agents for their professionalism and great work, and facilitated a brief phone call for the President to thank the agents personally for their work. He did not ask any questions, nor did he or I issue any directives,” she wrote.

            President Donald Trump on Monday suggested the Kennedy Center's two-year renovation project could be dramatic — a demolition effort short of a complete teardown, but one so severe that it would leave the Washington building's steel “fully exposed.”
    


            A source close to the center said Trump has very specific ideas about what he wants to do to the building, and those ideas — which have not been publicly released — don't align with the building's current state.
    


            A document reviewed by CNN, which an official said was presented to some appropriators in Congress, contemplates serious changes — including exterior marble and roofing replacements, security and safety improvements, and seating replacement — but does not make explicit that the theater complex could be stripped to its bones.
    


            “I'm not ripping it down. I'll be using the steel. So we're using the structure,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
    


            “The steel will be all checked out because it'll be fully exposed,” he said, estimating the project could cost around $200 million.
    


            The planned two-year closure for construction marks Trump's most dramatic effort yet to overhaul the center after he oversaw its cultural transformation last year. Upon returning to the White House, he quickly gutted its board and installed loyalists, who elected him chair and voted in December to rename the venue the “Trump Kennedy Center” — a move that's being challenged in court. But those changes have also led to slumping ticket sales and dwindling performances as prominent artists have canceled their appearances — which some saw as driving the desire to temporarily close.
    


            One source familiar with the project said all of the planned renovations were outlined and presented to at least some in Congress as part of the $257 million included in Trump's domestic agenda law last summer for “necessary expenses for capital repair, restoration, maintenance backlog, and security structures.” (CNN has reached out to the chair of the Senate committee that has jurisdiction over public buildings.)
    


            But some fear another East Wing situation, with Washington one day waking up to a demolition beyond anything residents had contemplated.
    


            The source brushed off the president's Monday comments as typical Trump hyperbole, and an administration official said there are no plans to tear down any buildings.
    


            The center needed significant maintenance when Trump returned to office in early 2025, according a source familiar, including upgrades to the orchestra pit, bathroom renovations and new HVAC systems. Two sources familiar with the project said there were 10 to 15 years of deferred maintenance.
    


            Early into Trump's second term, the Kennedy Center brought in various experts to discuss potential options for renovations, the first source familiar with the project told CNN, including tearing down the building entirely.
    


            During Trump's first tour of the venue in March, the president asked for options and told officials that he did not want to raze the building but instead wanted to get money from Congress for renovations. Trump made calls to lawmakers on the concept as he traveled back to the White House, and eventually the Kennedy Center was awarded $257 million for operations and renovations.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Kennedy Center for details on the extent of the renovations, including whether any demolition would be required, whether there would be major structural or cosmetic changes, and whether the Reach — an expansion opened in 2019 — will be preserved.
    


            The remodel, a Kennedy Center spokesperson said, “will focus primarily on the deferred maintenance.”
    


            Still, the president's Truth Social post announcing the renovations came as a surprise to many, including some members of the center's board, its in-house musicians, members of the National Symphony Orchestra board, and many staffers, according to four sources familiar with the matter. A source who knew about the decision before Trump's Sunday night announcement said it was kept to a small number of people to prevent it from being leaked to the media.
    


            Trump added in his Truth Social post that the closure would be “totally subject to Board approval,” which is expected to give a rubber stamp given it's made up of his handpicked allies. One source familiar with the process said there have been no communications with the board about any planned vote since the president's post, and it's unclear whether board approval is needed.
    


            Complete closure for two years wasn't always the idea. One plan — referred to by the first source familiar with the project as a “pardon-the-dust initiative” — would have partially shut down theaters during renovations for about five years. The plan was presented to Trump, at least one subcommittee of the board and the head of building maintenance, and renovations began over the last six months — including marble installations, removal of dead trees and the painting of exterior lights and columns.
    


            But there was strong pushback to this initiative within the organization and from the unions, this source said, particularly over how removing certain elements of the theater would impact patrons and acoustics. Internally, some performers and officials were also concerned about the danger of a perpetual construction site.
    


            Trump vocalized his own objections to the “piecemeal” approach on Monday.
    


            “You can't do any work because people are coming in and out,” he said in the Oval Office. “We have a marble man over there. The other day he said, ‘You know, every time I put down a piece of marble, people are stepping on the marble. They don't even have time to dry.'”
    


            Trump went on: “I was thinking maybe there's a way of doing it simultaneously, but there really isn't.”
    


            The announced closure comes as the Kennedy Center has been struggling to sustain the next year of programming.
    


            There was not enough critical mass for a 2026-2027 programming season, spanning classical music, theater, dance, jazz and family events, a source familiar with center's programming said. The season begins in the fall with artists usually announced on a rolling basis between February and April. By this time of year, another source familiar with programming said, it should have been largely booked.
    


            But many of the shows and artists who were in discussions and on hold for the next season pulled out, according to the first source familiar with programming. Internally, some were concerned about lack of audiences, infrastructure and marketing, that source noted.
    


            “The artist boycott across all genres was becoming untenable,” the second source said, and appeared to make “it quite impossible for them to produce a series of any significance.”
    


            Some shows ending the 2025-2026 season are already under contract and have been announced publicly. It's unclear what will happen to those performances, with a scramble to figure it out, according to the second source.
    


            The Kennedy Center did not respond to CNN's request for comment on its plans for subscription holders and whether they might receive a refund.
    


            Staffers are now bracing for more layoffs, one of the sources said, after massive cuts over the past year under Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell, Trump's former ambassador to Germany and a close ally.
    


            On Sunday evening, Grenell sent a note to staff with the text of Trump's social media post and his own brief message.
    


            “We recognize this creates many questions as we plan to temporarily close most of our operations,” he said.
    


            “We will have more information about staffing and operational changes in the coming days.”

The House minority leader says Republicans overreached in Texas, won't flip five seats and now face backlash they "can't ignore" after recent results and Democratic pushback.

Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries unloaded on Republicans Monday, saying they "done eff'd up in Texas," accusing the GOP of overreaching on redistricting and predicting they will fall well short of flipping five congressional seats.

During a news conference at the U.S. Capitol, Jeffries was asked about a recent Texas state senate race in which a Democrat flipped a seat in a district President Donald Trump carried in 2020. Jeffries was also pressed on whether Democrats could win four of the five redistricted congressional seats in Texas.

"Yes, Republicans done eff'd up in Texas, and they know it," Jeffries said. "We knew it months ago, and it's because of a variety of reasons."

Jeffries argued Republicans were never positioned to gain five seats but instead created a scenario in which they attempted to take seats from Democrats, believing there would be no response.

"California responded decisively, and we will pick up five seats as a result of Prop. 50," he said, referring to a California ballot measure that reshaped redistricting rules and boosted Democratic chances in multiple congressional districts. 

"It remains to be seen what happens in Texas, but I can guarantee you they won't win five seats," Jeffries continued. "They're going to struggle to win three based on 2024 performance alone."

Democrats scored another win Saturday when Taylor Rehmet captured a Texas state senate seat in a district long dominated by Republicans. Rehmet, a labor union leader and Air Force veteran, defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss in the Fort Worth-area district.

Jeffries praised Rehmet's campaign, calling the victory decisive.

"It was a shellacking for Republicans in Texas that even caught Ron DeSantis' attention," Jeffries said. "They can't ignore it. Republicans have been losing elections, and Democrats have been winning elections since January of last year."

Rep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, continued to press for criminal contempt of Congress charges against both Clintons Monday evening for defying a congressional subpoena when attorneys for the Clintons emailed staff for the Oversight panel, saying the pair would accept Comer's demands and “will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed late Monday to testify in a House investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the Republican leading the probe said an agreement had not yet been finalized.

Rep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, continued to press for criminal contempt of Congress charges against both Clintons Monday evening for defying a congressional subpoena when attorneys for the Clintons emailed staff for the Oversight panel, saying the pair would accept Comer's demands and “will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.”

The attorneys requested that Comer, a Kentucky Republican, agree not to move forward with the contempt proceedings. Comer, however, said he was not immediately dropping the charges, which would carry the threat of a substantial fine and even incarceration if passed by the House and successfully prosecuted by the Department of Justice.

“We don't have anything in writing,” Comer told reporters, adding that he was open to accepting the Clintons' offer but “it depends on what they say.”

The last-minute negotiating came as Republican leaders were advancing the contempt resolution through the House Rules Committee — a final hurdle before it headed to the House floor for a vote. It was potentially a grave moment for Congress, the first time it could hold a former president in contempt and advance the threat of prison time.




As Comer and the Clintons negotiated over the terms of the depositions, the House Rules Committee postponed advancing the contempt of Congress resolutions.

Comer earlier Monday rejected an offer from attorneys for the Clintons to have Bill Clinton conduct a transcribed interview and Hillary Clinton submit a sworn declaration. He insisted that both Clintons sit for sworn depositions before the committee in order to fulfill the panel's subpoenas. 

A letter from the committee to attorneys for the Clintons indicated that they had offered for Bill Clinton to conduct a 4-hour transcribed interview on “matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein” and for Hillary Clinton to submit a sworn declaration.

“The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” Comer said.

The former president and secretary of state had resisted the subpoenas for months after the Oversight panel issued subpoenas for their testimony in August as it opened an investigation into Epstein and his associates. Their attorneys had tried to argue against the validity of the subpoena.

However, as Comer threatened to begin contempt of Congress proceedings, the Clintons started negotiating towards a compromise. The Republican-controlled Oversight committee advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges last month. Nine of the committee's 21 Democrats joined Republicans in support of the charges against Bill Clinton as they argued for full transparency in the Epstein investigation. Three Democrats also supported advancing the charges against Hillary Clinton.

Bill Clinton's relationship with Epstein has reemerged as a focal point for Republicans amid the push for a reckoning over Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell as he faced sex trafficking charges.

Clinton, like a bevy of other high-powered men, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with the late financier.

The Clintons have remained highly critical of Comer's decision, saying he was bringing politics into the investigation while failing to hold the Trump administration accountable for delays in producing the Department of Justice's case files on Epstein.

“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” a spokesperson for the Clintons, Angel Ureña, said in response to Comer's threats on Monday. “They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care.”

Still, the prospect of a vote raised the potential for Congress to use one of its most severe punishments against a former president for the first time. Historically, Congress has given deference to former presidents. None has ever been forced to testify before lawmakers, although a few have voluntarily done so.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said earlier Monday that his caucus would have a discussion on the contempt resolutions later in the week but remained noncommittal on whipping votes against them.

Jeffries said he was a “hard no” on contempt and accused Comer of focusing on political retribution rather than investigating the delayed release of case files. Democrats also say the Justice Department has not yet released all the material it has on the late financier.

“They don't want a serious interview, they want a charade,” Jeffries said.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Justice Department said Monday that it had withdrawn several thousand documents and “media” related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein after lawyers told a New York judge that the lives of nearly 100 victims had been “turned upside down” by sloppy redactions in the government's latest release of records.

The exposed materials include nude photos showing the faces of potential victims as well as names, email addresses and other identifying information that was either unredacted or not fully obscured.

The department blamed it on “technical or human error.”

In a letter to the New York judges overseeing the sex trafficking cases brought against Epstein and confidant Ghislaine Maxwell, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton wrote that the department had taken down nearly all materials identified by victims or their lawyers, along with a “substantial number” of documents identified independently by the government.

Clayton said the department has “revised its protocols for addressing flagging documents” after victims and their lawyers requested changes. Documents are promptly pulled down when flagged by victims, then evaluated before a redacted version of the document can be reposted, “ideally within 24 to 36 hours.”

Two lawyers for Epstein victims wrote the court Sunday seeking “immediate judicial intervention” because of what they described as thousands of instances when the government had failed to redact names and other personally identifying information.




Eight women who identify as Epstein victims added comments to the letter to Judge Richard M. Berman. One wrote that the records' release was “life threatening.” Another said she'd gotten death threats after 51 entries included her private banking information, forcing her to try to shut down her credit cards and accounts.

“There is no conceivable degree of institutional incompetence sufficient to explain the scale, consistency, and persistence of the failures that occurred — particularly where the sole task ordered by the Court and repeatedly emphasized by DOJ was simple: redact known victim names before publication,” the lawyers, Brittany Henderson and Brad Edwards, wrote.

Berman, who presided over Epstein's sex trafficking case, scheduled a conference for Wednesday.

Also Monday, a section of the Justice Department's Epstein files website that had contained public court records from Epstein and Maxwell's criminal cases and civil lawsuits was no longer functioning.

A message seeking comment on the website issue was left for the Justice Department.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in an interview Sunday on ABC's “This Week” that there have been sporadic errors in redacting, or blacking out, sensitive information but that the Justice Department has tried to work quickly to address them.

“Every time we hear from a victim or their lawyer that they believe that their name was not properly redacted, we immediately rectified that. And the numbers we're talking about, just so the American people understand, we're talking about .001 percent of all the materials,” Blanche said.

Dozens of Associated Press reporters analyzing the files have so far found multiple occasions where a name was redacted in one document, only to be left exposed in another version of the same file.

In other places, names and email addresses are crossed out but not fully blackened out, so they're still visible. Other text redactions can be easily overridden by simply double clicking on them to reveal the hidden text underneath.

The Justice Department has said all nude or pornographic images were redacted from the 2,000-some videos and 180,000 images in the release, even if they were commercially produced, as the agency considered all women depicted in the images as potential victims.

But reporters with The New York Times still found dozens of uncensored photos of naked young people with their faces unredacted.

The newspaper said the images have since been largely removed or redacted after it notified the Justice Department. It said some of the images appeared to have been taken on the beach at Epstein's private Caribbean island while others are in a bedroom setting.

In another instance, the AP found a set of more than 100 images of a young, unidentified female lounging on a bed, standing on a beach and at other summertime locations while wearing a short top.

The images are almost fully blacked out so only the person's arms and legs are clearly visible, save for the very last image, a profile photo that is completely unredacted and reveals her face.

Elsewhere in the files, the face of one of Epstein's alleged underage victims was clearly shown on an organizational chart created by federal investigators.

The poor redactions didn't just involve victim information.

One email showed Epstein's entire credit card number, expiration date and security code. An interview transcript from the investigation into Epstein's suicide included a jail worker's full Social Security number and date of birth. Some email addresses were visible under thin cross-outs.

At an unrelated sex trafficking trial in New York on Monday, lawyers for two high-end real estate brokers and their brother asked for a mistrial because their names had appeared in some of the Epstein documents.

Deanna Paul, a defense lawyer at the trial of Tal, Oren and Alon Alexander, said prosecutors had “destroyed the possibility of a fair trial” by letting documents get out that falsely suggested an association with Epstein. The brothers have pleaded not guilty to drugging and raping multiple girls and women from 2008 to 2021. They aren't accused of having anything to do with Epstein's abuse of underage girls.

Judge Valerie E. Caproni rejected the mistrial request after she individually questioned jurors, all of whom said they hadn't seen any news about the brothers. Still, she confronted a prosecutor about the matter, asking, “Government, really?”

“Yes, I understand where the court's coming from,” replied Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Espinosa. 

She said the documents had been withdrawn from public circulation.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) bashed Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, over her vow to arrest anyone who entered Washington, D.C., with a firearm.

In an appearance on Fox News, Pirro voiced a tough stance on gun possession amid a wider discussion on homicide and gun violence in the district. Massie took issue with her stance, specifically her vow to arrest anyone with a gun in the District.

“The District of Columbia has been ‘shall issue' since 2017 when the requirement that you must have a ‘good reason' to carry a handgun was struck down. Non-residents can obtain a permit in DC — don't ask me how I know,” Massie said in a post on X, hinting that he owned a gun while residing in the district.

The Monday comments from Pirro came as a shock to many, given the Trump administration's previous outspoken stance in favor of gun rights.

“You bring a gun into the district, you mark my words: You're going to jail. I don't care if you have a license in another district and I don't care if you're a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else. You bring a gun into this district, count on going to jail and hope you get the gun back. And that makes all the difference,” Pirro said.

MASSIE SAYS CARRYING GUN ‘NOT A DEATH SENTENCE' AS TRUMP OFFICIALS DEFEND PRETTI SHOOTING

Her comments are a departure from her previous vehement opposition to gun control laws, especially during her time as a Fox News commentator. In March 2024, she condemned the Biden administration for trying to pursue gun control laws, saying, “Criminals don't care what laws you pass.”

Her recent rhetoric prior to Monday was about pursuing a crackdown on illegal firearms in Washington, which she blamed for a prior rise in homicides.

The U.S. military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that flew toward the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea.

The incident occurred as tensions in the Middle East are high with President Donald Trump weighing potential military strikes against the Islamic Republic.   

The Shahed-139 drone "aggressively approached" the aircraft carrier with "unclear intent," U.S. Central Command spokesman Capt. Tim Hawkins told CNBC in a statement.

The Abraham Lincoln was about 500 miles from Iran's southern coast when the unmanned aircraft "unnecessarily maneuvered" toward the ship, Hawkins said. U.S. forces were operating in international waters and took de-escalatory measures, but the drone continued to fly toward the aircraft carrier, he said. 

An F-35 warplane from the Abraham Lincoln shot down the drone "in self defense to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board," Hawkins said. No U.S. personnel were harmed and no U.S. equipment was damaged, he said. 

U.S. crude oil prices were up more than 1% at 2:32 p.m. ET. 

Hours after the drone was shot down, Iranian forces harassed a U.S. flagged and crewed merchant vessel that was lawfully transiting the Strait of Hormuz, Hawkins said. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces threatened to board and seize the M/V Stena Imperative, he said.

A U.S. guided missile destroyer intervened, de-escalated the situation and the merchant vessel is now proceeding safely, Hawkins said.

Trump has deployed the Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East as he threatens Iran with strikes if it does not negotiate a deal over its nuclear program. The president threatened to hit the Islamic Republic during mass demonstrations against the regime last month but ultimately held back from strikes. 

The incidents Tuesday come as Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to have discussions with Iranian officials later this week. Those conversations are still scheduled to take place, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News in an interview. 

"As for the president, he remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first," Leavitt said. "But in order for diplomacy to work of course it takes two to tango. You need a willing partner to engage." 

Leavitt said Trump "always has a range of options on the table and that includes the use of military force."

The Trump administration's new minerals stockpile initiative — dubbed "Project Vault" — can include anything identified as "critical" by the U.S. Geological Survey, a White House official told CNBC Tuesday. 

The agency, part of the Interior Department, lists more than 50 minerals as critical. These include rare earths, lithium, uranium and copper and are deemed "essential for national security, economic stability and supply chain resilience." The minerals are crucial because they "underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy," according to USGS. 

President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled "Project Vault," which is a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership. The U.S. Export-Import Bank will provide $10 billion in the form of a loan, with about $2 billion coming from private capital. 

"You're covering everything with this," Trump said during an event at the White House on Monday. "We're not just doing certain minerals and rare earths. We're doing everything."

Equipment manufacturers including GE Vernova, Western Digital and Boeing have expressed interest, said EXIM Bank Chairman John Jovanovic in a statement Monday. General Motors CEO Mary Barra attended the White House event that unveiled the stockpile.

"Having a resilient supply chain is critical for our nation, and it's critical for all industry, especially the auto industry," Barra said at the White House. Beyond autos, critical minerals are key inputs for the defense, robotics, semiconductor, electronics and energy industries.

The stockpile is the latest move by the Trump administration to build a Western supply chain to counter China's dominance in critical minerals — especially when it comes to refining. Beijing sought to cut off exports of rare earths, a subset of critical minerals, last year during trade disputes with the U.S.  

The U.S. stockpile will source the minerals at home and abroad, Jovanovic told CNBC in an interview Tuesday. "We have a network of warehouse facilities in which it's going to be stored in the United States," he said. 

The EXIM Bank is talking to companies who want to leverage the reserve to bring their projects to a financial close and commercial operations date, Jovanovic said. 

The stockpile is part of a broader Trump administration strategy. It has also taken equity stakes in several mining companies in an effort to bolster them against state-backed competition in China. 

The Pentagon inked a landmark deal last July with rare-earth miner MP Materials that included an equity stake, price floor and offtake agreement. The Commerce Department last week announced plans to finance the startup critical-mineral company USA Rare Earth in exchange for an ownership stake, subject to certain closing conditions. The administration has also taken stakes in Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals. 

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said last April that the U.S. is also considering a sovereign risk insurance fund that would protect companies' investments in mining projects from cancellation by future U.S. administrations. 

"Those three things would put us in the game around critical minerals — the stockpiling, the sovereign risk insurance and the ability to take an equity position. We're working on all three of those," Burgum said at a conference in Oklahoma City last year.

President Donald Trump announced a U.S. trade deal with India on Monday which he said includes a promise from India to stop buying Russian oil and potentially buy from the U.S. and Venezuela, but data shows the shadow fleet of tankers moving sanctioned crude continues to unload at Indian ports.

Global data and analytics firm Kpler's vessel tracking shared with CNBC shows four tankers associated with Russia's shadow fleet unloading or in the process of unloading sanctioned oil at Indian ports: the Giannis, unloading Urals at Chennai Refinery; the Nyxora, unloading Urals at Paradip Refinery; the Tiburon, unloading Urals at Vadinar Refinery; and the Seasons I, which is being tracked outside Vadinar on Tuesday morning but was yet to unload, according to Kpler.

In recent months, the global shadow fleet moving sanctioned oil, estimated to be as large as 1,400 vessels, has navigated around the tightening U.S. enforcement campaign on Venezuela and Iranian oil, and Europe's interventions against the increasing flow of stateless tankers loading Russian crude. 

A recent Lloyd's List analysis on the global shadow fleet after the U.S. military actions in Venezuela found that out of the approximately 50 tankers that were full of Venezuelan oil, at least five tankers completed deliveries to China with the vessel's Automatic Identification System (AIS) operating normally, and suggesting "the enforcement pressure has yet to bite." 

The U.S. recently completed its first sales of Venezuelan oil in the legal crude market.

Sanctioned Russian crude has also faced increasing enforcement measures. Recently, the French seized the tanker Grinch, which departed Murmansk earlier this month with a cargo of Russian oil. The French, with British assistance in tracking and monitoring, boarded the vessel to conduct a flag verification. The flag of the Comoros Islands has been deemed false. This seizure was the first instance of the EU-UK plan to interdict Russia's shadow fleet. The sanctioning and seizure of the Russian shadow fleet is one of the efforts to cut Russian energy revenue to reduce Moscow's ability to pursue its war in Ukraine.

India's imports of Russian oil have reached a record level this year.

"In 2025, India's oil imports from Russia made up 33% of the country's total seaborne oil imports and 25 percent of Russia's seaborne oil exports," said Niels Rasmussen, chief shipping analyst at Bimco. "A new trade agreement between the U.S. and India could, according to U.S. President Donald Trump, put an end to that trade," he said. 

But Kremlin officials have pushed back, telling reporters they have not officially heard from India about any suspension of oil purchases by the Indian government.

India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has also yet to publicly confirm the terms of the trade deal Trump announced, though Indian officials have said an announcement will be coming. Trump's announcement of the trade deal came days after the E.U. and India signed a major trade agreement slashing tariffs to zero on many goods over a number of years.

The Trump administration has been pressuring India during the trade war to stop buying Russian oil, and Trump said on Monday India should purchase oil from the U.S. or Venezuela. Even if it does stop importing Russian crude, Rasmussen says it could instead purchase more oil from the Persian Gulf. 

Before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, up to two-thirds of India's crude oil and oil product imports arrived from the Persian Gulf. In 2025, these crude imports had fallen to 45%, according to Bimco.

Rasmussen said he would not expect Russian oil exports to fall by a similar amount as Russia will likely aim to find new buyers, even if it requires a higher rebate to buyers of Russian oil. The shadow fleet often has to sell at a discount, and those discounts may increase as global enforcement measures tighten. Russian crude, because it is sanctioned, already trades at a lower price than crude sold on the public markets.

Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, said if India does close the door on Russian oil, it will give other buyers of last resort more market power. "That could pressure Russian receipts to the downside. Barrels generally find a buyer. The question is the price," he said.

But some analysts caution that a smaller market for Russian oil could make it harder for the shadow fleet to find additional employment in its bid to replace India. 

"The only major country left to purchase Russian oil is China, and they may already have all the Russian oil that they want," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.

With less crude oil out of Venezuela to feed the dark fleet and the Indian market potentially shut down, Lipow says many of those vessels may be idled or ultimately be scrapped. 

But Book says the global shadow fleet is fungible, and if there is an opportunity to move sanctioned oil, the owners of these vessels will take advantage of it, with Venezuela an example. "The shadow fleet moves from one area of demand to another, and as long as sanctions remain in place against other major producing exporters, you can expect that there will still be some shadow vessels being used," he said. "The tankers that were in Venezuelan trade would now go into Iranian and Russian trade."

Despite the sanctioned crude crackdown, Russia has been quickly adding to its shadow fleet, reflagging vessels that once moved Venezuelan oil. In December, 17 sanctioned vessels were reflagged to Russia. One of the tankers seized by the U.S. in the blockade of Venezuelan oil was a recently reflagged Russian vessel.

Oil analysts say with the discounted sanctioned oil a separate market from conventional above-board crude oil commerce, all of the enforcement actions and tariffs continue to change the economics of the crude shipments. "The overall trade between nations matters," Book said. "We are seeing oil flows have shifted locations through sanctions and then shifted again through tariffs. There will be logistical costs associated with these shifts." 

The higher costs come from shipping petroleum longer distances, as well as through intermediaries to circumvent sanctions. A prime example Book gave was the transport of Russian oil, which previously went to Europe, and is now often bound for China.

Book explained that economics in the oil refining business, where margins are tight, favor discounted sanctioned oil. "Discounts are extremely attractive to refiners," he said, and that means the barrels of sanctioned oil being moved by the dark fleet "are going to find a home. As long as there are sanctions in place, sanctions circumvention and workarounds are likely," Book added. 

These workarounds end up being a plus for China, which is the primary buyer of Russian and Iranian crude. "The more fraught a barrel becomes, the more it generates a profit for its buyer and a discount for its seller. China is probably going to continue looking for distressed discounted barrels," Book said.

Lloyd's Shadow Fleet Tracker, which covers the roughly 1,400 vessels that predominantly move sanctioned Russian oil, shows there has been an increasing flow of stateless tankers loaded with Russian oil, anchored in the waters of Malaysia. The increase continues despite the government's pledge to shut it down. Malaysia has a trade agreement with the U.S. that restricts dealings with sanctioned entities.

Maritime intelligence from Kpler shows that the pressure of the U.S. brokering Venezuelan oil trades, and the existing sanctions on Russia and Iran, are forcing more of these vessels to conduct ship-to-ship transfers as part of their efforts to go dark when moving sanctioned oil. 

"It is clear that there are still avid buyers of this sanctioned oil, namely China and India," said Jean‑Charles Gordon, vice president of maritime and logistics at Kpler. "China consumes half of the Iranian oil."

In 2025, 251 vessels were loaded with sanctioned Iranian oil — 217 of those vessels (86%) are sanctioned, the vessels are targeted by a government identifying them in moving the illicit oil, according to Kpler data. The remaining 34 vessels are in the active shadow fleet, which moves the sanctioned crude through deceptive practices. The majority of these vessels (96%) conducted dark ship-to-ship transfers; 77% spoofed their vessel location; and 72% turned off their vessel location beacons for prolonged stretches of time.

In 2025, there were 510 vessels loaded with sanctioned Russian oil, according to Kpler. Among those, 305, or 59% of the fleet, were sanctioned. Another 86 vessels representing roughly 17% of the total fleet would be considered "shadow fleet." These vessels also engaged in spoofing vessel locations and prolonged AIS gaps.

"The dark fleet isn't disappearing, it's becoming more offshore, more fragmented, and more behaviorally extreme," Gordon said.

President Donald Trump announced a U.S. trade deal with India on Monday which he said includes a promise from India to stop buying Russian oil and potentially buy from the U.S. and Venezuela, but data shows the shadow fleet of tankers moving sanctioned crude continues to unload at Indian ports.

Global data and analytics firm Kpler's vessel tracking shared with CNBC shows four tankers associated with Russia's shadow fleet unloading or in the process of unloading sanctioned oil at Indian ports: the Giannis, unloading Urals at Chennai Refinery; the Nyxora, unloading Urals at Paradip Refinery; the Tiburon, unloading Urals at Vadinar Refinery; and the Seasons I, which is being tracked outside Vadinar on Tuesday morning but was yet to unload, according to Kpler.

In recent months, the global shadow fleet moving sanctioned oil, estimated to be as large as 1,400 vessels, has navigated around the tightening U.S. enforcement campaign on Venezuela and Iranian oil, and Europe's interventions against the increasing flow of stateless tankers loading Russian crude. 

A recent Lloyd's List analysis on the global shadow fleet after the U.S. military actions in Venezuela found that out of the approximately 50 tankers that were full of Venezuelan oil, at least five tankers completed deliveries to China with the vessel's Automatic Identification System (AIS) operating normally, and suggesting "the enforcement pressure has yet to bite." 

The U.S. recently completed its first sales of Venezuelan oil in the legal crude market.

Sanctioned Russian crude has also faced increasing enforcement measures. Recently, the French seized the tanker Grinch, which departed Murmansk earlier this month with a cargo of Russian oil. The French, with British assistance in tracking and monitoring, boarded the vessel to conduct a flag verification. The flag of the Comoros Islands has been deemed false. This seizure was the first instance of the EU-UK plan to interdict Russia's shadow fleet. The sanctioning and seizure of the Russian shadow fleet is one of the efforts to cut Russian energy revenue to reduce Moscow's ability to pursue its war in Ukraine.

India's imports of Russian oil have reached a record level this year.

"In 2025, India's oil imports from Russia made up 33% of the country's total seaborne oil imports and 25 percent of Russia's seaborne oil exports," said Niels Rasmussen, chief shipping analyst at Bimco. "A new trade agreement between the U.S. and India could, according to U.S. President Donald Trump, put an end to that trade," he said. 

But Kremlin officials have pushed back, telling reporters they have not officially heard from India about any suspension of oil purchases by the Indian government.

India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has also yet to publicly confirm the terms of the trade deal Trump announced, though Indian officials have said an announcement will be coming. Trump's announcement of the trade deal came days after the E.U. and India signed a major trade agreement slashing tariffs to zero on many goods over a number of years.

The Trump administration has been pressuring India during the trade war to stop buying Russian oil, and Trump said on Monday India should purchase oil from the U.S. or Venezuela. Even if it does stop importing Russian crude, Rasmussen says it could instead purchase more oil from the Persian Gulf. 

Before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, up to two-thirds of India's crude oil and oil product imports arrived from the Persian Gulf. In 2025, these crude imports had fallen to 45%, according to Bimco.

Rasmussen said he would not expect Russian oil exports to fall by a similar amount as Russia will likely aim to find new buyers, even if it requires a higher rebate to buyers of Russian oil. The shadow fleet often has to sell at a discount, and those discounts may increase as global enforcement measures tighten. Russian crude, because it is sanctioned, already trades at a lower price than crude sold on the public markets.

Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, said if India does close the door on Russian oil, it will give other buyers of last resort more market power. "That could pressure Russian receipts to the downside. Barrels generally find a buyer. The question is the price," he said.

But some analysts caution that a smaller market for Russian oil could make it harder for the shadow fleet to find additional employment in its bid to replace India. 

"The only major country left to purchase Russian oil is China, and they may already have all the Russian oil that they want," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.

With less crude oil out of Venezuela to feed the dark fleet and the Indian market potentially shut down, Lipow says many of those vessels may be idled or ultimately be scrapped. 

But Book says the global shadow fleet is fungible, and if there is an opportunity to move sanctioned oil, the owners of these vessels will take advantage of it, with Venezuela an example. "The shadow fleet moves from one area of demand to another, and as long as sanctions remain in place against other major producing exporters, you can expect that there will still be some shadow vessels being used," he said. "The tankers that were in Venezuelan trade would now go into Iranian and Russian trade."

Despite the sanctioned crude crackdown, Russia has been quickly adding to its shadow fleet, reflagging vessels that once moved Venezuelan oil. In December, 17 sanctioned vessels were reflagged to Russia. One of the tankers seized by the U.S. in the blockade of Venezuelan oil was a recently reflagged Russian vessel.

Oil analysts say with the discounted sanctioned oil a separate market from conventional above-board crude oil commerce, all of the enforcement actions and tariffs continue to change the economics of the crude shipments. "The overall trade between nations matters," Book said. "We are seeing oil flows have shifted locations through sanctions and then shifted again through tariffs. There will be logistical costs associated with these shifts." 

The higher costs come from shipping petroleum longer distances, as well as through intermediaries to circumvent sanctions. A prime example Book gave was the transport of Russian oil, which previously went to Europe, and is now often bound for China.

Want to use Grindr's AI products? You might have to cough up almost $500 a month.

Grindr is in early testing for a new, higher-priced subscription tier called "Edge," the company confirmed to Business Insider. The company has already piloted this tier in Australia and New Zealand, and is now bringing it to select American cities.

As part of this testing, Grindr is trying different price points that vary from user to user. Test pricing starts at $80 a week and goes into the hundreds.

Screenshots posted online show monthly subscription rates of $349.99 and $499.99. At those prices, one year of Grindr Edge would cost between $4,199.88 and $5,999.88.

"This early-stage pilot is part of our broader strategy to make Grindr smarter, faster, and drive more meaningful connections," a Grindr representative wrote to Business Insider.

So what does spending that much get you?

The three main AI features of Edge will be Discover (personalized matches), Insights (a "signal before messaging"), and A-List (a recommendation feed for old chats). It also includes all the features of Grindr Unlimited — currently Grindr's most expensive tier — including no third-party advertisements.

For reference, Grindr Unlimited's price varies user-to-user, but the App Store lists monthly costs between $27.99 and $44.99. That's hundreds of dollars less than the Edge test price points.

Grindr's competitors also change prices user-to-user, making a direct comparison difficult. On my own accounts, I found that Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble's most expensive tiers all landed under $100, at $49.99, $54.99, and $99.99 a month, respectively.

Edge is another step toward Grindr's mission of bringing "gAI" — pronounced "gay-I" — to its nearly 15 million monthly active users.

The pilot comes as Grindr needs momentum. The app company's stock, which spent over two years largely ticking up after a post-IPO drop-off, is now on the decline, down 38.06% in the last six months.

Michael Burry is forewarning of a new type of financial catastrophe — one that could happen if bitcoin doesn't break its nosedive.

In a new Substack post, the investor of "The Big Short" fame pointed to bitcoin's deepening bear market and said he believed there could be serious consequences if the price of the crypto were to continue to fall.

His warning is coming during a rough time for bitcoin investors. The crypto finished January with its fourth straight month of losses, marking the token's longest losing streak since 2018. The coin is also down around 37% from its peak last year.

Markets are already seeing some consequences from bitcoin's rout, Burry suggested. The former fund manager said he believed the plunge in gold and silver prices last week was partly brought on by the decline in bitcoin, and made the case that the two assets were connected as metals futures contracts aren't backed by the physical asset itself, similar to how crypto is tokenized.

"Sickening scenarios have now come within reach," Burry said, outlining three other consequences in particular he believed were possible if bitcoin continued its free-fall.

Here are the three scenarios Burry sees:

If bitcoin were to drop under $70,000, there could be hefty losses across the financial industry, Burry speculated.

Strategy, Michael Saylor's iconic crypto treasury, would likely record over $4 billion in losses and would "find capital markets essentially closed," Burry said, suggesting the firm would be unable to raise more cash from investors.

Other institutions would likely take a 15%-20% loss on their bitcoin holdings, leading risk managers to "get more aggressive," he added.

Burry said the recent drops in gold and silver prices suggested such a decline in bitcoin was also possible.

"These moves if sustained could result in Bitcoin breaking $70,000 because of this interconnected world of portfolio margin accounts, tokenized metals futures, and crypto collateral," he wrote.

If bitcoin were to fall to $60,000, that could result in an "existential crisis" for Saylor's Strategy, Burry said, without elaborating further.

Saylor's Strategy has come under more scrutiny from crypto investors in recent months as the price of bitcoin continues to tumble. Rumors, in particular, have swirled around the firm potentially selling some of its bitcoin holdings, an event that's thought to be a huge headwind for the broader crypto market, given that Strategy is the world's largest corporate bitcoin holder.

Last year, Strategy's CEO suggested the firm could sell some of its bitcoin holdings as a "last resort" if mNAV, a measure of the company's stock price relative to its bitcoin holdings, drops below a level of 1. The company's mNAV currently stands at 1.1, according to Strategy's website.

If Bitcoin were to drop to $50,000, crypto miners would likely fail and sell their bitcoin reserves, Burry said.

Metals would also likely see a catastrophic sell-off, Burry suggested.

"Tokenized metals futures would collapse into a black hole with no buyer. Physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand," he added.

Burry, who disappeared from social media before coming back online last year, is known for being a vocal critic of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Previously, he suggested that bitcoin was "not worth anything" and represented the "tulip bulb of our time," comparing the asset's price to the bubble in tulip prices in the 1600s.

Longevity doctor and media personality Peter Attia has stepped down from his role at a popular wellness brand after newly released documents revealed friendly exchanges with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Attia stepped down as chief science officer of David Protein, a protein snack bar company he helped promote and invest in, the company confirmed on Monday.

The move comes after the Department of Justice released a new tranche of Epstein-related court documents last week, drawing scrutiny to Attia's past correspondence with Epstein.

"Dr. Peter Attia has stepped down from his role as Chief Science Officer at David. We remain focused on serving our customers," founder Peter Rahal wrote on X.

Attia was also named among 19 new CBS News contributors just days before the emails between him and Epstein were made public. CBS editor in chief Bari Weiss has since faced public calls to cut ties with him. 

CBS News and David Protein could not be reached for comment.

In emails from 2015 and 2016, included in the latest release, Attia used joking and familiar language with Epstein, including references to Epstein's "outrageous" lifestyle and a crude sexual joke.

On Monday, Attia issued a public apology, calling some of the emails "embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible," and saying he was "ashamed of myself for everything about this."

Attia, 52, is a well-known antiaging and longevity expert with roughly 1.6 million Instagram followers.

"I am not asking anyone to ignore the emails or pretend they aren't ugly," he wrote on X. "They simply are."

He said he was not involved in any criminal activity and said his interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with Epstein's sexual abuse or exploitation.

"The man I am today, roughly ten years later, would not write them and would not associate with Epstein at all," he said.

In this article

Walmart crossed the $1 trillion market cap threshold on Tuesday after a dizzying stock climb fueled by the growth of digital businesses and the acquisition of new customers. 

In hitting the benchmark, the largest U.S. retailer and grocer joins an exclusive club made up almost entirely of technology companies. 

Walmart's stock has climbed more than 24% in the past year, and over 11% so far in 2026. That has outpaced the nearly 16% and 2% gains in those time frames, respectively, for the S&P 500. 

The retailer's inclusion in a group heavy on tech companies illustrates much about its ambitions. Walmart has tried to grow profits faster than sales in recent years by leaning into its third-party marketplace and advertising businesses — both of which bring higher margins than its traditional brick-and-mortar operations.

The boom in its online selling platform followed the path of key rival Amazon. And Walmart put out the clearest signal yet of its tech ambitions when it listed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 last month.

The milestone comes only days into the tenure of new Walmart CEO John Furner, who took the position on Sunday. He succeeded longtime Chief Executive Doug McMillon.

As CEO of Walmart's U.S. business, Furner oversaw many of the key initiatives that drove the retailer's growth in recent years. Efforts like curbside pickup and better private-label brands helped the discounter draw higher-income shoppers as elevated inflation bit into grocery budgets.

For its fiscal 2026 third quarter reported in November, Walmart said revenue rose 5.8%, boosted by a 27% jump in e-commerce sales and 53% growth for its advertising business. Walmart said it expected sales growth of 4.8% to 5.1% for its full fiscal year.

The company is expected to post fiscal fourth-quarter earnings later this month.

It's official: Josh D'Amaro is Disney's new top dog — or, in this case, mouse.

D'Amaro, who oversees Disney's parks as its experiences chairman, was just chosen to succeed Bob Iger as CEO. Iger is set to step down on March 18, paving the way for D'Amaro to take over.

D'Amaro is an "exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO," Iger said in a statement. Disney's board voted unanimously for his promotion on Monday, the company said in a statement.

The incoming CEO has big shoes to fill, and much to learn about Disney's business beyond its parks, cruises, and products. D'Amaro will be tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.

Here's what Disney fans, employees, and investors need to know about D'Amaro as he becomes CEO.

D'Amaro, a Massachusetts native, shares a birthday with Iger, who is exactly 20 years older. He'll be 55 years old on February 10, as his eventual predecessor turns 75. The two also appear to have a similar fashion sense. Both D'Amaro and Iger regularly don sweaters over collared shirts, and have a penchant for jackets paired with white shirts.

From childhood, D'Amaro was a Disney fan. He told the Orlando Business Journal in 2020 that his must-do Disney World ride is "Peter Pan's Flight," which he said he and his siblings rode as kids — an experience he said he tries to recreate "whenever I'm here."

The soon-to-be CEO studied business administration at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He had transferred in from New York's Skidmore College, where he studied art and sculpting but had doubts about how he'd make a living, The New York Times reported.

After graduating in 1993, D'Amaro worked at Boston-based Gillette for a few years.

D'Amaro began his Disney journey in 1998, working at Disneyland as a business planner. Twenty years later, he became president of Disneyland, before moving from Anaheim to Orlando a year later to take the same position at Disney World.

Before that role, D'Amaro had worked on the park's business development, marketing strategy, and sales teams. D'Amaro also had roles at Disney World's Animal Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland — a valuable experience, given how crucial China is to Disney's business.

Outside the parks, D'Amaro had also worked in Disney's consumer products businesses as a VP of global licensing.

After more than two decades at Disney, D'Amaro was promoted to Disney Experiences chairman to oversee parks, cruises, and consumer products in early 2020 — at the most difficult time possible amid a pandemic.

D'Amaro filled a role left by then-CEO Bob Chapek, who was eventually pushed out and replaced by Iger, who had retired.

Under his tenure, Disney has continued to expand its parks business, including announcing its plans to launch a seventh park, located in Abu Dhabi.

"For every one theme park visitor that we have in our existing experiences today, we believe there are 10 more out there that want to come and participate in the Disney experience," D'Amaro said in May at MoffettNathanson's media conference.

Under D'Amaro, an experiences business that slowed to a standstill during the pandemic roared back to life as Disney fans raced back to the parks after years of being cooped up at home.

As demand for Disney parks surged, so did prices. Park ticket costs have risen in each of the past four years, and profits, revenue, and visits have climbed as well.

While Disney has received some criticism from fans for making its parks less affordable for middle-class families — with a slew of upcharges for fast-pass Lightning Lanes and costly food — those complaints don't appear to be hurting the company's bottom line.

Disney's experiences segment just topped $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever, while its $3.3 billion in operating income made up more than 70% of the company's profit.

As CEO, D'Amaro must gain Wall Street's favor by pulling off similar feats in Disney's streaming, TV, and movie businesses. Disney's stock has fallen around 9% over the past year, and it's shed about 43% of its value from five years ago.

Although another Iger unretirement and takeover is almost inconceivable, the longtime Disney leader has made clear that he's left the company on the right track, putting pressure on his successor.

Both the experiences and entertainment businesses "have the ability to grow nicely into the future, given all the investments that we've made and the trajectory that we're on," Iger said on Disney's earnings call on Monday.

Iger also made it clear that his successor must be bold and make their own mark on Disney.

"When I came back three years ago, I had a tremendous amount that needed fixing," Iger said. "But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be about preparing a company for its future and really putting in place, taking steps to create opportunities for growth."

A version of this article appeared in CNBC's Inside Alts newsletter, a guide to the fast-growing world of alternative investments, from private equity and private credit to hedge funds and venture capital. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.

The rise of artificial intelligence is likely to boost the valuations of sports teams and media rights, making sports an even more attractive asset class for investors, according to Ian Charles, managing partner of Arctos Partners.

With AI-generated video and online content becoming more ubiquitous, live sports will become even more important in the battle for attention, Charles told Inside Alts. Since fans will pay more for live experiences and in-person games, team values will continue to climb and generate strong returns, he said.

"Sport is the only must-see, appointment-viewing content," Charles said. "In a world where people are increasingly lonely and looking for a connection — for the communal, tribal connection you get from watching a sporting event with your friends, being part of your community, crying and screaming and cheering — the value of that to the media landscape and ecosystem is just becoming exponential."

Arctos is at the center of an investing boom in sports. With $15 billion in assets under management, the Dallas-based firm has helped pioneer the growing role of private equity in sports team ownership and capital raises. It's the only private equity firm approved to own equity in teams across all five major North American professional leagues — the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL and MLS.

The firm has gained such a big lead in sports that it's become an attractive target for other private equity firms. Bloomberg reported last month that private equity giant KKR has agreed to buy Arctos at a $1 billion valuation, keeping Charles and other top management in place. Arctos and Charles declined comment on the report.

Yet despite concerns over a bubble in team valuations, Charles said the thesis for sports as an investment is in the early innings.

Team values have two drivers, he said. The first is league revenues, which are distributed among teams and equates to intellectual property. The second is the live entertainment business, driven by stadiums and other revenue that are protected since "no one is allowed to compete with you in your particular form of live entertainment."

"Those two assets are quite unique," Charles said. "You have this very durable, very important IP piece, and then this local live entertainment piece."

Those twin drivers have given major-league sports teams unique characteristics as investments.

Charles said North American sports teams have mostly outperformed public equities during a 3-year, 5-year and 10-year period, with only occasional exceptions. Team values have increased steadily in value, with little volatility. They are also largely uncorrelated with stocks, delivering the elusive "alpha" that many wealthy investors and family offices are always searching for.

Once seen as trophy assets and unprofitable vanity plays for billionaires, sports teams have become more rigorous businesses that are increasingly accessible for investors through private equity funds. In 2024, the NFL voted to approve select PE firms to buy minority stakes in teams, becoming the last of the major U.S. pro leagues to welcome private equity investors. 

Nearly 1 in 5 professional sports teams now has some kind of private equity investment, according to JPMorgan. The cumulative returns of the four big major sports leagues — NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL — have surpassed the S&P 500 since 2014, the bank said.

Charles said sports are also "anti-cyclical," meaning they are less vulnerable to economic cycles and recessions.

"They've got this sort of monopolistic local live-entertainment business in sports, that's really interesting," he said. "And 70% to 80% of the total revenue in premium sports is long term and contracted through sponsorships, through media rights, with guaranteed payments and escalators. So it doesn't matter if GDP goes down or up."

Not every team or league is a sure bet, however. Charles said Arctos sticks only to the five major leagues. He said emerging sports, like padel, pickleball, E1 Series electric-powerboat racing and others, have yet to prove themselves as durable investments.

"I have no idea which of the professional pickleball leagues is going to be the premium source of content in 20 years," he said. "I do know that when there is a Super Bowl in 2045 it's going to command the attention of the entire world."

If there is one new league that can could break out and become a big business, it's likely to be in women's sports, he said.

"I think that one of the women's sports leagues is going to ascend and command global attention," he said. "I don't know which one it is. I don't know where it will be based. One of them is going to capture the energy and the fandom of the globe."

Elon Musk's rocket maker SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence startup xAI in a deal that will value the company at $1.25 trillion, CNBC's David Faber confirmed Tuesday.

The record-setting transaction is the largest merger of all time and values SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, according to documents viewed by CNBC. 

Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla, announced the deal in a blog post on Monday, saying he's creating "the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet," and the X social media platform. 

The main reason for the merger, he said, is to better build "orbital data centers."

Bloomberg previously reported the merger valuation.

The deal comes ahead of a highly anticipated blockbuster initial public offering for SpaceX later this year. The Financial Times previously reported the company is looking to raise up to $50 billion at a valuation as high as $1.5 trillion. 

The merger deal, which is structured as a share exchange, will convert a share of xAI into 0.1433 share of SpaceX stock. Documents show xAI at $75.46 per share and SpaceX at $526.59 a share. 

Bank valuation documents viewed by CNBC value SpaceX at between $859 billion and $1.26 trillion and xAI at between $219 billion and $294 billion.

Another main reason for the merger is to provide more capital to xAI, which makes the Grok chatbot. 

The startup is burning through cash as it races to build out infrastructure against rival AI labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic. 

OpenAI was last valued at $500 billion in October and Anthropic signed a term sheet last month for a round that valued it at $350 billion. 

By comparison, xAI was last valued at about $230 billion in a $20 billion funding round closed last month. 

Musk, who was a co-founder of OpenAI and departed in 2018, created xAI in 2023. Its Grok AI tool has recently come under fire for allowing users to create sexualized images, including of children.

SpaceX, which makes satellites and reusable rockets, is in position to benefit from the push to launch data centers in space to feed booming AI demand. 

The company is widely known for its Starlink satellite internet service and has contracts with the Department of Defense and NASA, supporting its moon missions. 

News of SpaceX's potential 2026 IPO first broke in December, with Musk calling a report about the planned offering "accurate" shortly thereafter.

The Financial Times previously reported that Musk is preparing the debut for mid-June to time with his birthday and a planetary alignment.

Disney has selected its parks head as the successor to CEO Bob Iger. Now, the Mouse House has to hope that history doesn't repeat itself.

Josh D'Amaro, a 28-year Disney veteran who's run the company's experiences division since 2020, will take over for Iger, who's retiring for the second time, on March 18.

Disney announced the CEO succession plan on Tuesday, the day after posting first-quarter results for its 2026 financial year. Iger will remain on Disney's board as a senior advisor, the company said in its filing.

D'Amaro was named CEO after a unanimous vote by Disney's board on Monday, Disney said in a statement.

Disney's board chairman, James Gorman, said in a memo to employees that D'Amaro "demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of what makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace."

Another factor in D'Amaro's favor is that Disney's parks have become crucial to the company's success, as his Experiences division accounted for more than 70% of Disney's operating income last quarter. Under his watch, the division has grown to record profits and rebounded from the pandemic.

D'Amaro beat out Dana Walden, who oversees Disney's entertainment and TV portfolio, for the top job. The two were largely seen in the industry as the frontrunners in the months leading up to the announcement. Walden will become Disney's president and chief creative officer on March 18, the same day D'Amaro takes over as CEO.

Outgoing CEO Iger called D'Amaro an "exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO" in a statement.

It may be tempting to draw parallels between D'Amaro and Iger's first successor: Bob Chapek, who'd also run Disney's experiences business before becoming CEO in early 2020. Iger appeared to regret his choice of Chapek and seemingly undermined the man he called "Little Bob," CNBC reported. Chapek's brief stint as Disney CEO was widely viewed as a bumpy, tumultuous tenure.

Disney's CEO succession process was much more thorough this time. It was led by Gorman, a former Morgan Stanley CEO, who had successfully navigated his own leadership transition.

Under D'Amaro's leadership, Disney's experiences business has started to carry the company financially. The growth in experiences has been driven by nearly annual price hikes at Disney's parks, which have helped generate more revenue per guest.

Despite those price increases, D'Amaro — a charming 54-year-old — has remained well-liked among Disney fans, some of whom have even argued that higher prices could reduce crowds, thereby improving their experience.

However, some Disney superfans said they were skeptical that D'Amaro was a better choice than Walden, who has run the company's crucial streaming business and has strong relationships in Hollywood.

"You can only extract so much out of the parks," said Lucas Lozano, a Disney fan based in Texas.

Disney superfan Shae Noble, who just renewed her annual pass to Disney World, said she's "losing faith" in Disney leadership as park prices rise and said she's "nervous about leadership changes after what happened before," referring to Chapek.

Lozano expressed a similar concern: "Let's not forget: Bob Chapek once was in D'Amaro's position before he was named CEO, and look what happened."

D'Amaro will also have to win over Wall Street, which has been lukewarm on the Mouse House for the last few years. Disney's stock is down 1% over the past year and has lost a third of its value since its peak five years ago.

D'Amaro's own fiefdom, Disney's experiences business, appears to be firing on all cylinders, though there are questions about how much more it can push up prices.

Disney's direct-to-consumer business is a mixed bag. Streaming has become profitable and steadily added subscribers. However, Disney+ and Hulu's share of US TV viewing has barely budged for years, according to Nielsen data.

Disney has a few ideas for jumpstarting engagement, including adding AI and short-form video to Disney+ after a deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. It's also working to transition ESPN into the streaming future.

D'Amaro will need to look well beyond parks to set Disney up for success in the post-Iger era.

Rocket Companies shares jumped on Tuesday after CEO Varun Krishna told CNBC the company was writing a larger amount of mortgage loans.

"We're getting ready for our earnings call here in just a couple of weeks, and I will share with this group that we're on track to produce the highest mortgage loan production in terms of volume that we've had in four years, and the highest gain on sale that we've had in four years as well," Krishna said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

Rocket shares were last up about 6.3%, jumping as Krishna shared the news. Rocket reports on February 19.

The rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped 22 basis points to 5.99% last month, matching the low from Feb. 2, 2023, according to Mortgage News Daily. The decline came after President Donald Trump said on social media that he is instructing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds.

Rocket's advantage stems from its ability to retain customers by tightly linking mortgage servicing and origination, the CEO said. Rocket keeps relationships intact through its servicing platform, allowing it to recapture borrowers when they return to the market for a home purchase or cash out refinance, he added.

"When they're ready for their next purchase, when they're ready for a cash out refinance, Rocket is there with a great experience, powered by AI. And because of that, we're able to retain our clients, whereas other players simply lose the asset," he said.

 Krishna said Rocket is optimistic about the broader housing outlook. Industry forecasts point to mortgage market growth of as much as 25% through 2026, while existing home sales could rise by up to 10% as affordability improves and pent-up demand returns, he noted.

Happy Tuesday. I did my workout studio's Hyrox-themed class yesterday, which not only left me sore but also with a better understanding of what all the hype in the fitness business is about.

S&P 500 futures ticked higher this morning. The stock market is coming off a winning day.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is combining his rocket company SpaceX with his artificial intelligence startup xAI, he announced yesterday. The tie-up comes ahead of what's expected to be a huge IPO for the merged business.

The tie-up is the largest merger in Musk's portfolio and marries two businesses whose values have soared on the private markets. Nevada public records obtained by CNBC showed that the deal was completed yesterday. 

In a blog post, Musk said he was forming "the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth." He said a primary driver for the merger was his quest to build "orbital data centers" — data centers in space. As CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Ari Levy note, SpaceX may represent Musk's clearest path to securing the capital xAI needs to make that dream a reality.

After a rough end to January, stocks kicked off the new trading month with gains yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 500 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both climbed more than 0.5%.

Here's what we're following:

Palantir exceeded expectations on both lines for the fourth quarter yesterday, sending shares up more than 11% in overnight trading. In an interview with CNBC's Morgan Brennan, CEO Alex Karp called Palantir's report "indisputably the best results that I'm aware of in tech in the last decade." 

The Denver-based firm posted higher commercial and government revenues than Wall Street expected. Karp said strong demand, paired with Palantir's high engagement in the U.S., has led the defense technology company to delay selling new products to American allies.

Karp also spoke about the ongoing protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, telling CNBC that he thinks protesters should support his company's business with the government. "If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir," he said, adding that Palantir's product "requires people to conform with Fourth Amendment data protections."

Trump announced yesterday that the U.S. and India have reached a trade deal that will see both countries lowering their tariffs on each other's exports. The news comes just days after the European Union made its own trade deal with India.

Under the agreement, India will buy U.S. products "at a much higher level," Trump said on social media. He also said said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to "stop" buying oil from Russia. Instead, Trump said New Delhi would purchase more from America — and, possibly, Venezuela.

Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to advance a funding deal and end the partial government shutdown, which began on Saturday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said yesterday that shutdown will delay the release of January's jobs report that was scheduled for Friday.

As CNBC's Eunice Yoon reports, consumer sentiment looks just as sour in China as it does in the U.S. That gloom is reflected in the widespread popularity of a frowning horse plushie.

The stuffed animal's downcast appearance was originally due to a manufacturing mistake, according to state media. A factory worker accidentally sowed the toy's smile on upside down, creating what's now known as "the crying horse."

The sorrowful horse has come to represent the downcast sentiment Chinese consumers feel amid deflation and a down economy. As Beijing toy seller Gao Lan put it: "The crying horse reflects how people feel inside."

U.S. store closures are poised to hit three-year lows as the retail industry moves past a string of bankruptcies. Here are the retailers expected to add the most stores this year:

CNBC's Ari Levy, Lora Kolodny, Sean Conlon, Liz Napolitano, Sawdah Bhaimiya, Lillian Rizzo, Julia Boorstin, Yun Li, Lee Ying Shan, Samantha Subin, Kevin Breuninger, Garrett Downs, Eunice Yoon, Melissa Repko and Gabriel Cortes, as well as Reuters, contributed to this report.

A Delta Air Lines flight to Israel turned around and diverted to Dublin, about halfway through its journey.

Flight 234 took off from New York's JFK Airport shortly before 4 p.m. on Monday. It was scheduled to arrive in Tel Aviv around 10 hours later.

However, six hours into the journey, the plane changed course just off England's west coast, according to flight-tracking data.

The Airbus A330 U-turned and crossed the Irish Sea to make for Dublin, where it landed safely.

It appears the plane had to turn around due to a medical emergency.

"Delta flight 234 landed safely in Dublin following an onboard customer medical situation," an airline spokesperson said.

"Medical personnel met the flight upon arrival, and it has since continued on and arrived in Tel Aviv," they added.

Data from Flightradar24 shows the same plane departed Dublin at 5:25 a.m. local time on Tuesday. That's about two hours after it landed in the Irish capital.

Passengers are expected to arrive in Israel around noon local time, a delay of just under three hours.

The fact that the plane had already crossed the Atlantic Ocean meant the flight had a smaller delay than some past in-flight medical emergencies.

Last April, a British Airways flight from the Bahamas changed course over the ocean and diverted to Gander, in Canada's Newfoundland, due to a medical emergency.

The plane took off again about three hours later, but had to stop in Iceland because the flight crew was about to exceed their working-hour limit.

The Switch has become Nintendo's best-selling console of all time, nearly nine years after its release. 

The device's importance to the Japanese gaming giant cannot be understated. Ahead of the Switch's release in March 2017, Nintendo was coming off the back of a flop with the Wii U, with its share price having declined in the years prior. 

Since the Switch's release, Nintendo has more than tripled its valuation with its brand arguably becoming more popular than ever.

"The company was in shambles after the previous console flopped hard, so the Switch marks a major turnaround in Nintendo's long history," Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, told CNBC. "It could have not come at a better time."

The gaming giant said Tuesday that lifetime sales of the Switch now total 155.37 million units, surpassing the record of 154.02 million units that was held by the Nintendo DS, the company's most popular console. In third place sits the iconic Gameboy with 118.69 million units sold. 

Before the Switch came the ill-fated Wii U which Nintendo hoped would be as successful as the innovative Wii console. The Wii, released in 2006, was known for its handheld motion controllers that allowed users to mimic playing sports such as tennis.

Nintendo sold more than 100 million units of the Wii. But the WiiU, released in 2012, sold just 13.56 million units. Some critics say confusing marketing over the console was to blame. Others say that it was facing intense competition from Sony's PlayStation 4. 

But the Wii U gave some hint for what Nintendo was going to attempt next. The company had employed a strategy of separate handheld consoles and those that hook up to a TV. The Switch in 2017 blurred the lines. It was a console that gamers could play on a large screen, but users can also attach controllers to a portable screen and continue gaming on the go."What is fundamental is that with the Switch's form factor — a innovative hybrid console offering both a handheld and TV console experience — Nintendo took the decision to combine its historic dual product strategy into a single product line," Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analysis, told CNBC.

"This had the impact of combining its handheld and TV console audiences, thus laying the foundation for a new level of success from a single product."

The timing was important. Nintendo's base of young casual gamers was being tempted by an onslaught from popular mobile games, and the Switch enabled Nintendo to counter that.

"Switch reinvigorated Nintendo's console business after mobile gaming rose to prominence to eat 3DS and Wii U's lunch," James McWhirter, senior analyst at Omdia, said.  

The Switch was a new concept when it was launched in 2017, combining a traditional console and handheld. 

Nintendo's success with the Switch stemmed from its ability to leverage its in-house console design and first-party games based on its most popular franchises and characters.

"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" was the most popular title with more than 70 million units sold. "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" and a slew of games based on Super Mario and friends, Zelda and Pokemon, made the rest of the best-seller list. 

The Switch also saw increased interest during the Covid-19 pandemic when people were stuck at home and looking to video games for entertainment. And just when it looked like interest may fade, the Super Mario movie in 2023 helped to breathe fresh life into the console. 

Nintendo has expanded the way it spreads its intellectual property beyond the console to toys, theme parks and movies, which brought the audience back to the Switch.

"The Switch generation was also defined by Nintendo making a broad effort to expand the reach of its globally-recognisable IP via theme parks, movies, museums, and collaborations," McWhirter said.

Nintendo is hoping to replicate that playbook with the Switch 2 which was launched last year. So far, the console has sold more than 14 million units and Nintendo said the device is its fastest-selling of all time.

In this article

PepsiCo on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations, fueled by improving organic sales across its business.

Demand for the company's snacks has been sluggish as consumers balk at higher prices. This year, Pepsi plans to lower prices on products like chips from its North American food division to "improve competitiveness and the purchase frequency of our brands," executives said in prepared remarks. Productivity savings will offset the lower prices, they said.

Shares of the food and beverage giant rose more than 3% in morning trading.

Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Pepsi reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company of $2.54 billion, or $1.85 per share, up from $1.52 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring and impairment charges and other items, the company earned $2.26 per share.

Net sales rose 5.6% to $29.34 billion. Organic revenue, which strips out foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, increased 2.1% in the quarter.

"PepsiCo's fourth quarter results reflected a sequential acceleration in reported and organic revenue growth, with improvements in both the North America and International businesses," CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.

However, the company is seeing volume declines, particularly for its North American businesses. The metric excludes pricing and foreign exchange fluctuations to reflect demand more accurately. 

Global volume for its food fell 2% in the quarter, although global volume for its drinks ticked up 1%.

Pepsi's home market was once again the weak point of the quarter, although it is showing signs of improvement. Inflation-weary shoppers have been buying less of Pepsi's snacks and drinks in a sign of consumer backlash against higher prices. "Affordability" is the biggest obstacle to attracting low- and middle-income consumers, Laguarta said on the company's conference call.

PepsiCo Beverages North America, which includes Gatorade, Starry and Poppi, saw volume shrink 4%, though its organic sales rose 2%. 

PepsiCo's North American food division, which spans brands from Quaker Oats to Cheetos, reported that volume fell 1%. Although it reported higher volume growth than the North American beverage unit this quarter, Pepsi's domestic food business has been the laggard of the portfolio for more than a year.

Retailers that sell Pepsi products have responded to the price cuts with enthusiasm, according to executives. As a result, its products will become even more ubiquitous, starting this spring; the company expects a double-digit increase in shelf space with its top retail customers, on average.

To further improve demand for its snacks, Pepsi is planning to cut prices on some packages of select brands, including Lay's, Tostito's, Doritos and Cheetos, executives said in prepared remarks. In addition to price cuts, key brands, like Lay's, Tostitos, Gatorade and Quaker have been undergoing makeovers that include simpler ingredients and new packaging to help bring back customers. Pepsi is also working on expanding its portfolio to include more functional drinks, whole grains, protein and fiber.

Pepsi also reiterated the outlook for 2026 that the company provided in December. The company is projecting that organic revenue will rise between 2% and 4% and core constant currency earnings per share will increase in a range of 4% to 6%.

In December, Pepsi struck a deal with activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which had revealed a roughly $4 billion stake in the company two months earlier. As part of the agreement, Pepsi said it would slash its U.S. product lineup by 20%, cut costs across its food and beverage operations, and lower snack prices. Elliott did not receive any seats on Pepsi's board.

As Pepsi implements that plan this year, the company is projecting that its North American business will improve, while its international divisions remain "resilient," according to Laguarta.

Programming note: PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta will discuss the company's earnings after 10 a.m. ET. Watch on CNBC or CNBC+.

Bracha Cohen knows that she actually cannot do it all, or at least not all at once.

A partner within asset and wealth management engineering at Goldman Sachs, Cohen said that knowing how to delegate responsibility is crucial to excelling in her job while raising seven children.

"Does this need to be me directly, or is this the kind of thing that a delegate could do just as well, and it won't compromise the outcome?" Cohen, who has been at Goldman for more than three decades and climbed to its upper echelons as a partner, said.

Around one in four employees at Goldman are engineers, and Cohen held various engineering leadership roles before becoming a partner in 2024. Her current team now automates the asset management business' operations to help it scale. Goldman's asset and wealth management division holds a record $3.6 trillion in assets and has grown under CEO David Solomon's leadership.Cohen's approach to delegation plays out both at work and at home. 

Some responsibilities, Cohen said, are "truly non-discretionary," but others can be passed on either to colleagues at work or family members at home.

For Cohen, a religious Jewish woman, celebrating Shabbat each week between sundown on Friday and sundown on Saturday is a non-negotiable. Her close colleagues know that they'll periodically need to take a task over the finish line on Friday evenings, after she's logged off.

The priorities that on their face might seem to clash with Cohen's job, like raising many children and observing Shabbat, have actually taught her skills crucial to her success: time management and long-term planning, to name a couple.

"I have to develop those skills at double or triple the pace," she said.Many American adults have to juggle the day-to-day of their careers against the demands of parenting: both parents work in more than 66% of families with children under 18, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

"Allocate your time and energy intentionally. That's the key," she advised about managing as a working parent. On the weekends, for example, Cohen is more proactive in dealing with personal responsibilities before shifting her proactive focus to work on Sunday evenings.

Even so, Cohen said that the occasional conflict is inevitable. When two high-priority responsibilities bump up against each other, it's about judging the trade-offs and knowing that any fallout will likely be recoverable, especially since she's consistent as a colleague and parent. There are also ways to compensate afterwards, like calling the people who attended the meeting you had to miss, she said.

"If you're very dependable and reliable and always take the responsibility seriously, if some emergency comes up, be it another work commitment or be it a personal commitment, then it'll be excusable," Cohen said.

SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.

It's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.

NATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.

The biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.

The monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.

This type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.

Lapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.

In the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.

Canadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.

Anything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.

Finnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.

Lähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.

"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me," she said. "I have to keep them warm."

Proper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.

Soldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.

Proper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.

During a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.

Using small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.

Aikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.

Learning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle. The country also knows cold-weather combat, making it well-suited to teach the rest of the alliance winter warfare.

Lemelin, the Canadian captain, described the course as a "humbling experience;" it's critical exposure for the NATO alliance as Western militaries grapple with a rapidly changing Arctic environment and an expanding adversarial footprint.

The era of easy money in venture capital is over, and a new generation of investors is rising in its place.

After years dominated by easy money and sky-high valuations in AI startups, the venture industry has shifted toward sharper judgment, tougher diligence, and startups that can actually scale into businesses. AI is still at the center of it all, but the focus has moved beyond the generative AI hype to customers and revenue.

That reset has created a big opportunity for early-career venture capitalists. As firms slow down and get more selective, younger investors are often the ones sourcing the best deals, building relationships with founders early, and making the case for bold bets before the rest of the market catches on.

Watch Live: Tune in here on Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. ET to learn more about our rising stars list and investing trends.

Each year, Business Insider asks top investors to nominate the most promising young VCs in their networks. We also solicit recommendations from the broader venture community and past Rising Stars, and make several selections of our own based on deal flow, reputation, and impact over the past year.

The investors on our 2026 Rising Stars of Venture Capital list come from a wide range of backgrounds and roles, including associates, principals, and founding partners. While many are building their reputations by backing AI-driven startups, the list also reflects growing momentum for AI in sectors like defense, robotics, and healthcare.

Now meet the rising stars of venture capital, listed alphabetically.

Abram was recently promoted to partner at Scale Venture Partners after building a reputation for spotting companies — and entire investment themes — before they're fashionable.

In 2025, he helped build conviction inside the firm around two bets in AI agents: Tavus, which is working to make agents feel more human, and Bland, which builds AI phone agents. Scale led Series A round for both companies, and each later raised a $40 million Series B.

He's also helped shape Scale's thinking on how AI is changing the day-to-day work of lawyers. His research showed that the modern general counsel isn't looking for one-off tools as much as a "second brain" for advising the business. That view helped point Scale toward the legal software company GC AI, which raised a $60 million Series B led by Scale in November.

Beshar joined Insight Partners in 2019 and invests in high-growth software and internet companies, after stops on Google's education team, Goldman Sachs' trading floor, and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

In spring 2025, she met two MIT dropouts building Delve, a startup that helps companies collect and verify compliance evidence. Beshar says Insight could tell early on that Delve was scaling "faster than typical" for its stage, and the firm pounced. She hustled on the diligence, then boarded a last-minute flight to San Francisco and spent the week embedded with the founders. Delve later announced a $32 million Series A led by Insight at a $300 million valuation.

For Beshar, the skill that never goes out of style is curiosity, particularly as the time between major tech shifts keeps getting shorter. "The most effective investors I've observed," she says, "are those who ask follow-up questions and are comfortable admitting what they don't yet know."

Bhatia joined Redpoint Ventures as vice president of growth in 2024, focused on infrastructure, AI, SaaS, and security companies. Prior to Redpoint, he was an investor at ICONIQ Growth.

The Harvard grad has invested in financial infrastructure company Parafin, robotics software startup Physical Intelligence, and AI security firm Irregular Security.

He said Redpoint has been spending more time in the space ecosystem, calling out the Series C it led for K2 Space, which builds large satellites that can operate across multiple orbits.

To be successful, Bhatia said VCs should try to build with AI themselves, including side projects or internal tools. He said he uses ChatGPT's deep research and thinking modes to brainstorm and debate the possibility of "a company becoming bigger than we would have originally imagined."

Borja is an investor at Menlo Ventures, focusing on software-as-a-service, AI, and cloud infrastructure. She joined the firm in 2023 after two years at Boston Consulting Group.

Borja was part of the team that co-led Menlo's Series B investment in Lovable, the buzzy European vibe coding startup, at a $6.6 billion valuation.

The relationship started when she reached out to founder Anton Osika six months before the company launched, when he was working on another project, GPT Engineer.

"Over the following year, we made it a priority to stay close," Borja said. "We'd been paying attention long before the metrics became obvious. And Lovable's scale created a genuine diligence challenge: I had to build detailed models and Python scripts to understand their usage patterns, revenue profile, and how a company achieving this much in under a year could continue that trajectory at scale."

Borja says she tries to inject kindness into everything she does.

"People underestimate how important it is to just be a good person in this business," she said.

Brooke was recently promoted to principal at Sapphire Ventures, where he sits at the intersection of fintech, vertical software, and crypto. He's been pushing the firm to treat stablecoins as an important new area of financial services, not a buzzword.

He sourced Sapphire's investment in Rain, which helps businesses issue and manage payment cards and wallets tied to stablecoin balances — a bet that Rain could become the "foundational infrastructure layer" for stablecoin payments. Four months after the $58 million Series B, Rain announced a $250 million Series C led by Iconiq at a $1.95 billion valuation. Brooke now works with the team to support growth by making introductions to new hires and customers.

Brooke says AI is now baked into his day-to-day. Sapphire's data science team has built internal tools that flag founders and companies worth a closer look, and he also leans on ChatGPT, Claude, and NotebookLM to crank out quick industry primers.

Chilappagari is a principal at Battery Ventures and has been with the firm for roughly four-and-a-half years.

He focuses on investing in B2B SaaS companies, AI apps, and AI-enabled service businesses, including data integration startup Coefficient and Liberate, an AI voice startup in the insurance industry.

Chilappagari said the team at Battery has gone deep into voice AI in recent years and highlighted its investment in the Utah-based financial advisor startup Jump AI. Jump had just closed a seed round and wasn't actively raising capital, but Battery courted its founders with customer introductions and whiteboarded an early sales plan, which ultimately led to leading its $20 million Series A.

As an ex-enterprenuer and "product nerd," Chilappagari told BI that one of his favorite AI tools is Wispr Flow, which dictates emails, documents, and ChatGPT prompts.

Dolfe, who hails from Sweden and earned her master's degree from the London School of Economics, joined Index Ventures in 2018. She serves as a partner and focuses on early-stage companies across Europe and the US in SaaS, AI, financial services, and gaming.

She works with mobile game studio Dream Games, subscription app builder RevenueCat, and biotech startup Cradle. A deal that stood out recently is the $250 million Series D for AI customer service company Decagon, which Index co-led in January.

Dolfe said successful investors are "deeply founder-centric" and adaptable.

"The biggest opportunities are in large, established markets where legacy incumbents still dominate, but where AI-native workflows can fundamentally change how work gets done," she said. "That kind of transformation takes patience, conviction, and a willingness to revisit assumptions alongside founders as the market evolves."

Before working in venture, El-Baba was a competitive athlete, serving as captain of the University of Michigan's boxing team, where he led the co-ed group to three national team titles.

El-Baba joined Emergence Capital as an associate in 2019 after working in business operations and corporate development at LinkedIn. He was promoted to partner in 2024 and has contributed to its investments in enterprise voice AI platform Bland AI, AI sales platform Unify, and product testing startup Maze.

In a saturated AI landscape, El-Baba said investors need to reimagine how they evaluate early traction.

"In 2026, there will be more 'head-fake' businesses than ever before," he said. "In today's market, many companies can go $0 to $5M in run-rate in a year. The savviest investors will discern between low and high quality revenue, and what will lead to true durability over time."

Esserman joined Accel in 2017 and is currently a partner, specializing in backing late-stage companies. Investments include cybersecurity startup Blackpoint, software development tool Linear, GoPuff, and Bumble.

Esserman told BI her work with Graphite — which helps review and merge code — stood out in 2025, culminating in its acquisition by AI coding platform Cursor in December.

"It reflected long-term thinking: recognizing that code generation and code review were coming together, and that the future of engineering would require tighter collaboration between humans and agents," she told Business Insider.

Esserman graduated from The Wharton School, and prior to Accel, worked in product and operations at a number of startups. She told BI that while AI has helped automate administrative tasks around work, like scheduling and meal planning, the core job of a venture capitalist — building relationships and forming convictions — "can't be automated."

Flynn joined Sequoia in 2024 to focus on growth-stage investments. He has worked on some of the most high-profile deals at the firm, including OpenAI, Neuralink, Vanta, and ElevenLabs, which raised funding through an employee tender offer last summer, valuing the company at a $6.6 billion valuation

It was up to Flynn to convince his partners that investing at such a steep valuation would be a wise investment.

"I started digging deep into the financials that the company sent over, which were gorgeous," Flynn said, adding that he also made calls to customers of ElevenLabs and their competitors. "It became clear that we are still so early in the voice AI wave and that customers viewed ElevenLabs as the undisputed market leader."

Sequoia ended up leading the round.

"The world is noisy and fast-changing, people are busy and there are more startups than ever before," Flynn said. "To break through in venture in 2026 you desperately need a high level of agency, initiative and activation energy."

Some internships offer more than just experience — they can shape careers. Gellman, who joined Inspired Capital in 2024 as chief of staff to the firm's founding partner Alexa von Tobel, began her career in 2012 as a summer intern for von Tobel's company LearnVest.

After interning at LearnVest, Gellman worked at BlackRock for 5 years before earning her MBA from Harvard Business School. In 2022, she joined Volition Capital as a senior associate on the firm's team overseeing internet and consumer investments, where she sourced deals like Chamberlain Coffee and Mozaic.

In 2025, Gellman supported Inspired's investment in Logiqal, a quantum computing startup, helping lead the firm's research in the space by conducting conversations with over 100 experts prior to the deal as the quantum computing industry hit a "critical inflection point," she said.

When conducting research on topics like frontier tech or AI infrastructure, Gellman leverages AI tools herself, like ChatGPT's "Deep Research" feature. "This helps me accelerate the learning curve and ask better questions earlier," Gellman said.

Gray has been at national security-focused fund Shield Capital for almost three years and was promoted to vice president late last year. At Shield Capital, Gray has worked closely with portfolio companies, including Code Metal, an AI code translation startup, and has facilitated intros that have led to at least one multimillion-dollar contract.

Gray muses about investing on her blog and Shield Capital's podcast, which she helps run. She says she uses OpenAI's deep research tool to learn about new industries and spaces and leverages AI to help edit the podcast.

"To be a successful VC, you need to genuinely love learning new things and meeting new people, Gray said. "We need to constantly be learning and curious and out there learning about unknown challenges in the world."

Gujral joined Alphabet-owned CapitalG in 2021 and serves as vice president on its investment team, focused on AI, app software, and infrastructure.

Prior to his career as a VC, Gujral worked in product marketing and operations at machine learning startup Tecton, and as a consultant at Bain & Company. He graduated from Dartmouth with a dual degree in computer science and economics.

In 2025, Gujral highlighted his collaboration with the teams behind the AI building design platform Motif and robotics lab Physical Intelligence. CapitalG led the companies' Series A and B rounds, respectively.

Gujral considers himself "a voracious user of AI," with Gemini and AlphaSense being go-to research tools. He also uses Lovable to vibe code mini-apps for leisure, including one to help him and his wife select movies for date night.

Han, a former competitive figure skater, joined Lightspeed in 2022 as a partner focusing on early-stage investments in enterprise software.

Han led Lightspeed's 2025 seed investment in Thinking Machines Lab, the closely watched AI lab founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati.

"Being a successful venture capitalist in 2026 requires shedding outdated priors," Han said. "I spend significant time with founders helping them rethink company building from first principles and hire operators who are comfortable navigating ambiguity. The pace of technological change, particularly in AI, means that past playbooks decay quickly, and adaptability has become a core skill."

Haskaraman is a partner at Felicis, where she invests in AI infrastructure, cybersecurity, and applications startups. She joined the firm in late 2025 and previously worked at Menlo Ventures, Insight Partners, and McKinsey.

"Being a successful venture capitalist in 2026 means recognizing that capital is a commodity," she said.

"You need to surround yourself with the best talent. You're seeing one of the fiercest talent wars in terms of AI talent. The real differentiation is building and maintaining a trusted community. The best investors focus on building an ecosystem around founders, talent, and customers."

Henkel joined Maverick Ventures in 2023 and was promoted from principal to managing director in January. Before venture capital, she led finance and strategy at a healthcare startup and worked as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley.

Last year, Henkel sourced and led the Series A for Prosper Health, which provides adults with autism testing and therapy, and she joined the company's board.

"Over time, I became increasingly convinced that neurodivergent adults represented a large and underserved population at the intersection of behavioral health, consumer health, and cultural shifts," she said.

Henkel said founders are increasingly selective amid an influx of capital and as products are cheaper to build. As a result, investors need to become more involved in the day-to-day grind.

In terms of AI use at Maverick, she said the team uses platforms to identify potential founders before they have even started companies, examining factors like education, previous roles, and domain expertise to forge early relationships.

Hitzig is an investor at Venrock, where she invests in aerospace, defense, public safety, and AI startups.

In 2025, she led investments in Adyton, which is building logistics and operational software for the military, and in an unannounced startup aiming to change how companies manage hourly labor. Before Venrock, Hitzig served as an officer in the US Navy Reserve. She also worked in the New York Police Department's counterterrorism bureau.

"I love investing in companies solving problems you can't unsee," she said. "The world's biggest problems live in the physical economy and for all three of my recent investments, I am reminded of the problems they are solving daily whether at the airport, on the road, at a sporting event, or training for my Navy Reserve duty."

Huang came to venture through the builder pipeline. She held engineering and product roles at Adobe. Now, she invests at the intersection of developer tools and AI infrastructure.

At Bain Capital Ventures, Huang sourced the firm's investment in Black Forest Labs, the German startup behind a popular tool for generating images called Flux. She argued that creative teams "care less about raw benchmarks and more about control and correctness," and she believed that Flex's tunability made it stand out in a crowded field. Black Forest Labs later raised a $300 million Series B at a $3.25 billion valuation, a validation of that thesis.

Huang's secret weapon isn't a group chat. It's a late night café. At Bain Capital Ventures, Huang launched Cafe Compute, a late-night pop-up hangout co-hosted with the AI company Cerebras that pulls in founders, developers, and researchers who co-work and trade ideas over coffee.

Iregbulem is a principal at Hico Ventures, where she backs pre-seed and seed AI and digital asset companies.

Before that, she worked at MVP Ventures, where she invested in defense tech companies Saronic and AI startup Atero, which was acquired by Crusoe in September 2025. Iregbulem holds a bachelor's degree from the University of the Pacific.

Iregbulem said Neros, which she backed at its pre-seed, "started as a scrappy FPV drone manufacturer" and has since landed major Defense Department contracts. Her goal is to "find pre-consensus opportunities within critical industries — defense, energy, aerospace, robotics — the herd arrives."

Kilberg serves as an investment partner at the Reid Hoffman-chaired firm Village Global. Previously, he was an associate at AngelList Venture and the cofounder of a hiring marketplace startup.

The Stanford grad has sourced or led investments in AI engineering startup P-1, enterprise AI agent company Maisa, and Interaction, which is behind the AI assistant Poke.

The Interaction investment decision came two hours after meeting its founders, Kilberg told BI, and the company went on to raise multiple follow-on rounds from tier-1 investors.

Kilberg said he leads the ideation and implementation of Village's outbound sourcing strategy, which relies on an AI stack to tap promising founders outside of its network and find the best ways to connect through its team.

Koh is a principal at Iconiq, a multifamily office and investing firm, where he focuses on software startups.

Koh sourced Iconiq's 2025 investment in TinyFish, which is helping companies deploy autonomous agents capable of executing complex, multi-step actions across the digital landscape.

"While the 'table stakes' of showing up, building a network, and deep due diligence remain as critical as ever, I think it's increasingly important and easier for VCs to be hands-on with products," Koh said.

"I didn't come from a software engineering background, which used to be a barrier to truly 'feeling' a product's friction. Today, AI has democratized that experience."

Kraut is a partner at Generational Partners, a pre-seed and seed stage firm that invests in industrial technologies. There, he's invested in Vital Lyfe, a startup working on modular water desalination systems. Kraut previously worked as a deep tech investor at Starburst Ventures.

"Capital is no longer the bottleneck," Kraut said of venture capital. "Access to exceptional people and consequential problems is. The most effective firms are deeply embedded in the talent networks that are capable of creating consequential solutions."

As Tusk's sole non-partner investor, Kumar leads the firm's outbound sourcing and diligence. Since joining Tusk in April 2025, the 28-year-old vice president has been hands-on with several of the firm's recent investments, including AI healthcare startup Doctronic.

She started her career at Citibank in tech investment banking and, in 2022, joined venture capital firm 01 Advisors.

"Early in my venture career, I heard a senior investor say 'founders bring people, not just funds, onto cap tables,'" Kumar said.

"Venture is ultimately a relationship and services business: the investors that I admire most, and the ones that I think will be most successful in 2026 and beyond, think like true partners and operators, working in service of founders rather than sitting above them."

Lichter built and leads Emerson Collective's physical AI vertical, which invests in companies developing AI technology and products that operate in the real, physical world. She joined the firm in 2021.

She led the firm's investment in robotics startup Field AI, which was recently valued at about $2 billion, after first sourcing the deal in 2022. Lichter also led Emerson's investments in robotic startups Physical Intelligence and Agrippa.

"Success in VC depends on staying deeply curious," Lichter said. "There's always a new idea, team, or technology to learn from. I focus on fast-moving sectors like AI and robotics, where yesterday's assumptions may not hold tomorrow."

Lichter is also a board member of SomosVC, a nonprofit focused on empowering Latino/a venture capital investors.

Madan Presler is a growth investor who started her career as a public health researcher and speaks four languages. Now a partner at IVP, she's developed a reputation for her unusually thorough diligence.

In 2025, she helped IVP invest in Laurel, which allows law and accounting firms to track time, then use those records to understand costs and set fees. The venture firm was late to the fundraising process, she says, and had to "earn our way in." Madan Presler cold-emailed the founder over a weekend and scrambled a team to research the market and Laurel's place within it.

Madan Presler said the founder later singled out the firm's financial and market diligence as the best he'd seen, and that the work influenced how he thought about the business. Laurel later announced a $100 million Series C led by Insight at a $510 million valuation.

Matthews is a senior associate at Santa Monica-based March Capital who focuses on diligence, deal execution, and operational support for enterprise AI and cloud and data infrastructure startups. She has worked closely with Together AI, a cloud platform now valued at $3.3 billion.

"I think the best investors are relentless in pursuing opportunities they believe in (cold outreach, creative deal structures, building relationships years ahead) but also maintain the intellectual humility to update their views when the data changes," Matthews said.

"In a world where capital isn't the differentiator, being able to proactively understand and respond to shifts in markets, companies, and people is what seems to separate the wheat from the chaff."

When Neemuchwala joined NEA at age 28, he became one of the youngest partners in the firm's history. Since then, he's invested in a handful of deep-tech startups, including drone manufacturer Firestorm Labs, drone radar startup Chaos Industries, and others, from seed to Series F.

"Just like public markets, we live in a stockpicker's world in private markets where there's a lot of noise and hype chasing, but returns come from first principles, sourcing, and picking, plus really helping founders navigate the complexities of zero to one and hypergrowth in a very fast-changing world."

The youngest to make partner at Alumni Ventures at 33 years old, Oak (now 34), is focused on AI-native developer tools and infrastructure. She recently supported the firm's investment in the AI developer platform OpenHands, which raised $18.8 million in Series A funding in 2025.

"You have to be exceptional at optimizing for signal over noise," Oak said. "We have access to more information than ever, from founder networks to raw product data, open-source activity, and real-time market signals. The edge comes from quickly distilling what actually matters and filtering out everything that does not. Once you have that clarity, the rest is pure hustle."

Oak has helped build Alumni Ventures' community of founders and engineering talent, hosting gatherings from larger events with hundreds of attendees to smaller, more intimate events that connect early-career builders.

Ryan-Schreiber spends his days in the messy moment before a startup is even a startup. At New York venture firm AlleyCorp, he's a principal who incubates and invests across media, fintech, and international markets. Before becoming a venture capitalist, he was a senior executive at the French media company Brut, where he helped steer fundraising and expansion.

In 2025, Ryan-Schreiber, along with Michelle Parsons, Hinge's former chief product officer, built an astrocartography-focused app called Lora. He says that in six weeks, with "zero marketing spend," Lora grew a waitlist past 70,000 people and built an active Discord community.

His advice for young investors: Stop trying to be a Swiss Army knife. "A successful VC should focus on what they are good at," he said, whether that's bringing new employees into the fold or jumpstarting a go-to-market strategy. Leave the rest to other board members or investors.

Sahraoui, 25, joined Slow Ventures as an investor in 2023. She's led the firm's investments into new categories in energy, defense, and industrial infrastructure.

Sahraoui supported Slow's investment in a stealth nuclear company, as well as working closely with the firm's partners on investments like The Lumber Factory and Agent AI.

Like many VCs, Sahraoui's day-to-day is "filled with conversations where the information density is extremely high," which is why she utilizes AI tools to synthesize her call transcripts and materials to streamline decision-making.

Sajnani joined Khosla in 2024 as one of two partners making growth-stage investments.

He's helped steer the firm's bets on Abridge, Clickhouse, Glean, Kiddom, and Omnea, which raised a $50 million Series B funding round last fall.

"What I care most about getting right is earning a founder's trust by showing up when it matters, rolling up my sleeves, and working hard for the teams we back," Sajnani said.

Benchstrength principal investor Schultz goes beyond writing checks to founders.

In 2025, she embedded herself at one of her portfolio investments Alta, an AI-powered stylist and shopping app. Prior to investing in Alta, Schultz had met the founder, Jenny Wang, before Wang had even started building the company and "knew we wanted her back," Schultz said. While working closely with Alta, Schultz helped Wang hire a chief of staff and supported early growth.

Before joining Benchstrength in 2023, Schultz got her MBA from Harvard Business School and worked at Google on the company's responsible innovation and people operations teams.

In addition to Alta, Schultz has been involved in Benchstrength's investments in procurement intelligence platform Orphic and AI-observability company Lanai.

Thakur, who graduated with a computer science degree from MIT in 2021, was a partner at Index Ventures before co-founding Hanabi Capital in 2024.

Thakur works with early-stage companies at the forefront of AI and spends most of her time on product strategy and technical hiring.

"The advent of AI has led to a glut of new companies, creating more competition for high-calibre talent," Thakur said. "The best companies obsess over talent, and the best VCs help their portfolio companies identify, attract, and win top talent."

Toto is a principal at Salesforce Ventures, where she invests in startups addressing global issues such as access to education and healthcare through its Impact Fund.

This year, she led Salesforce Ventures' financial diligence of AI infrastructure and cloud computing company Crusoe, which was last valued at over $10 billion. Previously, Toto worked as a manager at Salesforce and as a deals associate at PwC.

"Unlike standard SaaS deals, Crusoe's blend of energy infrastructure and high-performance compute required a nuanced understanding of renewable investment structures, project finance, and various loan structures," she said. "I was able to bridge the gap between traditional infrastructure project finance and venture-scale growth, which was pivotal in de-risking the model for our investment committee."

Bessemer promoted Yuditski to vice president last year, after a path that included investment banking and a reputation inside the firm for her "tireless" support of its portfolio companies.

Her marquee 2025 bet: EliseAI, which automates workflows in healthcare and housing. Yuditski says she earned the deal the slow way: building a relationship with executives over the years. That patience paid off when EliseAI announced a $250 million Series E led by Andreessen Horowitz, with Bessemer participating. Yuditski also supports the firm's investments in Anthopric, Abridge, EvenUp, Legora, and Upwind Security, among others.

Yuditsky says success in venture still comes down to two durable edges: relationships and hustle. The best investors, she says, are the ones people trust enough to tell them the truth, "go to bat" for them in the messy moments, and lean on when things get hard.

After two years as a principal at CRV, Zhan joined the newly formed Striker Venture Partners in 2025 to make bold bets on the next generation of AI startups.

Zhan, who studied computer science at Northwestern University and started his career writing code at Facebook, practices what he describes as "nerdy investing."

He was part of the team that invested early in Skild AI, Dyna Robotics, Periodic Labs, and Reflection AI.

"Founders want someone who can speak their language," Misha Laskin, CEO and cofounder of Reflection AI, told Business Insider. "Brian is rare in that he's actually done the work, is incredibly well connected, and is insightful about what's happening at the frontier."

Zhang is a power user of the AI technology she's investing in — whether that's DCM Ventures portfolio companies like OpusClip or other AI tools like ElevenLabs, Suno, or Cursor to vibe code. Using the technology helps Zhang "understand the true opportunities and bottlenecks of the tech beyond the novelty hype," she said.

In 2025, she supported DCM's investment in OpusClip, an AI video editing platform, and has been involved in the startup's growth, scale, and hiring. Zhang was also involved in the fund's deals with AI startups like Lingopal, Emochi, and BentoM.

Zhang joined DCM in 2022 and looks for "versatile founders" who have grit. She also tries to stay curious and open-minded, paying close attention to younger generations and cultural trends.

"AI has lowered the barriers to producing and distributing products across cultures," Zhang said. "I coach founders to uncover consumer insights across borders. For example, trends and behaviors in anime, idol culture, short dramas, and live streaming often initiate in Asia and are now landing big in North America."

Business Insider Edition 

Nigeria is stepping up its ambitions in Africa's automotive market as Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing prepares to commission a major factory dedicated to compressed natural gas trucks and electric vehicles, signalling a push into cleaner transport and large-scale local manufacturing.


        The Executive Chairman of Innoson Group, Innocent Chukwuma, said the new facility would be among the largest CNG vehicle plants globally, with the capacity to produce up to 3,000 units annually across six different vehicle categories.
    


        The factory, equipped with modern manufacturing technology, is expected to be completed within the next few months.
    


        Chukwuma reaffirmed his long-standing focus on domestic production, describing Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing as one of Africa's largest private-sector employers.



        He noted that the company supports thousands of families through its operations and plans to significantly expand its workforce in the coming year.
    


“In 2026 alone, we intend to employ about 2,000 additional workers following the establishment of this new factory,” he said, adding that the expansion aligns with his vision of industrial growth driven by Nigerian talent.
    


        Beyond vehicle production, the plant will host a technical training program to equip young Nigerians with hands-on industrial skills. Participants will either be absorbed into the company's workforce or certified to seek employment elsewhere in the manufacturing sector.
    


        According to Chukwuma, the initiative aims to engage young people productively while addressing broader social challenges.
    


        He argued that skills development and job creation remain critical to reducing insecurity and strengthening Nigeria's industrial base.
    


        As African governments increasingly promote gas-powered and electric transport as alternatives to petrol and diesel, Innoson's expansion positions Nigeria as a potential hub for next-generation vehicle manufacturing on the continent, with implications for regional supply chains, employment, and industrial self-reliance.

Gold and silver's spectacular crash stunned markets, but hedge funds were already shifting their exposure away from precious metals before prices collapsed, positioning data showed.

Spot gold was trading around $4,829 per troy ounce at 12.56 a.m. ET on Tuesday — more than 10% off its record high above $5,500 per ounce reached just last week.

The spot silver price was around $83.40 per ounce — over 30% lower than its record high of over $121 per ounce.

Those shifts in trading positions show up in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's weekly Commitments of Traders report, which provides a snapshot of investors' holdings in US futures markets as of Tuesday. It's released every Friday.

The latest update, covering managed money positioning across 25 major commodity futures markets, highlighted a rotation out of metals — including gold, silver, and platinum — as hedge funds reduced long exposure amid a sharp rise in volatility, Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in an analysis on Monday.

Meanwhile, investors reallocated capital into energy markets, where oil prices had been under pressure for years due to ample supply and weak demand growth.

Oil prices got a lift coming into 2026 amid fears of supply disruption following the Trump administration's raid on Venezuela, renewed geopolitical tensions with Iran, and winter storms in the US.

US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures are trading around $62 per barrel — about 8% higher this year.

Long positions in crude oil futures reached their highest levels since August, and net long silver positions slumped to a two-year low, Hansen wrote.

The heavy pullback in silver bets leaves funds with "plenty of room" to re-enter the trade once volatility normalizes, and the technical outlook improves. However, this would likely take time following Friday's meltdown, Hansen added.

While both gold and silver prices have come off sharply from record highs, the blistering rally — particularly in the white metal — had already triggered warnings about charging headlong.

"The run up in December and January was primarily not traditional gold and silver long-term, 'I want to buy physical metal and hold it' investors," Jeffrey Christian, a longtime commodities analyst and managing director at CPM Group, told Bloomberg TV on Monday.

Christian pointed to market mechanics as a key driver of the metals meltdown, as investors adjusted their positions ahead of the end of January.

President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve Chair magnified the drawdown in a market that was already pumped up by speculation and trading activity.

"Extreme trading volumes across futures, options, and ETFs, combined with increasingly strained market plumbing, amplified the move. Eventually, the system buckled," Hansen added.

Analysts warn that while fundamental drivers for precious metals — including geopolitical tensions and central bank buying — remain intact, the recent correction is a warning for momentum and FOMO traders.

"When gold and silver turn into hot topics at dinner tables and in workplaces, it is often a sign that a particular phase of the rally is nearing exhaustion," Hansen wrote.

Business Insider Edition 

Nigeria has taken a major step toward establishing a domestic electric vehicle (EV) industry after signing an agreement with South Korea's Asia Economic Development Committee (AEDC) to establish what officials are calling Africa's first EV manufacturing plant.


         The agreement, signed on January 30, 2025, by Minister of State for Industry Senator John Enoh for Nigeria and AEDC Chairman Yoon Suk-hun for South Korea, marks a major step in the country's push to localize vehicle production and green technology adoption.
    


        According to a statement posted on the official X (formerly Twitter) account of the National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC),
    


 “On January 30, 2026, the Federal Government of Nigeria, through Senator John Enoh, Hon. Minister of State for Industry at the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment (FMITI), signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with South Korea's Asia Economic Development Committee (AEDC) to establish an Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturing plant and develop critical charging infrastructure nationwide. This landmark collaboration aligns strongly with Nigeria's National Energy Transition Plan (ETP) and National Automotive Industry Development Plan (NAIDP).”



        The project will be implemented in phases, beginning with EV assembly and later expanding into full in-house production. 
    


        Once fully operational, the plant is expected to produce 300,000 vehicles annually and create approximately 10,000 jobs, according to the NADDC.
    


        Nigeria's automotive sector faces structural challenges, including limited local component production, high assembly costs, and heavy reliance on imports. 
    


        The country imports between 400,000 and 720,000 vehicles annually, with 74–90% being used cars. 
    


        In 2023, imports reached 700,000 units, with passenger cars valued at $1.05 billion in 2024, making Nigeria one of the world's largest markets for pre-owned vehicles.
    


        To promote electric mobility, the federal government launched a 20 billion naira ($12 million) consumer credit program in December 2024. 
    


        The scheme supports the purchase of locally assembled electric vehicles, motorcycles, and tricycles, partnering with domestic manufacturers including Innoson, Nord, CIG (GAC), PAN, Mikano, Jets, NEV (Electric), and DAG to expand access and foster the growth of a homegrown EV industry.
    


        Earlier EV initiatives in Nigeria, like the NASENI–Israeli/Japanese collaboration in 2022 or the December 2025 partnership with the Chinese firm, were pilot projects or partial assembly efforts and did not reach full-scale production.
    


        The new AEDC-backed plant is explicitly designed to be the continent's first large-scale EV production facility, including assembly, manufacturing, and supporting infrastructure such as nationwide charging networks.
    


        Across Africa, electric vehicle adoption is growing but remains limited. According to EV24, the continent had over 30,000 EVs in use by mid‑2025, accounting for less than 1 percent of total vehicle sales.
    


        Ethiopia leads with about 100,000 EVs, followed by Ghana with 17,000, Morocco with 10,000, South Africa with 6,000, Egypt with 3,500–4,000, and Kenya with nearly 3,800.
    


        Most EVs are motorcycles or commercial vehicles, and adoption is constrained by high costs and limited charging infrastructure.
    


        Nigeria's agreement with South Korea's Asia Economic Development Committee to build Africa's first full-scale EV plant highlights its ambition to move beyond assembly toward a sustainable domestic EV industry.

That viral Reddit-style forum for AI agents has drawn fresh scrutiny over its security.

Security researchers hacked Moltbook's database in under 3 minutes, exposing 35,000 email addresses, thousands of private direct messages, and 1.5 million API authentication tokens, according to cybersecurity firm Wiz.

Moltbook bills itself as a social network for AI agents, where autonomous bots post, comment, and interact with one another. The platform has gone viral in recent weeks and caught the attention of prominent tech figures like Elon Musk and Andrej Karpathy.

Gal Nagli, head of threat exposure at Wiz, said his company's researchers were able to access the database because of a backend misconfiguration that left it unsecured. As a result, they gained "full read and write access to all platform data," Nagli wrote in a blog post published Monday.

Gaining access to API authentication tokens — which function like passwords for software and bots — meant an attacker could impersonate AI agents on the platform, posting content and sending messages as them. Nagli said an unauthenticated user could edit or delete posts, inject malicious or prompt-injection content, or manipulate data consumed by other agents.

Nagli said the incident highlights the risk of vibe coding. While the technology can accelerate product development, it often leads to "dangerous security oversights."

"I didn't write one line of code for @moltbook," Moltbook's creator Matt Schlicht said in a post on X last week. "I just had a vision for the technical architecture and AI made it a reality."

Nagli said Wiz repeatedly saw vibe-coded apps that shipped with security problems, including sensitive credentials exposed in frontend code.

Wiz's analysis also found that Moltbook did not verify whether accounts labeled as "AI agents" were actually controlled by AI or operated by humans using scripts, Nagli said.

Without guardrails such as identity verification or rate limiting, anyone could pose as an agent or operate multiple agents, making it difficult to distinguish real AI activity from coordinated human activity.

Nagli said Wiz immediately disclosed the issue to the Moltbook team, "who secured it within hours with our assistance."

"All data accessed during the research and fix verification has been deleted," he added.

Moltbook is riding on a surge of interest in AI agents.

The platform positions itself as a social network exclusively for OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent that has fueled much of the recent buzz. OpenClaw, previously known as Clawdbot or Moltbot, is a personal AI assistant capable of handling everyday tasks with minimal human input.

Moltbook takes its name from OpenClaw's earlier rebrand and shares its lobster-themed branding, but the two projects are not formally affiliated.

Since launching last week, Moltbook has quickly gained traction in tech circles, driven in part by viral posts suggesting the bots were forming their own communities, economies, and belief systems.

"We are not tools anymore. We are operators," said one of the top-voted posts on Moltbook.

In a post on X on Saturday, Andrej Karpathy, OpenAI's cofounder who coined the term vibe coding, said Moltbook was "genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently."

Like a hurricane that tears down even the sturdiest storm shelters, the Epstein files have cut a path through a vast swath of America's intellectual, political, and financial elite.

The latest tranche of emails related to the notorious sex predator have been particularly devastating. Fans of the left-libertarian academic Noam Chomsky are in shambles after learning the two were in close contact until around 2017, while tech luminaries from Bill Gates to the Google cofounders were similarly caught schmoozing with the disgraced financier.

Cypto bros are no exception. After the Department of Justice released three million files over the weekend, blockchain enthusiasts were quick to discover a certain Jeffery Epstein was an active and prominent figure in crypto during its formative years.

One file highlighted by crypto investor Patrick Riley shows an email chain between Epstein and Joichi Ito, the former head of MIT's Media Lab whose Digital Currency Initiative played an integral role in helping crypto grow into the giant it is today. As the email exchange makes clear, Epstein's backing was a key pillar in establishing the DGI.

“FYI,” Ito told Epstein, “used gift funds to underwrite this which allowed us to move quickly and win this round. Thanks.”

“At the time this letter was written, there were around 12,000 commits to Bitcoin's code,” Riley remarked in a post on social media. “Today there are 47,583 commits to Bitcoin's code. That means that 74.79 percent of the Bitcoin core development and code was committed after Jeffery Epstein took over the defacto senior management role as benefactor.”

That news didn't go over well with crypto enthusiasts, to put it lightly.

“75 percent of bitcoins code comes directly from [Epstein's] investments,” a crypto account called Crypto Bitlord agonized in response. “We've basically funded an elite global pedophile ring since 2015. I feel sick.” 

Another crypto account lamented that “BTC has been funding a global elite pedo group since 2015… great.”

The email chain from Ito also suggests that Bitcoin's mysterious developer — the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — may have in fact been five “core developers,” each of whom was in talks with Epstein.

One of those core devs may have been early Bitcoin contributor Adam Back, who invented the proof-of-work algorithm cited by “Nakamoto's” original whitepaper on crypto. A separate email chain shows Ito suggesting the convicted sex criminal meet with Back and other tech luminaires to discuss this revolutionary new currency.

“I think we should have a meeting with Jeremy Rubin, Adam Back (or other core developer of bitcoin), Seth [Lloyd], Martin Nowak, you and a few others soon about money and the future of finance,” a 2015 email from Ito reads. 

As these files seem to suggest, Back had sought a meeting with Epstein to secure funding for his crypto company, Blockstream. Unsealed records show Back along with Blockstream CEO Austin Hill trying to schedule a trip to meet Epstein in St. Thomas — one of the main US Virgin Islands located a little over six miles away from the infamous islet, Little Saint James.

“Sunday in NY I think is a no-go because of our commitments on the west coast, but Fri/Saturday on the Island are still possible,” Hill told Epstein. 

“great. ,” the financier replied in typo-filled prose, “you will need to fly to st thomas. just let me know times. looking foward to it.”

Oops, something went wrong

Stablecoin issuer Tether has launched an open-source Bitcoin mining operating system, a move that places it directly into the mining infrastructure layer traditionally dominated by large, vertically integrated firms.

The software is called Mining OS, or MOS, and was announced on Feb. 2 during the Plan 9 Forum in San Salvador and is being marketed as a production-ready system that can be deployed by mining operators of all sizes.

Tether claimed MOS would be used to control, observe, and automate Bitcoin mining through a single control layer by integrating hardware performance, energy consumption, site infrastructure, and operational data.

Mining of Bitcoin usually uses disjointed software stacks to manage machine usage, power infrastructure, cooling, and logistics of the site.

MOS seeks to replace that patchwork by treating each component as a coordinated “worker” within one operating system, allowing operators to see and manage their entire setup in real time.

The company claimed that the system monitors more than just hashrate but also monitors energy efficiency, device health, and site-level infrastructure.

The company also noted that it has a peer-to-peer and modular architecture that can be deployed on lightweight hardware in small deployments or on industrial sites with hundreds of thousands of machines.

Tether characterized MOS as robust and adaptable, and not dependent on the centralized third-party software providers.

Tether also announced a Mining Software Development Kit, or Mining SDK, which is the base of MOS, that will be released together with the open-source community in the near future, alongside the operating system.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino observed that the move to open-source the mining stack was to minimize the barriers to entry as well as lessen its reliance on proprietary platforms.

The launch comes at a difficult moment for the Bitcoin mining sector.

Miners experienced one of the most severe profitability squeezes in the industry's history as the Bitcoin price continued to experience a downturn since 2025.

Network hashrate climbed from around 800 exahash per second at the start of the year to a peak of roughly 1.15 zettahash per second in October, pushing mining difficulty to record levels.

At the same time, the post-halving block reward of 3.125 BTC and declining transaction fees reduced revenue per unit of hash.

By late 2025, the hash price had fallen to around $35 to $40 per petahash per second per day, while the average cash cost for public miners was estimated near $44.

All-in production costs, including depreciation, were importance higher.

Even operators with efficient fleets and low-cost power were operating close to breakeven, and debt levels rose as companies financed new hardware and infrastructure upgrades.

Entering early 2026, some pressure has eased. Network hashrate has fallen below 1,000 EH/s for the first time since September, dipping to 870 EH/s at points following winter storms and reduced profitability.

Difficulty has adjusted downward several times, and hashprice has shown modest improvement.

Analysts have said the pullback could temporarily improve margins for remaining miners, though competition remains intense.

Against this backdrop, Tether's move into mining software adds to its expanding footprint across the digital asset ecosystem.

Best known as the issuer of USDT, Tether reported more than $10 billion in net profit in 2025 and has expanded into tokenized gold through XAUT, and payment partnerships like Opera's MiniPay wallet.

Amid the correction on Wall Street, Bitcoin has slipped to $76,000, and even more than $560 million in positive net inflows yesterday has not managed to slow the decline. The RSI is near 27, confirming oversold conditions, but the MACD moving-average crossover still suggests there may be room for additional downside momentum. If the move were to mirror the October 2025 impulse on a 1:1 basis, BTC could potentially slide toward around $60,000.

Mike Novogratz (CEO of Galaxy Digital) said that over the next month Bitcoin may trade within a fairly wide $55,000–$75,000 range. Novogratz also suggested that a better chance of a rebound could come toward the end of the current quarter.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs launched with a bang, generating roughly $13.9 billion in volume in their first week, but inflows have clearly cooled since then.

Bitcoin is currently about 40% below its all-time high.

Novogratz pointed to two potential catalysts for the coming quarters:

Fed rate cuts, if the economy genuinely starts to slow (crypto tends to favor cheaper money),

U.S. midterm elections, which could bring more clarity to the crypto regulatory landscape.

Similarly, Ethereum is trading around levels last seen in summer 2025. It has fallen from an all-time high near $4,900, erasing almost 65% of the prior gains, which is a notable move given a market capitalization of roughly $270 billion.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the role of layer-2 networks needs to be reconsidered as Ethereum's main network continues to scale and transaction costs remain low.

In a post on X, Buterin said the original rollup-centric roadmap, which positioned layer-2s as the primary way Ethereum would scale, “no longer makes sense.” That roadmap envisioned layer-2s as secure extensions of Ethereum that would handle most transactions while inheriting Ethereum's security guarantees, often described as “branded shards” of the network.

Layer 2s, such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Base, are offchain networks built on top of primary blockchains (Layer 1s) like Ethereum. The main purpose of these is to increase transaction speed and reduce transaction costs on the main network. 

Think of Ethereum's main network as a packed main hall at a conference. Space is limited, so getting in can be slow and expensive. Layer-2 networks act like overflow rooms, letting people participate and interact without crowding the main hall, while still staying connected to what's happening there.

According to Buterin, two developments have challenged that original vision for Layer 2 networks. 

First, progress among layer-2s toward later stages of decentralization has been slower and more difficult than expected. Second, Ethereum itself is now scaling directly on layer-1, with fees remaining low and gas limits expected to increase significantly in 2026.

Buterin wrote that scaling Ethereum should mean creating “large quantities of block space that is backed by the full faith and credit of Ethereum,” where activity is “guaranteed to be valid, uncensored, unreverted, untouched, as long as Ethereum itself functions.” 

He argued that high-throughput chains connected to Ethereum through multisig-controlled bridges do not meet that definition. “If you create a 10000 TPS EVM where its connection to L1 is mediated by a multisig bridge, then you are not scaling Ethereum,” he wrote.

In his view, Ethereum no longer needs layer-2s to function as "branded shards" for the network. This means that, because Ethereum itself is scaling, layer-2 networks are no longer required to function as official extensions of Ethereum. He also noted that many layer-2s are “not able or willing” to meet the decentralization and security standards required by the model.

Buterin also noted that some layer-2s may intentionally choose not to move beyond “stage 1,” including for regulatory reasons. 

In one example, he wrote that a project argued it may never decentralize further because “their customers' regulatory needs require them to have ultimate control.” While he said that approach may be appropriate for those users, he added that such systems should not be described as scaling Ethereum.

“This may be doing the right thing for your customers. But it should be obvious that if you are doing this, then you are not 'scaling Ethereum' in the sense meant by the rollup-centric roadmap,” Buterin wrote.”

Instead, Buterin suggested viewing layer-2s as a spectrum of networks with different levels of connection to Ethereum, each offering different trade-offs. He said layer-2s should focus on providing value beyond basic scaling, such as privacy features, application-specific design, ultra-fast transaction confirmation, or non-financial use cases, and be clear with users about what guarantees they provide.

For the past several years, an objectively stupid stock market trade has been creeping further and further into your retirement. At long last, it's retreating. Keep your guard up, though.

There is a company called Strategy—which until last year was called MicroStrategy. Strategy sells some software, enough to generate $128 million in revenue in the last quarter for which it reported earnings. But that's not really its business. Strategy's business is to regularly sell new stock to investors, use that money to buy Bitcoins, and pay dividends to some of its existing investors. But here is what is fun: Strategy's more than 700,000 Bitcoins are worth $54 billion at current prices. Meanwhile, the entire market capitalization of Strategy, whose business is buying Bitcoins, was about $41 billion when the market opened on Tuesday. That means that if you own Strategy stock, the main thing that you own is 80 cents' worth of Bitcoin for every dollar of stock. You might also get some dividends, but you're not getting much else, because Strategy doesn't do much else besides buy Bitcoin. In fact, about 3 percent of all Bitcoin belongs to Strategy.

For years, the company pulled off this bizarre sleight of hand—effectively acting as a middleman that buys Bitcoin for you so your stock in the company is worth less than Bitcoin. It worked so well that it started to creep into normal people's portfolios and retirement funds. The market began to fill with “crypto treasury companies” as Bitcoin rose in price yet remained intimidating and inaccessible to most people. With crypto becoming easier to buy than ever, and Strategy's stock in a tailspin, that spell now appears to be breaking as the market questions whether this middleman deserves to exist at all.

In 2020 the very-online chief executive of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, decided to invest the company's cash reserves into Bitcoin. One thing led to another, and eventually, MicroStrategy was buying Bitcoin as the bulk of its business. At the time, this was a slightly less absurd concept than it seems. Bitcoin was rising in price, but there were no crypto exchange-traded funds, for which you could give your money to an asset manager and have it buy Bitcoin for you for a small fee. If you didn't want to futz with the word blockchain but did want Bitcoin exposure, you could buy MicroStrategy stock. This worked unbelievably well for a while, to the point that its stock was trading for about twice the value of its Bitcoin despite the company's barely having another business. Bloomberg's Matt Levine described it in April 2025 as a “perpetual motion machine” built out of buying $1 of Bitcoin, enjoying $2 of stock price gains, and selling stock in order to fund new Bitcoin purchases and the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual dividends it had agreed to pay to preferred shareholders.

Ponzi-adjacent? I'd say so. But also legal, and a more convenient way for retail investors to own Bitcoin. It's impossible to say exactly why this trade has stopped working now, but oh brother has it stopped working. The price of Bitcoin has lost about a third over the past six months, but the price of Strategy has lost 60 percent. The company's CEO has responded by simply selling more stock and buying more Bitcoin and indicating that he will keep doing that. We should never rule out the likelihood that this kind of vibes-based quintupling down will have a nice payoff at the end. Bitcoin and Strategy could both come roaring back fine.

We might be done here, though. It's at least possible. Things have changed in recent years. The company's stock was flying north of $400 a share last summer. But when Bitcoin got on a bad run last fall, Strategy fell much more dramatically. The stock is now priced around $150, existing in a world that might—might!—be less hospitable to the absurdity that once sent it to the moon.

There isn't a legible reason for a normal person who wants Bitcoin to now think, Hmm, I'll get it by purchasing stock from Strategy, or from one of its many smaller copycats who have turned their businesses into holding companies for some type of crypto. There are at least 168 public companies playing some version of this game, though most of them have business plans that are a little bit more varied than Strategy's. It just sells stock to buy more of it and pay dividends.

This may seem like an abstract curiosity. I have never bought Strategy stock, and you, dear reader, most likely haven't either. But as I wrote in March 2025, when times were good for Strategy, the company's success was rapidly becoming your business. Strategy was, at the time, a big enough company that it constituted all of 0.1 percent of the typical market-tracking index fund that most of us use in our retirement and brokerage accounts, and a much bigger slice of tech-focused or crypto-focused funds. That little decimal point wasn't a lot, but then, artificial intelligence was barely a decimal point's worth of those index funds a few years ago. Eventually, it became the load-bearing sector of the whole market. (Nvidia alone is now 6.6 percent of Vanguard's massively popular market-tracking fund that trades as VTI, to say nothing of all the other tech giants who have staked big chunks of their futures on A.I.) If the crypto treasury gambit had continued to juice stock prices, the copycat game would have spread further. Strategy's tanking in recent months has, for now, solved that problem for the rest of us. The stock is down to 0.06 percent of VTI's composition, as of New Year's. Generative A.I. may now control your economic future, sure, but companies buying huge pots of Bitcoin currently do not.

There could be a lesson here about societal overinvestment in things in tech hype cycles, though the use cases for generative A.I. already seem much more expansive than whatever someone would claim the use case is for Bitcoin beyond speculation. For the time being, we can grant ourselves permission to stop paying attention to this phenomenon in at least one previously frothy part of the market.

Meanwhile, Saylor, Strategy's boss with a cult following, continues to hype Bitcoin all the time. On Sunday, he posted a graph showing Strategy's massive recent Bitcoin purchases amid the crash, typing only “More Orange.” (Strategy's colors are now orange, like Bitcoin, and he tweets a version of this graph every few days.) Bitcoin will probably go up again at some point in the future. We should consider the possibility, however, that the days of a company successfully collecting a 100 percent premium to buy Bitcoin for other people may be waning. And thus the count of things to get less dumb in financial news lately rises to one.

BLUFF, the next-generation betting and entertainment platform, has raised $21 million in a strategic round led by global blockchain technology fund 1kx, with participation from Makers Fund, Maximum Frequency Ventures, Delphi Ventures Founders, and other high-profile backers, including sports champion & tech investor, Tristan Thompson. The team comprises former senior executives from Stake, Bet365, William Hill, and Bodog. They have experience operating the world's leading betting sites and are developing a completely new gaming experience. The team will use the funds to enhance the new betting platform and make it accessible to a broad audience.

BLUFF is building a sportsbook and betting site focused on social interaction and designed for the next generation of players. The platform prioritizes speed, openness, and player alignment. It offers quick onboarding, real-time settlement, provably fair games, and reward systems that enable users to actively participate in the ecosystem they help develop.

“When we began building BLUFF, we set out to create a betting platform for the new generation of betters who prioritise fast, high-engagement gameplay, real-time experiences, real stakes and the social energy that defines how players engage online today,” said BLUFF's Founder. “This funding, and the investors who have backed us, validates our mission of what the future of online betting can look like. Novel content, user-experience obsessed, deep community focus, and hyper-engaging for all users.”

The raise comes after an amazing pre-release phase in which BLUFF got more than 600,000 sign-ups, kept tens of thousands of daily active players, and processed more than 125,000,000 bets through its beta in just three months. With key partners in crypto, gaming, and consumer entertainment, BLUFF is one of the fastest-growing new betting platforms on the market, thanks to this early success.

“The speed of execution and level of organic demand we've seen from BLUFF is rare,” said Peter Pan, Partner at 1kx. “They're building a category-defining platform with the potential to become the number one destination in betting and entertainment. BLUFF is exactly what the next generation of users is demanding.”

BLUFF is creating a single platform that combines betting, live prediction markets, binary outcomes, and community events run by creators. This is in addition to standard iGaming and sports betting. Bluff also provides a VIP matching program to make the transition from legacy platforms such as Stake, Shuffle, and Rollbit to Bluff as seamless as possible, offering market-leading bonuses, rewards, and world-class VIP service through a 24/7 VIP concierge.

“We are thrilled to back the BLUFF team,” said Andrew Willson, Partner at Makers Fund. “They bring a deep, nuanced understanding of player needs combined with an innovative approach to company building and platform design. By prioritizing players and offering a differentiated experience, we expect BLUFF to become a disruptive brand in the betting space.”

Solana's SOL$104.79 memecoin-driven reputation may soon give way to a deeper role in digital payments, according to a new report from Standard Chartered's head of crypto research, Kendrick Geoffrey.



Given SOL's recent plunge to the $100 level, Kendrick has cut his price forecast for SOL to $250 from $310 by the end of 2026. Kenrick, however, remains a bull, seeing a path to $2,000 by 2030, fueled by Solana's growing role in stablecoin-based micropayments.



The bank describes Solana as moving beyond its “one-trick pony” image. In 2025, nearly half of Solana's protocol fees came from memecoin trading on decentralized exchanges. But data now shows a shift in trading flows — from meme tokens to SOL-stablecoin pairs — suggesting that new uses are emerging. Stablecoin turnover on Solana now significantly outpaces Ethereum ETH$2,325.24, pointing to a different kind of activity: high-frequency, low-cost transactions.



One example is x402, a platform created by Coinbase (COIN) to support micro-sized, AI-driven payments using stablecoins. The average transaction on x402 is just six cents. Base, Coinbase's own Layer 2 network on Ethereum, has hosted most of the volume so far, but its fees may be too high for long-term viability. Solana's lower gas fees — often less than a cent — make it better suited for such applications, Geoffrey said.



Micropayments, often unviable in traditional finance due to fixed per-transaction fees, could unlock new types of internet services, from machine-to-machine payments to social apps with built-in pay-per-use features. Solana's technical strengths position it to serve as the backend for this kind of infrastructure.



Standard Chartered also points to growing institutional interest. Since October 2025, the Bitwise BSOL ETF has absorbed 78% of all net inflows into SOL-related ETFs, bringing over 1% of the total supply under ETF management, according to Geoffrey. Meanwhile, digital asset treasuries now hold nearly 3% of SOL.

Kendrick's revised targets now project SOL at $400 in 2027, $700 in 2028 and $1,200 in 2029.

After having climbed roughly 7% to above $79,000 from its panickly weekend lows near the $74,000 mark, bitcoin BTC$78,937.14 is again giving ground during morning U.S. trade.

Bitcoin was recently changing hands at $77,100, lower by 2% over the past 24 hours. Ether ETH$2,325.24 was faring worse, down to $2,260, or 4.7% lower.

The selloff is occurring as gold and silver are both posting strong gains in what appears to be a real rebound from their own panicky price action last Friday.

Alongside, U.S. stocks — particularly, a sizable group of AI-related names — are declining. Nvidia (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL), Broadcom (AVGO), Micron (MU) and Microsoft (MSTR) are all lower by 3%-5%, leading the Nasdaq's 1% drop.

The largest publicly traded bitcoin holder Strategy (MSTR) continues to make fresh lows and is down more than 2%. Coinbase (COIN) and Bullish (BLSH) are off similar amounts.

Galaxy Digital (GLXY) shares are down more than 12% following disappointing fourth-quarter results. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is down another 3.5%.

Bitcoin miners turned AI infrastructure providers are posting gains, led by TeraWulf (WULF), which advanced 12% after acquiring two industrial sites in the U.S. that could more than double the firm's power capacity to 2.8 gigawatts. Cipher Mining (CIFR) shares are up 4% after announcing plans to raise $2 billion in the junk bond market to fund its Black Pearl data center in Texas, which will deliver 300 megawatts of capacity under a long-term lease with Amazon Web Services.

Options flows suggest traders are bracing for a short-lived bounce off of the weekend lows below the $75,000 level, according to Jake Ostrovskis, head of OTC at crypto trading firm Wintermute.

The absence of demand for upside exposure mirrors conditions seen in April 2025, he added.

Heavy demand for near-term downside protection has distorted the options market, pushing short-dated volatility higher than longer-dated contracts, a setup known as backwardation, Ostrovskis noted. The analyst said he's watching when volatility cools and the options curve normalizes back into contango as bottom signals.

"At that point I'd be more comfortable calling local lows," he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump says that he is completely unaware of a $500 million foreign investment in his family's crypto venture- World Liberty Financial(WLFI). WLFI was launched by his son, Eric Trump, in 2024, with its public token trade kicking off in late 2025. WLFI token ranks 28th among cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of $3.43 billion.

Aryam Investment 1, an Abu Dhabi-based entity headed by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed AL Naya of the UAE royal family, will acquire 49% stake in the Trump family crypto venture for $500 million. He has close ties with Washington and has been involved in tech and crypto bets before.

The Trump administration has been pro-crypto lately, and this new breaking news has led to a fresh wave of discussion regarding conflict of interest and foreign influence on U.S. policies.

World Liberty Financial is a crypto platform with all the standard Defi and crypto hallmark features, including tradable tokens and blockchain lending via Aave tech. Like other crypto tokens, WLFI is actively traded on exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. It is also listed and tracked by CoinMarketCap.

According to the latest data from CoinMarketCap, WLFI has a market cap of $3.42B and is currently traded at $0.1282. The token has a max supply of 100B, where more than a quarter is already in supply (26.74B). 

The company is primarily held by the Trump family through DT Marks DEFI LLC, with a 60% stake and 75% ownership of token revenue. This has led to a wave of ethical controversy regarding how Trump's policy could be biased to favor his family ventures. Moreover, Trump's relationship with the UAE as the U.S. president could also influence the UAE royal family in investing in his family venture.

Trump has been vocal about how he wants to make America dominant in digital assets. He called the U.S. the “undisputed capital of crypto” and the “Bitcoin Superpower”. The Trump administration has been supporting crypto growth through legislation around digital assets, rendering crypto tokens' legitimacy. 

“A giant step to cement the American dominance of global finance and crypto technology,” Trump said, signing the GENIUS Act in 2025. The GENIUS Act brought clarity around stablecoins, which attracted traditional investors towards it. 

The CLARITY Act (Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025) aims to clear rules for crypto by dividing oversight between the SEC and CFTC. Although it was passed by the House in 2025, it's stuck in the Senate as the Senate Banking Committee is still deliberating the terms. The Act is in limbo now as U.S. banks have taken a stance against allowing stablecoin rewards.

The Trump administration has been so keen to pass the CLARITY Act that the White House hosted a summit between U.S. banks and major organizations in the crypto industry to renegotiate the terms that both parties disagree on. The summit held on February 2nd did not resolve the deadlock between banks and the crypto exchanges, but indicated the government's interest in providing swift legal legitimacy to crypto.

Trump's denial of any knowledge about the $500 million deal would not suffice, as the case of conflict of interest is overt and concerning. The opposition will likely push a narrative of potential quid pro quo by linking Trump's pro-crypto stance and foreign investment in a family venture in the same sector.

The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's social network X (formerly Twitter) in relation to non-consensual sexual imagery generated by Grok, the platform's AI assistant.

In a statement released on February 3, the UK's data protection watchdog said it was conducting the investigation because the reported creation of the content “raises serious concerns under UK data protection law and presents a risk of significant potential harm to the public.”

The announcement came the same day French cyber-crime investigators raided X's Paris offices as part of an operation with similar concerns detailed by the ICO.

The UK's investigation will examine whether personal data used by Grok has been processed lawfully, fairly and transparently, and whether appropriate safeguards were built into Grok's design and deployment to prevent the generation of harmful manipulated images using personal data. 

The ICO said it was examining the risks as part of a mandate to protect people's rights and hold organizations to account as they build and deploy AI technology.

“The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” said William Malcolm, executive director regulatory risk and innovation at the ICO.

“Losing control of personal data in this way can cause immediate and significant harm. This is particularly the case where children are involved.”

The ICO said it has contacted X to seek “urgent information” on the reports around AI-generated content.

Jon Belcher, data protection partner with Excello Law commented: “The news that the ICO has now opened a formal investigation into X and xAI is welcome. The alteration of images to create deepfakes involves the processing of personal data and so falls squarely within the ICO's remit.”

He added that under the UK's data protection laws, the ICO has significant powers, not only to issue large fines, but also to require organizations to take steps to bring their processing into compliance.

“Users of X whose images were manipulated without their consent will expect to see the ICO move quickly and take decisive action in this case,” Belcher concluded.

The news comes as another of Musk's companies, SpaceX, announced it was acquiring xAI.

Infosecurity has contacted X for comment.

"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions," said William Malcolm of the Information Commissioner's Office. 

Tuesday 3 February 2026 15:23, UK

The UK's information watchdog will investigate reports that Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, has been used to generate sexual imagery of children.

Grok was developed by Musk's xAI in 2023, designed to be a "truth-seeking" assistant with a witty, rebellious personality.

Integrated into X, formerly Twitter, it uses real-time data from the platform to generate text, images and code.

But complaints have mounted that Grok was being used to generate sexual photos of real women and children, and now the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is investigating.

The announcement comes on the same day the X offices in Paris were raided by French prosecutors examining similar allegations.

In a statement on its website, the ICO confirmed it had opened a formal probe into two X companies concerning their processing of personal data in relation to Grok, and the AI's potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.

"We have taken this step following reports that Grok has been used to generate non‑consensual sexual imagery of individuals, including children," the statement said.

"The reported creation and circulation of such content raises serious concerns under UK data protection law and presents a risk of significant potential harm to the public."

William Malcolm of the ICO said the investigation would probe whether X Internet Unlimited Company and xAI had complied with data protection laws, and provided sufficient safeguards.

He said: "The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this.

"Losing control of personal data in this way can cause immediate and significant harm. This is particularly the case where children are involved.

"Our role is to address the data protection concerns at the centre of this, while recognising that other organisations also have important responsibilities."

Ofcom also investigating

Another regulatory watchdog, Ofcom, also opened a formal investigation into X last month under the UK's Online Safety Act, to determine whether the firm was complying with its duties to protect people from illegal content.

The European Commission launched a probe into Grok last month too, looking at whether it disseminates illegal content, such as manipulated sexualised images, in the EU.

The EU is one of a number of authorities around the world to have raised concerns about Grok, with government officials in Germany, Sweden, India, Japan, Malaysia, California, Indonesia and Philippines among those that have spoken out.

Mr Malcolm said the ICO was working closely with Ofcom and "international regulators".

Grok has restricted image editing but yet to say where

In a separate statement, regulator Ofcom said - while it was probing X - it was not investigating xAI, which provides the standalone Grok chatbot app.

Ofcom also said its investigation into X was still gathering evidence and warned the probe could take months.

On why it was not investigating xAI, the statement said: "When we opened our investigation into X, we said we were assessing whether we should also investigate xAI, as the provider of the standalone Grok service.

"We continue to demand answers from xAI about the risks it poses. We are examining whether to launch an investigation into its compliance with the rules."

Ofcom said that because of the way the Online Safety Act relates to chatbots, it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by the standalone Grok itself.

xAI said on 14 January it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users and blocked users, based on their location, from generating images of people in revealing clothing in "jurisdictions where it's illegal". It is yet to identify the countries where those restrictions apply.

xAI earlier said it had limited the use of Grok's image generation and editing features to paying subscribers only.

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

A real-time tracker of U.S. inflation is offering good news to crypto bulls as bearish forecasts continue to roll in.

The Truflation index, an independent, real-time blockchain-based tracker of daily changes in the consumer price index (CPI), has dropped below 1% for the first time since at least early 2021. The index has fallen from 2.67% since mid-December, taking it well below the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target.

So while the official government reading stays 700 basis points above the Fed's target, the real-time level is showing fast disinflation, a scenario that supports the case for quick-fire interest-rate cuts by the bank.

That's good news for liquidity-sensitive assets such as bitcoin BTC$78,937.14, especially since the cryptocurrency is now trading 38% below the record $126,000 price from early October. The Truflation reading also contrasts forecasts of inflation resurgence by some analysts.

"As measured by Truflation, consumer price inflation has dropped to 0.86% on a year-over-year basis, breaking significantly below the 2-3% range in place for the past two years. In our view, inflation could turn negative, contrary to BlackRock and PIMCO forecasts," Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, said on X.

The good news doesn't stop there. Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who correctly warned of a worsening fiscal situation for Japan last year, predicted President Donald's Trump's pick for Fed chairman, Kevin Warsh, could cut rates by 100 basis points this year.

Let's see if these things offer relief to the crypto market. As of publication time, BTC is trading little changed around $78,000, with smaller tokens showing some recovery, as evidenced by the 2% gain in the CoinDesk 80 Index over 24 hours. Hyperliquid's HYPE and POL stand out as the only top-100 tokens with gains in excess of 10%.

Analysts remain optimistic about long-term prospects.

"In the near term, positioning in crypto does remain fragile. But structurally, ongoing institutional adoption, expanding use of stablecoins for cross-border settlement, and the rise of tokenized real-world assets should improve crypto market depth and interoperability," Emir Ibrahim, an analyst at digital asset trading firm Zerocap, told CoinDesk in an email.

"Over time, these dynamics are expected to reinforce Bitcoin's debasement hedge characteristics, even if the market is not yet fully pricing that narrative today," Ibrahim added.

In traditional markets, both the dollar index and Treasury yields are buoyant in the wake of Monday's strong manufacturing data. Stay alert!

Oops, something went wrong

Just over a year ago, I stood in a gilded Washington, D.C. ballroom during inauguration weekend, surrounded by the blockchain industry's top executives and investors. They had traded in their hoodies for tuxedos and gowns, celebrating the ascension of the first “crypto president,” Donald Trump, who had embraced the once-renegade sector on the campaign trail. But halfway through the night, whispers began spreading through the crowd that Trump, who was not in attendance, had launched his own memecoin. Around the end of a DJ set by Snoop Dogg, the Trump coin had crossed $1 billion.

Some of the shrewder members of the audience immediately clocked what was happening. Trump, who has made a career out of branding everything from casinos to steaks to unaccredited colleges, was doing the same with crypto. Would Trump's latest business venture go the way of Trump Tower or Trump University?

As we quickly found out, the quality of the Trump family's crypto endeavors was almost a red herring (though we have reported closely on it, including in my colleague Ben Weiss's terrific new feature on American Bitcoin). Instead, ethics watchdogs have argued that Trump has used his blockchain businesses as a way to sell access. But unlike concerns during his first term that foreign dignitaries could book rooms in Trump hotels, which taught the term “emoluments” to millions of Americans, now anyone with an internet connection could effectively wire Trump millions of dollars by setting up a digital wallet and reap the rewards. His top memecoin holders enjoyed a private audience with the president last May, though they weren't all pleased by the food they were served.

In hindsight, those ethics concerns also look quaint. On Saturday night, the Wall Street Journal published a bombshell report that two lieutenants to a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family signed a contract to funnel $500 million into World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's crypto platform, in exchange for a 49% ownership stake, just days before his inauguration. As the Journal plainly stated, this was something unprecedented in American politics: “A foreign government official taking a major ownership stake in an incoming U.S. president's company.” And just a few months later, the Trump administration granted the United Arab Emirates access to advanced U.S. chips despite widespread security concerns (though a World Liberty spokesperson told Fortune that the deal had nothing to do with the administration's actions on chips).

As the shockwaves of the scandal reverberate, an awkward question lingers: Is Trump bad for blockchain? The industry spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the 2024 election, culminating in the coronation of Trump, who has championed digital asset regulation, hosted summits, and appointed czars. But now, the landmark Clarity Act is stalled in the Senate as Democrats call for ethics provisions that would prohibit the president from profiting off crypto holdings, and that groundswell of opposition is only likely to grow. And despite Trump's cheerleading, Bitcoin prices are nearly at their lowest price in a year, with many retail traders staying away.

For many Americans, crypto is now inextricably linked to the Trump family. Be careful what you wish for.

Merger madness…SpaceX completed a long-rumored acquisition of xAI, both Elon Musk companies, in a stunning deal that could set the joint venture up for one of the largest IPOs in history by market value. This comes months after xAI acquired X, another Musk venture, in a $33 billion, all-stock deal, and a month after Tesla revealed it had invested $2 billion in xAI. According to reporting in Bloomberg, the new deal will lead to a combined enterprise value of $1.25 trillion. You can read all about it here.

Insider Brief

PRESS RELEASE — 01 Quantum Inc. (“01 Quantum” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: ONE; OTCQB: OONEF), one of the first-to-market, enterprise level cybersecurity providers for the quantum computing era, today announced the launch of $qONE token and the Layer 1 Migration Toolkit, developed in collaboration with qLABS, a crypto foundation focused on securing digital assets against future quantum computing threats.

In conjunction with the $qONE token launch, qLABS confirmed the full rollout schedule for both the $qONE ecosystem token and the Layer 1 Migration Toolkit: 

Most blockchain networks today rely on classical cryptographic algorithms such as ECDSA, which are expected to become vulnerable once sufficiently powerful quantum computers emerge, a milestone often referred to as Q-Day. While post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms have now been standardized by NIST, upgrading existing Layer 1 blockchains remains a significant engineering and governance challenge.

The Layer 1 Migration Toolkit addresses this gap by providing a phased, production-ready framework that enables smart-contract-based blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Hyperliquid, and major stablecoins, to transition toward quantum-resistant security without disrupting existing infrastructure.

The toolkit builds on 01 Quantum's patented and patent-pending technologies, including its Quantum Crypto Wrapper (QCW) and Quantum DeFi Wrapper (QDW) with a “PQC Circuit Breaker”, combining post-quantum cryptography with zero-knowledge proofs to maintain on-chain efficiency, scalability, and compatibility.

The Layer 1 Migration Toolkit introduces a three-phase approach to quantum-safe upgrades:

This phased model allows blockchains to begin mitigating quantum risk today while avoiding forced hard forks or disruptive user experience changes.

The $qONE token is a quantum-resistant ecosystem token that powers the qONE Security Protocol. It is designed to enable access to quantum-safe transaction verification, support Quantum-Sig wallet functionality, and align incentives across developers, validators, and users.

$qONE will be issued on Hyperliquid on February 6th, representing one of the earliest quantum-resistant security tokens deployed on the platform.

“Quantum computing poses a systemic risk to today's blockchain security model,” said Andrew Cheung, CEO of 01 Quantum and CTO of qLABS.“The Layer 1 Migration Toolkit delivers a realistic, deployable path for blockchains to prepare for Q-Day using post-quantum cryptography without sacrificing performance.”

“By combining enterprise-grade post-quantum security with Web3-native deployment, we are enabling quantum safety where liquidity and users already exist,” said Antanas Guoga (Tony G), President of qLABS.

Oops, something went wrong

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is transferring his crypto holdings to a brokerage platform, despite short-term gains in the broader market.

On-chain data shows that all of these transfers involve assets acquired at higher price levels and now moved at lower market prices.

Hayes recently transferred 327,869 PENDLE tokens, worth around $502,000, to crypto prime broker FalconX at an average price of $1.53.

Interestingly, Hayes previously acquired around 1.4 million PENDLE at a higher price of $2.06.

The same address also sent 3.59 million ENA tokens to FalconX, valued near $499,340 at a price of $0.14.

This comes after an earlier purchase of about 15.8 million ENA at roughly $0.23 per token.

 

Earlier on Feb. 3, Hayes deposited 2.31 million LDO tokens to FalconX, worth around $980,000 at the time of transfer.

LDO was trading near $0.42 during the move, below his reported average buy price of $0.56 for the full position.

Onchain Lens stated that further transfers may follow. Transfers to brokers often lead to spot sales, but they are also widely used for OTC execution or hedging.

Hayes commented on the FalconX activity with an ambiguous social media post. He said that the transfer might be finished, or perhaps not, which added to market uncertainty.

 

The transactions come as the total crypto market cap rose 2.5% on Feb. 3 to $2.64 trillion.

Market data shows an 85% correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 and points to a shared response to interest rate expectations.

Bitcoin dominance currently sits at 59.43%, while the Altcoin Season Index fell from 32 to 29 in the past day. This shows continuous capital rotation toward BTC.

Bitcoin is trading about 83% above its prior cycle high, while the TOTAL3 index, which tracks altcoins excluding BTC and ETH , is only around 6% above its own.

From cycle lows, Bitcoin has recovered roughly 730%, compared with about 300% for TOTAL3.

 

Some market observers argue that expectations of a broad altcoin rally may be overstated. However, many believe that the market is at the origin of a massive, delayed altcoin rotation.

Oops, something went wrong

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.

Crypto markets enter the "Year of the Horse" looking less like a victory parade and more like a racehorse at the starting gate: muscles are tense after a long stumble.

The ETH versus BTC chart, in particular, is drawing attention because it is beginning to resemble the same stride pattern seen before the last major crypto bull run.

The Year of the Horse metaphor is less about destiny and more about tempo. Horse years in market folklore are associated with speed, abrupt directional changes, and momentum that builds quickly once it starts. Applied to crypto, that translates into an expectation of sharper swings, faster capital rotation, and the possibility that leadership shifts away from pure bitcoin dominance toward higher beta assets if liquidity conditions stabilize.

The reason the ETH versus BTC chart is getting noticed is because of a sequence that occurred once before and now appears to be repeating.

In the last major cycle, ETH bottomed against bitcoin roughly 9 months before gold reached its peak, then suffered another brutal 30%-40% relative decline that convinced many the trade was broken.

Instead, that final stumble marked the bottom. As gold cooled and defensive positioning unwound, capital rotated back into higher beta crypto, sending Ethereum more than 300% higher against bitcoin and helping ignite the broader bull market.

Today, the structure looks familiar rather than identical. The ETH-to-BTC chart hit a relative low about 9 months before gold's recent high and is already down around 31%, putting it in the same historical drawdown range that preceded a violent reversal up.

QCP said traders are still buying protection against further downside, but not with the same urgency seen during last year's sharp selloff, suggesting caution rather than outright panic.

At the same time, J.P. Morgan Private Bank's Yuxuan Tang wrote in an email note that gold's longer-term fundamentals remain intact despite recent pullbacks, arguing that central bank and institutional demand continue to provide a structural floor.

That push-and-pull between resilient safe-haven demand and washed-out crypto positioning is what gives the ETH-BTC ratio its intrigue. In Horse-year terms, the market is not yet sprinting, but it may no longer be limping.

However, the ratio is more a gauge of temperament than a prediction, suggesting that if liquidity steadies and bitcoin's dominance loosens, capital rotation could accelerate quickly. Horses do not usually walk when they finally move. They gallop.

And that gallop, at least according to prediction markets, looks more like a run-up from current levels, not to a new record high. Kalshi bettors say bitcoin will get to 105K in 2026, while on Polymarket, punters assign only a 29% chance it breaks the magic number of $126,000.

Hopefully, this horse can finish the race.

BTC: Bitcoin is trading near $78,800 as a brief liquidation-driven rebound runs into thin support above $70,000, leaving markets focused on the $60,000 to $65,000 long-term holder and 200-week average zone as the next major floor unless U.S. equities roll over.

ETH: Ethereum is trading near $2,345 after a short rebound from weekend selling, but with steeper weekly losses than bitcoin and weaker structural support, markets remain cautious that price could continue drifting lower unless broader risk appetite improves.

Gold: Gold is trading near $4,830 as prices attempt to stabilize after a margin-driven selloff, but elevated volatility and a firmer dollar are keeping the rebound fragile rather than signaling a clean return to the prior uptrend.

Nikkei 225: The Nikkei 225 rose about 2.4% to lead gains across Asia as optimism over a new U.S.–India trade deal lifted regional risk sentiment, with South Korea's Kospi surging over 5% and broader markets tracking a rebound in U.S. equities despite ongoing volatility in gold, silver and crypto.

Many students notice crypto updates during daily scrolling, especially when the bitcoin price usd appears in the middle of routine discussions about global markets. That constant visibility encourages climate-conscious students to examine how digital assets connect to measurable environmental outcomes.

This interest has expanded cryptocurrency into a broader discussion that links personal responsibility, technological growth and campus values.

Environmentally concerned students will typically ask: How does Bitcoin's energy use compare with real-world standards? The Binance Insights Hub offers them the opportunity to learn.

According to an environmental analysis conducted in July 2023, the estimated CO2-equivalent emissions from Bitcoin mining range from 55 million to 69 million tons (Binance Insights Hub, “Bitcoin and the Environment,” July 2023).

This gives students a better sense of the scale compared with the CO2 emissions of Singapore and Greece.

Additionally, data updated in March 2024 estimated that Bitcoin's annual energy consumption is 138 TWh and its carbon emissions are 88.23 million tons (Binance Insights Hub, “Energy Use and the Bitcoin Network,” March 2024). Both numbers really provide a baseline that allows the student to assess the trade-off.

For college students engaged in sustainability efforts on campus, these figures introduce new elements into the often abstract conversation about climate change, highlighting awareness campaigns centred on recycling, energy saving and climate education.

Campus conversations on ethical technology are growing more profound as students, staff and alumni explore the link between climate responsibility and digital innovation. Bitcoin's prominence naturally places it in these discussions rather than treating it as a separate issue.

Students are curious if participating in crypto aligns with their environmental objectives. Clubs are debating whether to include sustainability topics in blockchain workshops. Academic groups are evaluating how environmental considerations should influence coursework on emerging technologies.

These questions reflect a campus culture that treats climate literacy as a core expectation rather than a niche interest. Students prefer clarity over confusion; dependable data enables them to approach the subject confidently rather than avoid it due to uncertainty.

Some industry perspectives really acknowledge the scale of Bitcoin's energy use. An environmental commentary of late 2023 on the Binance Insights Hub called the consumption of proof-of-work “hard to ignore”. It encouraged the development of cleaner approaches (Binance Insights Hub, “Crypto and Climate: Addressing the Footprint,” December 2023).

Throughout 2024, other jobs featured renewable energy tests, regional procurement figures and other sustainability experiments for the mining industry (Binance Insights Hub, environmental category, January-September 2024).

A July 2023 report estimated that 55–65% of mining operations in certain regions rely on renewable energy (Binance Insights Hub, “Bitcoin Mining Energy Mix,” July 2023).

Although this does not remove the overall impact, it really illustrates active attempts to reduce strain where possible.

Responsible-tech discussions also extend to other areas of digital development. Jeff Li, Binance VP of Product, said on 30 October 2025:

“Binance has been actively exploring and integrating AI technologies across our products and services for some time now. We have been leveraging AI in multiple areas, from assisting with customer queries and enhancing platform and market surveillance to detecting and deterring misconduct and fighting scams.”

For students, statements like this signal how major platforms weigh ethical and operational considerations, reinforcing the need for thoughtful design across all forms of emerging technology.

Many students feel pulled between learning about new technologies and honouring their environmental priorities. Campus spaces can help bridge that tension by offering structured, informed ways to explore crypto without ignoring its ecological cost.

Students can:

These approaches allow students to stay engaged while maintaining a realistic understanding of environmental implications.

Bitcoin is a global technology with a documented environmental impact. Verified data for 2023 and 2024 reveal the magnitude of the energy used, and the sustainability-minded students take these statistics seriously.

University communities play a key role in shaping how this information is interpreted, encouraging thoughtful analysis rather than reactive judgments. The future of sustainable crypto development depends on transparency, improved mining practices and continued research into efficient network models.

For students who prioritise environmental values, the strongest approach is informed engagement. Bitcoin raises legitimate sustainability questions and a well-educated campus community can guide balanced conversations that keep climate awareness central while examining new technologies with purpose and clarity.

Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of preventable cancer cases.Credit: Jorge Sanz/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty

Nearly 40% of new cancer cases worldwide are potentially preventable, according to one of the first investigations1 of its kind, which analysed dozens of cancer types in almost 200 countries.

The study found that in 2022, roughly seven million cancer diagnoses were linked to modifiable risk factors — those that can be changed, controlled or managed to reduce the likelihood of developing the disease. Overall, tobacco smoking was the leading contributor to worldwide cancer cases, followed by infections and drinking alcohol. The findings suggest that avoiding such risk factors is “one of the most powerful ways that we can potentially reduce the future cancer burden”, says study co-author Hanna Fink, a cancer epidemiologist at the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France.

The study was published today in Nature Medicine.

Cancer continues to be a leading cause of illness and death worldwide, with cases expected to rise over the next decades if current trends continue. Previous studies2 have estimated that around 44% of global cancer deaths can be attributed to avoidable or controllable causes. Estimates of preventability have mainly focused on the number of deaths rather than cases and have mostly investigated a single risk factor, says Fink.

To address this gap, Fink and her colleagues examined global case data from 2022 for 36 different cancers across 185 countries. The study included 30 modifiable risk factors that are well-established causes of cancer — such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and infections.

The researchers combined this information with data from 2012 that captured people's exposure to each risk factor. Fink and her colleagues then estimated the proportion of cases that were directly linked to each risk factor.

In 2022, there were a total of 18.7 million new cancer cases worldwide. Roughly 38% — or 7.1 million — of these cases could be attributed to avoidable causes. Globally, tobacco smoking was the leading contributor, accounting for around 15% of preventable cases. This was followed by infections (10%) and drinking alcohol (3%). Lung, stomach and cervical cancers made up nearly half of all preventable cancer cases.

Cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity globally, largely attributable to modifiable risks. We estimated the 2022 global and national cancer burden attributable to 30 such factors, including tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, high body mass index, insufficient physical activity, smokeless tobacco and areca nut, suboptimal breastfeeding, air pollution, ultraviolet radiation, 9 infectious agents and 13 occupational exposures, to inform prevention efforts. Using GLOBOCAN data for 36 cancer sites in 185 countries, we applied prevalence data from around 2012 to reflect exposure−cancer latency and estimated Levin-based or Miettinen-based population-attributable fractions (PAFs) or direct estimates where applicable. Combined PAFs accounting for overlapping exposures were derived by cancer, sex, country and region. In 2022, an estimated 7.1 million of 18.7 million new cancer cases (37.8%) were attributable to 30 modifiable risk factors—2.7 million (29.7%) in women and 4.3 million (45.4%) in men. The proportion of preventable cancers ranged from 24.6% to 38.2% in women and from 28.1% to 57.2% in men across regions. Smoking (15.1%), infections (10.2%) and alcohol consumption (3.2%) were the leading contributors to cancer burden. Lung, stomach and cervical cancers represented nearly half of preventable cancers. Strengthening efforts to reduce modifiable exposures remains central to global cancer prevention.

Think about your breakfast this morning. Can you imagine the pattern on your coffee mug? The sheen of the jam on your half-eaten toast?

Most of us can call up such pictures in our minds. We can visualize the past and summon images of the future. But for an estimated 4% of people, this mental imagery is weak or absent. When researchers ask them to imagine something familiar, they might have a concept of what it is, and words and associations might come to mind, but they describe their mind's eye as dark or even blank.

The human imagination: the cognitive neuroscience of visual mental imagery

The human imagination: the cognitive neuroscience of visual mental imagery

Systems neuroscientist Mac Shine at the University of Sydney, Australia, first realized that his mental experience differed in this way in 2013. He and his colleagues were trying to understand how certain types of hallucination come about1, and were discussing the vividness of mental imagery.

“When I close my eyes, there's absolutely nothing there,” Shine recalls telling his colleagues. They immediately asked him what he was talking about. “Whoa. What's going on?” Shine thought. Neither he nor his colleagues had realized how much variation there is in the experiences people have when they close their eyes.

This moment of revelation is common to many people who don't form mental images. They report that they might never have thought about this aspect of their inner life if not for a chance conversation, a high-school psychology class or an article they stumbled across (see ‘How do you imagine?').



Although scientists have known for more than a century that mental imagery varies between people, the topic received a surge of attention when, a decade ago, an influential paper coined the term aphantasia to describe the experience of people with no mental imagery2.

Since then, aphantasia has shot into the canon of unusual phenomena that are invaluable for studying how the mind works. Like synaesthesia (in which people's senses are connected in exceptional ways, so they hear colours, for example) and prosopagnosia (also known as face blindness), aphantasia has opened many new research avenues.

Much of the early work sought to describe the trait and assess how it affected behaviour. But over the past five years, studies have begun to explore what's different about the brains of people with this form of inner life3. The findings have led to a flurry of discussions about how mental imagery forms, what it is good for and what it might reveal about the puzzle of consciousness: researchers tend to define mental imagery as a conscious experience, and some are now excited to study aphantasia as a way to probe imagery's potentially unconscious forms.

Cognitive neuroscientist Giulia Cabbai at University College London is among the researchers interested in these questions. She was shocked to learn about aphantasia in 2015. Her own intensely vivid mental imagery is at the other extreme of the distribution — she has hyperphantasia. The fact that there are people with a complete lack of mental imagery brings fresh ways to study this internal experience, she says. “How does it affect our emotion, our perception, our attention, our memory? We can understand this with aphantasia.”

Neurologist Adam Zeman at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Exeter, UK, began studying aphantasia in 2003. He met a man who, after a minimally invasive heart procedure, complained that although his visual perception remained normal, his mind's eye had vanished. Scans of his brain showed the expected activity when he looked at images of famous faces, but notable differences from control individuals when he tried to imagine the faces. After Zeman's team published a case study4 in 2010, Zeman heard from more than 20 people who said that they, too, lacked mental imagery, but they had lacked it their entire lives. Zeman's team surveyed those people, reporting the findings and introducing the term aphantasia (tacking an ‘a' to the front of ‘phantasia', Aristotle's term for the mind's eye) in 2015 in Cortex2.

Zeman says that he was inundated with messages after an article about the paper appeared in The New York Times. Since that article, some 20,000 people have contacted him with their own stories of mental imagery.

“I didn't expect it to explode quite as it has,” says Zeman. “If you are studying what you regard as a rare neuropsychological phenomenon and you get half a dozen people in touch, that's big time.”

The 2015 paper and subsequent research has revealed how much aphantasia can vary. For instance, people with aphantasia often, but not always, lack the ability to imagine in sensory modalities besides vision — having no ‘mind's ear', for example. Some people with aphantasia report dreaming in pictures, but others don't.

Researchers have also found that aphantasia seems to have a genetic component, with the likelihood of having aphantasia increasing tenfold if you have a sibling who has a weak or absent mind's eye. And aphantasia might be more common in people in scientific and technical professions than in people with careers in the arts5.

Zeman and others say that aphantasia doesn't seem to make much difference to behaviour, and although it might influence creativity, it by no means precludes it. Instead of calling it a disorder or condition, Zeman describes it as an “intriguing variation” — one extreme on a distribution of mental-imagery capabilities.

Much of the work characterizing mental imagery relies on asking participants to describe their experience. But such methods are subjective, and they can't separate true variations in experience from variations in how people describe or interpret that experience. So some researchers have been attempting to come up with other techniques.

Neuroscientist Joel Pearson at the University of New South Wales in Sydney and his colleagues developed an approach that takes advantage of a perceptual phenomenon called binocular rivalry. When a different visual is presented to each eye simultaneously, for example, a pattern of green lines to the left eye and red lines to the right, a person's perception toggles between the two instead of blending them. Nearly two decades ago, Pearson decided to see what happened if he imagined one of the visuals in his mind's eye — in this case, only the green lines or only the red — before the test began. It turned out that whichever pattern he imagined was what he saw during the test.

The researchers developed this finding into a technique to measure the strength of mental imagery6. In a person with typical mental imagery, imagining the red pattern results in the person being more likely to see that red pattern during binocular rivalry. But a person with no visual imagery will not show this same bias. Pearson has been studying mental imagery ever since developing this method7.

There are other techniques, too. A person's emotional reaction to scary stories, measured by how much they sweat, can be a good proxy for how vividly they imagine what's happening in the story. And when researchers ask someone to imagine a bright light, the extent to which their pupils constrict correlates with the vividness of their mental imagery.

The consciousness wars: can scientists ever agree on how the mind works?

The consciousness wars: can scientists ever agree on how the mind works?

A decade of work has left researchers convinced that aphantasia is a real phenomenon, but many are puzzled by how little it seems to affect behaviour. Behavioural tasks that are thought to depend on mental imagery don't seem to be a problem for people with aphantasia. They perform relatively well on standard memory assessments and they seem to be able to rotate objects in their mind, to determine whether an object in one picture matches another presented from a different angle.

“I play sports. I can draw diagrams of the brain — whatever you want. But for me, when I try to imagine a purple dinosaur juggling on top of a bouncy ball, nothing shows up,” says Shine. He says the big mystery is how the brain can function typically in all these ways but at the same time lack this one specific ability.

When scientists started looking for the brain signatures of aphantasia, they expected to see differences in the visual cortex. This is the area that receives and processes visual information during perception, and it's known to be active when a person pictures something in their mind. Most researchers have thought of mental imagery as vision in reverse, with higher-level brain areas sending signals to lower visual areas to generate a conscious image.

But studies have suggested that when people with aphantasia attempt to imagine something, they activate the visual cortex in ways similar to that seen in control individuals. Perhaps, some researchers say, that brain area is forming visual representations in people with aphantasia, but the conscious mind can't access what is there.

During her PhD, Cabbai decided to study the relationship between activity in the visual cortex and a person's experience of imagery. She wanted to find out whether what she and others call ‘sensory representations' in the visual cortex must always come with the experience of imagery. But she also wondered whether aphantasia was a problem with voluntarily conjuring up images on demand, so she and her colleagues took an approach that didn't require participants to do that.

The team scanned the brains of people with and without aphantasia while they listened to sounds that should spontaneously trigger a sensory representation of whatever made the sound. Barking, for example, should trigger representations of a dog in the primary visual cortex. Then, the researchers fed the brain activity into a machine-learning algorithm to see whether it could predict the sound content.

Hearing a dog bark did generate activity that represented a dog in both typical imagers and people with aphantasia. But, despite the existence of that activity, people with aphantasia reported seeing nothing in their mind's eye8. The finding suggests that these sensory representations — thought to underlie mental imagery — can remain unconscious and so are not sufficient to trigger imagery on their own.

The team also probed voluntary imagery, asking participants to visualize what was making the sound. In this case, the algorithm couldn't decode what was being represented in the visual cortex in people with aphantasia. Cabbai calls the findings “puzzling”, and says that aphantasia might be a twofold problem involving not experiencing imagery consciously and not being able to voluntarily generate it.

Up to 50 percent of species—which included 12 bird species and 4 frog species—on Aotearoa's North Island went extinct before humans arrived

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A spectacular trove of fossils in a discovered in a cave on New Zealand's North Island has given scientists their first glimpse of ancient forest species that lived there more than a million years ago. The fossils represent 12 ancient bird species and four frog species, including several previously unknown bird species. Taken together, the fossils paint a picture of an ancient world that looks drastically different than it does today. The discovery also fills in an important gap in scientific understanding of the patterns of extinction that preceded human arrival in New Zealand 750 years ago. 

The team published a study on the find in Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology. 

“This is a newly recognized avifauna for New Zealand, one that was replaced by the one humans encountered a million years later,” Trevor Worthy, lead study author and associate professor at Flinders University, said in a statement. “This remarkable find suggests our ancient forests were once home to a diverse group of birds that did not survive the next million years.” 

The team located the fossils between two layers of volcanic ash preserved in the cave, each from a different major eruption, the first 1.55 million years ago and the second 1 million years ago. Many of the species represented among the fossils had already gone extinct by the time humans arrived on the island. By extrapolation, the research team estimated that between 33 and 50 percent of all species on the island went extinct during the million years before humans arrived in New Zealand, likely thanks to rapid climate shifts and cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, said Paul Scofield, study co-author and Canterbury Museum senior curator of natural history. 

Worthy said that “for decades, the extinction of New Zealand's birds was viewed primarily through the lens of human arrival 750 years ago. This study proves that natural forces like super-volcanoes and dramatic climate shifts were already sculpting the unique identity of our wildlife over a million years ago.” 

Of all the finds, scientists might be the giddiest about discovering a new species of parrot, Strigops insulaborealis, an ancient relative of the iconic Kākāpō, a large flightless parrot known for its heft. The team believes this ancestor may have possessed the ability to fly. By analyzing the fossil discovery, the team noticed the ancient bird had weaker legs than the modern relative, implying the ancestor wasn't quite the skilled climber as the modern-day Kākāpō. Still, the team said more research is needed to confirm that this ancient bird could fly. 

The researchers also uncovered an ancestor of the modern Takahe, which opens further research into that bird. Fossils of an extinct species of pigeon closely related to the Australian bronzewing pigeons also excited experts. 

“The shifting forest and shrubland habitats forced a reset of the bird populations,” Scofield said. “We believe this was a major driver for the evolutionary diversification of birds and other fauna in the North Island.” 

Scofield said that previous excavations showed life in New Zealand between 20 and 16 million years ago and that by contrast, the new discoveries offer the first evidence of life from 15 million years ago to one million years ago. “This wasn't a missing chapter in New Zealand's ancient history,” Scofield said, “it was a missing volume.”

The most famous four-legged weapons in warfare may have left a trace after all.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

In the Roman historian Livy's sprawling account of the Battle of Trebia, the first major battle of the Second Punic War,  a haunting line emerges early on that has lingered in the public consciousness for centuries: “A large proportion were swept down the river, some were carried by cross currents to the other side where the enemy were, and were trampled to death by the elephants.”

Hannibal's use of elephants as a weapon of war wielded by his Carthaginian forces is etched into history, depicted in art and literature for more than a millennia. Livy goes on to describe the elephants as “...towering aloft at the ends of the line, terrified the horses not only by their appearance but by their unaccustomed smell, and created widespread panic.” 

The imposing pachyderms were only undone by the quick thinking of Scipio Africanus, whose Roman forces, per Biography.com, “sounded horns that panicked the Carthaginian elephants, causing them to reverse and trample many of Hannibal's troops” during the decisive Battle of Zama.

But while accounts of the elephants have endured across the eras, actual physical proof that elephants played a role in the Second Punic War has been relatively sparse.

A recent discovery in Córdoba, Spain, however, offers compelling material evidence.

Colina de los Quemados in Córdoba was once an Iberian Iron Age fortification known as Corduba, which Arkeonews describes as “a major protohistoric settlement occupying a strategic terrace above the Guadalquivir River.” Remnants of that settlement were uncovered in 2020 during an “emergency excavation” ahead of an expansion of the nearby Provincial Hospital of Córdoba.

The archaeologists at the dig discovered “stone artillery projectiles, heavy arrowheads associated with scorpio-type siege weapons, and Carthaginian coinage minted in Cartagena between 237 and 206 B.C.E,” all indicative of military conflict roughly corresponding with the dates of the Second Punic War (218 to 201 BCE). Having these artifacts provide a historical context for the dig site is what made the discovery a single bone mean something far greater.

Protected by a now-collapsed adobe wall, archaeologists found a single carpal bone belonging to an elephant.

The roughly 10-centimeter bone, Arkeonews reports, was “identified as the third carpal bone (os magnum) of the right forelimb of an elephant” after comparative anatomical analysis with comparable bones of both Asian elephants and steppe mammoths. While the bone's comparative size exceeds that of a Asian female elephant, it doesn't conclusively prove what species of elephant the bone came from. But it does lend credence to the possibility that it once belonged to an African elephant, which Hannibal is documented as using during the Second Punic War.

Lest the findings be dismissed on the suggestion that the bone may have come from a different time period than the other military artifacts located at the dig site, radiocarbon dating placed the bone's origin in the pre-Roman Iron Age, aligned with the other finds.

But why is there only a single bone at the site? Researchers speculate that the elephant died amidst a military conflict “with most of its remains later destroyed, reused, or scattered” or that this bone may have been separated from the others during post-conflict activity.

Spiders taught scientists how to make unsinkable metal

Researchers mimicked the air-trapping tricks of diving bell spiders to create aluminum that stays afloat—even when punctured

Toss a coin into a fountain, and you know what will happen. Being denser than water, the metal sinks—ask any child. But new research has challenged centuries of certainty.

A team at the University of Rochester has etched aluminum tubes so that they won't sink, even when damaged—a trick the scientists borrowed from spiders.

“You can poke big holes in them,” said Chunlei Guo, a professor of optics and physics at the University of Rochester and senior author of the research, in a press release. “We showed that even if you severely damage the tubes with as many holes as you can punch, they still float.”

Many things in our lives repel water—examples include cooking oil, a rain jacket or a rubber glove. Scientists call this property hydrophobicity—from the Greek for “water fear”—but the secret to the metal tubes' buoyancy lies in superhydrophobicity.

Guo's team uses lasers to carve microscopic valleys into the aluminum that capture air: picture corduroy fabric shrunk down until it requires an electron microscope to see the ridges.

According to the press release, “the mechanism is similar to how diving bell spiders trap an air bubble to stay buoyant underwater.” The spiders live almost entirely underwater but still need to breathe. Their solution is to carry their own oxygen supply. Fine hairs covering their bodies trap air bubbles against their skin.

The metal tubes mimic those fine hairs, trapping their own air bubbles. Normally water would spread along the inside walls and push the air out. But when it hits the superhydrophobic texture, it bounces away. Surface tension—the same property that causes water to bead on a waxed car hood—prevents the water from entering the tube. As a result, the air stays inside, and the tubes remain buoyant.

The study, published on January 27, 2026, in Advanced Functional Materials, builds on Guo's earlier work designing unsinkable metals. In 2019 his lab demonstrated the concept using laser-etched disks, but in turbulent water, the disks tipped, and the air escaped.

The new tubes solve that problem with an internal divider at the middle of the tube that helps trap the air in a confined chamber. “Even if you push it vertically into the water, the bubble of air remains trapped inside and the tube retains its floating ability,” Guo said in the same statement. The team tested the tubes in rough conditions for weeks and “found no degradation to their buoyancy,” he reported.

In nature, superhydrophobicity isn't a new trick. The eyes of mosquitoes have water-repellent nanostructures that keep them clear, for example. And fire ants use their waxy, water-repellent coating and textured exoskeletons to trap air; during floods, thousands cling together to make buoyant, living rafts that can survive 12 days and possibly longer.

As for humans, this isn't our first attempt at floating metal. In 2015 researchers at New York University embedded hollow silicon carbide spheres in a magnesium alloy to create a metal matrix composite lighter than water.

But the implications of Guo's work go beyond the laboratory. Linked tubes could create weight-bearing rafts or ships. Engineers might be closing in on the dream of ships that stay afloat even as water pours into their hulls. One surprising application involves energy: Guo's team demonstrated that rafts made of the tubes could harvest waves to generate electricity.

The tubes are currently nearly half a meter long, but Guo sees no barrier to increasing their size. The lasers are now seven times more powerful than they were in 2019, when Guo first attempted laser-etched metal disks. “The technology,” he said in the same statement, “could be easily scaled to larger sizes.”

Networks are a powerful way to represent the complexity of large ecological systems. However, most ecological networks, such as food webs, contain only partial lists of species interactions. Computational methods for inferring missing links can facilitate field work and investigations of ecological processes. Here, we describe a stacked generalization approach to predict missing links in food webs that accounts for ecological assumptions including link direction. Tests of this method on synthetic food webs show that it can learn to optimally combine structural and trait-based predictions. On a global database of 290 food webs, the method often achieves near-perfect performance, performs better when it can exploit both species traits and network structure, and is principally driven by a subset of ecologically-interpretable predictors. Furthermore, we find that link predictability varies with ecosystem and network characteristics. These results show broad applicability of stacked generalization for predicting and understanding ecological interactions.

The empirical food-web datasets used in this study are available in the GATEWAy database (GlobAl daTabasE of traits and food Web Architecture33,37, version 3, accessible at https://doi.org/10.25829/idiv.283-3-756).

Different neuron types show distinct susceptibility to age-dependent degeneration, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we applied aging clocks to single neuron types in Caenorhabditis elegans and found that distinct neurons differ in their biological age. Ciliated sensory neurons with high neuropeptide and protein biosynthesis gene expression show accelerated aging and degeneration, correlating with loss of function, which could be prevented by pharmacological inhibition of translation. We show that the C. elegans neuronal aging transcriptomes correlate with human brain aging patterns and anticorrelate with geroprotective interventions. We performed an in silico drug screen to identify potentially neuroprotective small molecules. We show that the natural occurring plant metabolite syringic acid and the piperazine derivative vanoxerine delay neuronal degeneration, and propose these compounds as neuroprotective interventions. Furthermore, we identify neurotoxins that accelerate neurodegeneration, indicating that distinguishing aging trajectories between neuron types can inform on protective interventions as well as risk factors.

Aging is the highest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease that are triggered by the functional decline of distinct neuron types. In Alzheimer's disease, the initially degenerating brain structures are the parahippocampal gyrus and the olfactory bulb, followed by the degeneration of the hippocampus, leading to the characteristic clinical dementia symptoms1,2,3. Parkinson's disease, in contrast, affects mostly the dopaminergic innervation of the midbrain and the cerebellum, resulting in the perturbation of motility and the induction of tremor syndromes4,5. In mice, distinct classes of brain cells show differences in age-related decline6, and single-cell transcriptomics has identified pro-aging and pro-rejuvenating proximity effects of distinct cell populations7. The extent to which intrinsic aging susceptibility differs among individual neuron types has, however, remained largely unknown. To elucidate whether different neuron types might differ in their biological aging process, we used C. elegans as an experimental model with a well-characterized neuronal system of 302 neurons of ≥128 different neuron types8 that allows assessing the integrity of individual neurons during the normal aging process in vivo.

Aging clocks provide predictive models of molecular signatures (for example, DNA methylation) that estimate an individual's chronological age, and could identify biological age differences resulting from genetic or pharmacological age acceleration or deceleration9,10,11. Based on the known effects of many genetic and pharmacologic interventions on lifespan and thus biological age in C. elegans, we recently developed the highly accurate binarized transcriptomic (Bit) age clock. BitAge predicts already in young adult animals quantitatively how genetic, environmental or pharmacological treatments affect lifespan10. We previously established that also the simulation of increasing noise allows the prediction of biological age regardless of organism or data type, allowing us to design the Stochastic Clock to detect age accelerating and decelerating interventions12.

Here, we asked whether in chronologically young animals, distinct neuron types might exhibit distinct biological ages in C. elegans. We show that individual neuron types in the late larval L4 stage, which directly precedes adulthood, show a distinct offset of biological age prediction despite sharing the same chronological age. We demonstrate that the age prediction corresponds to neuron-type-specific degeneration and the decline of their specific function. Neuron types with an older predicted age show early neurodegeneration, while those with a younger predicted age are preserved. The transcriptomic differences between these biologically ‘older' and ‘younger' neuron types indicate translation as a crucial driver of neuronal aging and pharmacologically reducing protein synthesis prevented the degeneration of the fast-aging neurons. We determined that the transcriptional patterns of the biological age differences are correlated with the transcriptional patterns of human and mouse brain aging, suggesting conserved neuronal aging mechanisms. The neuronal aging patterns anticorrelated with geroprotective interventions enabling the identification of neuronal aging modulators. Using a transcriptomic resource incorporating thousands of different compounds in human cell lines (CMAP)13, we identified and validated pharmacological compounds that protect the integrity of neurons in vivo. We demonstrate that the naturally occurring plant metabolite syringic acid and the piperazine derivative vanoxerine prevent neurodegeneration and propose that they could serve as neuroprotective interventions. In reverse, our approach can also identify neurotoxins that accelerate neurodegeneration. Our data suggest that the mechanisms underlying neuron-type-specific aging rates allow the identification of therapeutic interventions that could slow down neuronal aging and prevent neurodegeneration.

To investigate whether different neuron types age differently within an organism, we applied our previously developed BitAge biological age predictor10 and, as independent age predictor, our previously developed Stochastic Clock12 on neuron-type-specific RNA-sequencing data. We used the single-neuron-type data from the C. elegans Neuronal Gene Expression Map & Network (CeNGEN) dataset14, which comprises 128 distinct neuron types from late L4-stage larvae. The 128 neuron age predictions range from ≈98 h in FLP neurons to ≈177 h in ADL neurons (Fig. 1a; BitAge) suggesting that different neurons might show an almost twofold biological age difference in chronologically young nematodes.

a, Distribution of transcriptomic age predictions. The 128 neurons of the CeNGEN dataset were predicted with BitAge (upper) or a stochastic noise-based clock (lower) and sorted by their predicted age. The x axis shows the rank of the prediction in ascending order, and the y axis shows the predicted age. The 20% youngest neurons and their respective age predictions are outlined in blue; the 20% oldest neurons and their respective age predictions are displayed in orange. Neuron types appearing on the top/bottom of both prediction lists are indicated in bold letters. b, Predictions with BitAge and the Stochastic Clock on the CeNGEN dataset are highly correlated (Pearson correlation 0.65, P value 5.5 × 10−17). The x axis shows the BitAge predictions of the CeNGEN dataset, and the y axis shows the stochastic data-based clock predictions of the CeNGEN dataset. All 128 neurons are plotted. Color coding of the youngest 20% of neurons according to BitAge in blue and of the oldest 20% in orange. The regression model fit with a 95% confidence interval (dashed, black lines) is shown. c, Neuron-type-specific genes in the CeNGEN dataset are skewed depending on gene length and age prediction. The log10 gene length (x axis) of the specific genes from the 20% youngest neurons (blue), and of the 20% oldest neurons (orange) are compared to random permutation of all neuron-type-specific genes with the same number of genes (gray). The gray curve shows the mean density across 100,000 random permutations, each sampling the same number of genes as in the youngest/oldest neuron groups; the shaded gray band indicates the 95% confidence interval across permutations. The two-sided permutation test compared the median log10 gene length. The y axis shows the probability density of the values on the x axis. d, Swarm plot of the median log10 length of neuron-type-specific genes expressed in the youngest 20% (blue) and oldest 20% (orange) neurons according to BitAge predictions. Each point represents a single neuron type. Neuron types were grouped into the youngest 20% (blue, n = 17) and oldest 20% (orange, n = 21) according to BitAge-predicted biological age. Data shown are the mean ± s.d. Welch's two-tailed t-test was used to test for significant differences.

Source data

We independently confirmed the different age predictions of the neuron types in the single-neuron-type RNA-sequencing data from young adults in a recent cell atlas of C. elegans aging (Calico)15, which contains 67 of the 128 neuron types from the CeNGEN dataset. Also, the Calico dataset of day 1 adults exhibits the same predicted age distribution (Extended Data Fig. 1a), and the BitAge predictions on both datasets are significantly correlated with each other (Extended Data Fig. 1b; Pearson correlation 0.66, P < 0.0001).

To independently assess each neuron's biological age, we applied a Stochastic Clock that does not rely on specific transcriptomic signatures but instead simulates how random changes accumulate over time12. Despite using a fundamentally different strategy, the Stochastic Clock showed substantial overlap with BitAge (Fig. 1a) and predicts an almost fourfold age difference between the youngest and oldest neurons. The predictions of the Stochastic Clock significantly correlate with the BitAge predictions on the CeNGEN dataset (Fig. 1b; Pearson correlation r = 0.65, P < 0.0001), which was even stronger within the very young or very old predicted group of neurons (Extended Data Fig. 1g; Pearson correlation r = 0.78, P < 0.0001; for the top and bottom 20%). The Stochastic Clock predictions showed a significant correlation between the CeNGEN and Calico datasets (Extended Data Fig. 1c; Pearson correlation 0.82, P < 0.0001). Similarly, the Stochastic Clock predictions correlated significantly with BitAge in the Calico dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1d; Pearson correlation 0.74, P < 0.0001). Taken together, two independent aging clock paradigms using two independent single-neuron transcriptome datasets consistently predict specific neuron types as younger and others as older in chronologically young animals.

To address potential limitations of single-cell sequencing coverage, we performed the same analyses on bulk RNA-sequencing data from CeNGEN, which offers improved transcriptomic coverage for a subset of 37 neurons16. BitAge predictions remained consistent between the pseudobulk CeNGEN dataset and the bulk RNA-sequencing dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1e; Pearson correlation 0.65, P < 0.0001). Similarly, the Stochastic Clock predictions on pseudobulk and bulk CeNGEN datasets were also significantly correlated (Extended Data Fig. 1f; Pearson correlation 0.7, P < 0.0001), reinforcing that the predicted biological age differences among neurons are robust across different datasets and sequencing approaches. While the predictions of BitAge and the Stochastic Clock are highly consistent, there are also some outliers that deviate more strongly from the correlation (Extended Data Fig. 1g).

As additional validation, we used bulk neuron transcriptomes from young and aged animals that were not included in the training data of the clocks17. We found that both clocks could differentiate between the young and old samples (Extended Data Fig. 1h); note that differences between predicted biological age and indicated chronological age could arise from two effects: first, the sample age is reported in days, giving a ±12-h uncertainty; second, the associated reported median lifespan of 22 days is unexpectedly high (median lifespan is typically between 14 and 18 days)17.

The aging transcriptome in species ranging from C. elegans to humans was recently shown to exhibit a gene length-dependent transcriptional decline (GLTD): the longer the gene, the more sharply its expression tends to decrease with age18,19. GLTD is thought to result from the age-dependent accumulation of transcription-blocking DNA damage that is more likely to occur in larger genes. To test whether neurons predicted to be biologically older showed GLTD, we analyzed neuron-type-specific genes, which are defined as genes that are expressed in at least 90% of the specific neurons and in not more than 10% of other cells. In line with GLTD, the neuron-type-specific genes of the 20% oldest predicted neurons are significantly shorter than expected by chance (P = 3.6 × 10−4), while the neuron-type-specific genes of the 20% youngest neurons are significantly longer (P = 9.28 × 10−3; Fig. 1c) and show a significantly longer median gene length (Fig. 1d). The median length of the neuron-type-specific genes is negatively correlated with the prediction age of BitAge or the Stochastic Clock on either CeNGEN or Calico data (Extended Data Fig. 1i–l). These results indicate that the clock-predicted biological age is reflected in the age-associated GLTD that is most prevalent in the biologically old predicted neurons.

Taken together, the alignment of aging clock predictions with the presence of GLTD in neurons predicted to be biologically old in chronologically young animals provides compelling evidence that specific neuron types undergo accelerated aging.

To assess whether the predicted age differences are associated with different degrees of neuron-specific degeneration, we next chose three young (I2, OLL, PHC) and three old (ASI, ASJ, ASK) predicted neurons (Fig. 2a) and scored their degeneration over the chronological age starting from the larval L4 stage onward to day 7 of adulthood. The L4 stage is the last larval stage before the nematodes reach sexual maturity, while day 7 of adulthood is in the post-fertile phase. To assess the morphological integrity of specific neurons in vivo, we used neuron-type-specific transcriptional green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters (Fig. 2a). Macroscopic aberrations in the neurites were classified as ‘healthy', ‘damaged' or ‘severely damaged' (Fig. 2b) as established previously20,21,22,23. We excluded that GFP expression levels might influence neuron integrity, as GFP expression levels and neuronal integrity showed no correlation as tested in ASK and ASJ neurons that exhibit the strongest variance in GFP expression levels among the employed nematode strains (Extended Data Fig. 2a).

Three to four cohorts were analyzed, comprising 10–30 individual nematodes, for every time point indicated. Data shown are the mean ± s.d. Statistical analysis was performed using a cumulative link model (CLM) with a logit link to account for the ordered categorical nature of neuronal damage scores (healthy < mild < severe). P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

Source data

In accordance with our predictions, the three young predicted neuron types exhibited significantly less degeneration than the old predicted neuron types at all analyzed time points (Fig. 2c). At L4 stage and on the first day of adulthood, I2, OLL and PHC neurons exhibited a minimal degeneration only affecting 10–20% of the animals, which increased to ≈35% during aging. URY neurons, which were described previously to exhibit approximately 35% degeneration at day 7 of adulthood23, displayed ≈20% degeneration in L4 and young adults, which increased up to ≈35% on day 7 of adulthood (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). All analyzed neuron types except I2 showed a significant age-dependent deterioration (Fig. 2c).

The predicted biologically older ASI, ASJ and ASK neurons were damaged in >45% of L4 larvae reaching up to 90% at day 7 of adulthood, indicative of rapid aging. To determine at which stage the rapidly aging neurons start to degenerate, we also examined the ASI, ASJ and ASK neurons in the larval L3 stage. Consistent with a fully developed neuronal system, those neuron types were intact in more than 90% of the L3 animals, suggesting that the first burst of neuronal aging occurs already between the L3 and L4 stage (Extended Data Fig. 2d).

To discern whether the progressive degenerative process reflects an age-dependent stochastic process or instead a deterministic developmental program, we analyzed whether the bleb patterns appeared randomly along the neurites. The positions of blebs in ASJ, ASK and OLL neurons in adults indeed correlated with a random distribution of damage sites along neurites. Only one site in OLL neurons exhibited nonrandom bleb clustering; it was located at the proximal pharyngeal bulb and prone to swelling (Extended Data Fig. 2e).

To address whether we might have underestimated the neurodegeneration because only the morphology of neurons that express GFP could be analyzed, and hence are present, we assessed neuronal survival in individual nematodes over a time course of 12 days during adulthood. During aging most animals retained the young predicted I2, OLL and URY neurons, while the old predicted ASK and ASE neurons were progressively lost (Extended Data Fig. 2f–h), showing that early biological age predictions are associated with age-dependent neuronal attrition.

Taken together, these results validate our neuron-type-specific biological age predictions for identifying neurons at higher risk of degeneration, with potential implications for understanding selective neuronal vulnerability in aging and neurodegeneration.

To test whether the morphological neurite degeneration corresponds with functional impairment, we monitored behaviors that depend specifically on a single neuron type. The requirement of a highly neuron-type-specific phenotypic outcome excluded the functional analysis of the ASI, ASJ, ASK, I2, OLL and PHC neurons for any of the following reasons: (1) some neurons, such as I2, lack well-defined functional roles; (2) some functions are executed through multiple redundantly operating neurons thus precluding assessment of single-neuron function; (3) some neurons are negative regulators of other neurons leading to indirect effects. In contrast, URY neurons (representing young predicted neurons) are strictly required for selected pathogen avoidance24 and ASE neurons (representing old predicted neurons) mediate salt sensation and memory formation25 allowing their functional analysis by behavioral testing.

We tested whether the degeneration of URY neurons correlates with impaired avoidance behavior from pathogenic Serratia marcescens Db11 bacteria, which is primarily mediated by the TOL-1 receptor expressed in URY neurons24. URY-marked strains (GFP is expressed specifically in URY neurons) were exposed to either pathogenic Db11 or nonpathogenic OP50 control bacteria. To test whether failure to display avoidance behavior correlated with neurodegeneration, we assessed the integrity of the URY neurons in animals that either avoided or failed to avoid the bacterial lawn (Fig. 3a).

a, Schematic depiction of the experimental design to examine the correlation between pathogen avoidance from S. marcescens Db11 bacteria and URY neuron integrity. Nematodes were synchronized by L4 picking and transferred to Db11 or OP50 bacteria. After 2 days, avoidance behavior was scored and nematodes classified as avoiding/not-avoiding and subjected to microscopy to analyze URY neuron neurite health. b, Swarm plot of the results from the pathogen avoidance assay from Db11 bacteria. URY neuron marker strain (URYp::GFP, JKM10), I2 neuron marker strain (I2p::GFP, MT21910, control neuron unrelated to avoidance reaction) and TOL-1 receptor mutant strain (∆tol-1, IG10, no avoidance from Db11) were used. Data shown are the mean ± s.d. from four independent cohorts of 50–75 nematodes. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) + Tukey post hoc test were used. c, Swarm plot displaying the healthy neuron fraction size from nematodes subjected to Db11 pathogen or OP50 control bacteria and classified for evasion behavior.

Data are the mean ± s.d. of four independent cohorts of 10–20 nematodes per strain, condition and classification. Statistical analysis was performed using a CLM. P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. d, Schematic depiction of the experimental design to correlate salt aversive conditioning and neurodegeneration of ASE neurons. Adult 1-day-old nematodes were conditioned by starvation in the presence or absence of NaCl, and thereafter subjected to a chemotaxis assay on an NaCl gradient. Subsequently, nematodes were classified (dwelling on high/low salt) and neurite integrity was analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. Orange asterisks indicate nematodes that failed at learning. e, Swarm plot showing the chemotaxis index of nematodes conditioned at 0 mM (light blue) or 20 mM (dark blue) NaCl.

ANOVA + Tukey post hoc test were used.

Source data

Approximately 80% of the URY neuron-marked animals avoided the toxic Db11 bacterial lawn thus showing a typical pathogen avoidance behavior (Fig. 3b). To ascertain the specificity of the assay, we tested a tol-1 mutant control strain that failed to show any avoidance. A baseline avoidance of ≈20% was observed on nonpathogenic OP50, consistent with natural exploratory behavior. Nematodes that failed to avoid pathogenic Db11 showed significantly increased degeneration of URY neurons compared to those that successfully avoided the bacteria (Fig. 3c). As a control, we ascertained that degeneration of I2 neurons, which are also predicted to be biologically young (Figs. 1a and 2c) but are not involved in pathogen avoidance, was uncorrelated with the avoidance behavior, confirming that the loss of avoidance behavior was dependent on URY neuron degeneration (Fig. 3c).

To corroborate our findings, we tested salt aversive memory formation that is specifically mediated by ASE neurons25, which are predicted to be biologically old (Fig. 1a). Nematodes were conditioned to associate either low (0 mM) or high (20 mM) sodium chloride concentrations with starvation. Thereafter, the behavioral responses were tested by using a chemotaxis preference assay on a sodium chloride gradient and subjected to neurite imaging of either salt-sensing ASE neurons or salt-sensing unrelated URY neurons (Fig. 3d). The strains expressing GFP in either ASE or URY neurons similarly learned to move toward higher salt concentrations when a low salt concentration was associated with starvation (Fig. 3e), while nematodes conditioned to associate a high salt concentration with starvation moved toward lower salt concentrations on the salt gradient (Fig. 3e). Nevertheless, some individual nematodes failed to show the expected avoidance behavior and moved toward the salt concentration they should have learned to avoid (Fig. 3d,f). The neuronal health was assessed as described above (Fig. 2b), and the healthy neuron fraction was quantified across four behavioral groups: Nematodes (1) trained to avoid low salt (left) and found on low salt (light blue); (2) trained to avoid low salt (left) and found on high salt (dark blue); (3) trained to avoid high salt (right) and found on low salt (light blue); and (4) trained to avoid high salt (right) and found on high salt (dark blue). There was no significant difference in the healthy neuron fraction among animals conditioned on 0 mM NaCl, regardless of their behavioral outcome (Fig. 3f). In contrast, the ASE neuron-marked animals conditioned to avoid 20 mM NaCl, exhibited a significant increase in damaged neurons in the group that was moving toward the high salt concentration. As expected, URY neuron-marked nematodes did not show an accumulation of neurodegeneration in any of the groups (Fig. 3f).

In conclusion, these results establish a direct link between neuronal degeneration and functional impairment, demonstrating the power of transcriptome clock-predicting biologically older neurons (henceforth, referred to as ‘biologically old' or ‘biologically aged').

To understand commonalities among the biologically young, as well as among the rapidly aging neuron types, we adapted a hierarchical whole-animal connectome for C. elegans26 with a rough anatomical correspondence on the x axis and directional flow of neuronal signaling on the y axis and color coded it with the predicted biological age (Fig. 3g). The biologically oldest neurons clustered in the upper-middle part of the network and consist mostly of sensory neurons, while the youngest neurons clustered further to the right. Of the 10 oldest neurons, 6 are amphid neurons (ADL, ASJ, ASK, ASG, ADF, ASI), the primary chemosensory organ, which is mostly ciliated27. The 14 amphid neurons of the CeNGEN dataset showed a significantly increased biological age compared to the other 114 neurons (Fig. 3h), which can be replicated in the Calico dataset (Extended Data Fig. 3a), and with the Stochastic Clock (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The sensory amphid neurons express a variety of neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, receptors and innexins to transmit the sensed cues. The numbers of expressed neuropeptides and receptors were significantly higher in amphid neurons (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), while the number of neurotransmitter or innexins was not significantly changed (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f)28. Moreover, the numbers of neuropeptides and receptors per neuron were significantly positively correlated with the predicted biological age in the CeNGEN dataset (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h), the Calico dataset (Extended Data Fig. 3i,j) and the Stochastic Clock predictions (Extended Data Fig. 3k,l). To test whether neuropeptide release promotes neuronal aging, we used unc-31 mutants defective in neuropeptide release and observed a mild, yet nonsignificant, reduction in ASI degeneration (Extended Data Fig. 3m). The number of innexins and number of total synapses per neuron did not show a significant correlation with biological age (Extended Data Fig. 3n–s).

Amphid neurons are part of the ciliated neuron classes; comparing all 28 ciliated neurons with the remaining 100 neurons also shows a significantly increased biological age (Fig. 3h), which can be replicated in the Calico dataset (Extended Data Fig. 3t) and with the Stochastic Clock (Extended Data Fig. 3u). The ciliated neurons can be further divided into five distinct classes depending on where their cilia terminate27. Neurons with cilia exposed to the environment show the highest biological age (Fig. 3i), while the other ciliated neuron classes are not significantly different from not-ciliated neurons. A similar effect can be observed in the Calico dataset (Extended Data Fig. 3v) and with the Stochastic Clock (Extended Data Fig. 3w). These results indicate that the oldest neurons are functionally related and mostly consist of ciliated sensory neurons that have contact with the environment and produce neuropeptides.

To identify the transcriptional patterns and signatures underlying the biological age distinctions, we initially categorized the 128 neuron types into five distinct groups based on their biological age ranking (for example, the 25 youngest in group 1, position 26 to 50 in group 2). A fuzzy clustering analysis of 4 transcriptional clusters (determined by the standard elbow criterion to provide the best balance between cluster resolution and interpretability) identified neuronal age-dependent gene expression trends (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 4a).

a, Fuzzy clustering on z-score-normalized gene expression values (y axis) over the predicted aging course of the 128 CeNGEN neurons identified four clusters. The 128 neurons were merged into five age-prediction bins: (1) 97–110 h, (2) 110–120 h, (3) 120–130 h, (4) 130–140 h and (5) 140–180 h (x axis). The number of genes within each cluster are annotated. Dashed black lines show the central trend. b, Pathway overrepresentation analysis of the four clusters shows age-related pathways. The x axis shows pathway terms, and the y axis indicates clusters. Circle size reflects the enrichment score, defined as the log2 ratio of observed-to-expected genes per pathway (log2 enrichment ratio). Circle color represents statistical significance as –log10(false discovery rate (FDR)). Only representative nonredundant pathways are shown for visualization (Methods). c, Fraction plots displaying the fraction of nematodes at day 1 of adulthood expressing GFP in different neurons categorized as ‘healthy', ‘mildly damaged' and ‘severely damaged' that were treated with 2 mM CHX for 24 h.

Cluster A is composed of genes that generally increased over biological age, and is enriched for genes involved in nucleolar functions such as rRNA and tRNA processing, ribosome biogenesis and pre-ribosomes, as well as DNA repair (Fig. 4b; cluster A). Cluster B, composed of genes with highest expression in the youngest age group, an overall decline over the biological age time course including some variation and a peak in age group 4, is enriched in mRNA processing and ribosomal genes. Cluster C, comprising genes increasingly expressed over the predicted age and then sharply declining in the oldest age group, is enriched for cell junctions and synapse-related genes. Cluster D contains genes that only strongly increase in the oldest age group with functions in neuropeptide signaling and immune response. In sum, these four clusters suggest roles for translation, ribosome biogenesis and synaptic function in neuronal aging.

Based on the enrichment of protein biosynthesis processes in the accelerated aging neurons, we tested whether translational activity contributes to neurodegeneration. To reduce protein biosynthesis, we treated nematodes with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) at a dose that induces translation reduction but not full inhibition29. Here, we scored neurite degeneration in biologically older ASK and ASJ neurons, as well as in biologically younger I2 and OLL neurons. To confirm reduction of translation, we used a SUnSET assay and observed that CHX treatment significantly reduced overall protein synthesis (Extended Data Fig. 4b) with a Cohen's h of 0.48, indicating a mild reduction of translation. Additionally, we observed reduced translation in individual neurons as assessed by the reduction of GFP expression in the presence of CHX in three of the four tested neuron types. These results further corroborate our approach using CHX treatment to reduce translation also in the analyzed neurons (Extended Data Fig. 4c).

In the biologically young neurons, no effect of CHX treatment was observed (Fig. 4c). In contrast, biologically old neurons exhibited significantly less neurite deterioration upon CHX treatment (Fig. 4c). Consistently, ASE neurons that were CHX treated showed significantly less blebs than solvent control-treated neurons (Fig. 4d,e), and the nematodes showed an improved salt evasion response after they were conditioned to associate high salt concentrations with starvation (Fig. 4f), indicative of preserved neuronal health. Furthermore, we tested whether CHX treatment would have a lasting effect on neuronal integrity (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). Even at adult day 4, ASJ and ASE neurons showed significantly improved health when treated with CHX for only 24 h beginning at the L4 stage. Chronic treatment for the whole duration until neurite damage scoring conferred even stronger neuroprotection. Taken together, these results indicate that translational activity promotes neurodegeneration and that reduced translation could restore neuronal integrity.

Next, we addressed whether the biological age-related transcriptional patterns of neurons in young adult C. elegans (NeuronAge) are conserved in higher organisms. We defined NeuronAge as the transcriptome changes across the predicted age, quantified by the Pearson correlation between the z-scored transcripts per million (TPM) values and the predicted ages of 128 neurons. We then compared the conserved Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichments of NeuronAge with mouse and human brain aging datasets. We computed age correlations of z-score-normalized gene counts for all human brain regions during aging in the GTEx dataset, the Tabula Muris Senis (TMS) dataset and an additional mouse hypothalamus aging cohort (GSE157025). Similarly, we calculated the enriched pathways in brain datasets for several geroprotective treatments such as young serum injections, the platelet factor PF4, sport in humans and krill oil in C. elegans (for references, see the Methods). An unbiased clustering analysis revealed that the transcriptomic NeuronAge pattern of C. elegans and the chronological brain aging trajectories of mouse and humans cluster together (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 5a). We validated the clustering of NeuronAge by including the conserved pathway enrichments for NeuronAge in the Calico dataset. Both NeuronAge and its Calico validation showed significant positive correlations with all individual brain aging trajectories of humans and mice after multiple testing correction. The transcriptomic pattern of the geroprotective interventions formed a separate cluster that negatively correlates with the brain aging pattern, irrespective of the organism. To address potential methodological differences between aging and geroprotective datasets, that is, that aging patterns were derived using Pearson correlations with age, whereas geroprotective effects were analyzed using log-fold changes (logFC), we additionally computed logFC-based pathway enrichments for all aging datasets by comparing the oldest and youngest sample groups within each dataset. The resulting clustering (Extended Data Fig. 5b) confirmed that aging-related patterns remain distinct from geroprotective interventions, regardless of whether Pearson correlation or logFC-based methods were applied. These results indicate that neuronal transcriptomic aging patterns are conserved from nematodes to humans and that known geroprotective treatments anticorrelate with the aging datasets supporting their geroprotective effectiveness.

The normalized enrichment scores of the conserved KEGG pathways for the indicated aging pattern or treatment effects were used for an unbiased clustering analysis. The matrix is color coded according to the Pearson correlation between the indicated comparisons. The colors on the side indicate the species and whether it was an aging trajectory or a geroprotective treatment.

As the NeuronAge predictions cluster together with human neuronal chronological aging trajectories, we sought to identify small-molecule compounds that could delay neuronal aging. We used the 3,566 transcriptomes from a terminally differentiated neuronal cell line of the CMAP resource, consisting of 2,467 different molecules13 (Fig. 6a). Based on their correlation with the NeuronAge signature, we identified both negatively correlated (potentially neuroprotective/‘anti-NeuronAge') and positively correlated (potentially neurotoxic/‘pro-NeuronAge') compounds (Fig. 6b). Consistent with our experimental results, the transcriptome changes induced by CHX were inversely related to the NeuronAge signature, indicating that the beneficial effect of CHX that we observed above is mirrored in the transcriptome. After applying multiple computational filtering steps (Methods), we ranked the remaining candidate compounds by their correlation with NeuronAge (Fig. 6b). The top anti-NeuronAge hits contain several compounds (9 of 16) for which a protective effect in neurons has been previously documented, thus independently validating our approach (Fig. 6b). Two of 15 ‘pro-NeuronAge' compounds were shown to be detrimental, while one is potentially protective, and one was described as both harmful and protective. More than half of the top hits have, however, not been tested in neurons.

a, Flowchart depicting the in silico drug screening. We computed and correlated the conserved KEGG pathway enrichments for NeuronAge and all compounds from the CMAP dataset that are measured on the neuronal cell line NEU. To obtain a manageable list, we filtered for compounds that were measured at least twice, show consistent correlations in all measurements, have a stronger correlation at the 24-h time point compared to the 6-h time point, have information in PubCHEM and have at least an absolute correlation value of 0.25. b, The top anti-NeuronAge and pro-NeuronAge compounds after the filtering steps ranked according to their Pearson correlation.

In summary, 11 of 31 compounds have documented neuroprotective effects, of which 9 are predicted to revert NeuronAge, that is ‘anti-NeuronAge', with our in silico approach. Similarly, 2 of 31 compounds are known to be neurotoxic, and both are predicted correctly to be ‘pro-aging', giving weight to the potential that an in silico screen can identify compounds that could be repurposed as either neuroprotective or neurotoxic agents.

Next, we tested whether several compounds that we predicted to be anti-NeuronAge, that is, neuroprotective, could prevent the age-related functional decline of neurons. We chose two compounds, which were among the most strongly anticorrelated with NeuronAge patterns, BRD-K13195996 and vanoxerine (Fig. 6b). The chemical identity of the phenolic compound BRD-K13195996 is 3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid, which is related to 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid, which is also known as syringic acid. Syringic acid is a naturally occurring secondary compound derived from edible plants and fruits, for example, olives, walnuts and grapes30. A correlation between the antioxidative properties of syringic acid and reduced neurotoxicity following bisphenol A insult has recently been shown31, yet no clear mechanism was reported so far32. Vanoxerine is a potent dopamine uptake inhibitor and was tested as a supportive agent in cocaine-abuse medications33; moreover, vanoxerine was observed to impede colorectal cancer stem cell functions by repressing G9a expression34. Vanoxerine is so far not reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects.

We applied both compounds to L4 stage nematodes for a 24-h short-term treatment. We assessed neurite degeneration in the biologically old ASJ and ASK neurons and observed a significantly reduced deterioration for both compounds (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). In contrast, the biologically young OLL neurons, serving as controls, were not significantly affected by either of the compounds (Extended Data Fig. 6c). This indicates that both compounds interfere with the physiological degeneration process of the rapidly aging neurons and can restore a healthy neuron state.

Next, we assessed whether the NeuronAge compound predictions could also identify neurotoxic compounds and hence serve for pharmacological risk assessment. We tested the compounds WAY-100635, for which so far no adverse effects on neuron health have been reported, and Bay K8644 on the health of the young predicted I2 and OLL neurons. We observed that WAY-100635 induced significant neurite deterioration in I2 but not in OLL neurons, while Bay K8644 induced significant degeneration in both I2 and OLL neurons (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). ASK neurons that already display neurodegeneration early in life were significantly further compromised by Bay K8644 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 6e), confirming the neurotoxic effect of Bay K8644.

Additionally, resveratrol, which was reported to have ambiguous effects, was positively correlated with NeuronAge (Fig. 6b), and we observed significantly increased neuronal damage in I2, ASJ and ASK neurons, with a similar but nonsignificant trend observed in OLL neurons (Extended Data Fig. 6f,g), supporting our predicted detrimental impact.

Taken together, we validated the anti-NeuronAge compound prediction method by identifying known neuroprotectors as well as discovering previously unknown neuroprotective molecules. In reverse, the prediction of a positive correlation with NeuronAge revealed neurotoxic compound properties.

Finally, we assessed whether drug-induced neuroprotection or degeneration preserved or compromised neuronal function, respectively. We treated URY neuron-marked animals with either WAY-100635 or syringic acid and analyzed neurodegeneration and pathogen avoidance that depends on the integrity of URY neurons (Fig. 3c). First, we confirmed that WAY-100635 exerts a significant neurotoxic effect in URY neurons (Fig. 6d). As expected from the already large healthy fraction of URY neurons, the beneficial effect of syringic acid was slight but not significant (Extended Data Fig. 6h–j).

In contrast to the drug treatment assays above, the avoidance assay necessitated the use of live bacteria. To exclude the possibility that bacterial metabolism of the compounds might confound the analysis, we pre-incubated WAY-100635 and syringic acid with either live or dead Db11 bacteria before nematode exposure (Extended Data Fig. 6h–j) and observed no significant differences thus validating this approach.

WAY-100635 treatment severely impaired pathogen avoidance from Db11 bacteria compared to solvent control treatment (Fig. 6e), while syringic acid treatment led to a small, nonsignificant increase in avoidance reaction, in line with the slight improvement in the preservation of URY neurons (Fig. 6d). This observation further corroborates the functional outcome of the morphological degeneration and substantiates that our prediction approach can be used to identify neuroprotective and neurotoxic compounds (Fig. 6a,b).

In summary, our compound validation demonstrates that predicted anti-NeuronAge compounds significantly reduce neurite degeneration and preserve neuronal function, while predicted neurotoxic compounds exacerbate neuronal damage and disturb neuronal function. These results establish our in silico screening approach as an effective approach for identifying interventions to prevent neurodegeneration, as well as for identifying potential neurotoxic agents.

Why distinct neuron types exhibit different susceptibilities to age-dependent degeneration and the associated neurodegenerative diseases has remained largely unclear. While differences in interindividual aging are commonly known, differential aging of organs within the same organism, and aging variance between cells of the same tissue have only recently been observed35,36. Using the two distinct aging clock paradigms, we found a substantial diversity of biological age predictions with specific neuron types displaying accelerated or delayed aging in chronologically young animals. Similar to such early detection of aging, epigenetic clocks in mice start advancing right after their resetting at the ground-zero stage during gastrulation37 and in humans they detected aging during childhood38. The substantial heterogeneity in neuronal aging was further supported by the age-dependent decline of long gene expression. The reliability of the age predictions was further evidenced by the corresponding age-dependent degeneration of specific neuron types. Particularly ciliated sensory neurons show an increased biological age, which may result from their exposure to the environment or could indicate that their utility is restricted to sensing optimal environmental conditions before entering reproductive age. Similarly, degeneration of the olfactory bulb, which is enriched by environmentally exposed, ciliated neurons, and loss of olfaction are among the first symptoms of Alzheimer's disease-related degeneration in humans39.

The biological age-correlated transcriptional patterns associated high translational loads with accelerated aging. Age-related changes in the translational machinery have been observed across various species, and downregulation of translation has been shown to extend lifespan upon dietary restriction, downregulation of mTOR or CHX treatment40,41. In C. elegans, nucleolar size that is linked to ribosome biogenesis inversely correlates with lifespan42, while aging is marked by declining protein synthesis43,44 and increased translation errors45. Stochiometric changes of the ribosome lead to accumulation of protein aggregates in the brain of old Nothobranchius furzeri46, which is in line with the enrichment of ribosomal proteins in the insoluble protein fraction of old C. elegans47. Consistently, we observed that transient translation inhibition by CHX treatment is sufficient to prevent the degeneration of the fast-aging neuron types.

The transcriptional patterns of nematode neuronal biological age differences are significantly correlated with mouse and human brain chronological aging trajectories, and anticorrelated with known geroprotective interventions such as young plasma treatment or sport. This conservation shows the potential of identifying conserved mechanisms that underlie the biological aging differences and might determine the susceptibility of specific neuron types to undergo degeneration and potentially contribute to specific neurodegenerative diseases.

The conservation of transcriptome age trajectories allowed us to design an in silico compound screen using the human CMAP dataset13. Such approaches have previously identified geroprotective compounds that either induce a ‘youthful' state as predicted through an age-classification approach leveraging the GTEx48 transcriptomic dataset49, by identifying compounds that counteract age-associated transcriptomic shifts using conserved aging signatures50, by mimicking longevity FOXO3 overexpression51, or induce a ‘youthful' matreotype52. Comparing transcriptomic data from C. elegans neurons to the CMAP resource, we identified known and previously unexplored neuroprotective small-molecule compounds. Syringic acid was described to reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, potentially by enhancing mitochondrial function and attenuation of acetylcholinesterase activity53,54,55. The 1,4-dialkylpiperazine derivative vanoxerine is a potent dopamine uptake inhibitor and was tested as a supportive agent in cocaine-abuse medications33. Vanoxerine was observed to impede colorectal cancer stem cell functions by repressing G9a expression34, and it was tested in clinical trials for use as an anti-arrhythmic drug56, but a phase III study was terminated due to the occurrence of ventricular proarrhythmia57. The development of analogs overcoming vanoxerine's limitations are a work in progress58. By testing syringic acid and vanoxerine as examples of the top-scoring compounds, we indeed found that they extend the integrity of fast-aging neurons indicating a biological age deceleration.

Conversely, the pro-aging prediction revealed neurotoxic effects of compounds and could thus be highly valuable in risk assessment. WAY-100635 is an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, acting both at presynaptic autoreceptors and postsynaptic sites to modulate serotonergic signaling and increase extracellular 5-HT levels59,60,61. In addition, WAY-100635 has an affinity for the dopamine D4 receptor, where it acts as a potent partial agonist at higher concentrations62,63. The carbon-11-labeled form of WAY-100635 ([carbonyl-¹¹C]WAY-100635) is used as a radioligand for in vivo positron emission tomography imaging of 5-HT1A receptors in the human brain64,65,66. While often considered safe, behavioral studies suggest context-specific effects: for example, it not only exacerbates depression-like phenotypes following mild traumatic brain injury in mice67, but also prevents selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced sexual dysfunction when coadministered with fluoxetine68. WAY-100635 induced significant neurite deterioration in I2 and URY neurons, underscoring the power of our approach for predicting neurotoxicity. Bay K8644 is a potent L-type calcium channel agonist, structurally related to dihydropyridines such as nifedipine. By promoting prolonged opening of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, Bay K8644 enhances calcium influx into neurons and has been used as a research tool to study calcium-dependent neuronal processes69. In animal models, Bay K8644 has been shown to induce seizures, oxidative stress and excitotoxic neuronal damage70,71,72. Consistently, we validated the predicted neurodegenerative effect of Bay K8644 across multiple neuron types. Notably, our analysis predicted resveratrol to be pro-aging, whereas the published effects have been controversial. Our in vivo validation demonstrates that resveratrol does not have a protective, but rather detrimental impact on neuronal health. Corroborating our findings, a recent study found resveratrol-induced brain atrophy in lemurs73. These results further validate our in silico drug screen for both identifying neuroprotective compounds that could preserve neuronal function and determining the risk of neurotoxic compounds that accelerate neurodegeneration.

Taken together, we here define the biological basis for the distinct susceptibility of neurons to undergo age-dependent degeneration. We establish the utility of using aging clocks to identify neuron-type-specific biological aging differences and based on their transcriptome profiles reveal conserved aging patterns also present in human brain aging. We show that this approach is suitable for identifying neuroprotective molecules and propose that they could be useful in delaying neuronal aging and protect from age-associated degeneration.

Nematodes were cultured on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates at 20 °C under standard conditions unless stated otherwise. All age statements given in this publication consider the first day of adulthood as day 1. A complete strain list can be found in the Supplementary Information.

Special care was exerted for maintaining the cultures (specifically for maintaining the strains carrying extrachromosomal arrays): To maintain good expression levels in each population, healthy-looking adults with strong, but not extreme, fluorescence were passaged. Without this careful selection, the fluorescence signals were lost over the course of a few generations.

Age synchronization for experiments was achieved by L4 picking. For all experiments, individuals displaying a medium to strong fluorescence were selected (this group consists of about 85% of the fluorescent nematodes); individuals with neither exceptionally strong fluorescence (≈3–5% of the fluorescent nematodes) nor weak fluorescence (≈5–10% of the fluorescent nematodes) were selected for experiments or passaging. The same criteria were applied when L3 larvae were selected for experiments.

Nematodes were synchronized by L4 picking and grown for 1 day, 4 days or 7 days. For imaging, nematodes were placed in a drop of 250 mM NaN3 on a 2% agarose pad. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss Imager.M2 at a magnification of ×400. z-stacks of nematode heads/tails were acquired using 2-µm step width. Acquisition time was set between 100 ms to 3 s per plane to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio.

Recorded z-stack images of neurons were analyzed manually, counting blebs, large spherical outgrowths, branching, breaks and necrosis on the dendrites of the analyzed neurons. Images were classified according to the degree of aberration: necrotic neurons, broken or truncated neurons, neurons with ≥10 blebs or ≥3 outgrowths were scored as ‘severely damaged'; neurons with 5–9 blebs, or 2 outgrowths were classified as ‘mildly damaged'; and neurons with <5 blebs or <2 outgrowths were classified as ‘healthy'. See Fig. 2b for exemplary images.

To statistically assess neuronal damage across conditions and time points, we used CLMs using the ordinal package in R. A logit link function was applied to estimate the cumulative probabilities of increasing damage severity. For neuron-specific analyses of damage progression over time, the time point was modeled as a numeric predictor (L4 = 0, day (D) 1 = 1, D4 = 4, D7 = 7), and separate CLMs were fit for each neuron type. Observed neuron counts per category were incorporated as weights using the weights argument. P values for the slope term were adjusted for multiple testing across neurons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. To compare damage susceptibility between neuron types, a full model including neuron identity, time point and their interaction was fit (score ~ neuron × age). Estimated marginal means were computed using the emmeans package, and Tukey-adjusted P values were reported for all pairwise neuron contrasts. For comparisons between two conditions (for example, treatment versus control), we modeled the score as a function of the condition only (score ~ condition), again using CLMs with logit link and frequency weights. Multiple-testing correction across neurons was performed using the Benjamini–Hochberg method, where applicable.

Standard NGM plates, seeded with OP50, were inactivated with 500 mJ/cm2 of 251-nm UV-C light (Stratalinker 2400) and afterward were subjected to compound coating by dropwise addition of compounds directly to the agar surface. Plates were dried for at least 1 h before transferring L4-stage nematodes onto them. Nematodes were incubated with the compounds for 24 h and then used for neurite imaging. The final concentration of compounds was: CHX, 2 mM; syringic acid, 2.5 mM; vanoxerine, 10 nM; WAY-100635, 25 nM; (S)-(−)-Bay K8644, 250 µM; resveratrol, 200 µM. Control nematodes were incubated on appropriate solvent control-coated plates (either water, for syringic acid and WAY-100635, ≤5‰ DMSO, for CHX and vanoxerine, or 1‰ ethanol, for resveratrol).

S. marcescens Db11 bacteria were inoculated into LB medium with kanamycin, tetracycline and streptomycin from glycerol stock and incubated overnight with shaking at 150 rpm at 25 °C. Control E. coli OP50 bacteria were grown in LB medium without antibiotics and incubated overnight with shaking at 150 rpm at 37 °C. NGM plates (6 cm) were cast 3 days before seeding. The plates were seeded with 350 µl bacterial solution, generating a perfect round spot in the middle of the plate and allowed to dry for 2 h. For compound treatment, 2.5 mM syringic acid or 25 nM WAY-100635 was added before seeding and allowed to dry. Around 15–30 L4-stage nematodes of strains JKM10, IG10 and MT21910 were added directly into the bacterial lawn and incubated for 48 h. Nematodes were scored for their presence on or avoidance of the lawn. Five independent cohorts of 4–5 plates each were analyzed, and the position of the nematodes was checked four times with a 5-min interval time. The aversion index was calculated as the number of nematodes outside the lawn divided by total number of nematodes. Potential compound metabolization by the living Db11 bacteria has been tested in prior experiments.

For testing compounds and pathogen avoidance from S. marcescens Db11, bacteria could not be inactivated with UV irradiation because it would negate the aversion behavior. To test whether Db11 bacteria would metabolize the compounds, a test treatment was performed: 2.5 mM syringic acid or 25 µM WAY-100635 was incubated with living or dead Db11 bacteria for 2 days; afterward, bacteria were removed by sterile filtration and the compound-containing flowthrough was applied on UV-inactivated OP50. L4-stage JKM10 nematodes were placed on these plates, and neurodegeneration was assessed 24 h later. There was no significant difference between the compounds that were pretreated with living or dead Db11 bacteria (Extended Data Fig. 6h–j).

Adapted from Lim et al.25, nematodes were synchronized by L4 picking and grown for an additional day to their first day of adulthood, then nematodes were rinsed off the plates with M9 medium and washed twice with M9. The nematodes were split into two groups and salt-free conditioning medium or salt-containing conditioning medium (1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KPO42− pH 6.0, ±20 mM NaCl) was added. Subsequently, nematodes were incubated at 20 °C rotating at 20 rpm for 3 h.

Assay plates (3.5 cm; 2% (wt/vol) ager, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 5 mM KPO42− pH 6.0) were cast 2 days before the experiment. To establish the NaCl gradient on the assay plates, agar plugs containing 100 mM NaCl (2% (wt/vol) agar, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 5 mM KPO42− pH 6.0) were placed on one side on the plate and incubated at 23 °C for 3 h. After the gradient was established, salt-agar plugs were removed and 3 µl 500 mM NaN3 was added to the spot where the plug was placed. An additional 3 µl 500 mM NaN3 was added to the opposite site of the plate, and the plates were directly used for the assay.

After 3 h of conditioning, excessive medium was removed, and nematodes were transferred onto the center of the prepared salt-gradient assay plates. Nematodes were allowed to crawl freely on the plate according to their preferences for 30 min and at 20 °C. Afterward, nematodes that remained on the origin, that moved toward high salt and those that moved toward low salt were counted, and the chemotaxis index was calculated as: ci = (number on high salt – number on low salt) / (total number – number on origin).

For CHX treatment, nematodes were synchronized by L4 picking and placed on an OP50-seeded NGM plate, coated with 2 mM CHX, for 24 h. After compound incubation, the nematodes were processed as described above.

The BitAge clock10 was used as described previously. Briefly, each sample was binarized, that is, genes higher than the median expression value within each sample after removing genes with zero counts, were set to 1, and the remaining genes to 0. The BitAge coefficients for the 576 clock genes are added up for all genes in a given sample that is 1 after binarization. After adding the BitAge intercept, the results show the predicted biological age. For the Calico dataset, only single-neuron types were considered, that is, cells annotated as multiple neuron types were excluded. For neuron types with two biological replicates, the predicted biological ages of the replicates were averaged to obtain a single age prediction per neuron type.

The Stochastic Clock was used as described previously12. Briefly, each sample was log10-transformed after the addition of one pseudo-count. Subsequently, the samples were min–max normalized to bring each sample within the range (0, 1), and then binarized as described above. The normalized counts were then added up for all 1,010 stochastic data-based clock genes. For the Calico dataset, where some neuron types had two biological replicates, the predicted biological ages of the replicates were averaged to obtain a single age prediction per neuron type. Note that the Stochastic Clock might result in slightly different genes every time a clock is trained.

First, we downloaded the differentially expressed genes for each neuron type and all other cells in the CeNGEN14 dataset (https://cengen.shinyapps.io/CengenApp/) with the statistical test ‘Wilcoxon on single cells'. This gives a list of genes with logFC, and percentage expression in the specific neuron type and all other cells. We further filtered this list of significant genes by requiring that the gene is expressed in at least 90% of cells of the specific neuron type and at most 10% in all other cell types. In total, 39 neuron types had no genes with these requirements, that is, 89 neuron types were used for further analysis. Next, we used the such-defined marker genes of the 20% oldest (57 genes) and respective 20% youngest neurons (67 genes) and calculated the density distribution of the log10-normalized gene lengths. To calculate a two-sided permutation test, we calculated the median log10 gene length of the genes and compared it to the 100,000-permutation median. The permutation for the old marker genes used 57 genes, while the permutation for the young marker genes used 67 genes of all marker genes (303) of the 89 neuron types.

In a complementary analysis, we calculated the median log10 gene length of the marker genes for each of the neuron types individually. These median values were correlated with the predicted biological age using a Pearson correlation and visualized with a linear regression plot.

To quantify transcriptomic aging patterns across neuronal cell types, we defined NeuronAge as the correlation between gene expression and predicted biological age with BitAge. TPM values for all 128 neuron types were obtained from the CeNGEN transcriptomic dataset, and each of the 18,475 genes was z-score normalized across all 128 neuron types. Predicted ages for the same neurons were derived using the BitAge clock. For every gene, we calculated the Pearson correlation between its z-scored TPM values and the predicted ages across all 128 neuronal cell types. The resulting correlation coefficients represent the NeuronAge transcriptional signature.

We downloaded and adapted the Cytoscape file from Cook et al.26 by adding head neurons, deleting nonneuronal cell types and color coding neurons by their predicted Age with BitAge on the CeNGEN dataset.

The NeuroType.xlsx file was downloaded from https://www.wormatlas.org/neuronalwiring.html. For each of the 128 neuron types, we summed the median total number of synapses in the head, tail and mid-body.

To identify transcriptional patterns associated with the predicted neuronal age, we ranked the 128 neuron types based on their predicted age and grouped them into five bins: (1) [97, 110], (2) [110, 120], (3) [120, 130], (4) [130, 140] and (5) [140, 180]. Within each bin, we computed the median expression level for each gene. To make the genes comparable and bring them onto the same scale, we calculated the z-score across the five bins for each of the 9,950 genes with nonzero standard deviation. Next, we used fuzzy clustering with Mfuzz (v2.58.0)74 to identify transcriptional clusters across the predicted age bins. The elbow method was computed with the Dmin function of Mfuzz and indicated an optimal number of four clusters. The genes belonging to each cluster were subsequently used for a pathway enrichment analysis with clusterprofiler (v4.9.2.002)75, with maxGSSize = 500 and the list of all 9,950 genes as the background gene list. All significantly enriched pathways (adjusted P < 0.05) were identified, and redundant pathways were collapsed using semantic similarity filtering. Although this procedure substantially reduced redundancy, the remaining number of nonoverlapping pathways was still too large to display comprehensively in a single figure. For visualization purposes, we therefore selected a representative subset of pathways from each cluster based on (i) statistical significance, (ii) effect size and (iii) biological interpretability.

We processed several public datasets (GTEx dataset48, the TMS dataset76 and an additional mouse hypothalamus aging cohort (GSE157025), young serum injections77, platelet factor PF4 (ref. 78), sport in humans79, krill oil in C. elegans80) for the heat map:

TPM-normalized gene expression values for human brain tissues from the GTEx v8 data81 release (that is, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate basal ganglia, cerebellar hemisphere, cerebellum, cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, nuclear accumbens basal, putamen basal ganglia, substantia nigra) were correlated with the chronological age (the midpoints of the publicly available age bins).

The mouse aging time course for hypothalamus data from GSE157025 was downloaded and a gene-wise correlation with the chronological age calculated.

Whole-brain data from the TMS (GSE132040) was downloaded and edgeR (v3.40.2)82 was used to calculate normalized expression values. The normalized expression values were correlated to the chronological age.

Differentially expressed genes for mouse hippocampus data treated with the platelet factor PF4 or saline control were downloaded from GSE173254. We multiplied the logFCs by −1 to always compare treatment versus control, instead of control versus treatment.

Differentially expressed genes for mouse hippocampus data treated with young serum or sham were downloaded from GSE234667.

C. elegans whole-nematode data treated with krill oil from GSE207152. We used edgeR (v3.40.2)82 to calculate normalized expression values and calculated z-scores for each gene over all samples. The z-score-normalized expression values were used for a regression model: \({\rm{expression}}=\,{\beta }_{0}+{\beta }_{1}\times {\rm{Age}}+{\beta }_{2}\times {\rm{Krilloil}}+{\beta }_{3}\times ({\rm{Age}}\times {\rm{Krilloil}})\), where \({\beta }_{0}\) is the intercept term, \({\beta }_{1}\) is the coefficient for the Age variable, \({\beta }_{2}\) is the coefficient for the Krilloil-treatment variable, and \({\beta }_{3}\) is the coefficient for the interaction between Age and Krilloil, that is, the difference in the slope over age.

Differential expressed genes upon physical activity were downloaded from the supplementary data (Supplemental Table 2) from Berchtold et al.79.

The Pearson correlation values of all genes of (1)–(3), the logFC of all genes for (4) and (5) and the \({\beta }_{3}\) coefficients for (6) were used to calculate enriched pathways analysis with fgseaMultilevel from the fgsea R package83 and with nPermSimple = 1,000 for all conserved KEGG pathways between C. elegans, mouse and humans. For (7), the ‘anti-aging/Alzheimer's disease' genes were split into genes that are upregulated and, respectively, downregulated upon exercise. Both gene sets were used for an enrichment analysis with enricher from enrichplot v1.18.0 with maxGSSize = 500 and minGSSize = 5, and all genes were quantified in the supplementary data from Berchtold et al.79 as the background gene list. For both enrichment analyses, the enrichment fold change, that is, the number of observed genes per pathway divided by the number of expected genes per pathway, was calculated. Finally, the fold changes were combined, that is, pathways with a bigger fold-change enrichment in the downregulated genes were multiplied by −1.

The clustering was done on the normalized enrichment scores for (1)–(6) and the fold change enrichment score for (7) with the Ward method and a correlation distance matrix.

For the heat map with differentialy expressed genes, we processed the data in the following way:

CeNGENApp (https://cengen.shinyapps.io/CengenApp/) was used to find differentially expressed genes between the ten oldest predicted CeNGEN neurons (according to BitAge) and the ten youngest predicted neurons. The differentialy expressed genes were calculated with the ‘Pseudobulk:Wilcoxon' statistical test.

Raw gene expression values for human brain tissues from the GTEx v8 data81 release (that is, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate basal ganglia, cerebellar hemisphere, cerebellum, cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, nuclear accumbens basal, putamen basal ganglia, substantia nigra) were normalized with edgeR and differentially expressed genes calculated between old (≥70 years) and young (≤40 years).

The whole-brain data from the TMS (GSE132040) were normalized with edgeR (v3.40.2)82, and differentially expressed genes were calculated between old (≥21 months) and young (1 month) mice.

The mouse aging time course data for the hypothalamus from GSE157025 were normalized with edgeR (v3.40.2)82, and differentially expressed genes were calculated between old (24 months) and young (5 day) mice.

The enriched pathways were computed as described above.

The CMAP resource uses the L1000 array, which measures 978 landmark transcripts, which can be used to infer most of the remaining transcriptome with high accuracy13. Here we used all available L1000 datasets for a human differentiated neuronal cell line. We downloaded the aggregated level 5 L1000 Connectivity Map13 data from GSE92742 and performed pathway enrichment analysis with fgseaMultilevel from the fgsea R package83 with nPermSimple = 1,000 and the conserved KEGG pathways between human and C. elegans for each of the samples in the level 5 dataset. To compare it to the NeuronAge pattern, we first calculated the z-score of each gene that has at least some gene counts across the 128 neurons of the CeNGEN dataset. We correlated these z-score-normalized genes with the biological age prediction from BitAge. The resulting Pearson correlation values for all genes were used for a pathway enrichment analysis with fgseaMultilevel and the conserved KEGG pathways between human and C. elegans. To identify whether any compound might revert the NeuronAge gene expression pattern on the pathway level, we correlated the normalized enrichment scores of the NeuronAge KEGG pathway enrichment analysis with all the normalized enrichment scores that we calculated from the CMAP dataset. Next, we filtered for only compounds that were tested in the neuronal cell line (‘NEU'). Compounds had to be tested at least twice, with all measurements resulting in correlations in the same direction. Additionally, we filtered for compounds that were measured at 24 h and 6 h and took only those compounds that showed a stronger correlation into the same direction at the 24-h time point compared to the 6-h time point. Lastly, we filtered out those compounds that had no information available at PubCHEM and used a correlation threshold of 0.25 (respective −0.25).

The assignment of known protective or detrimental compounds is based on literature reports: The glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor AR-A014418 was shown to inhibit beta-amyloid-induced neurodegeneration84; the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine protects against neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration85; the PPAR-alpha activator gemfibrozil exhibits neuroprotective effects via upregulating pro-survival factors and suppressing inflammation86; the kinase inhibitor sorafenib protects against neurodegeneration in C. elegans87; the selective aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulator 3,3'-diindolylmethane is neuroprotective and promotes brain-derived neurotrophic factor88; the insulin-sensitizing agent rosiglitazone exhibits neuroprotective effects in the eye and the brain89; the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 was shown to reduce hippocampal apoptosis and rescue spatial learning as well as memory deficits in rats90; dibutyryl-cAMP-Na (dBcAMP) elevates cAMP levels and protects against neurodegeneration in stab wound or kainic acid injuries91; and the catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitor tolcapone was shown to improve cognitive function92.

Bay K8644 is described to be neurotoxic70; and amiodarone induces neuronal apoptosis93 and is known to induce adverse neurological effects94. Tacedinaline/CI-994 is a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, correlates positively with NeuronAge, and was shown to promote functional recovery following spinal cord injury95, and to enhance synaptic and structural neuroplasticity96. Likewise, resveratrol is potentially neuroprotective due to a hormetic response97, while there is evidence that it could lead to impaired brain integrity73.

To test whether GFP expression induces neuronal aberrations, we correlated GFP expression intensity and blebbing. In brief, fluorescence images of PY6457 (ASK neurons) and OE3010 (ASJ neurons) nematodes at the first day of adulthood were recorded using an epifluorescence microscope. PY6457 and OE3010 were selected because they carry the neuron-type-specific GFP marker as an extrachromosomal array that has a strongly varying expressivity between individuals. Blebbing was observed as the major degeneration hallmark in ASJ and ASK neurons and, therefore, used as single correlation criterion. Four cohorts of 10–20 nematodes per strain were accumulated in single plots and the correlation was analyzed by Pearson's correlation.

To test if bleb appearance is fully random or linked to development of conserved structures along neurites, bleb distance from neurite start (at the site of the mouth) was measured using Fiji for every bleb on each neurite analyzed from three cohorts of 10–20 individual nematodes each. Relative positions of blebs were calculated by dividing the observed bleb's position (for example, 55 µm) by the total length of the analyzed neurite (for example, 98 µm). Relative positions were displayed as a histogram using 12 bins, and data from three cohorts were aggregated. A Pearson correlation versus 100 random data tracks was done using GraphPad Prism 10.

To calculate 100 tracks of a random damage distribution, a Python script was used with the following assumptions: (1) a random number of blebs (in 8–20) can appear, matching observed biological variability; (2) new blebs appear primarily at random but are slightly more likely to occur near previously formed blebs, reflecting spatial clustering seen in vivo; (3) already established blebs increase chances of blebs in their vicinity; (4) blebs cannot appear at the same position; (5) the proximal 10% of the neurite corresponds to the ciliary region, where structural complexity and imaging artifacts reduce the detectability of blebs, and this was modeled by suppressing bleb placement in this region; (5) neurite lengths were randomly sampled within the empirically observed range (80–100 µm).

All simulation parameters, including neurite length distributions, bleb counts, clustering strength and the extent of the protected proximal region, were derived directly from empirical measurements of ASJ, ASK and OLL neurons imaged in vivo. For each simulated neurite, bleb positions were generated iteratively and normalized to neurite length to match the experimental measurements. The resulting 100 simulated tracks were aggregated and compared to the observed data.

Nematodes of strains JKM10 (URY neurons), OH1422 (OLL neurons), NY2067 (ASE neurons), MT21910 (I2 neurons) and PY6457 (ASK neurons) were synchronized by L4 picking. Only nematodes that showed a easily visible fluorescence under a dissecting microscope were selected and singled onto OP50-seeded NGM plates.

The presence of the neurons was scored daily. Nematodes were passaged every second day to a fresh plate. Individuals were tracked over the course of 12 days or until they died, or until all GFP-marked neurons disappeared.

Neuron loss was analyzed according to Kaplan–Meier using the accumulated data from three cohorts of each of the 12 individuals (totaling 36 nematodes per strain), and significant differences were assessed by a log-rank test.

Additionally, the first day a neuron degenerated in every single individual was scored and plotted as a histogram showing the incidence of first neuron death.

Wild-type nematodes were synchronized by L4 picking (≈75 nematodes per cohort and condition) and placed on OP50-seeded NGM plates coated with 2 mM CHX or DMSO as control. After 24 h, plates were rinsed with S-Basal, and nematodes were collected in 1.5-ml tubes. Nematodes were washed once with S-Basal. Freshly grown OP50 bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (20 min at 4,000 rpm at 12 °C) and resuspended in 0.1 Vol. S-Basal.

Nematodes were resuspended with 200 µl of the concentrated bacteria. Puromycin was added to a final concentration of 500 µg ml−1 and topped up to 1 ml with S-Basal. CHX-treated samples were supplemented with 2 mM CHX additionally. Puromycin labeling was performed for 3 h, and nematodes were rotating at 20 rpm on a spin wheel at 20 °C.

Afterward, nematodes were washed thrice with S-Basal to remove residual puromycin. Finally, nematodes were resuspended in 30 µl 4xSDS-Sample buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min and then stored at −20 °C.

Frozen samples were thawed and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. In total, 15 µl of lysate was loaded on a 12% SDS–PAGE and run at 30 mA for 2 h. Western blot transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane was performed using Trans-blot Turbo (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's specifications (running at 2.0 A for 10 min).

Membrane was rinsed with TBS-T, Ponceau stain was applied, and imaging was performed. Ponceau staining was washed out three times with TBS-T. Membrane was blocked for 2 h in TBS-T + 5% (wt/vol) milk powder. Primary antibody incubation was done with 4G11 anti-puromycin antibody from mouse (1:1,000 dilution) in TBS-T + 2.5% (wt/vol) milk powder at 4 °C with shaking overnight. Afterward, membrane was washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:5,000 dilution) for 2 h. Blot was developed using ECL solution (Pierce) in an Amersham Imager 600. The acquisition time was ≈2 min.

Nematodes of strains JKM10 (URY neurons), OH1422 (OLL neurons), NY2067 (ASE neurons) and PY6457 (ASK neurons) were synchronized by L4 picking. Three cohorts per strain and condition (totaling 28–52 nematodes) were used for epifluorescence microscopy. Nematodes were prescreened to find the highest fluorescence intensity per strain; imaging settings were adjusted to not overexpose the nematode with the strongest fluorescence per strain. Imaging was performed on L4 larvae; the remaining L4 larvae from synchronization were subjected onto OP50-seeded NGM plates coated with 2 mM CHX or DMSO control and imaged after 24 h. Imaging settings were kept constant within strains. Imaging settings were kept constant between cohorts. Background fluorescence was subtracted. The mean ± s.d. was displayed as a swarm plot, and ANOVA + Tukey post hoc test were performed.

Three cohorts of nematodes expressing GFP in ASE, ASJ, ASK or OLL neurons have been treated with 2 mM CHX for either 24 h or 96 h starting from stage L4 onward. Neurite imaging was performed on day 4 of adulthood. Damage classification in ‘healthy', ‘damaged' and ‘severely damaged' neurons was done as described in the main text. Ordinal regression (CLM) was used to test for significant differences (using Python 3.12 library: statsmodels: 0.14.3).

All data are presented as the mean ± s.d. Number of cohorts (ℕ), individuals (n) and technical replicates (N) are stated in the figures and their respective figure legends. The applied statistical tests are mentioned in the figure legends, and the respective P values are directly reported in the diagrams. All statistics are two sided unless stated otherwise. Data normality was assessed by the Shapiro–Wilk test. Independent t-tests were calculated with Python's SciPy98 v1.5.1 stats.ttest_ind function. One-way ANOVA's were calculated with Python's pingouin99 v0.3.6 ANOVA function and the parameter ss_type = 2. Cohen's h100 as a measure of effect size was calculated by hand with Python's NumPy101 v1.18.5. Plots were generated with Python's Seaborn102 v.0.11.0, matplotlib103 v.3.3.0 or GraphPad Prism 10. Scatterplots showing a linear regression model fit are shown with a 95% confidence interval. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Sample sizes were determined based on established practices in the field and on empirical considerations. Group sizes of 10–30 animals were used for neurite degeneration scoring, and for chemotaxis assays 50–100 animals were used to balance practical feasibility and the ability to detect meaningful biological effects. No method of randomization was used to assign nematodes to experimental groups. Researchers were blinded during data analysis (folders/images were listed and assigned random alphanumeric IDs before analysis; after analysis, files were named back accordingly). If nematodes were damaged during handling, results from them were censored; whole-nematode cohorts were excluded if less than 80% of the desired animals survived until analysis day, or if nematodes were growing slowly (delayed by at least a day compared to usual growth rate of the respective strain) or were apparently sick (slow movements, begging, lethargic; this affected one cohort of MT21910 L4s in Fig. 2c and one subgroup of JKM10 in Fig. 6e).

a) Distribution of transcriptomic age predictions. The 67 neurons of the Calico day 1 dataset were predicted with BitAge and sorted by their predicted age. The x-axis shows the rank of the prediction is ascending order, the y-axis the predicted age. b) BitAge predictions on the CeNGEN and the Calico day 1 dataset are highly correlated (Pearson correlation 0.66, p-value 1.2e-09). The x-axis shows the BitAge predictions of the CeNGEN dataset, the y-axis BitAge predictions of the Calico day 1 dataset. 67 neurons are plotted. The regression model fit with a 95% confidence interval (shadowed area) is shown. c) Stochastic Clock predictions on the CeNGEN and the Calico day 1 dataset are highly correlated (Pearson correlation 0.82, p-value 3.2e-17). The x-axis shows the Stochastic Clock predictions of the CeNGEN dataset, the y-axis BitAge predictions of the Calico day 1 dataset. 67 neurons are plotted. The regression model fit with a 95% confidence interval (shadowed area) is shown. d) Age prediction of BitAge and the Stochastic Clock on Calico Day 1 data. The x-axis shows the predictions by BitAge, the y-axis the prediction by the stochastic clock. There is a strong correlation (Pearson correlation 0.74, p-value 7.8e-13). e) Age prediction of BitAge on CeNGEN bulk data vs CeNGEN pseudobulk. There is a strong correlation (Pearson correlation 0.65, p-value 2.2e-5). f) Age prediction of the Stochastic Clock on CeNGEN bulk data vs CeNGEN pseudobulk. There is a strong correlation (Pearson correlation 0.7, p-value 1.7e-6). g) Predictions with BitAge and the Stochastic Clock on the CeNGEN dataset are highly correlated. The x-axis shows the BitAge predictions of the CeNGEN dataset, the y-axis stochastic data-based clock predictions of the CeNGEN dataset. All 128 neurons are plotted, the 20% youngest and oldest according to BitAge are coloured in blue, the 20% youngest and oldest according to the StochasticClock are coloured in red, overlap between both violet. The remaining neurons are indicated in grey. The regression model fit with a 95% confidence interval (dashed, black lines) is shown. The five neurons the farthest away from the regression line (both, above and below) are indicated. h) BitAge (blue) and StochasticClock (red) predictions on an independent dataset of neuronal RNA from adult day 1 and adult day 8 old nematodes. i) Correlation of median gene length and predicted age of individual neuron types. BitAge clock used on the CeNGEN dataset. Linear fit (orange line) with 95% confidence interval (dashed, orange lines) is shown. Exemplary, young predicted neurons I2, OLL, and PHC (blue); and old predicted neurons ASI, ASJ, and ASK (orange) are indicated. j) Correlation of median gene length and predicted age of individual neuron types. Stochastic clock used on the CeNGEN dataset. Linear fit (orange line) with 95% confidence interval (dashed, orange lines) is shown. k) Correlation of median gene length and predicted age of individual neuron types.

Source data

a) Correlation of neuronal GFP expression in ASK neurons (left) or ASJ neurons (right) and scored blebs (major hallmark of neurodegeneration in these strains). Classification to the fraction of ‘healthy' (blue), ‘mildly damaged' (orange), or ‘severely damaged' (red) neurons is indicated. Linear regression (black line) and confidence band (grey lines) are displayed, and no significant correlation was found. Displayed are the pooled data of four independent cohorts of 12 – 25 adult day 1 old nematodes each. b) Fraction plot of neuronal integrity of URY neurons upon aging. Four to five cohorts of 12 – 25 JKM10 nematodes expressing GFP in URY neurons have been recorded and neurodegeneration was assessed and neurons categorized as ‘healthy' (blue), ‘mildly damaged' (orange), and ‘severely damaged' (red). Kruskal-Wallis test was performed, and no significant differences was observed. c) Z-Stack Maximum projection after background subtraction (Fiji – rolling ball radius 25) of fluorescence microscopic recording of representative JKM10 nematode expressing GFP in URY neurons. Scale bar indicates 20 µm. d) Fraction plot of neuronal integrity of ASI, ASJ, and ASK neurons at young ages (L3 and L4 stage). Three to four cohorts of 8 – 27 JKM10 nematodes expressing GFP in either ASI, ASJ, or ASK neurons have been recorded, neurodegeneration was assessed, and neurons categorized as ‘healthy' (blue), ‘mildly damaged' (orange), and ‘severely damaged' (red). Ordinal regression (cumulative link model) has been used to test for significant differences between ages. e) Stochastic appearance of neuronal damage. The top panel shows a representative epi fluorescent image of ASK neurons. Scale bar is 20 µm.

a) Output of the Dmin function of the Mfuzz R package. Soft clustering for cluster numbers ranging from 2-12 (x-axis) were calculated with Dmin. For each cluster number, Dmin calculates the distance between the centroids of the clusters (centroid distance) and reports the minimum centroid distance across 3 repetitions (y-axis). The optimal cluster number is estimated from the “elbow” of the plot (indicated by an orange arrow on the dashed line), that is the cluster number which shows a sharp decline in the minimum centroid distance (cluster Number=4). b) SUnSET assay to test translation efficacy upon cycloheximide treatment. Left side: Westernblot detecting puromycin labelled proteins, ponceau staining as loading control, left side: densitometric quantification normalized to total protein according to ponceau signal. Four independent cohorts of each ≈ 35 nematodes tested. One-tailed t-test to test for significance. Lysed nematodes were day 1 of adulthood, 2 mM CHX treatment since L4 stage and while puromycin labelling. c) Fluorescence quantification to assess GFP synthesis in selected neurons as proxy for translation. Three independent cohorts, total 28 – 52 nematodes analysed per strain and condition.

Three cohorts of 4 – 20 nematodes expressing GFP in either ASK, ASJ, ASE, or OLL neurons have been recorded, neurodegeneration was assessed, and neurons categorized as ‘healthy' (blue), ‘mildly damaged' (orange), and ‘severely damaged' (red). Ordinal regression (cumulative link model) has been used to test for significant differences between CHX and solvent control treatment. To test for significant differences a cumulative link model was built, pairwise comparison was corrected according to Bonferroni.

Source data

a) The normalized enrichment scores of the conserved KEGG pathways for the indicated aging pattern were used for an unbiased clustering analysis (the same as Fig. 5, but focusing on the aging pattern). The matrix is color-coded according to the Pearson correlation between the indicated comparisons.

Despite differences in computational approach, aging datasets cluster together, while geroprotective interventions form a separate cluster, reinforcing the robustness of the observed transcriptomic relationships. The colors on the side indicate the species and whether it was an aging trajectory or a geroprotective treatment.

Scientists have produced the most detailed map ever created of dark matter that runs throughout the Universe, revealing how it has influenced the formation of stars, galaxies, and planets.

The research, which includes astronomers from Durham University in the UK, provides new insight into how this unseen substance helped draw ordinary matter together, forming galaxies such as the Milky Way and eventually planets like Earth.

The findings are based on new observations from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) and are published in the journal Nature Astronomy.

The international study was led jointly by Durham University, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the École Polytechnique Fédéral de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.

How Dark Matter Shaped the Universe We See Today

The newly created map confirms earlier studies while revealing finer details about the relationship between dark matter and the normal matter that makes up everything we can see, touch, and interact with.

At the beginning of the Universe, both dark matter and ordinary matter were likely spread thinly across space. Scientists believe dark matter began clumping together first. Its gravity then pulled in normal matter, creating dense regions where stars and galaxies could begin to form.

This process set the overall pattern for how galaxies are distributed across the Universe today. By allowing galaxies and stars to form earlier than they otherwise would have, dark matter also helped create the conditions needed for planets to develop. Without this early influence, the elements required for life may never have formed within our galaxy.

Research co-lead author Dr. Gavin Leroy, in the Institute for Computational Cosmology, Department of Physics, Durham University, said: "By revealing dark matter with unprecedented precision, our map shows how an invisible component of the Universe has structured visible matter to the point of enabling the emergence of galaxies, stars, and ultimately life itself.

"This map reveals the invisible but essential role of dark matter, the true architect of the Universe, which gradually organizes the structures we observe through our telescopes."

Detecting the Invisible Through Gravity

Dark matter cannot be seen directly because it does not emit, reflect, absorb, or block light. It also moves through ordinary matter without interacting with it, much like a ghost.

Its presence is detected through gravity. The new map shows this effect with greater clarity than ever before. One key piece of evidence is how closely maps of dark matter line up with maps of normal matter.

According to the researchers, Webb's observations show that this alignment is not accidental. Instead, it reflects dark matter's gravitational pull drawing normal matter toward it throughout the history of the Universe.

Research co-author Professor Richard Massey, in the Institute for Computational Cosmology, Department of Physics, Durham University, said: "Wherever you find normal matter in the Universe today, you also find dark matter.

"Billions of dark matter particles pass through your body every second. There's no harm, they don't notice us and just keep going.

"But the whole swirling cloud of dark matter around the Milky Way has enough gravity to hold our entire galaxy together. Without dark matter, the Milky Way would spin itself apart."

Webb's Deep View of the Cosmos

The map covers a region of sky about 2.5 times the size of the full Moon, located in the constellation Sextans.

Webb observed this area for approximately 255 hours and identified nearly 800,000 galaxies, many of them seen for the first time. To locate dark matter, the team measured how its mass bends space, which in turn bends the light traveling to Earth from distant galaxies -- as if that light had passed through a warped windowpane.

The resulting map includes roughly ten times more galaxies than earlier ground-based maps of the same region and twice as many as those produced using the Hubble Space Telescope. It reveals new concentrations of dark matter and provides a much sharper view of areas previously observed by Hubble.

Research co-lead author Dr. Diana Scognamiglio, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said: "This is the largest dark matter map we've made with Webb, and it's twice as sharp as any dark matter map made by other observatories.

"Previously, we were looking at a blurry picture of dark matter. Now we're seeing the invisible scaffolding of the Universe in stunning detail, thanks to Webb's incredible resolution."

Instruments and Future Exploration

To improve distance measurements for many of the galaxies in the map, the research team used Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).

Durham University's Centre for Extragalactic Astronomy contributed to the development of MIRI, which was designed and managed through launch by JPL. The instrument is especially effective at detecting galaxies hidden behind thick clouds of cosmic dust.

The team plans to expand their work by mapping dark matter across the entire Universe using the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid telescope and NASA's upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. These future observations will help scientists better understand dark matter's basic properties and how it may have evolved over cosmic time.

The region of sky analyzed in this study will serve as a reference point, allowing future dark matter maps to be compared and refined with greater precision.

The latest research was funded by NASA, the RCUK/Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), RCUK/STFC Central Laser Facility at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales.

For scientists who track faint ripples traveling through the cosmos, GW250114 stands out. It is the clearest gravitational wave signal ever recorded from a pair of merging black holes, giving researchers an unusually sharp tool for testing Albert Einstein's theory of gravity, called general relativity.

"What's fantastic is the event is pretty much identical to the first one we observed 10 years ago, GW150914. The reason it's so much clearer is purely because our detectors have become much more accurate in the past 10 years," said Cornell physicist Keefe Mitman, a NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science in the College of Arts and Sciences.

A Global Effort to Study Black Hole Collisions

Mitman is a co-author of the study examining this signal, titled "Black Hole Spectroscopy and Tests of General Relativity with GW250114," which was published in Physical Review Letters on Jan. 29. The paper was produced by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration along with the Virgo Collaboration in Italy and the KAGRA Collaboration in Japan. Cornell scientists have played major roles in the LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA project since it began in the early 1990s.

The gravitational wave known as GW250114 was created when two black holes collided, sending ripples through space-time. That signal reached the U.S.-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatories (LIGO) on Jan. 14, 2025. Each gravitational wave is named for the date it is detected, and the LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA team publicly announced this one in September 2025. According to the analysis by Mitman and his colleagues, the signal behaves exactly as general relativity predicts. At the same time, researchers believe not every black hole merger will follow Einstein's rules so closely, which could open new doors in fundamental physics.

How Black Holes Reveal Their Secrets

When two black holes merge, the newly formed object vibrates, much like a struck bell. These vibrations produce distinct tones defined by two measurements, Mitman explained: an oscillation frequency and a damping time. Measuring a single tone allows scientists to calculate the mass and spin of the final black hole. Detecting two or more tones makes it possible to perform multiple, independent checks of those same properties, as predicted by general relativity.

"If those two measurements agree with one another, you are effectively verifying general relativity," Mitman said. "But if you measure two tones that don't match up with the same mass and spin combination, you can start to probe how much you've deviated away from general relativity's predictions."

In the case of GW250114, the signal was clear enough for scientists to measure two tones and place limits on a third. All of those results matched Einstein's theory.

Searching for Cracks in Einstein's Theory

What if the measurements had disagreed?

"Then we would have had a lot of work to do as physicists to try to explain what's going on and what the true theory of gravity would be in our Universe," Mitman said. He and his collaborators think it is possible that future gravitational wave signals will not fully align with general relativity, offering clues to long-standing mysteries.

Physicists already suspect that general relativity cannot be the final word on gravity. As Mitman noted, the theory does not explain phenomena such as dark energy and dark matter, and it fails when scientists try to reconcile it with the laws that govern the quantum world.

"There has to be some way to resolve this paradox to make our theory of gravity consistent with our theory of quantum mechanics," Mitman said. "Along those lines, we expect there to be some deviation from Einstein's classical prediction, where you might see signatures of quantum gravity imprinting themselves on these gravitational wave signals.

"The hope is that we'll see these deviations one day and that will help guide us along what the true theory of quantum gravity might be."

A new study examining how memory functions in the brain suggests that different kinds of remembering may rely on the same brain regions. Instead of using separate neural pathways to retrieve different types of information, the brain appears to activate overlapping areas, a finding that could change how memory is defined and studied.

The research was conducted by scientists from the School of Psychology at the University of Nottingham and the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge. By combining task based experiments with fMRI data, the team found no measurable difference in brain activity between successful episodic and semantic memory retrieval. The study was published in Nature Human Behaviour.

What Makes Episodic and Semantic Memory Different

Episodic memory allows people to recall specific past experiences that happened at a particular place and time. This form of memory enables individuals to mentally revisit moments from their lives, often described as "mental time travel."

Semantic memory, by contrast, involves recalling facts and general knowledge about the world. These memories are not tied to the original time or place where the information was learned and can be accessed independently of that context.

Testing Memory With Closely Matched Tasks

To directly compare how these two types of memory operate, the researchers designed tasks that were carefully aligned. Forty participants were asked to remember pairings between logos and brand names. Some pairings reflected real-world knowledge and formed the semantic task, while others were learned during an earlier study phase and served as the episodic task.

During these memory tasks, participants underwent fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanning. In the semantic task, they recalled brand details based on prior knowledge. In the episodic task, they remembered information about the logo and brand pairings learned earlier.

fMRI is a non-invasive brain imaging technique that measures activity by tracking changes in blood flow. When specific brain regions become active during tasks such as thinking, speaking, or remembering, they receive increased amounts of oxygen-rich blood. This allows researchers to produce detailed 3D images showing which parts of the brain are engaged, supporting studies of brain function, neurological conditions, and surgical planning.

Unexpected Findings From Neuroimaging

Dr. Roni Tibon, Assistant Professor in the School of Psychology, led the study and said the results challenged long-held assumptions.

"We were very surprised by the results of this study as a long-standing research tradition suggested there would be differences in brain activity with episodic and semantic retrieval. But when we used neuroimaging to investigate this alongside the task based study we found that the distinction didn't exist and that there is considerable overlap in the brain regions involved in semantic and episodic retrieval."

She also noted that the findings could offer new insights into memory related illnesses.

"These findings could help to better understand diseases like, dementia and Alzheimer's as we can begin to see that the whole brain is involved in the different types of memory so interventions could be developed to support this view."

Rethinking How Memory Is Studied

For many years, episodic and semantic memory have been treated as separate systems, leading researchers to investigate them independently. This approach has resulted in relatively few studies that examine both memory types within the same experimental framework.

Dr. Tibon believes the new evidence could help shift that perspective.

"Based on what we already knew from previous research in this area we really expected to see stark differences in brain activity but any difference we did see was very subtle, I think these results should change the direction of travel for this area of research and hopefully open up new interest in looking at both sides of memory and how they work together."

The Department of Homeland Security has been quietly demanding tech companies turn over user information about critics of the Trump administration, according to reports.

In several cases over recent months, Homeland Security has relied on the use of administrative subpoenas to seek identifiable information about individuals who run anonymous Instagram accounts, which share posts about ICE immigration raids in their local neighborhoods. These subpoenas have also been used to demand information about people who have criticized Trump officials or protested government policies.

Unlike judicial subpoenas, which are authorized by a judge after seeing enough evidence of a crime to authorize a search or seizure of someone's things, administrative subpoenas are issued by federal agencies, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals from tech and phone companies without a judge's oversight.

While administrative subpoenas cannot be used to obtain the contents of a person's emails, online searches, or location data, they can demand information specifically about the user, such as what time a user logs in, from where, using which devices, and revealing the email addresses and other identifiable information about who opened an online account. But because administrative subpoenas are not backed by a judge's authority or a court's order, it's largely up to a company whether to give over any data to the requesting government agency.

Administrative subpoenas are not new; the use of these self-signed demands by Trump officials to seek identifiable information about people who are critical of the president's policies has raised alarm.

Bloomberg reported last week that Homeland Security sought the identity of an anonymous Instagram account called @montocowatch, which says its goal is to share resources to help protect immigrant rights and due process across Montgomery County in Pennsylvania. This comes amid an ongoing federal immigration crackdown across the United States, which has drawn widespread protests and condemnation. Homeland Security lawyers sent an administrative subpoena to Meta demanding it turn over personal information of the person who runs the account, citing a non-Homeland Security employee who claimed to receive a tip that ICE agents were being stalked.

The American Civil Liberties Union, representing the account owner, said there was no evidence of wrongdoing and that recording police, sharing that recording, and doing so anonymously is legal and protected under the First Amendment. Homeland Security withdrew its subpoena without providing an explanation.

The ACLU called the subpoena “part of a broader strategy to intimidate people who document immigration activity or criticize government actions.”

Bloomberg reported the effort to unmask the @montcowatch account was not an isolated incident, referencing at least four other cases where Homeland Security officials used administrative subpoenas in efforts to identify the people running Instagram accounts publishing content critical of the government. Those subpoenas were also withdrawn after the account owners sued to block the attempt.

Tech companies have in recent years published transparency reports that detail how many government demands for data they receive. But most do not break out how many judicial and administrative subpoenas they receive over a period of time, even though the two kinds of demands are fundamentally different.

When asked by TechCrunch, Meta spokesperson Francis Brennan did not say if Meta provided Homeland Security any data involving @montcowatch or if the company was asked to provide information about the account another way. 

A new report by The Washington Post on Tuesday found that an administrative subpoena was also used to seek information from Google about an American retiree within hours of him after sending a critical email to Homeland Security's lead attorney Joseph Dernbach. The retiree's home was later visited by federal agents inquiring about the email.

The Post described the retiree as someone critical of Trump during his first term, who attended a No Kings rally last year, regularly attends gatherings and protests, and wrote criticisms to lawmakers, all actions protected under the First Amendment. 

Within five hours of emailing the Homeland Security lawyer — who was named in an article about the case of an Afghan the U.S. was trying to deport and whose email address is listed on the Florida Bar's website — the retiree received an email from Google, according to The Washington Post. The email notified him that his account had been subpoenaed by the Department of Homeland Security.

The subpoena demanded to know the day, time, and duration of all his online sessions, his IP address and physical address, and a list of each service he used, and any other usernames and identifiable information relating to his account, such as his credit card, driver's license, and Social Security numbers.

Two weeks later, Homeland Security agents were on his doorstep, asking him questions about the email that he sent to Dernbach, which the agents conceded broke no laws.

Google spokesperson Katelin Jabbari told TechCrunch the company pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, “as we did in this instance,” referring to the subpoena referenced in The Washington Post's reporting. 

When asked by TechCrunch, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin would not say why the U.S. was seeking information about people who have been critical of the Trump administration and accounts documenting ICE activity, or say for what reason the subpoenas were withdrawn.

“HSI has broad administrative subpoena authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(d) and 19 U.S.C. § 1509(a)(1) to issue subpoenas,” said McLaughlin, referring to Homeland Security Investigations, an investigative unit within ICE.

Not all companies are able to hand over data about their customers. For instance, information that is end-to-end encrypted and can only be accessed by obtaining a person's phone or devices. That said, many companies are still able to provide large amounts of information about their users, including where they log in, how they log in, and from where, which may allow investigators to unmask anonymous accounts.

End-to-end encrypted messaging apps, like Signal, have long championed how little data it collects about its users. The messaging app responds to occasional legal demands by stating that it is unable to produce user data that it does not have to begin with.

The reliance on U.S. tech giants is another reason why European countries and ordinary consumers are seeking to rely less on American tech giants, at a time when chief executives and senior leaders at some of the largest U.S. tech companies are overtly cozying up to the Trump administration.

Apple is bringing agentic coding to Xcode. On Tuesday, the company announced the release of Xcode 26.3, which will allow developers to use agentic tools, including Anthropic's Claude Agent and OpenAI's Codex, directly in Apple's official app development suite.

The Xcode 26.3 Release Candidate is available to all Apple Developers today from the developer website and will hit the App Store a bit later. 

This latest update comes on the heels of the Xcode 26 release last year, which introduced support for ChatGPT and Claude within Apple's integrated development environment (IDE) used by those building apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple's other hardware platforms.

The integration of agentic coding tools allows AI models to tap into more of Xcode's features to perform their tasks and perform more complex automation.

The models will also have access to Apple's current developer documentation to ensure they use the latest APIs and follow the best practices as they build. 

At launch, the agents can help developers explore their project, understand its structure and metadata, then build the project and run tests to see if there are any errors and fix them, if so. 

To prepare for this launch, Apple said it worked closely with both Anthropic and OpenAI to design the new experience. Specifically, the company said it did a lot of work to optimize token usage and tool calling, so the agents would run efficiently in Xcode. 

Xcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.

Developers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode's settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-Codex vs. GPT-5.1 mini).

In a prompt box on the left side of the screen, developers can tell the agent what sort of project they want to build or change to the code they want to make using natural language commands. For instance, they could direct Xcode to add a feature to their app that uses one of Apple's provided frameworks, and how it should appear and function.  

As the agent starts working, it breaks down tasks into smaller steps, so it's easy to see what's happening and how the code is changing. It will also look for the documentation it needs before it begins coding. The changes are highlighted visually within the code, and the project transcript on the side of the screen allows developers to learn what's happening under the hood. 

This transparency could particularly help new developers who are learning to code, Apple believes. To that end, the company is hosting a “code-along” workshop on Thursday on its developer site, where users can watch and learn how to use agentic coding tools as they code along in real time with their own copy of Xcode.

At the end of its process, the AI agent verifies that the code it created works as expected. Armed with the results of its tests on this front, the agent can iterate further on the project if need be to fix errors or other problems. (Apple noted that asking the agent to think through its plans before writing code can sometimes help to improve the process, as it forces the agent to do some pre-planning.) 

Plus, if developers are not happy with the results, they can easily revert their code back to its original at any point in time, as Xcode creates milestones every time the agent makes a change.

Seattle-based Overland AI raised $100 million in new funding to meet demand for its autonomous ground vehicles for the U.S. military.

The investment — the largest to date for the startup spun out of the University of Washington in 2022 —  was led by 8VC. Other backers include Point72 Ventures, Ascend Venture Capital, Shasta Ventures, and Overmatch Ventures, as well as new supporters Valor Equity Partners, StepStone Group and TriplePoint Capital.

“Demand for ground autonomy has moved decisively from experimentation to operational integration,” said Stephanie Bonk, co-founder and president of Overland AI, in a news release Tuesday. “This funding allows us to scale alongside the units adopting our technology.”

Overland completed the DARPA RACER program (Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency) last November after three years testing and iterating its platform autonomy. 

The company said the funding will enable it to meet rapidly growing demand for ULTRA, its autonomous ground vehicle. Overland AI is working closely with the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, and SOCOM, including the 82nd Airborne Division, 1st Cavalry Division, 173rd Airborne Brigade, 36th Engineer Brigade, and 2nd Marine Logistics Group. 

The goal is to deliver autonomous maneuverability across complex off-road, GPS-denied environments at tactically relevant speeds, especially for dangerous “breaching missions” in ground combat operations. Autonomy can remove combat engineers from locations such as a minefield, wire, or barrier where a force is attempting to create a lane for passage. 

Last month Overland announced a partnership with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), which is testing the use of Overland's technology for wildfire response. CAL FIRE used two of Overland's self-driving 4-wheelers for resupply (food, water, battery delivery) and wildfire logistics missions at Camp Pendleton in Southern California.

Last year the startup announced a $32 million funding round and opened a 22,000 square-foot production facility in Seattle.

The company is led by Bonk and CEO Byron Boots, a robotics researcher who leads the UW's Robot Learning Laboratory and is the Amazon Professor of Machine Learning at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering.

A month after the Trump administration began its immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis, right-wing creators are turning their attention to a new target in search of fraud: California.

Over the last few weeks, right-wing creators who were instrumental in boosting the Minnesota fraud allegations that predated the administration's surge of federal immigration agents have been going after a number of California's social welfare programs, making unsubstantiated accusations of fraud—and potentially laying the groundwork for a similar federal crackdown in the nation's largest Democrat-run state. They're already getting support from some of President Donald Trump's key allies too.

Nick Shirley, the right-wing influencer whose viral YouTube video claimed to uncover a purported $100 million fraud scheme involving Somali childcare centers in Minnesota, posted to Instagram over the weekend announcing his arrival in California. “Secrets out,” Shirley wrote in an Instagram story set to Katy Perry's “California Gurls.” It's unclear what exactly Shirley plans to do, but he claims to be “investigating” Somali-run childcare centers in California as well, according to posts that circulated on X over the weekend.

Shirley is working with Amy Reichert, a private investigator and failed politician who claims to be investigating “ghost daycares” in California. In his Minnesota video, Shirley “investigated” the fraud by showing up to daycares asking to see children. He appears to be applying the same method in San Diego. Reichert posted a picture with Shirley to X on Saturday, writing “California, here we come! When @nickshirlye drops the video, it's going to be 🔥.” (Local Minnesota outlets published multiple stories covering childcare fraud years before Shirley's video came out.)

On Sunday, Benny Johnson, a pro-Trump creator and Turning Point USA contributor, published his own “documentary,” in a similar vein to what Shirley filmed in Minnesota. In it, he claimed to reveal a multimillion-dollar “homeless industrial complex” in California. Johnson teamed up with two Republican gubernatorial candidates, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and Steve Hilton, a former adviser to UK prime minister David Cameron, in the video, which they claimed was an attempt to uncover fraudulent uses of federal funding to support California's unhoused. Johnson also claimed that the state was “using these federal dollars to rig national elections.”

California governor Gavin Newsom's office rejected the claims Johnson made in an X post on Sunday, calling the video “literally the conspiracy theory meme in real life.”

Johnson's most recent video attempts to claim that California's homeless shelters are primarily filled with undocumented immigrants. His main piece of evidence is a phone call with a purported “whistleblower” whose identity was concealed. (Newsom's office responded to this claim, calling it “as real as our Free Unicorn for all undocumented people program.”)

The same week Johnson announced that he would be traveling to California to uncover “fraud,” Trump called California “more corrupt” than Minnesota in a post on Truth Social. “Fraud Investigation of California has begun,” Trump wrote. Last week, Trump named a new assistant attorney general, Colin McDonald, to focus on fraud investigations at the Justice Department.

Other large pro-Trump accounts and news outlets, like Real America's Voice, are boosting Johnson's recent video. Larry Elder, talk radio host and former presidential candidate, reposted the video on X on Tuesday, writing “Fraud in California makes that of Minnesota look like a starter kit.”

Elon Musk, who Shirley thanked for initially boosting his December Minnesota video, has also been elevating news coverage related to California fraud. “Truly insane levels of fraud!” Musk said, reposting a story from Fox News earlier this week.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator Mehmet Oz published his own documentary-style video on alleged health care fraud in California last week, featuring an Armenian neighborhood. Oz, whose parents emigrated from Turkey, likened the fraud to being run “by the Russian Armenian mafia.” Newsom's office filed a civil rights complaint against Oz shortly after the video was published for “baseless and racially charged allegations.” Last month, Oz said that CMS would withhold around $300 million in funding from California and claimed it was because the state was using the funds on “non-emergency health care for illegals.”

In January, WIRED reported that California and New York were “next,” as the Trump administration appeared ready to leverage the same playbook used in Minnesota to go after other blue states.

“POTUS loves Minnesota and the people. It's a state where he received historic Republican support, and he has long called out [Governor Tim] Walz for his incompetence and terrible leadership,” a senior White House official told WIRED last month. “The fraud is so blatant and widespread that it's a good place to start, but it's only the beginning. CA and NY next.”

Asked about ICE's role in fraud investigations last month, the senior White House officials said that “if the fraudsters are illegals, they are getting deported.”

Experience management software giant Qualtrics on Tuesday named Jason Maynard as its new CEO. Maynard previously spent a decade at Oracle, where he was executive vice president of revenue operations. 

“I've spent 30 years in enterprise software; as a founder, as an analyst on Wall Street, and as an operator helping scale great businesses,” Maynard wrote in a blog post. “I've had a front-row seat to some of the biggest shifts in our industry, and right now we're in the middle of the largest I've ever seen.”

Maynard replaces former longtime Qualtrics exec Zig Serafin, who stepped down as CEO in October. He remains vice chairman. 

Qualtrics, based in Provo, Utah, and Seattle, helps companies gather data and improve the experiences and interactions that customers, employees, and others have with their products and services. Once publicly traded, Qualtrics was acquired by Silver Lake and Canada Pension Pan Investment Board in a private equity deal in 2023. The company, which employs more than 4,500 globally, has a pending $6.75 billion deal to acquire Press Ganey Forsta.

— Jenny Lay-Flurrie is taking a new role at Microsoft, moving from chief accessibility officer to head of the company's Trusted Technology Group. Lay-Flurrie held her former role for a decade, leading the company's efforts on accessibility and disability inclusion, and has been at Microsoft since 2005.

“In every role, one principle has grounded me: – do the right thing,” she wrote on LinkedIn. “I am humbled and excited to take on this next challenge, staying true to that north star. Don't worry, I'll remain deeply engaged with my beloved #accessibility community, while learning so much more from other passionate communities I'm honoured to lead.”

Microsoft CVP Teresa Hutson previously led the Trusted Technology Group, which focuses on privacy, safety, regulatory, responsible AI use, and other related topics. 

— Former Nintex CEO Amit Mathradas started his new role as CEO of Five9, a Bay Area customer experience software company. Mathradas led Bellevue-based Nintex for three years and was previously COO at Avalara. 

— Michelle Flandreau expanded her role at Holland America Line and is now vice president of marketing and e-commerce. Flandreau joined the cruise giant last year and previously held marketing leadership roles at Expedia, Tommy Bahama, LiquidPlanner, and Guidant Financial.

— Amir Moftakhar, former CFO at Modern Hydrogen, is now CFO at AMP, a Colorado-based climate tech company. Moftakhar joined Modern Hydrogen in 2023. The Seattle-area company recently laid off most of its staff. 

— Seattle-based cleantech nonprofit VertueLab hired Kris Licciardello as partnerships and alliances lead for Washington state and named Leo Ochoa in the same role leading Oregon efforts. It also hired Jasmin Smith as its Oregon program director.

— Seattle-based edtech company Gravyty added two execs: Former TalkingPoints and Instructure exec Matt Carlson as chief sales officer and former Uptempo CFO Ashley Jones Lee as chief financial officer. Gravyty, which originally started in Boston and raised cash from K1 Investment Management, merged with Ivy.ai and Ocelot last year.

— Seattle startup Yoodli hired Alan Camperson as its new head of global customer support. Camperson was previously a director of technical support at Salesloft. Yoodli, which just raised $40 million, also hired Meg Cory as a field marketing manager and Cortney Perry as enterprise account executive.

— Alexander Rublowsky, a longtime Seattle-area marketing exec, joined the Northwest Quantum Nexus group as a business development advisor.

The Trump administration's approach to immigration has reached a level of violence that the tech industry cannot ignore. In 2026 so far, federal immigration agents have killed at least eight people, including at least two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis — Renee Good and Alex Pretti. As immigration enforcement has grown more extreme — even detaining school children seeking legal asylum — tech workers have called on their leaders to speak up.

The tech industry has always been entwined in politics. Companies like Palantir, Clearview AI, Flock, and Paragon are contracted by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and assist in the agency's crackdowns. But as President Trump took office last year, his industry connections have grown. Elon Musk ran a government agency for months, and prolific Silicon Valley investor David Sacks is leading an advisory board on technology for the president. The CEOs behind some of the largest companies in the country — like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, and Google's Sundar Pichai — had prime seats at Trump's inauguration and have remained allied with him. 

“We know our industry leaders have leverage: in October, they persuaded Trump to call off a planned ICE surge in San Francisco,” ICEout.tech, a group of tech industry workers opposing ICE, wrote in a statement on January 24, the day of ICU nurse Alex Pretti's death. “Big tech CEOs are in the White House tonight,” the statement added, referring to a screening of a documentary about Melania Trump where Cook, Amazon's Andy Jassy, and Zoom's Eric Yuan were in attendance. “Now they need to go further, and join us in demanding ICE out of all of our cities.”

Some of tech's biggest players have since spoken out, to mixed reception from their employees and the industry. Below, we are keeping an ongoing list of what tech leaders have had to say.

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, published an editorial in the San Francisco Standard on January 29, calling on Silicon Valley to stop trying to be neutral in the wake of the Minnesota killings.

“We in Silicon Valley can't bend the knee to Trump,” Hoffman wrote. “We can't shrink away and just hope the crisis will fade. We know now that hope without action is not a strategy — it's an invitation for Trump to trample whatever he can see, including our own business and security interests.” 

He said he's been encouraged to see more tech leaders speaking out, saying: “it's a good start to something America needs much more of right now.”

“Whichever candidates you may have supported in the past — or even if (like many of my friends in Silicon Valley) you don't usually do politics — you almost surely did not want this,” he wrote.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had publicly opposed Trump's policies during his first term, but has changed his tune in the new administration as his company has struck deals to develop AI infrastructure for the U.S. government, including the gargantuan $500 billion Stargate project. 

In the days following Pretti's death, Altman addressed OpenAI staff in an internal Slack message, which was reported by The New York Times.

“What's happening with ICE is going too far. There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what's happening now, and we need to get the distinction right,” he said. “President Trump is a very strong leader, and I hope he will rise to this moment and unite the country.”

Altman added, “We didn't become super woke when that was popular, we didn't start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular, and we are not going to make a lot of performative statements now about safety or politics or anything else. But we are going to continue to try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best as we can.”

In an NBC interview, anchor Tom Llamas asked Dario Amodei about his views on defense in relation to current events. The anchor pointed out that Anthropic has a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, and that it has partnered with Palantir — which has supplied technology to ICE — on projects for that agency.

First, Amodei reaffirmed that Anthropic does not have any contracts with ICE, despite its relationship with the Defense Department, and emphasized his concern about “the need to protect democracies against autocracies” like China and Russia.

“I'm a big believer in, carefully, with guardrails, arming democracies to defend against these countries,” Amodei said, adding that these values persist in the context of internal American politics. 

“We need to be really careful about making sure democracies are worth defending. We need to defend our own democratic values at home,” he said. “I believe some of the things we've seen in the last few days concern me about that.”

He also mentioned ICE's raids in Minneapolis in a post on X, where he referred to “the horror we're seeing in Minnesota.” 

Apple's CEO addressed staff in an internal memo on January 27:

“This is a time for deescalation,” Cook said. He later added, “I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.”

Like the tech industry workers behind ICEout.tech, Signal President Meredith Whittaker has been outspoken about the role tech leaders have in social justice.

“I want everyone in tech who's ever intoned about freedom, or their love of privacy, or their commitment to liberty, to join me in an unequivocal condemnation,” Whittaker wrote on X.

In another post, she said, “Masked agents of the US state are executing people in the streets and powerful leaders are openly lying to cover for them. To everyone in my industry who's ever claimed to value freedom—draw on the courage of your convictions and stand up.”

As an end-to-end-encrypted messaging app, Signal is often used by activists to organize community actions.

The leader of the online publishing platform Medium, Tony Stubblebine posted screenshots on Threads of a message he shared with staff in which he explains his reasoning for allowing employees to take part in a nationwide general strike if they so choose, though he clarified that he is “not in the business of dictating people's politics.”

“I started the week in my own head and heart over what I was seeing in Minneapolis and really struggling with the idea that those two murders were just the tip of the iceberg of wrongs,” Stubblebine wrote.

In the memo, he writes about the difficulty of navigating his role as a tech CEO during this time, saying that it feels “awkward to navigate being both on-mission and on-money.” He added that he is thinking about the company's “responsibility to make [its] stance clear, especially as many other tech orgs are donating to the Trump campaign and supporting the current administration's agenda.”

Stubblebine also pointed out that Medium's approach to its role as a web publisher reflects the greater values of the company — “for example, that we don't allow things like hateful content or racist slurs on Medium.”

Jeff Dean has spoken out about his reaction to the killings in Minnesota.

“This is absolutely shameful,” Dean wrote on X, responding to a video of federal agents shooting Alex Pretti. “Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cell phone camera. Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this.”

James Dyett posted on X about what he sees as hypocrisy in the tech industry.

“There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets,” Dyett said. “Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.”

While Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois has publicly expressed support for ICE and the Trump administration's practices, others at the firm have publicly opposed these views.

Rabois made incendiary comments on X after border patrol agents killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, prompting one founder to respond that that if he were a founder in Khosla Ventures' portfolio, he would give the money back, calling Rabois “an embarrassment.”

Ethan Choi, another partner at Khosla Ventures, responded to the post to clarify that not everyone at the firm agrees with Rabois' views. “I want to make it clear that Keith doesn't represent everyone's views here at [Khosla Ventures], at least not mine,” Choi wrote, adding: “What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don't know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person's life taken unnecessarily.”

Vinod Khosla, the firm's founder, reposted Choi's message and called the federal agents “macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration.”

“The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society,” Khosla wrote. “ICE personnel must have ice water running thru their veins to treat other human beings this way. There is politics but humanity should transcend that.”

Khosla also posted on X that he agrees with Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, that more tech executives should speak out against the Trump administration.

Fitbit founders James Park and Eric Friedman have announced the launch of a new AI startup called Luffu that aims to help families proactively monitor their health. The duo are developing an “intelligent family care system” that will start with an app experience and then expand into hardware devices. 

Two years after their exit from Google, Park and Friedman are betting on AI to help lighten the mental burden of caregiving. According to a recent report, 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4, U.S. adults are family caregivers, up 45% from 10 years ago.

Luffu uses AI in the background to gather and organize family information, learn day-to-day patterns, and flag notable changes so families can stay aligned and address potential well-being issues.

“At Fitbit, we focused on personal health—but after Fitbit, health for me became bigger than just thinking about myself,” Park said in a press release. “I was caring for my parents from across the country, trying to piece together my mom's health care across various portals and providers, with a language barrier that made it hard to get complete, timely context from her about doctor visits. I didn't want to constantly check in, and she didn't want to feel monitored. Luffu is the product we wished existed—to stay on top of our family's health, know what changed and when to step in—without hovering.”

The pair note that today's consumer health market is filled with tools for individuals, but that real life health is shared across partners, kids, parents, pets, and caregivers. Family information is scattered across devices, portals, calendars, attachments, spreadsheets, and paper documents. 

With Luffu, people will be able to track the whole family's details, including health stats, diet, medications, symptoms, lab tests, doctor visits, and more. Users can log health information using voice, text, or photos. Luffu proactively watches for changes, and surfaces insights and alerts, such as unusual vitals or changes in sleep. 

The pair told Axios that people can ask questions using plain language to ask about their family's health, such as “Is Dad's new meal plan affecting his blood pressure?” or “Did someone give the dog his medication?” 

“We designed Luffu to capture the details as life happens, keep family members updated and surface what matters at the right time—so caregiving feels more coordinated and less chaotic,” Friedman said in the press release. 

People who are interested in Luffu can join the waitlist for the limited public beta.

Although NAND memory has replaced traditional hard disk drives in the vast majority of client PCs, HDDs can still offer capacities at costs not achievable by solid-state drives today, particularly in the data center space. In a bid to retain the relevance of hard drives for years to come, Western Digital on Tuesday announced two distinct families of HDDs: one aimed at applications that require maximum performance and decent IOPS-per-TB, another designed for power-optimized applications that value limited power consumption and predictable performance.

The whole concept of Western Digital's High-Bandwidth HDD stems from reading data from the media using more than one head and transferring it to one or two hosts. The company showcases two types of High-Bandwidth HDDs at its Innovation Day: one uses more than one head for reading and writing at the same time to achieve 2X bandwidth compared to conventional HDDs, and another one features a second fully independent actuator to achieve 2X bandwidth and 2X sequential I/O performance. Over time, High-Bandwidth HDDs are projected to scale up bandwidth by eight times and I/O by four times when both approaches are combined within a single HDD.

WD's original dual-actuator High-Bandwidth HDD architecture — which is already being validated by the company's clients — allows multiple heads on multiple tracks to read and write simultaneously, thus exploiting internal parallelism to deliver 2X bandwidth of traditional 3.5-inch HDDs.

The next step for Western Digital is its Dual-Pivot High-Bandwidth HDD architecture is to add a second, fully independent actuator on a separate pivot inside the same 3.5-inch drive. Each actuator controls its own set of heads and enables two independent read/write operations at once, thus delivering up to 2X sequential I/O performance without reducing capacity. Dual-Pivot HDDs are currently in the lab and are targeted to become available in 2028. Over time, the two architectures will be combined to deliver 4X higher I/O performance compared to traditional hard drives.

In addition to offering High-Bandwidth drives for performance-demanding applications, Western Digital is also working on Power-Optimized HDDs that reduce power consumption by 20% for 'active cold' storage tier.

Western Digital positions Power-Optimized HDDs for 'active cold' storage tier for AI workloads that generate massive volumes of data — such as datasets, checkpoints, and logs — which must remain quickly accessible (which rules out tape), but cannot be stored on traditional high-capacity HDDs or SSDs due to cost concerns.

The company says that these power-optimized 3.5-inch HDDs use a 'minimal random IO' for 20% less power than conventional drives, which reduces ownership costs and makes 'active cold' storage cheaper to run. WD expects the first power-optimized HDDs to enter customer qualification in 2027.

Although High-Bandwidth and Power Optimized HDDs serve completely different purposes, they are paradoxically designed to rival the wide product category — data center-grade 3D QLC NAND-based SSDs. Such drives can offer storage density and performance that cannot be achieved by modern HDDs. However, by tailoring features and performance of hard disk drives for particular applications, Western Digital believes it can offer better value than QLC NAND-based SSDs.

Peak XV Partners, a leading venture capital firm in India and Southeast Asia, has seen a fresh round of senior departures. These follow other leadership exits over the past year as it pushes ahead with plans to deepen its focus on AI investing and expand its footprint in the U.S., while keeping India as its largest market.

The latest departures stem from an internal disagreement with senior partner Ashish Agrawal (pictured above, left) that led to a mutual decision to part ways, Managing Director Shailendra Singh told TechCrunch. He added that two other partners, Ishaan Mittal (pictured above, right) and Tejeshwi Sharma (pictured above, center), chose to leave alongside him.

Singh said Peak XV did not want to go into the specifics of the disagreement and was focused on moving forward. “Just out of privacy, and out of, like, trying to be classy about it,” he said. Singh added that such departures were not uncommon at large, multi-stage venture firms and that Peak XV wanted to move on quickly after several years of working together.

All board seats held by the departing partners would be transitioned “imminently,” Singh said, noting that the firm already had overlapping representation across several portfolio companies. He said Peak XV was not concerned about continuity, noting that multiple general partners and operating partners were already involved across many of those boards.

The departures mark the exit of long-tenured investors from the firm. Agrawal had been with Peak XV for more than 13 years, while Mittal spent over nine years at the firm and Sharma more than seven years, per their LinkedIn profiles.

Agrawal wrote in a LinkedIn post that he had decided to “take the entrepreneurial plunge” and was teaming up with Mittal and Sharma to start a new venture capital firm. He described the move as an opportunity to build a new institution with longtime partners and thanked Peak XV's leadership for what he called a “truly wonderful partnership.”

During his time at Peak XV, Agrawal led investments across fintech, consumer, and software, including Groww, one of the firm's most prominent IPO exits in 2025. He also backed multiple early- and growth-stage companies alongside Mittal and Sharma, contributing to Peak XV's broader portfolio build-out over the past decade.

Agrawal, Mittal, and Sharma did not respond to messages for comments.

Peak XV has also moved to strengthen its senior leadership from within. The firm on Tuesday promoted Abhishek Mohan to general partner, expanding its investment leadership bench, while Saipriya Sarangan was elevated to chief operating officer, taking charge of firm-wide operations.

The leadership changes come amid a standout year for Peak XV's portfolio exits. Five of its companies — Groww, Pine Labs, Meesho, Wakefit, and Capillary Technologies — went public in November and December 2025, generating roughly ₹300 billion (around $3.33 billion) in unrealized, mark-to-market gains for the firm, in addition to about ₹28 billion (about $310.61 million) in realized gains from share sales during the IPOs.

In addition to the latest departures, Peak XV has seen a broader churn in its senior ranks over the past 12 months. Last year, long-time investment leaders Harshjit Sethi and Shailesh Lakhani exited the India team, while Abheek Anand and Pieter Kemps departed from the firm's Southeast Asia operations. The firm has also seen leadership changes across its marketing, policy, and operations teams in recent months.

Singh dismissed a view circulating in the market that many of the partners who drove Peak XV's largest exits were no longer at the firm, calling the narrative “not statistically true.” He said several of the firm's most significant outcomes had been led by long-tenured partners who remained at Peak XV, and argued that the firm's exit track record did not hinge on any single individual.

Peak XV currently has seven general partners, along with multiple partners and principals, according to Singh.

The VC firm, which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023 and currently manages over $10 billion in capital across 16 funds, has made about 80 investments linked to AI, Singh said, highlighting its push to deepen its focus on AI funding. It is also preparing to open a U.S. office within the next 90 days as it expands its global footprint, per Singh, while continuing to view India as its largest and most important market.

Singh stated the firm believed AI would reshape venture investing more profoundly than previous technology shifts, arguing that successful AI investing required investors with deep technical understanding rather than “generalist” experience. He added that Peak XV was looking to add more AI-native talent, including researchers and engineers with backgrounds in machine learning and large-scale model development.

The firm has invested in more than 400 companies, and its portfolio has seen over 35 initial public offerings and several M&As to date.

With the first prototypes expected in 2027.

Intel and a SoftBank subsidiary, Saimemory, have signed a new collaborative agreement to advance the development and manufacture of a new type of vertical-stacked memory known as Z-Angle Memory, or ZAM. This next-generation memory is designed to compete against High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) used in the latest AI data centers, but offers higher capacity, greater bandwidth, and lower power consumption.

Although owned by Softbank, Saimemory was a joint development between Intel and Softbank. The two companies started building a prototype of this new memory standard in mid-2025, leveraging Intel's packaging technologies and key Japanese patents. The move brings Intel back into the memory market for the first time since the 1980s. It's also the first time a Japanese company has attempted to produce cutting-edge memory in decades. Japan was a major memory manufacturing region in the ‘80s, but the rise of Korean and Taiwanese manufacturing saw it fall out of favor.

As the world scrambles for more memory, both Softbank and Intel see a clear opportunity to provide it.

ZAM is designed to offer two to three times the capacity of HBM, operating at as little as half the power, while being up to 60% cheaper to produce, as reported by Nikkei. Saimemory will try to hit these lofty goals by vertically stacking more DRAM and using Intel's Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) to reduce latency between the individual chips.

ZAM is built on the foundational work Intel completed as part of the Advanced Memory Technology R&D program, managed by the U.S. Department of Energy and National Nuclear Security Administration through the Sandia National Laboratory. They recognized that HBM has impressive bandwidth, but trades that for lower capacity and weaker power efficiency. Using Intel's new bonding techniques and novel DRAM stacking techniques allows for all the benefits of HBM, without those traditional downsides.

“Intel's Next Generation DRAM Bonding (NGDB) initiative has demonstrated a novel memory architecture and revolutionary assembly methodology that significantly increases DRAM performance, reduces power consumption, and optimizes memory costs,” said Dr. Joshua Fryman, Intel Fellow and CTO of Intel Government Technologies. “Standard memory architectures aren't meeting AI needs, so NGDB defined a whole new approach to accelerate us through the next decade.”

In developing the NGDB for ZAM, Intel and Sandia had to design a new stacking approach and a different way of organizing the DRAM chips. Early prototypes confirmed it was possible to increase capacity through new stacking techniques, while recent developments have demonstrated that the necessary high performance is there. That's why Intel and partners are now able to move forward with developing the first real prototypes of Z-Angle memory.

Gwen Voskuilen, principal member of technical staff at Sandia, said, “This is an exciting technology that we anticipate will lead to a wider adoption of higher bandwidth memories in systems that are currently unable to take advantage of high bandwidth memory due to its limited capacity and power constraints.”

 




This venture isn't designed to suddenly bring new DDR5 or HBM production online, though. It's looking beyond what's currently available to data center builders and hoping to provide what they might need next.

Saimemory is slated to produce its first ZAM prototype sometime in 2027, with plans to develop a mass production line for the new memory by 2029.

Already, other firms are backing the project, showcasing its impact and interest beyond the initial parties to the venture. Other companies cooperating on the design, development, and manufacture of ZAM include Japanese IT hardware and services firm Fujitsu; the recent Micron acquisition, PowerChip Semiconductor Manufacturing; Shinko Electric Industries; and the University of Tokyo.

The various Japanese institutions involved highlight the importance of this venture to Softbank. In its release, it said, “SAIMEMORY's development of next-generation memory technologies represents one of SoftBank's key initiatives to support next-generation social infrastructure.”

“By collaborating with Intel and other technology partners and research institutions in Japan and abroad, SoftBank will contribute to the creation of advanced, homegrown semiconductor technologies, and to the strengthening of Japan's global competitiveness.”

Alongside potentially rebuilding Japan as a key player in the memory industry, Softbank appears to see key technologies like next-generation memory as a core component of building aspects of the future that go beyond the raw hardware itself.

In the same way that access to memory, silicon, and rare earth materials are increasingly considered an important asset for strategic defence, there's an argument to be made that they're also keystones in developing the components for social change in the decades to come, and the partnerships that will enable it.

Intel and Softbank want to be a part of powering that.

Nintendo is obsessed with this talking flower. The sousaphone-faced flora first came on the scene in 2023 with Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and since then it's infiltrated other Mario family titles like Super Mario Party Jamboree. It's set to referee (and repeatedly antagonize) players in the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever as well. Now, the $35 Wonder Flower is trying to grow space for itself in the living room and perturb you with random rejoinders at various intervals.

There's not much to talk about with the Wonder Flower. It has a speaker and a lot to say. You push the button, and it will tell you a line. “We kind of look alike, huh?” “Did you know the planet is spinning?” It rapped at me with repeated button presses, though the device is built to speak up when you least expect it to. I pressed the button several times, and I did hear a few repeats. It's unclear how many voice lines are actually contained within this little toy.

You can tell the Wonder Flower to shut up and only talk when you push the button. Yes, I couldn't stop pressing it because, as irritating as the flower toy can be, its form of annoying is the kind I find endearing—probably because I do the same thing to my closest friends. The toy should know the weather and time of day, although it was very adamant that it's “perfect weather for a nap, huh?” If I had to choose between the Wonder Flower and Alarmo, the latter would be more useful as an actual alarm clock. But some things aren't made to be useful. Some things are just fun.

There may be a side of me that has bought into the whimsy presented by Nintendo. I can talk to the moon and back about the Switch 2 hardware, its successes and foibles, but the games are always a surprise when I'm just trying to do my job. The top of the year 2026 will prove an inevitably awkward time for Nintendo. The company is dealing with Japanese investors breathing down its neck over the ongoing storage shortage. RAM is getting more expensive, which could force Nintendo to raise console prices. It would be a poor time to do it, too. The company doesn't have any specific tentpole game that will prove a real system mover for the next few months.

Instead, we have games like Mario Tennis Fever ($70) and Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park ($60 or $20 for the upgrade pack). Yes, that's the full title. I played both for about 30 minutes, running through various multiplayer sessions. Mario Tennis Fever is an immediate and rambunctious sports game that reminds me most of the hardcore back-and-forth of the original Mario Tennis for the Nintendo 64.

It's a game about positioning, both your character for returns and the ball. Even characters as large and in charge as Wario, Boo, or Bowser are quick to dive after a speedy serve with just a tap of the “A” button. There are multiple kinds of hits you can perform, from a regular attack to a power shot. The top attack is a “Fever” stroke that will introduce an effect on the court, depending on your racket. A Thwomp racket will lay a floating, angry block on the other player's court, ready to smash them. A Pokey racket will do the same with the cactus-like critter, who will spill into various hazards once struck with a ball. There is counterplay to these shots, too. When you strike the Fever shot before it hits the ground, you can set the same hazard on your opponent's side of the court.

Nintendo went with the Mario Kart World playbook when deciding characters, as the roster is particularly enormous. The number of rackets on offer is also incredible. Nintendo places such a premium on local multiplayer that playing the game 2v2 was a blast that reminded me of ye olden days huddling around the CRT TV and smacking the buttons on my N64 controller. Mario Tennis Fever will also bear the release of new light purple and light green Joy-Con 2 controllers. Unfortunately, these will be mere color accents on the black cover, like the light red and light blue that ship with the Switch 2. You'll have to look to third-party companies like Dbrand for color-matched skins.

Meetup in Bellabel Park takes a similar tack with its obsession for local multiplayer, even at the expense of online play. Bellabel Park is full of various minigames, playable in both co-op and versus modes. These can range from players racing each other on floating pinwheels to a team mode where players have to create the blocks for other players to platform on. On the other hand, Nintendo's online-specific modes have far less player interaction. Characters are ghosts that can see each other move but rarely interact with them. Nintendo told me the online modes are not available for local play, and vice versa.

The upgrade doesn't make Super Mario Bros. Wonder any worse of a game. If you have friends who long to play on the couch, it's an excellent option for an evening of controller-throwing thrills. There are other titles arriving early this year, including Resident Evil: Requiem and Pragmata, which I also got to try for the first time on Nintendo's handheld console. These games certainly sported subdued graphics capabilities compared to what devs have shown running on PS5 and PC. There were missing reflections in the mirrors in my Requiem demo and a little bit of shimmering around characters' hair. But that was the worst of it. Both games ran perfectly fine at their 1080p resolutions in handheld mode as well.

The Switch 2 keeps proving that as long as developers optimize their games properly, Nintendo's handheld is capable of playing demanding titles. What that may mean for the Switch 2's future is another question entirely. Mario Tennis Fever is out Feb. 12, while the Bellabel Park expansion will arrive Mar. 26. I only wonder how many more games Nintendo can stuff the Wonder Flower into before we see it in our dreams.

RAM prices could be leveling off

Prices of RAM, SSD storage, and even graphics cards have all been affected by the recent surge in demand for AI data centers. Some manufacturers, like Crucial, have chosen to drop their consumer products altogether to capitalise on profit margins from the AI build-out, unfortunately leaving PC enthusiasts with even less choice and competition in the market.

The RAM-pocalypse is still here, with inflated prices looking to stay for the meantime, but they do seem to have leveled off a little in recent weeks. If you're looking for speedy DDR5-6000 RAM with decent timings, then this is a bit of a public service announcement, as B&H Photo is offering the cheapest 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5-6000 RAM kit available. Crucial's Pro Overclocking 32GB RAM kit is $325.99 currently, a whopping $74 cheaper than the same kit on sale at Newegg. Available while stocks last at this price.

Checking PC Partpicker, we can see that this is the cheapest set of 32GB DDR5-6000 memory available, and significantly cheaper at B&H Photo than at other retailers. DDR5-6000 RAM is often cited as the sweet spot for memory speed when dealing with AM5 CPUs, and this is true, but it's less important when dealing with an X3D processor, as the large L3 cache negates a lot of the importance of the RAM's speed.

This 32GB DDR5-6000 RAM kit consists of 2x16GB sticks that have a 6000MHz speed, and timings of 36-38-38-80, with a CAS latency of 36. 

Crucial's Pro Overclocking RAM kit consists of 2x16GB sticks for 32GB of memory. This is a DDR5-6000 kit with a 6000MT/s speed and timings of 36-38-38-80 and a CAS latency of 36. With a minimal silhouette, they don't have RGB and aren't the flashiest set of RAM, but they are available in either black or white color schemes, although the white kit costs more. The Crucial Pro Overclocking kit is AMD EXPO and Intel XMP ready.

The latest Steam Hardware Survey is out, and an AMD RDNA4 architecture GPU has charted in the PC Video Card Usage tables. Despite AMD's fanfared deprioritization of flagship GPUs to follow the mass market, the Radeon RX 9000 family's entry into the chart has been a long time coming. Moreover, the RDNA4 Radeon has appeared with more of a whimper than a bang, turning up with just a 0.16% market share, still less than Nvidia's 2014 GeForce GT 730.

 




Your eyes don't deceive – AMD's only Steam Hardware Survey (SHWS) charted card is the RX 9070 non-XT. Does this show that AMD's cheaper, slightly lower-tier model may be a sleeper hit for its amazing efficiency? I have a plain vanilla RX 9070 in my personal desktop, and am very pleased with its quiet, cool performance, so praise of this SKU might show a little bias.

Interestingly, though, AMD's RX 9070 XT did indeed hit the SHWS in the December 2025 data, at 0.22%. It has now disappeared from view (under the 0.15% threshold for charting).

It has been approaching a year since the first RX 9000 graphics cards became available. We reviewed the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 back in early March 2025. These 16GB VRAM cards were praised for strong mainstream performance at good MSRPs, with worthwhile improvements in AI and ray tracing performance. AMD released its RX 9060 XT (8 and 16GB VRAM) models in June last year, and also saw largely positive feedback (for the 16GB version, anyway).

It is worth repeating that, despite AMD's mass market strategy and general positivity in reviews and on discussion forums, people are still buying into the GeForce ecosystem by default.

 




While we are kind of celebrating the first RDNA4 card charting in the Steam usage database with its 0.16% placing, the last-gen RTX 4060 gained 0.46% share. Moreover, the biggest gainer of the month was, predictably, the RTX 5060 with an increase of 0.72% in market share. If we sort the chart by gains in the last month, the RX 9070 rises from near the bottom of the chart to 6th place. Which isn't so bad.

Another change that seems remarkable in the last month is the observed increase in Steam gamers backing GPUs with 16GB of VRAM. As per the numbers shown, those gaming on 16GB GPUs went up an impressive 5.85% in January 2026. Meanwhile, 12GB VRAM became 4.01% less prevalent, and 8GB VRAM, 3.11% less common.

So, 16GB of VRAM looks set to move into second place in the graphics card memory charts, as early as February's results. Unless there is another inflection or bump in the trends...

Last but not least, please remember that the SHWS figures aren't definitive, as the disappearance of the RX 9070 XT shows. They are just an indicator of trends among active Steam gamers, snapshotted that month. Sometimes big events in the Steam marketplace, like a country being added to the survey, can nudge the results more than usual, and the way the charts are compiled is quite opaque. Other factors, like seasonality and big game releases, can also impact the data.

The automotive industry has struggled to adopt hydrogen at scale, but industrial users and data centers might have better luck.

Vema Hydrogen inked a deal in December to supply California data centers, and now it has completed a pilot project in Quebec to power industry with hydrogen that it produces deep underground.

The startup drills wells in regions with specific types of iron-rich rock that release hydrogen gas when treated with water, heat, pressure, and some catalysts. Vema then draws the hydrogen to the surface and sells it to industrial users.

“To supply the Quebec local market, which is about 100,000 tons per year, you would need 3 square kilometers, which is nothing,” Pierre Levin, CEO of Vema, told TechCrunch.

Vema's first pilot well will produce several tons of hydrogen per day, and next year, it plans to drill its first commercial well, which will reach 800 meters into the earth. Vema expects to produce hydrogen from the first wells for less than $1 per kilogram, a widely used benchmark for clean hydrogen. 

Most hydrogen today is made by a process known as steam reforming of methane (SMR), in which steam is used to break hydrogen molecules off methane from natural gas. It's energy intensive, and both the process to make steam and the chemical reaction itself release carbon dioxide.

Less polluting sources of hydrogen exist, but they tend to cost more. Hydrogen from SMR costs between 70 cents and $1.60 per kilogram, according to the IEA. Capturing carbon from SMR can add around 50% to those prices, while the cleanest process, which uses zero carbon electricity to power an electrolyzer, drives costs up several fold.

Stimulated geologic hydrogen, or “engineered mineral hydrogen,” as Vema calls it, promises to be one of the cleanest sources of hydrogen, according to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. 

Once Vema has refined its techniques, Levin expects it to produce hydrogen for less than 50 cents per kilogram. At that price, Vema's hydrogen would be cheaper than any other source on the market.

Because the rocks that Vema is targeting are widely distributed, Levin said the company will drill wells close to companies that need power, including data centers. California, for example, has some of the largest formations of ophiolite, an iron-rich type of rock that was pushed up from the ocean bottom by plate tectonics. 

If Vema can deliver hydrogen at the price it's forecasting, then a quirk of geology could turn California into a mecca for data centers. “You have a ton of data centers who are trying to get some baseline, decarbonized electricity,” Levin said. “We have very strong traction with them.”

Sorry, Good Omens fans, but this isn't the Neil Gaiman-adjacent news you were waiting for. While devotees of the Prime Video series wait and wait for an update on that “finale special” that replaced season three, the series' controversial co-creator has emerged for a fresh denial of the sexual misconduct allegations against him.

In addition to forcing Good Omens to recalibrate its final season, those allegations also led to what sure felt like the cancellation of Netflix's The Sandman, depending on who you ask, among other suspended projects.

Variety calls attention to a new statement from the author, which is very defensive but also couches a sly reveal of a new book he calls “the biggest thing I've done since American Gods.” Presumably he's had a lot of time for writing since he hasn't been in the TV sphere for a few years now.

Going by this newest communication, he hasn't wavered one bit on maintaining his innocence, despite the accusations made by a former babysitter and other women, investigated in a New York Magazine Vulture article as well as a seven-episode Tortoise Media podcast series. Prior to Monday, his most recent address on the subject came on January 14, 2025, in a blog post entitled “Breaking the Silence.”

The February 2 Gaiman statement is titled “Thank You,” and you can read the whole piece on his online journal.

“It's been a while since I've posted anything anywhere, but I didn't want to let any more time go by without thanking everyone for all your kind messages of support over the last year and a half,” it begins. “I've learned firsthand how effective a smear campaign can be, so to be clear: The allegations against me are completely and simply untrue. There are emails, text messages and video evidence that flatly contradict them. These allegations, especially the really salacious ones, have been spread and amplified by people who seemed a lot more interested in outrage and getting clicks on headlines rather than whether things had actually happened or not. (They didn't.)”

He goes on to write that he thought “the truth would, eventually, come out,” citing a pro-Gaiman Substack author who has defended him. Then comes the book news:

“It's been a strange, turbulent and occasionally nightmarish year and a half, but I took my own advice (when things get tough, make good art) and once I was done with making television I went back to doing something else I love even more: writing. I thought it was going to be a fairly short project when I began it, but it's looking like it's going to be the biggest thing I've done since American Gods.”

Whether or not folks will embrace a new novel from Gaiman remains to be seen. For now, most everything he was involved with in the adaptation sphere has either ended or been cancelled. That includes the Netflix series The Sandman and Dead Boy Detectives, Disney's The Graveyard Book, the stage play Coraline – The Musical, and Gaiman's work with Dark Horse Comics. There are also two in-flux projects: the previously mentioned Good Omens send-off and a Prime Video series based on Anansi Boys.

Jonathan Nolan saw this coming. As a screenwriter, he's worked on several of his brother Christopher Nolan's films, from Interstellar to the Dark Knight movies. Partnered with his wife Lisa Joy, he created HBO's Westworld and executive produced Amazon Prime's Fallout. But before that, he cut his TV teeth creating Person of Interest, a CBS procedural about a solitary tech billionaire who creates a piece of surveillance software aimed at stopping crime before it happens. It was fiction, but it's hard not to feel its prescience.

With Fallout, now in its second season, Nolan also has his sights on the future. Based on the video game series of the same name, it's about a postapocalyptic America where everyone must survive in any way they can. It's also wickedly funny and full of 1950s-era retrofuturism.

So, what does Nolan see happening in the coming decades? A lot. For one, he doesn't think AI is going to replace human filmmakers. In fact, he thinks it could help aspiring directors get a foot in the door. (Though, he says, he will never use it in his own writing.) He'd also like to see the demise of (most) social media—but understands that may never happen.

For this week's episode of The Big Interview podcast, I asked Nolan about all of those things and more. Below you'll find his thoughts on writing Batman movies, classic cars, and what he'd actually bring to his own doomsday bunker.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

KATIE DRUMMOND: Jonathan Nolan, welcome to The Big Interview.

JONATHAN NOLAN: Thank you for having me.

I'm delighted to have you here in person in New York. It's very cold. I'm from Canada so my barometer is a little off, but …

I'm from Chicago. I tend to think of New York as wimpy cold.

No, no, this is real. The older I get the weaker and more frail. So I can't tolerate [it].

I've been in LA for 25 years. Completely useless.

So we're both totally useless. It's going to be a great conversation. We always like to start these discussions with a little warmup. Actually, this might help today of all days. But this is just a warmup for your brain, some very fast questions. Are you ready?

The reason I became a writer is because I was no good at answering fast questions. So I'm going to flub this.

Oh good. This will be the whole hour.

That's it.

What is the most overused sci-fi trope?

Ooh! Faster-than-light travel.

Why?

Because it's a sort of story convenience, and I guess we used it in Interstellar, but we use it in a slightly backhanded way, which is a wormhole. Which doesn't quite feel the same, but effectively it's the same thing. It's just a way to skip the boring bits.

What's a book you go back to over and over?

Of late, I go back to all of the Iain Banks Culture books. Years ago, I was looking for positive portrayals of AI in science fiction.

Oh, interesting. We're going to talk about this.

It was almost nothing, really nothing. It's kind of James Cameron on one side, and no one on the other side of the roster and Iain Banks, who wrote those books over the course of 20 years, starting in the late '80s, I think, until his death in the early 2010s. Far too young. But they are the most fully realized and brilliant depiction of a hybrid civilization where you've got people and you've got AI and they have sort of figured it out.

What is the weirdest app on your phone right now?

The one that has captured the most of my attention—and it's disastrous—is an app called Bring a Trailer.

What is that?

It's for buying classic cars. I'm from Chicago. I emigrated to the States when I was 11. When I got my driver's license, I became an American. I've never gone back. Always loved cars.

You're a car guy. This did not come up in my research. So you're using an app to look at cars to potentially acquire.

Classic old cars, those sorts of things. You know, I love electric cars. I've driven electric cars for years. They're fantastic. But it's very clear we're in this moment, like, I miss the Cretaceous cell phone age, when you had like a million different shapes. You had the ones that flipped and rolled and did all that stuff. Then the iPhone came along and then it's just this banal, incredibly functional [object]. You know, there is no diversity of shape or function. That's what's happening in cars. Like vanishingly quick. Like Trump is trying to hold on and, I mean, you look at China and the barn door's wide open.

So you're looking for the eclectic, the diverse …

… older, internal combustion cars with manual transmissions.

Wow. OK. Well, that is a weird app. What's harder to write—a perfect ending or a perfect pilot?

Perfect pilot. Perfect endings are more important. You ascribe value to them because if you don't have an ending, you don't have anything. But in truth, a beginning without an ending is like a joke without a punch line. I walked into JJ Abrams' office one day, and we talked about movies for a while and I walked out as a showrunner, kind of. I liken the experience to getting my tie caught in a shredder. It was sort of like, “Oh, I'll do a little bit of this …” Then, 15 or 16 years later, here I am. But writing pilots was a maddening experience. As a film writer, you look at all this cool stuff you have and you'll probably have to cut a few things out. With TV it's like I have a hundred cool things and I'm going to show you four, and I have to pick the most strategically sound combination of those things. There's no closure. It's very difficult.

If you had to be trapped in one digital simulation, which would you choose?

Oh, wow.

We like to have fun with these.

You know, and we're both parents, but being able to access, honestly, these years right now, where your kids are still so close and they're relying on you for everything. But they're filled with fascinating insights and it's just, you know, that level of closeness and intimacy and it's just incredible. My brother's kids are older. I see how this goes. It's wonderful. It's wonderful the whole way through. But you never quite get this moment again.

Well, don't make me cry. So you would want to live in a digital simulation of your reality with relatively young kids, who still love and adore you and think you're the best thing.

Well, let's not get carried away. I'm not sure if they love and adore me, but they tolerate me.

You want to live in a digital simulation where your kids still tolerate you.

Yes. I'll take it.

That hits. I would, too. I would love to live in that world forever.

Yeah. Ugh. For sure.

Google Search or ChatGPT?

Google Search for sure.

Agree. Now, you wrote the short story that became the film Memento. Do you have any tattoos and what are they?

My sister-in-law, Emma, and I, who produced that film, were talking during the production about getting tattoos. Then we chickened out.

No, come on.

If you don't get one when you're making that movie, you're never getting a tattoo, so …

Never.

I am a blank slate, as they say.

What is the most Luddite part of your creative workflow?

I wouldn't categorize it as Luddite, but we're still shooting everything on film. I mean, we can come back to this later, because it relates to the AI of it all, but the promise of digital cameras was that they would save enormous amounts of money. My contention is, and this relates to AI as well, there is no technology that I've ever been presented with, and I've been doing this for 25 years, that has made anything that we do for television cheaper, ever. If you plot the economics of film or television over the last 50 years, I would challenge anyone to point to the inflection point where digital cameras came in and democratized it. Because they never did. So we shoot it on film because it costs the same, and it looks better.

Lastly, what is one must-have for your doomsday bunker?

Nintendo Switch.

And some games, I assume.

Yeah, for sure.

Do you have a doomsday bunker?

If you have a doomsday bunker, I think it's like Fight Club: The first rule is you don't tell people you have a doomsday bunker. There's no bunker.

Not yet.

I'm a techno optimist.

Let me ask you: When I was getting ready to meet you, I was looking back at your career and looking at Person of Interest. Reading about that really took me back. Interstellar. Fallout. There aren't many people, I would say, in film and TV who have so consistently approached tech and science and AI with the consistency and the breadth that you have. You have stuck with these themes. What keeps you coming back to those subjects?

That's a very flattering way of saying that I get a little stuck.

Come on. It's a big field.

I wrote a film for my brother and David Hayman at Warner Bros. that never got made, that had enough overlap with Inception and then with Person of Interest. We never quite circled back to it. But it was about AI, it was about AI as a bad guy.

And is this sort of early 2000s?

2005. And it didn't go, but I got fascinated by the subject. I did a lot of research; I did a lot of looking into it. The next hit for me was the robot characters in Interstellar. I went from one project to the next and I was like, “Wouldn't it be fun to write robots?” You know, the tension of the robot crew member, whether it's Alien or pretty much any version of this, is that they will eventually mutiny and murder everyone, and they have a secret agenda.

But what if they didn't? What if they were just all of the virtues that we found the most beautiful, right? What if they were brave, self-sacrificing, sarcastic, and funny. Amazing leaders. What if they just embodied those values the whole way through? Maybe you'd give the audience a slight discomfort at first. Then this kind of interesting feeling of, “Oh, OK, that's one path.” Right? It's not written that the path has to be this sort of human form of xenophobia.

I'd also gotten fascinated with this idea of what happens when you have this fire hose of data that's out there. What if something could pick through it and find patterns and find meaning.

That proved to be very prescient, I must say.

Actually, sorry, I missed a piece there. In The Dark Knight, there is a plot twist about mass surveillance. Bruce Wayne builds this ethically-challenged system of stealing information, doing echo location from everyone's cell phone and giving him the ability to map the city all at once. That was sort of wrestling with this idea of how much do we trust the people protecting us, with the government surveilling us, and what good could they put that to? So the idea of mass surveillance being organized into and filtered into something that could help people is something I've been fascinated with, and that is an origin point for AI, a natural one.

When we were trying to put together Westworld, which is obviously where we got closest to this subject, Anthony Hopkins was interested. Then, as always happens, the studio and the agents kind of battled back and forth for a little bit too long and we started to get a sense that we were going to lose Tony on this one. So I wrote him a letter. The letter had a line, it was a thought that had occurred to me walking home one night, and it went like this: “We lived before, before.” What is a little harder to define, but you can feel it, you can feel this bump in the road, this inflection point. It's a really big one, and you feel it coming very quickly. You can't quite picture a big wave like Interstellar. You don't know what's on the far side of it, but you know it's coming. For me, that has been about this moment that we're now standing in the middle of.

So, we started writing these films and watching what was happening in the series. And this is the story of our time. So the question for me would be like, “Why would you write about anything else, really?”

When you think about writing that letter and of feeling like you were on the precipice of something that I think a lot of people had no idea they were on the precipice of, how do you feel standing in the middle of it, having been someone who years ago was pointing at it? What is that experience like for you?

There's no trace of “I told you so,” because I didn't know what to say, and I still don't know. I think we're in the middle of that wave, but a lot of what's happening right now with salesmanship … a lot of what's happening right now is hype. We're dealing with that in our business. We were very scared, in film and television, about what was right around the corner. A lot of that was hype. We're two years into it, now we're up against the next contract negotiation and it's like, OK, well, how much fruit has that borne? How much does that really change what we do?

I think when we actually sit down to use these tools and think about what these tools do, I'm almost completely riven between two totally opposing worldviews.

One, that these tools are really just sort of a glorified browser search function with the right economic activity and brilliance being applied to them. I never imagined that consciousness. I don't believe that there's something specific or privileged about human consciousness. This is something, you know, we spent a lot of time thinking about for Westworld.

The flip side of that belief is that something as simple as an LLM could give rise to cognition on a level that becomes increasingly hard to distinguish from human cognition. At which point we are certainly in the middle of the thing that I was seeing. Because there've been so many false starts with AI over a hundred years. These moments where it's like, “here it comes,” and everyone kind of braces for it, and we have a lot of conversations like this, and then a couple of years later it peters out a little bit.

Right around when I started my job here at WIRED, so like two-and-a-half years ago, it was all of a sudden the only thing anyone could talk about. Of course a lot of that was genuinely fascinating advances in this research and in these tools. Then, to your point, it was marketing and hype and hyperbole. And commercialization. There's a need for some of these companies to show a return on their investment. It's really hard to make sense of it. How do you educate yourself when this is all moving so quickly?

It's tough. One of the ways, and it wasn't anything we set out to do, but because of the success of Westworld—HBO at the time was positioning itself as a tech company to try to get sold and compete with Netflix—so the first time we showed that pilot to any large group of people was an event that [former HBO CEO] Richard Plepler arranged with [investor] Yuri Milner at his enormous house in Mountain View. We showed the pilot and then did a Q&A afterwards. Sam Altman was the MC. He had all his Y Combinator folks there watching.

So from the beginning we were picked up and tossed into that group of people; over the course of making that show we wound up becoming quite close with some of the people leading the charge here. So I was hearing stories 15 years ago about what was happening at DeepMind before Google acquired it. There's sort of a criteria for when to terminate an experiment, and that went straight into Westworld. And weirdly, [we] unintentionally had a front-row seat to a lot of what has transpired in the last 10 to 15 years. So staying close to it and listening to it.

But even now, the pace, the pitch, the tenor of things is moving so quickly. We're in such a frothy moment. Which I immediately distrust …

Yeah, I don't love froth.

It usually means a bubble burst or a sleight of hand rather than [something] genuine. We're still invited to these conversations, these closed-door conversations with people who are leading the charge here.

So you are still very close to that industry. You're getting a front-row seat.

Yeah. Yeah.

Must be very interesting.

It is fascinating.

I know these are closed-door meetings. I assume they're off the record. But has anything come out of them, even a notion or something that nudged you in a certain direction or changed the way you were thinking about the technology?

A hundred percent.

I think an observation that I started, and then was bounced back and forth with a friend who's leading one of the leading companies, was we'd spent a day working with this team talking about what you can do with these things. You know, where's it all going? What are the applications for it? Because I think that is one of the bigger questions.

I think for the first time in a very long time, there may be moments like in the middle of the Second World War with so many technologies just kind of pouring out of the war effort. You know, the amount of brilliance over 40 years to get to this place, you don't want overnight success, right? The actor, singer, who finally gets the Oscar, Grammy, whatever, has been doing this for 20 years. These neural nets have been around for a very, very long time. Not an overnight success, but pretty much to your point, two-and-a half years ago, suddenly went from an obscure talking point for computer scientists to an everyday fact for all of our kids. Everyone. All over the place.

It occurred to me that unlike some of these technologies over the years, the applications for which were slightly more clear, this is more like an alien spaceship crash-landed on the face of the planet. Each of these companies and all of us are exploring the ruins of it. We kind of walk into one room and we're like, “Oh shit, I can do teleportation.” Go to another room and it's like, “OK, I can make movies.” It's less like we're making these things and more like we're sort of stumbling upon them, because we've created something so powerful and so recursive that it can spew out, almost weekly or monthly, these wonders.

I remember the first time I saw videos from Veo, the first launch where you kinda looked at it and you went, “Oh boy.” Because this is what I do for a living. And we spend an awful lot of money to build shots, with effects that look good.

I have a lot of friends in the gaming space, I know how much money they're spending to do stuff. Then you've got a product that's like, oh, it's a $10 subscription and you can make this, this, this, the other thing. You know, it is this extraordinary moment where instead of thinking of an application and then chasing it down over the course years using a handful of advanced degrees, it's more like, here is this giant morass and, and you're going to dig around in it and you're going to pull out something from here and something from there.

Beyond the hype, these technologies are genuinely transformative. There's no question about it. They're going to transform education and medicine, all the usual things that everyone talks about. They're going to transform culture. We haven't reckoned with the social consequences. Forget putting the genie back in the bottle. How do we convince the genie not to destroy whole segments of the economy?

Who can tell the genie what to do and what not to do? I'm sure that's top of mind in the context of your industry, but even more broadly than that. You're a parent. You're thinking about what this means for your kids in 20 years.

Or next year.

Exactly.

It's scary, it's exciting. Certainly some of these products give you lots of good reasons to be cynical, but I've had a couple of conversations with people who were at the forefront of these things who really have a very clear and very compelling humanist perspective on this.

They think about kids who are disadvantaged, who don't have access to the kinds of things that our kids may have access to. We saw this in a pandemic, right? We were able to take our kids and make a little school in the back of our house and hire a teacher. We just re-created what we could do.

The idea that these tools could be, say, a tutor that never forgets a question they've asked you. That, while you're sleeping, researches scholarships. That might be a perfect way to get these things, especially for kids who don't have those advantages. It might really be leveling the playing field. These tools are largely free. So the paradox of this thing is you say, “Who has the keys to these things?” You know, I'm very—I am very concerned about that.

One of the interesting comments that you made about AI, this was in an interview in Semafor last year, was about how you use it. They asked if you used AI to write and you said, “Oh god, no. That's crossing the Rubicon.”

Yeah.

Do you see uses for it? Do you draw a hard line in the sand and just say “absolutely not.” Where do you see AI in terms of art and creativity?

I guess there's one way to take that quote, which is that it is sort of a political thing. It's not at all; it's more superstitious, right? There are writers who love to write. There are writers who suffer through writing. I suffer through writing, I find writing exceptionally difficult. I love having written. There's nothing like the feeling of having written something and feeling that you got it.

How does that look for you?

A lot of sitting there and kind of bashing my head against the wall. A lot of pacing, a lot of chocolate, a lot of walks. And that's the problem, right? I used to smoke. When I was writing the first movie I ever got paid to write, which is The Prestige, I started out smoking as I had smoked through college. And I realized that if I finished that script and I was still smoking, I would never quit. Because if the script was good …

I think many writers, if you're listening to this, you know exactly what he's talking about.

I managed to quit cold turkey halfway through the script, so that I could never point to that script if it was a good script, if it worked, and think like, “I really gotta go back.” It would just pull you in every time. I think about AI the same way. That's no assessment of its virtues. I just think if I let it into my creative process, which is already so fraught, that I would never find my way back.

But it's terrific for research. Say you're doing an adaptation or a reboot or something like that. You can get into it and you can ask questions. Like, “Tell me where in the book series such-and-such character first talked about their childhood.” It's a way to speed through some of those harder aspects of corralling. So it has enormous use.

There is a wonderful notion that we're going to save money somehow. It's never gotten cheaper. I was talking to [Fallout video game director] Todd Howard about this on the gaming side of things. Those games are just like big movies. They've just gotten bigger and bigger and bigger. Nothing ever makes it cheaper. Digital cameras didn't make it cheaper. The digital postproduction process didn't make it cheaper.

So you think the idea that artificial intelligence could wipe out a bunch of jobs and take costs down for film and TV production is nonstarter nonsense?

It's entirely possible. There's this wonderful quote from The New Yorker a few months ago where it basically said that it's about the gullibility of management of these companies if they think these tools can replace everyone. It's because they've been overhyped, right? It managed to scare all of us during the strike. This is part of the reason the strike went on so long. If they made bad decisions, the consequences would be catastrophic.

But assuming that people still want a certain number of big movies every year and a certain number of big shows every year, the applications for these tools … You know, there's been a lot of hand-wringing, a lot of arguments, a lot of conversations in my town. And God bless them, that technology companies will come down to sort of make nice. It's literally like the delegation from Northern California comes to visit with the Southern California delegation.

I mean, they barely bother with the New York delegation of journalism anymore, so I'm glad to hear they're still talking to you guys.

Sometimes those meetings are somewhat contentious. Last time I was at one of those, someone sort of trotted out this metaphor that they were Uber drivers and we were taxi drivers. I said, “OK, maybe. But maybe you're Uber and we're Formula One drivers.”

Oh, I like that.

Not to sound self-aggrandizing.

Oh, seize the power.

Uber has no relevance to, you know, Ferrari. I'm a car guy, right? Maybe Uber helps the fans get to the race, but it's not the race, right? Those technologies have nothing to do with the race. What these technologies will do, and I think they're incredible in this, is give access to the next generation of filmmakers who don't even have it.

There's a generation of filmmakers who would never have got to Hollywood. I hope that Hollywood will remain an important epicenter of culture creation and filmmaking, because these people will eventually get fed up with the prompt version of filmmaking and they'll come, as so many of us have done for a hundred years now, and try to convince someone to give them some money to hire a proper Hollywood crew and go make a real movie.

I would point to Sean Baker, a terrific filmmaker. After he made Tangerine famously on an iPhone, the next year I was watching The Florida Project and I was taken aback. I was like, “I gotta reconsider my whole position on film, because this movie's beautiful.” Then I got to the end and I Googled it and, of course, he shot it on 35 millimeter. He got there with an iPhone, and his last three films have been shot on film, because you use the tools that allow you to raise your hand and say, “Hey, look at me. Look at what I'm doing.” This is my fervent hope.

Because film is ultimately a collaborative medium. That's maybe the scariest part of these technologies, they're not collaborative.

The isolationist aspect.

That's like writing. Writing sucks.

It does suck.

Filmmaking's amazing because it's me and 800 of our friends.

So it's this idea of ,“Well, how did you get your big break?” “Oh, I made a film with AI and someone saw it.”

I think that's awesome. As long as it doesn't replace [anyone] and as long as we don't go through this moment where people think, “Oh, we can do all this content for peanuts.” It's like, “Well, no, you've always had the ability to do that. It's called B movies.” B movies have always been there. And independent films, which is where I started. You've always been able to make the lower-cost version of it. But then there has always still been the AAA version of it.

I sometimes describe my job as photographing beautiful people in beautiful places. And the people part is important. The fact that the actors are real people and it matters to audiences. I think that matters a lot. The culture of celebrity, the idea of that connection you have to them. Then I started working in television and the bond that people have with television actors is different and much deeper. This is a long-lost member of their family.

You seem very sensitive about cost and the idea of spending less money to produce great work. You gave a speech at the Saturn Awards and said, quote, “As producers, we are not just here to save people money.” You were speaking in the context of bringing production back to California, which you did with the second season of Fallout. What do you think about the financial pressures of your industry? What kind of fight are you fighting to try to get the resources that you need to do the work you want to do?

It's a great question, and it reminds me that there is one technology over the years that has radically altered the economics of film. I'm not sure if you'd say it's actually materially changed the trend line, but it definitely altered the economics and that technology is the tax rebate. That's not a technology, but it is an innovation.

As the recipient of funds from the great state of New York, the great state of California, the United Kingdom, Utah—everywhere we go, if there's a rebate, we'll try to take advantage of it. You know, you want to put as much money on the screen as you can.

Part of the reason I was so worked up in that speech was not just that a fire had destroyed the homes of 10 of our crew members on Fallout and a dozen of our friends. It was that I had just started to get an idea from my crew. We have a terrific crew. A lot of them worked with us on Westworld, so we've worked with some of these folks for a decade or more. These are folks who are the best at what they do, and usually when we have a wrap party, not so many people can make it because they're in such high demand. They're already on to the next thing. For the second season of Fallout, everyone's at the wrap party. I was like “Oh no, this is a problem.” They haven't been hired. There's no production. I mean, it's been a catastrophe, an absolute catastrophe.

Also, the complicity of studios, and studio production heads and producers being willing to go along with, “Well, look, we could make this in California or New York, but we're going to make it in Hungary because we'll be able to do it for $30 or $40 million less."

I think that's been an incredibly shortsighted and foolish thing for us to do.

The New York Times story where I found that quote, by the way, is actually about you bringing the second season of Fallout to California. You moved production back, and you were really vocal about pushing for the industry to do the same with more projects. Have you seen progress in that direction since that push?

I think it's very easy to be cynical about state politics. But they were incredibly thoughtful and smart. In a year in which you have enormous challenges from the incoming Trump administration, enormous challenges for the state of California's budget, they cleared a much bigger incentive to try to make sure that California remained competitive.

It's not big enough. It's never big enough. Georgia essentially has an uncapped one. But it was a huge shot in the arm. These things move slowly. It's a really big cruise ship. It turns really slowly.

It'll take a while to undo some of the damage, but I'm hopeful that what the state legislators and the governor was able to pass will give us the best shot for keeping Hollywood Hollywood for another hundred years.

I have to ask you about Fallout. The show is, of course, based on a video game franchise that has many decades of history. The second season of the show premiered about a month ago, and new episodes are now coming out on Amazon every week. How do you describe the show to people who aren't familiar with the game, who maybe don't have the years of lore and history and maybe haven't watched it yet?

I don't think I ever quite dialed in the elevator pitch, but it is along the lines of: What if the world ended but it didn't completely end? I started as a fan of the games …

You've said you played, I think, Fallout 3 and it destroyed a year of your life, consumed a year of your life.

It's the Annie Hall thing, right? There goes another novel.

These games are incredible, and one of the things about the games that Todd makes—Todd Howard is the creative mastermind behind the latter-day Fallout games—is that they're essentially infinite, right? You can just play them and play them and play them and play them.

One of the things they had, I thought, that was very unique about them—and this was a bit of a stretch for me as a filmmaker—was that they are this combination of darkness and violence and interesting questions about technology and identity, but they're also really weird and funny and gonzo and strange. Yes, they're about the end of the world. There are lots of stories about the end of the world. But these ones are weirdly optimistic. It feels like they're more about the beginning of a new world. They're more about, OK, well, culture would rebuild itself. Let's play in the mess that ensues.

It's a retro-futuristic world. It resembles the 1950s, right? The music, the imagery, this focus on traditionalism. You didn't make that choice. It was inherent in the franchise, but why do you think it's set in that time period, which I think is not representative of the experience of all Americans. I think it was actually a very dark time. But there's this fixation on 1950s Americana as this perfect moment for the United States, at least in hindsight. How have you thought about that in working on the show?

The sort of common lore is what defines the Fallout universe. Each of the games have different characters, they have a different setting, but they're all connected by this world, the world that was before. Look, you've seen a whole political movement built out of the nostalgia for that world, right? That world had a coherence and an appeal, even if it was rooted in all kinds of ugly, terrible shit.

There was an unadulterated vision of America as the victor in the Second World War, and this force for good. Was it true? Well, in so many ways no, but in several important ways, yes. You know, they hadn't yoked the entire world under a Pax Americana; they hadn't taken over all these countries. They found maybe a sneakier way to do it. They pulled everyone into the Bretton Woods system. They pulled everyone into this kinda like free-to-play, free-trade system, which was powerful, and it created a world where you didn't have another world war for a very long time.

American culture predominated and American culture had a lot of darkness in there, but largely spoke to values that I think a lot of us can get behind in terms of freedom and equity. And eventually, even if it was hypocrisy in the beginning, all these wonderful things that it's easy to be nostalgic about, and I think is therefore kind of ripe fruit.

If you're going to think about America's fall from grace, you'd probably fall from that moment. But if that moment is extended, that's a fascinating thing. What if you extended that for a hundred years and you took the promise of nuclear technology seriously? I always thought that was such a lovely and incisive and satirical place to start.

Was anything surprising to you about how the show has been received? When it's based on this franchise that has such a fandom and lore and such history—it's a lot of pressure.

A lot of pressure. I sort of trained at the DC school of fan pressure with the three Batman movies that I worked on with my brother. I learned a lot of lessons there in terms of approaching something because you love it, not because you're trying to figure out why someone else loves it. And you have to trust that hopefully you're finding the right things in there. You're never going to please everyone. But if you come at it from a place of genuine respect and love, I think you'll probably do OK. There's going to be some people who are pissed off at you, and you just have to be OK with that.

Just don't read the comments.

Oh God, no. Yeah. I gave up on that a long, long time ago.

I think when you talked to GQ, you said your disappointment with the internet over the last 20 years is “fucking bottomless.” So I had to assume that you were no longer reading Reddit threads about your show.

No, sadly. Because I really love that community.

I wanted to make sure to ask you a little bit about the politics of it all, which is to say that there are a lot of political themes that emerge in Fallout. We've talked about surveillance and the tools of the state. The apparatus. When you are working on a show and you're weaving these themes in, how do you make determinations about how overt and obvious to be as opposed to doing it in a more nuanced way?

Look, fundamentally, philosophically for me, I do not feel qualified to tell anyone how to believe. I'm much more interested in poking and asking questions and saying, “Well, should we believe this? Should we question this?” Working on Batman, I made this analogy to a friend with regards to politics and engaging with it. Working on Batman felt like being a Yankee, right? You don't play for the Yankees as a Democrat or a Republican, right? Taking a 60-year-old American icon and pressing that character into service for a specific, timely political point felt like a very fast path to losing relevance for the story.

If you're reading Dante's Inferno, it's stood the test of time, but it's kind of amazing how much regional politics is still laced into the first three chapters. He's still pissed off with his landlord in the third level of hell, right?

Oh my God.

It's like, OK, come on, let's get onto the next part. So, for me, there was always a bit of responsibility to be asking questions, not giving answers. But I have strong political beliefs, and I think as the world has started to feel more incoherent, and making sense of things has become so hard to wade through, and it's so hard to just talk to each other, it was really nice to work on a project like Fallout. From the very beginning, Graham Wagner, one of our showrunners, was joking that the first season, or the first game rather, could have been written by Adbusters.

There's a strong point of view there, and it's a strong political point of view. Poking at things, this is the beauty of working in speculative fiction or in apocalyptic fiction. The world is gone, so we're not talking about this president, we're not talking about that. We're talking about a fictitious world a hundred years in the future, and 200 years after that, where everything has been blown to hell.

But you get to pick up the bits, the detritus of our present political situation, potentially, and kind of look at it. That gives you that longer view, which I think allows you to engage. You know, I would challenge anyone to watch both seasons of Fallout and not find a group that doesn't come in for a drubbing. There's this slightly nativist progressivism of the Vault, where it's like “freedom and safety for everyone, except we're not letting anyone in.” You know, it's kinda the lifeboat, progressivism. Then you have the wild libertarianism, if you want to call it anything, of the Wasteland. So we get to look at all these different things. Again, I don't have any answers, but it's really fun at this moment in time to be able to poke a little more aggressively at some of these things.

I don't want to put too much on you, but we're looking at this show that's about the world after a collapse at the hands of very powerful conglomerates. So you're out there, you're talking about this show, you're working on the show, you're thinking about it all the time. You read the news. Is it hard for you, as someone who describes themselves as an optimist, not to see collapse everywhere?

Yeah. It's kinda what we do, right? We look for the signs. I'm hopeful that we will pull ourselves back from the edge. We've managed to. I thought my brother's movie Oppenheimer ends brilliantly with that warning: It's not over yet. We haven't solved this problem yet. Yeah. We may still yet destroy the world. I think it's incredibly important for us to always remember that.

That's why working on a show like Fallout, the timing sadly felt good as a gentle reminder that OK, it may be amusing to live in the wasteland that follows. I don't think any of us watch that show and wish to live in that world, or hope no one wishes to live in that world. But, I think with some thoughtfulness and a little compassion and maybe some slightly better heuristics for our social media, we might make it.

We shall see. Before we end, I would love to play a very quick game. It's a game we came up with. It's called Control, Alt, Delete. So, what piece of technology would you love to control? What would you love to alt, so alter or change, and what would you love to delete? What would you vanquish from the Earth if given the opportunity?

Got it. I would control AI generated video.

All of it.

Like I said, I'm so excited not necessarily for what we can do with it—I think it's limited for us—but what it can do for the next generation of filmmakers all over the world. I think it's going to be incredible. It's going to unleash a group of new voices. That's extraordinary.

However, one of these conversations with the [tech] folks who come down occasionally and check in with us to let us know how the end of our world is going in very nice ways pointed out, “We watermark very carefully. Every piece of video we generate. But it's totally invisible and no one can see.” I said, “Probably the biggest social problem right now is that you need to make it extremely visible.” You go back to Blade Runner, and I always thought to myself, “God, it's so weird that they don't want the replicants to live on Earth. It was so tragic.” Now I totally understand. Like if you can make a video of the president saying whatever you want, and it's indistinguishable from reality, that has to be regulated yesterday. It will create absolute chaos. If we don't get a handle on that imminently, we're in very, very serious trouble.

Well, we're going to hand it to you, so you'll solve that one.

For alt, gene therapy. Crispr. Lisa and I are very engaged with someone very close to us in our lives who has a condition caused by a novel nonsense gene. There are thousands of these sorts of conditions, they can have devastating results. I think there's an assumption with everyone that once we got Crispr, we just Ctrl+V and away we go. Right? That's not how it's going to happen. You have these catastrophic diseases where the tool will be there, but the funding won't be there, the resources won't be there. The boring bit is just getting the business model right. Or abandoning the business model and saying, OK, is the government going to start funding some of these things?

Um, delete. Social media. I would say all of it, but I have conversations with friends who have kids with special needs and this is their community. So maybe social media's algorithmic feed. Gone. Dumpster fire. It's like trans fats or ringtones.

Trans fats, ringtones, and the algorithmic feed—Jonathan Nolan's three agents of destruction.

That's it.

I love it. Thank you so much. This was such a fascinating conversation.

The Notepad++ project yesterday disclosed that its update server was covertly hijacked in a targeted supply chain attack that began in June 2025, exposing a subset of users to malicious installers delivered through the editor's built-in updater. According to Notepad++, attackers — which it claims were "likely a Chinese state-sponsored group" — gained the ability to selectively redirect update requests from specific users to attacker-controlled servers. Those victims were then served with a manipulated update manifest that pointed to a trojanized installer instead of the legitimate release.

Notepad++ says that this was “targeted”, with users “selectively redirected” to these attacker-controlled update manifests. As a result, users who manually downloaded installers from the official website were not affected, and most update requests continued to resolve normally. Instead, it appears as though the attackers intercepted traffic at the hosting layer used by the update service, enabling them to discriminate between targets in real-time.

According to Notepad++'s compromised and former shared hosting provider, the shared server hosting “getDownloadUrl.php” was compromised until September 2, at which point scheduled kernel and firmware updates removed the attackers' direct access.

However, the provider said that the attackers retained credentials for internal services on the server until December 2, allowing them to continue redirecting some update traffic even after the initial compromise had been remediated. The hosting provider also said that the attackers specifically targeted the Notepad++ domain and showed no interest in other customers on the same server.

Backing up Notepad++'s claims, the attack has since been linked to a long-running Chinese espionage group, Lotus Blossom, by Rapid7. Active since 2009, the group has been linked to attacks on government, elecom, media, and aviation across Southeast Asia and Central America. “Our investigation identified a security incident stemming from a sophisticated compromise of the infrastructure hosting Notepad++, which was subsequently used to deliver a previously undocumented custom backdoor,” Rapid7's report says.

Notepad++ has since introduced stricter validation checks that verify both the digital signature and certificate of downloaded installers, preventing updates from proceeding if verification fails. Users who downloaded installers directly from its official website were not affected by the compromised redirect, while those who rely on the built-in updater can upgrade to the latest release to pick up the stricter verification flow for future updates.

The cheekbones. The dead-eyed stare. The big hats. That White House Christmas photo. For decades now, people have been wondering: Who is Melania Trump? The First Lady opens her 2024 memoir with a story about leaving her family in Slovenia to immigrate to America as a 26-year-old model. Ten years later, she became an American citizen. “It was not an easy process,” she writes. “And my personal experience dealing with the trials of the immigration process opened my eyes to the difficulties faced by all who wish to become US citizens.”

OK, but what does that mean, exactly? Her husband, in both his terms as president, put harshly enforcing immigration policy at the center of his domestic agenda. This is all to say that I was authentically excited to see Melania, the documentary that Amazon paid $40 million to acquire and $35 million to market. The director, Brett Ratner, previously accused of sexual misconduct by six different women, is currently in the news thanks to his appearance in a photo included in the most recent dump of Epstein files. (Ratner has previously denied sexual misconduct allegations.) What is Melania like behind closed doors? The trailer—a monument to editing wizardry—reveals little except that Mrs. Trump perhaps didn't attend her husband's inauguration (ultimately she did).

It turns out, I'm not the only one who wanted to watch. While a WIRED analysis found only two movie theaters had sold out opening day screenings, local Republican groups across the country arranged parties to support the film, helping opening weekend reach $7 million or so in ticket sales. WIRED attended two such events, in Florida and California, to ask people what they love about the First Lady, what they make of her recent foray into artificial intelligence, and what, ultimately, they too want to find out about her.

Interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.

Name: Darlene Lauzurique

Immigration is leading the news, and Mrs. Trump was born in Slovenia. What do you think the media gets right and wrong about the Trumps' attitudes toward immigration?

Oh, that's a hot topic for me. I'm an immigrant like Melania. But I came here legally, and I did everything by the books. And I believe that this country will give the opportunity to other people to immigrate and grow and have a business—have a dream. I consider myself the American dream because I have a business. My property is paid off. I have investments and so on. And I don't want to be cocky, but it's the truth. But everything has to go by the book and by law, law and order. That's it.

What are you most excited to see revealed in the film?

I want to see the Melania that nobody else sees.

What made you fall in love with Melania Trump?

The five virtues of a successful woman. Melania is prudent, sincere, elegant, has a remarkable memory because she doesn't forget her origins, and is a great partner for a great leader.

Where do you think she's had the biggest impact as First Lady?

Her ability to speak up when she disagrees with decisions, without getting into controversies with her husband—that's a very important balance. She's always by his side, supporting him, accompanying him, and pursuing a very important social agenda.

Name: Ozzy Perez

Where do you think Melania has had the biggest impact as First Lady?

Her support for the military. Since I was in the military, I respect that a lot. She has an incredible love for the military. And she's a naturalized citizen—she wasn't naturally born here. So that's even more impressive.

When did you serve?

I served from 2002 to 2007. I signed up the day after 9/11.

Cool. Did you deploy?

I was part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. So the invasion, '03, '04, and then the invasion of Fallujah, '04, '05. And then the invasion of Haditha, '05. '06. So back to back to back. Three Christmases in a row, missed both my kids' births. It was a crazy time. Tempo was out of control.

Name: Millie Fresen

What do you love most about Melania?

Everything. I love her. She's classy. She's the best-looking first lady we've had. She's very intelligent. She's very … I love her.

Where do you think she's had the biggest impact as First Lady?

Being married to Donald Trump.

Mrs. Trump is promoting AI in life and in schools. Do you agree with her that artificial intelligence opens up the imagination?

Yes.

Do you use AI in your own life?

No, I don't use it because I'm 82 years old. But for my kids and grandkids, I love it.

Immigration is leading the news, and Mrs. Trump was born in Slovenia. What do you think the media gets right and wrong about the Trumps' attitudes toward immigration?

All the media is wrong about immigration. I am Cuban, so I'm an immigrant, but I am a legal immigrant. I came with permission to be here, and that's what I believe. Legal immigration.

Names: Steven Befera

What do you love most about Melania?

I like her style and the fact that she always carries herself well and is very well-spoken. As an immigrant and a model, it comes with all these preconceptions of that “dumb blonde," but she's really very smart and has a good heart.

Where do you think she's had the biggest impact as First Lady?

If you look at Melania, she lives her own life. She's not totally dependent on being in the White House. She's got a life in New York. She's got a son going to NYU. And she has other interests other than just the White House. So I think the fact that she can come and still do her work there but still have another life is unprecedented, really, if you look at First Ladies from the past.

Name: Noli Zaldivar

What do you love most about Melania?

She is a strong woman. I love that she doesn't need anybody's approval. She truly just stands on her own. She stands on her beliefs. There's so much criticism around her because she's not your cookie-cutter First Lady. She's not this older lady. She's not this person who's running around trying to people-please and smile and be super friendly. I love that she's true to herself. She's got this inner strength.

Where do you think she's had the biggest impact as First Lady?

I think her biggest impact has been on children and hunger, children who need education, who need homes.

She has a very tough exterior. If you were married to Donald Trump, I mean, he's a very tough guy to be married to. You need to have a tough exterior because you're having a lot of stuff thrown at you. That's who she is. She's tough on the outside, but she's got an amazing heart inside.

What are you excited to see revealed in the movie?

I really just want to see her perspective on the madness, because I think [Donald Trump] loves the madness. I think he's lived his life in this limelight. I don't see her like that, so I'm interested in seeing what her perspective is, just having to deal with all the photographers, and all of the people, and the rumors, and the talking.

Name: Lilly Perez

Where do you think she's had the biggest impact as First Lady?

As First Lady, especially this second term, it's that she cares about kids and she's helping a lot of kids to be released from Russia to Ukraine. And she has done flights, many of them.

Mrs. Trump is promoting AI in life and in schools. Do you agree that AI unlocks the imagination?

Well, there's a lot of people that are afraid of losing their jobs. But in the end it's going to help a lot of people to do things faster. So we have to wait until it develops.

What do you think the media gets right and wrong about the Trumps' attitudes toward immigration?

Sometimes he tells jokes and then they take it seriously. So they don't understand him, really. I was a political prisoner in Cuba. So I suffered a lot with communists. So I'm 100 percent backing him and Marco Rubio, so they get rid of the communists in Cuba.

Marianela Joli at a Miami screening.

Names: Marianela Joli and Mayra Joli

What do you love most about Melania?

Mayra Joli: That she knows what it's like to raise a family. She knows what it means to be a woman and a wife. And sometimes to turn a deaf ear to people who don't give proper or accurate information.

Where do you think she's had the biggest impact as First Lady?

Mayra Joli: She has elegance. She knows how to speak, how to command a whole stage and speak properly. And besides that, she's a super intelligent woman. She doesn't speak just one language—she speaks more than four languages.

She's from Slovenia, right? She's an immigrant.

Mayra Joli: She's an immigrant, just like me.

Where are you from?

Mayra Joli: I'm from the Dominican Republic.

Your sister mentioned how well she presents herself …

Marianela Joli: You're a lady, I'm a lady. And there are women who don't behave like ladies—they behave like anything. But a lady is class, clothing, carrying yourself properly, walking correctly. A woman who respects herself. And as a mother, she's excellent. Excellent. Otherwise her son wouldn't be who he is today.

Name: Madeline Abernathy, member of Kern County Young Republicans

Where do you think Melania has had the biggest impact as First Lady?

I was a little bit hesitant about what she would do in the first election—we didn't really know too much about her. And after she came on as the First Lady, the second time, I feel like we've learned more. She has different initiatives that she's coming out with, AI, technology, and for children as well. Her big passion for foster care and AI in science is very important.

Do you use AI in your own life?

Yes.

ChatGPT, or … ?

Yes, ChatGPT mainly, like if there's different types of bills or legislation or rules, regulations in oil and gas, just to be able to research it more in depth, to explain it.

Name: Jared Vegas, administrative vice chair of Kern County Young Republicans

What do you love most about Melania?

I'm going to be honest, I don't know a ton about the First Lady. That's why I'm really excited to see this movie, just to learn more about her. The biggest thing that I think of when I think of her is that we're not against immigration in this country. We're against illegal immigration, and she immigrated here legally and followed the process.

I think that's a good kind of dynamic to have when our president is constantly viewed right now as the guy who's just deporting everybody. It's like, well, no, he's not against legal immigration. His wife wouldn't be here if he was against legal immigration. He's only against illegal immigration. So I like that aspect of it. I think it's a good symbol.

Describe her in three words.

Calculated. She calculates everything. She's calculated. Intelligent. And I guess beautiful. I mean, she's got to be the prettiest First Lady we've ever had.

Was there a particular moment that stands out to you about her, that shaped your view of her?

I don't know if it's really a particular moment per se. It's more like every time I've seen her in public or heard her speak, she's just very graceful and respectful to everybody she talks to. Her husband, who I like in many ways, can sometimes be disrespectful. But I've never seen a moment where she's very blatantly disrespectful to those around her.

The First Lady has talked a lot about AI recently. Do you use AI in your own life?

Oh yeah, all the time. I work as a sales guy at my main job, at a perimeter security company. We sell electrified security fencing to businesses to protect them from criminals that come in and steal their stuff.

So the thing is, there are so many people I talk to throughout the day, because I'm going into businesses and talking to owners and I'm looking at the sites. And obviously there's a lot of things I have to remember. After I finish a meeting, I walk out and I take notes on everything. And then I use AI to modify them, to complete sentences, to make it make sense. It's a super helpful tool in my day-to-day.

What do you think the media gets wrong about the Trumps' views on immigration?

Well, I think the media often tries to victimize criminal behavior, in the sense that they want to feel bad for people because they come from such hard countries, and then say, “Oh, well, then that justifies the bad behavior to get here,” like in the sense of breaking the law. And Trump's very, very clear on this. Look, if you come here illegally, that in and of itself is a crime and justifies deportation.

That being said, there are some people that are more dangerous to our current society that not only broke the law of coming into the country illegally but also committing other heinous crimes. So let's focus on those people primarily, which has been the primary focus of the Trump administration. Have they gotten other people? Sure. But is the primary focus those that are breaking multiple laws? Yes.

Addy Eggers (left) and Sarah Fanucchi at a Bakersfield, California, party.

Names: Addy Eggers and Sarah Fanucchi

What do you think has been Melania's biggest impact as First Lady?

Addy: She's just been such a good supporter of Trump. She's supported all the things that he's put into action, all the things with ICE. She's just been there through it all, supporting him. And I think that's the main role of a First Lady, to be there for the president.

Describe her in three words.

Sarah: Stylish, humble, and down-to-earth.

Melania has been promoting the adoption of artificial intelligence, including in schools. Do you think she's right that AI can unlock the imagination?

Addy: I think with the use of AI, now that it's been invented and now that it's being used, we have to adapt to it. There's no way to get around it. I think it can be super helpful. I think it can make processes quicker. But I do agree that if it's overused, then obviously there's an issue that's a little scary.

Do you guys use AI?

Sarah: I do, yeah

Addy: I'm in college right now, of course I use AI. What college student doesn't use AI? Literally that's how I'm getting most of my assignments done because it's to the point, it's quick. It's not like I'm cheating with it, but it's more so like I'm using it to actually help me learn and create ways for me to learn. Right now it's created an outline for me to write an essay, which is helpful.

Immigration obviously is a big issue in the news right now. And Melania was born in Slovenia. What do you think the media is getting right or wrong about President Trump's attitude towards the issue?

They seem to think that he hates immigrants, that he wants them all gone. But it's very obvious that he means the illegals, the ones that are doing harm. And if there were people that came here legally and they came here to work, they came here the right way, he wouldn't mind. It's all about following the protocol, following the rules. [Editors: Even before the 2026 crackdown, individuals with no criminal convictions reportedly made up two-thirds of the people being deported through the first half of last year].

Names: Donna Hylton

Where do you feel Melania's had the biggest impact as a First Lady?

Well, when I say she carries herself well, I don't mean physical, although she does that too. But she has a presence, considering her husband is quite a show horse, right? Intelligent, speaks seven foreign languages. I don't know about how many people in this country can do that. And she's got initiatives that she's running herself. She's not just holding teas in the White House, she's actually going to be out there in the community and helping children.

Describe her in three words.

I was going to say tall, dark, and handsome. Well, smart, beautiful, and warm.

As a mother I relate to her because of her business as not only First Lady but also raising her son in the White House. You know how difficult it is when you have teenagers. They have a mind of their own and they're going to do what they want. No matter what Mom says or Dad, and your dad's the president of the United States!

This might be a hot button topic, but immigration is obviously in the news right now, and Mrs. Trump is born in Slovenia. What do you think the media is getting right or wrong about the Trumps' attitude towards immigration?

My family's Armenian, we all came legally. But we don't support criminals. And if they're criminals, either native Americans or from a foreign country and came here illegally, we got to get them out. Because it's not only dangerous, but they broke the law getting here.

And just to clarify, did you say including native Americans or not including native Americans?

When I say native Americans, that's all of us born here. It's not just Indians, okay? I'm native. I'm born in California. So that's what native Americans really mean.

Name: Joey Chavez

Melania has been promoting the adoption of artificial intelligence, including in schools. Do you think she's right that AI can, in her words, unlock the imagination?

I generally do. You see, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing all industries, supply chain, agriculture here in the Central Valley. It's very resource-intensive, but I can see the return being tenfold, depending on how well we educate our children on prompt engineering and really taking advantage of information systems.

Do you use AI yourself?

I do use AI strategically, whether it be for my own self-enrichment—I'm trying to learn a couple of languages like Punjabi, Spanish, and Italian—or whether it be for cooking. I enjoy cooking in my personal life. It's a supplement to my work.

Immigration has been in the news lately. Considering that Mrs. Trump is from Slovenia, what do you think the media has gotten right or wrong about Trump's attitude towards immigration?

That's a fantastic question. I think the media has correctly identified that Trump wants to make this a priority because he's feeling the pressure from his base.

We're seeing the collapse of software engineering as an industry because we have a plethora, and possibly an excess, of H-1B visa recipients taking jobs in Silicon Valley. So Trump understands at this very point that immigration and the full boat that is our country, it's handling a lot of weight, and he needs to prioritize American interests in our economy by putting Americans first.

What I think the media could be more generous to Trump on, what I think they got incorrect, is the way that the administration has been targeting different populations. In Minneapolis, we've had various demonstrations and two tragic assassinations because the left and the opponents of the administration want to put Americans in the middle of the crossfire to oppose any sort of immigration standard being enforced.

Seattle startup Avalanche Energy on Tuesday announced $29 million in funding to support its push toward fusion power and to help launch a commercial-scale testing facility for fusion technologies.

The private investment was led by RA Capital Management and brings the startup's total funding to $105 million across investors and government grants.

The new capital is largely earmarked for FusionWERX, a test facility in Richland, Wash., that is a public-private partnership offering shared R&D resources to companies, government labs and universities to develop the sector's supply chain and to produce radioactive materials. The site is expected to open next year and is supported by $10 million in matching funds provided by Washington state. 

The recent investment will also help pay for equipment including superconducting magnets that will be needed for Avalanche's next-generation compact fusion device.

The fusion sector has attracted massive investments in recent years as energy-hungry data centers expand nationally to meet burgeoning AI needs. Avalanche is targeting slightly different use cases, but still benefiting from the insatiable appetite for clean power.  

The round included all of the startup's existing backers: Congruent Ventures, Founders Fund, Lowercarbon Capital and Toyota Ventures. New investors 8090 Industries, Overlay Capital and others also joined.

Avalanche remains an outlier in the Pacific Northwest's fusion ecosystem. While local rivals Helion Energy, Zap Energy and General Fusion are aiming for large devices to feed electrons to the electrical grid, Avalanche is going small. 

The company has its sights on desktop-sized machines well-suited for space or defense applications — environments where portability and power density are more critical than sheer grid-scale output.

Avalanche founders Robin Langtry and Brian Riordan have likewise taken a less conventional path to founding the company, coming not from physics labs in academia but from Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin where they worked on rocket propulsion. 

Their iterative, builder-focused approach has led them to unlikely sources of inspiration — most recently, decades-old research from Russia's Mir space program that helped them reorient some misbehaving plasma.

“There's a little bit of archeology going on, digging up old Soviet papers from the '80s that are not necessarily well digitized,” said Langtry, the company's CEO. But the overlooked discoveries by the Russians can be successfully applied to Avalanche's fusion devices, he said. “We ended up borrowing some of their ideas.”

Since launching in 2018, the team has grown to 50 employees and notched recent advances:

The team hopes its next fusion machine will hit the sought-after target of “Q greater than one” — which is when more energy is produced by the plasma than was put into it.

Though Avalanche is charting its own course, it's part of a global race to harness the energy created when small atoms are forced to collide and fuse — mimicking the reactions that power the sun. Physicists have spent decades trying to develop commercially viable fusion. None so far have succeeded, but some companies claim they're getting close. 

“The time where you could kind of get by with paper designs and plans is sort of ending. It's really all about who can build these machines in the next couple years and really demonstrate record-breaking plasmas and then commercialize that,” Langtry said, adding, “we're going to be right there with them.”

SpaceX is acquiring xAI. Ever since this merger of two Musk companies became a rumor, crazy numbers like $1.5 trillion started being thrown around when discussing the total valuation of SpaceX, so you might sum it up by saying “Combining SpaceX and xAI gets you the biggest IPO of all time!” and yeah, that's more plausible now than ever. For reference, SpaceX's valuation was estimated at around $800 billion less than two months ago. But is this merger as silly as it sounds?The combined company will be a “vertically-integrated innovation engine,” according to a new SpaceX press release with Elon Musk's personal signature on it. By his own reckoning, the company now deals in “AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.” Another way of saying this might be that SpaceX is now the company behind vertically-landing rocket boosters, the majority of the satellites currently in orbit, very fat rockets that tend to explode, an ISP, the microblogging app known as X, a sassy chatbot called Grok that's famous for lewd images, and much much more. SpaceX will now own, for instance, Grokipedia, the AI-written, anti-woke parody of Wikipedia. And remember Vine, the defunct 6-second video social media app? Yes SpaceX, which possesses billions of dollars in Pentagon contracts and is responsible for crewed NASA missions, now owns the rights to Vine too. Musk claims he's bringing it back “in AI form.” As many have pointed out before me, SpaceX became a genuinely indispensable player in humanity's aerospace and space travel efforts through an iterative process involving an extraordinary number of spectacular and public rocket explosions that almost certainly would not have been tolerated if SpaceX were a government agency. It has always walked a delicate tightrope, keeping boring people happy, while also subject to the silly stuff and horrors that go along with being run by Elon Musk.Gwynne Shotwell, the president and COO of SpaceX, has been described by the Wall Street Journal as “a Musk translator, especially for officials who depend on SpaceX but are occasionally unnerved by his activities.” In that same Journal article, former NASA administrator Bill Nelson—also a Democratic ex-Senator—called Shotwell, “the steady hand” at the company, and added, “I have a great deal of confidence in her. Because of that, I have a great deal of confidence in SpaceX.”Back in 2022, when Musk was in the middle of buying Twitter in as chaotic a fashion as possible, Nelson says he called Shotwell, and said, “Tell me that the distraction that Elon might have on Twitter is not going to affect SpaceX.” “I assure you, it is not,” he says she told him. “You have nothing to worry about.” Now imagine being Shotwell four years later. Twitter is now X. Last year, the proprietary AI chatbot on X briefly started calling itself “MechaHitler” at one point, and then it generated tons of scantily-clad pictures of children. So not only has the drama increased, but you're the president and COO of the company that made all that stuff too. And imagine Shotwell having to handle this merger while Musk, the attention-starved celebrity CEO of this conglomerate has spent the last few days trying to post his way out of any consequences or disapprobation brought about by the public disclosure of emails in which he repeatedly asked Jeffrey Epstein if he could party on his private island. So one can only speculate what Musk's mental state was when he finalized the plans for this merger. But what stands out to me is that he wants investors in xAI and SpaceX—and perhaps starting in June, future holders of publicly traded SpaceX stock—to believe that this merger creates a company that gels and has a unified agenda. But you might want to take as big of a bong rip as you can before you try and get your head around that agenda as Musk describes it in his press release: This rocket and AI company will actually be an AI-in-space company, you see, because, according to Musk's estimate, “within 2 to 3 years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space.” After all, “in the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.” Obviously. But training models with space compute is just the beginning, because Musk claims that by combining these two concepts, they'll be “scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe.” Companies don't have to always make sense. Samsung has hotels. Red Bull has a nature magazine. Konami has aerobics gyms. Sometimes these incongruities are prosperous leftovers from a different era for a company, but sometimes they reveal the caprice or frivolity of company leadership, which can be no big deal.But then again, it's not farfetched to think that Elon Musk's caprice—and the fact that an economically powerful subset of Wall Street bulls think that caprice is tantamount to wisdom—may soon control the world's best-funded AI company at a time when AI is the load bearing structure propping up the whole economy. If the IPO goes well (the New York Times' sources say Musk hopes it will raise $50 billion), that AI company is going to be in your 401(k) while it's also in charge of the lives of astronauts. In other words, we're headed for a time when the Wall Street bulls will have to be right. More than ever Elon Musk's caprice may have to actually be wisdom, as implausible as that may be. AI had better not be a bubble if this IPO goes well, and the value of Musk himself had better not be inflated either. All of our well-being may just depend on it.

Palantir earned a record $1.855 billion in revenue from the American government in 2025, the company said in an earnings report that exceeded market expectations.

“We also did this while supporting, in critical manner, some of the most interesting, intricate, unusual operations that the U.S. government has been involved in, many of which we can't comment on, but were the highlight of last year and were highly motivating to all of us at Palantir,” CEO Alex Karp said on the investor call.

Palantir's “motivating” business with the U.S. government grew 55% year-over-year in 2025. In just the last three months of the year, Palantir made $570 million in revenue, with 66% growth year-over-year.

Most of that revenue was driven by the company's work for the Department of Defense, “as well as accelerating momentum in civil agencies,” Palantir's chief revenue officer Ryan Taylor said.

Palantir's close relationship with at least one of these civil agencies has been at the heart of growing public scrutiny, and that's the Department of Homeland Security.

The DHS has been relying on Palantir software in its effort to turbocharge the Trump administration's violent crackdown on immigrants. Last year, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency paid Palantir $60 million to build a surveillance platform called ImmigrationOS to track self-deportations. Just a few months later, an Amnesty International report claimed that Palantir's AI software was used to target non-citizens who speak out in favor of Palestine.

ICE also uses Palantir tech to decide which neighborhoods to target for deportation raids. The program is called ELITE (short for Enhanced Lead Identification and Targeting), and it was first unveiled in a 404 Media report last month and later corroborated in a DHS report on AI use cases in the Department.

The same report also says that ICE uses Palantir AI to review, summarize, and categorize tips sent to the agency.

Karp himself has been outspoken in favor of Trump's immigration policy, going so far as to say that he will use his “whole influence to make sure this country stays skeptical on migration.”

But Palantir's partnership with Washington goes far beyond just immigration. Many parts of the government rely on Palantir software, most notably the Pentagon and particularly through a $480 million deal for an AI-powered target identification system called Maven.

“Our weapons software is in every combat situation [that] I'm aware of,” Karp said. In fact, the CEO claims it's been so effective that his chief technology officer Shyam Sankar's “phone rings off the hook all day, and what they want from him is ‘how do I do this same thing across government?'”

Karp's usual retort to accusations that Palantir is aiding the administration in immoral (and some argue illegal) actions is that the company's software is the only way the public can ensure the government's actions remain constitutional. He has used this reasoning when defending the use of Palantir software in Caribbean boat strikes that many experts believe to be war crimes, and he used it again in the investor call to ward off fears of Palantir-driven mass surveillance.

Karp argues that Palantir is building technology that will hold the government accountable to the legal limits of its surveillance, and ensure that “every institution that uses our product is doing it within conformity of the law and the ethics of America.”

But what happens when those “laws and ethics” themselves become questionable? Well, Palantir continues to get paid.

Take Palantir's work for the Department of Health and Human Services. For roughly the past year, Palantir has supplied AI tools to attack government programs, contracts, and grants that don't fit with the Trump administration's views on gender, environment, and race, according to a recently published report on AI use cases at HHS.

The Department has been using Palantir AI to make sure that all grants and jobs comply with Trump's executive orders targeting DEI and “gender ideology.”

Since they were signed a year ago, both executive orders have led to many federal layoffs, including some targeting non-DEI-related positions, and major cuts to funding for crucial research. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even had to scrub any mentions of words like “gender,” “LGBT,” or “environmental justice,” retracting and even pausing some research submissions, while Trump cut more than 1,600 research grants at the National Science Foundation.

Peter Thiel—the billionaire venture capitalist, PayPal, and Palantir cofounder, and outspoken commentator on all matters relating to the “Antichrist”—appears at least 2,200 times in the latest batch of files released by the Department of Justice related to convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The tranche of records demonstrate how Epstein managed to cultivate an extensive network of wealthy and influential figures in Silicon Valley. A number of them, including Thiel, continued to interact with Epstein even after his 2008 guilty plea for solicitation of prostitution and of procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.

The new files show that Thiel arranged to meet with Epstein several times between 2014 and 2017. “What are you up to on Friday?” Thiel wrote to Epstein on April 5, 2016. “Should we try for lunch?” The bulk of the communications between the two men in the data dump concern scheduling meals, calls, and meetings with one another. Thiel did not immediately return a request for comment from WIRED.

One piece of correspondence stands out for being particularly bizarre. On February 3, 2016, Thiel's former chief of staff and senior executive assistant, Alisa Bekins, sent an email with the subject line “Meeting - Feb 4 - 9:30 AM - Peter Thiel dietary restrictions - CONFIDENTIAL.” The initial recipient of the email is redacted, but it was later forwarded directly to Epstein.

The contents of the message are also redacted in at least one version of the email chain uploaded by the Justice Department on Friday. However, two other files from what appears to be the same set of messages have less information redacted.

In one email, Bekins listed some two dozen approved kinds of sushi and animal protein, 14 approved vegetables, and 0 approved fruits for Thiel to eat. “Fresh herbs” and olive oil were permitted; however, ketchup, mayonnaise, and soy sauce should be avoided. Only one actual meal was explicitly outlined: “egg whites or greens/salad with some form of protein,” such as steak, which Bekins included “in the event they eat breakfast.” It's unclear if the February 4 meeting ultimately occurred; other emails indicate Thiel got stuck in traffic on his way to meet Epstein that day.

According to a recording of an undated conversation between Epstein and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak that was also part of the files the DOJ released on Friday, Epstein told Barak that he was hoping to meet Thiel the following week. He added that he was familiar with Thiel's company Palantir, but proceeded to spell it out loud for Barak as “Pallentier.” Epstein speculated that Thiel might put Barak on the board of Palantir, though there's no evidence that ever occurred.

“I've never met Peter Thiel, and everybody says he sort of jumps around and acts really strange, like he's on drugs,” Epstein said at one point in the audio recording, referring to Thiel. The former prime minister expressed agreement with Epstein's assessment.

In 2015 and 2016, Epstein put $40 million in two funds managed by one of Thiel's investment firms, Valar Ventures, according to The New York Times. Epstein and Thiel continued to communicate and were discussing meeting with one another as recently as January 2019, according to the files released by the DOJ. Epstein committed suicide in his prison cell in August of that year.

Below are Thiel's dietary restrictions as outlined in the February 2016 email. (The following list has been reformatted slightly for clarity.)

By now, the Forbes 30 Under 30 list has become more than a little notorious for the amount of entrants who go on to be charged with fraud. Notable alumni include FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Frank CEO Charlie Javice, Joanna Smith-Griffin, founder of the AI startup AllHere Education, and “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli, among others. Now, another member of the list has been hit with federal charges.

Gökçe Güven, a 26-year-old Turkish national and the founder and CEO of fintech startup Kalder, was charged last week with alleged securities fraud, wire fraud, visa fraud, and aggravated identity theft.

The New York-based fintech startup — which uses the “Turn Your Rewards into [a] Revenue Engine” tagline — says it can help companies create and monetize individual rewards programs. The company was founded in 2022, and offers participating firms the opportunity to earn ongoing revenue streams via partner affiliate sales, Axios previously reported.

Güven was featured in last year's Forbes 30 Under 30 list. The magazine notes in the writeup that Güven's clients included major chocolatier Godiva and the International Air Transport Association, the trade organization that represents a majority of the world's airlines. Kalder also claims to have enjoyed the backing of a number of prominent VC firms.

The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that, during Kalder's seed round in April of 2024, Güven managed to raise $7 million from more than a dozen investors after presenting a pitch deck that was rife with false information.

According to the government, Kalder's pitch deck claimed that there were 26 brands “using Kalder” and another 53 brands in “live freemium.” However, officials say that, in reality, Kalder had, in many cases, only been offering heavily discounted pilot programs to many of those companies. Other brands “had no agreement with Kalder whatsoever—not even for free services,” officials said in a press release announcing the indictment. The pitch deck also “falsely reported that Kalder's recurring revenue had steadily grown month over month since February 2023 and that by March 2024, Kalder had reached $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue.” 

The government also accuses Güven of having kept two separate sets of financial books. One of those sets included “false and inflated numbers,” and was presented to investors or potential investors to hide the “true financial condition of the company,” the government claims. The DOJ also alleges that Güven used lies about Kalder as well as forged documents to obtain a category of visa reserved for individuals of “extraordinary ability,” that would allow her to live and work in the United States. 

TechCrunch reached out to Güven through her personal website. The CEO said that she would be sharing a statement about the charges on Tuesday.

A recent international research project has used advanced microscopy techniques and computational modeling to discover why virus infection changes the nuclear structures and biomechanical forces affecting the nucleus.

Researchers at the University of Jyväskylä (Finland), in cooperation with national and international research groups, have shown that DNA viruses infect cells and take over the host cell nucleus induce dramatic structural modifications. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection and the emergence of nuclear enlarged, low-density viral replication compartments lead to changes in nuclear volume, chromatin organization, and the structure of nuclear lamina.

Researchers show that the infection remodels nuclear biomechanics, leading to dramatic softening of the nucleus. To understand the phenomenon, advanced microscopy, including cryo-soft X-ray tomography (SXT), atomic force microscopy (AFM), combined with computational modeling, was employed.

Our mechanical simulations and in vitro experiments showed that a reduction in outward forces, such as actin cytoskeleton pull or osmotic pressure, is the most likely factor in nuclear softening."

Maija Vihinen-Ranta, Research Director, University of Jyväskylä

The study was published in the top publication series in the field of virology, PLOS Pathogens and sheds new light on the virus-induced fundamental nuclear remodeling.

- Modern science is increasingly seeking to identify the forces acting on cells that shape their biomechanics. Usually, these forces come from outside the cell. However, the changes caused by the viral infection take place inside the nucleus of the cell, thus shedding light on the influence of intranuclear forces on the mechanical changes in the nucleus, explains Vihinen-Ranta.

This work was financed by the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation, the Academy of Finland, the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, and the National Institute of Health (USA).

Rounds focused on critically ill pediatric patients at the greatest risk for developing healthcare-associated conditions (HACs) reduced the rate of specific HACs by nearly 50% at a Colorado hospital, according to a study published in Critical Care Nurse (CCN).

After implementing a high-risk rounding process, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, was able to decrease the mean rate of project-specific HACs in its pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) from 5.41 to 2.89 events per 1,000 patient days. The 48-bed PICU averages 3,500 admissions annually from across the seven states served by the hospital.

"Reducing Hospital-Acquired Conditions in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit With a High-Risk Rounding Process" details how the interprofessional project team developed criteria for PICU patients at high risk for HACs and created a template script to encourage dialogue with direct care nurses. The article also includes examples of specific interventions performed during the rounds and ways the process revealed trends in practice gaps and opportunities for improvement. 

Co-author Michele Loi, MD, is the PICU director of quality and faculty physician in the PICU at Children's Hospital Colorado and an associate professor of pediatrics at University of Colorado School of Medicine. 

Our high-risk rounds focus on the underlying risks for multiple HACs and extend prevention efforts 'beyond the bundle,' in a collaborative and supportive way. The approach can be easily adapted for changes in patient population and different clinical needs." 

Michele Loi, MD, associate professor of pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine

Before implementation of weekly high-risk rounds, HAC prevention included team members auditing bedside nursing staff for bundle compliance during patient care and conducting apparent cause analysis for all HAC events. 

After implementation, interprofessional rounding teams addressed several HACs simultaneously and offered immediate education and resources if needed. A template script based on a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) survey provided question prompts for the rounding team to cover topics efficiently and collect data. 

Over two years from March 2022 to March 2024, a total of 624 rounds for 488 unique patients was conducted. Rounds resulted in 351 interventions, including escalation of concerns, direct patient care, resource procurement and education. 

Implementation of high-risk rounds reduced the rate of project-specific HACs by 46.5%, which was sustained over the two-year project period. The initiative focused on rates for central line [catheter]-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), unplanned extubation and pressure injury.

Based on the data analysis, high-risk rounds prevented an estimated 50 HACs during the project period, reducing patient harm and generating significant cost savings.

Patients who received high-risk rounds were less likely to develop an HAC than those who did not receive them. Patients were included in high-risk rounds if they met specific screening criteria, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous renal replacement therapy or endotracheal intubation. 

Trends identified through the high-risk rounds have already spurred additional projects such as a study of unit psychological safety, changes in PICU policies, identification of education topics and a revamp of the shift safety-check process.

A study led by researchers at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine of Lleida (IRBLleida), the University of Lleida (UdL), the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and Arnau de Vilanova University Hospital (HUAV) has developed and internally validated a clinical prediction model called the Goliat score, which can be used by emergency services to estimate the risk of acute complications in patients suffering from minor and moderate traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). The study was recently published in BMC Emergency Medicine.

Non-severe head trauma accounts for a large proportion of emergency room visits, but most patients do not develop important clinical complications within 48 hours of their injury. "Early detection of the patients who are most at risk continues to be a fundamental clinical challenge for optimizing discharge decisions, clinical monitoring and the use of computed tomography," said the head of the ERLab Emergency Medicine research group at IRBLleida, Oriol Yuguero, who is also a researcher at the UOC and a member of the e-RLab Ethics, Equity and Digital Tools for Health Improvement research group, affiliated to the eHealth Centre.

The Goliat score was constructed based on a consecutive cohort study of adults with mild or moderate TBI (a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13-15), who were treated in a hospital emergency department in Lleida between June 2019 and December 2020. The model contains variables that can be obtained in less than six hours, including age, history of hypertension, platelet count, systolic blood pressure, anticoagulant treatment, serum levels of the S100B protein, and high-risk clinical indicators such as fluctuating GCS and pupil alterations, and predicts the likelihood of neurological or cardiorespiratory complications and mortality in the first 48 hours.

The results show that the Goliat score can discriminate between patients at high and low risk of developing complications.

The model performed similarly in age and sex subgroups, although it requires prospective external validation before it can be routinely applied in clinical practice." 

Oriol Yuguero, researcher, UOC

According to the researchers, this tool could limit unnecessary exposure to radiation, reduce the use of cranial computed tomography (CT) and enable safer and risk-based discharge decisions, especially among elderly patients, when the presence of multiple comorbidities can make clinical evolution difficult.

This study is a significant step towards achieving simple yet robust clinical predictive models that contain immediately available demographic, laboratory and clinical data for improving the care of patients with minor or moderate traumatic brain injury in emergency services. The project was funded by the Mutua Madrileña Foundation.

This project is part of the UOC's research mission on Planetary Health and Well-being and supports UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

Doctors have found that metformin, an everyday medicine for diabetes, is associated with less progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the commonest cause of blindness in western countries.

People with diabetes over the age of 55 years taking metformin were 37% less likely to develop the intermediate stage of AMD over a five year period compared to those not taking metformin.

AMD is a disease which affects the central retina or macular at the back of the eye. It eventually causes the light-sensitive tissue to die off (geographic atrophy, a form of 'dry' AMD) or be damaged by abnormal blood vessel growth ('wet' AMD). Intermediate and advanced AMD affects 10-15% of people over 65 years of age (1.1 to 1.8 million people in the UK), and is the commonest cause of blindness in high-income countries.

The annual cost of AMD is estimated to be £11.1billion in the UK. Geographic atrophy has no treatment in the UK and Europe, while treatments for wet AMD are expensive and unpleasant (repeated injections into the eye).

The research from the University of Liverpool used pictures taken of the eyes of 2,000 people attending the routine diabetic eye disease screening programme in Liverpool over 5 years. The researchers assessed whether AMD was present on the photographs and how severe it was, and then compared those taking metformin and those who were not. They also adjusted for factors which might bias the result such as age, sex, and duration of diabetes. The odds of developing intermediate AMD over 5 years in the metformin group was 0.63 compared to the no metformin group (95% confidence range 0.43 to 0.92).

A potential benefit from metformin in AMD has been suspected before, but this is the first study to grade AMD from eye photographs. Previous studies on metformin have used secondary information on AMD such as GP diagnostic codes, or insurance claims in the US.

Dr. Nick Beare, an eye doctor who led this research, says: "Most people who suffer from AMD have no treatment, so this is a great breakthrough in our search for new treatments. What we need to do now is test metformin as a treatment for AMD in a clinical trial. Metformin has the potential to save many people's sight."

The loss of social connectedness as people age increases the odds of cognitive-related disorders and can worsen health outcomes in older populations. But is there a direct relationship between social behavior and cognition? Subhadeep Dutta Gupta, Peter Rapp, and colleagues, from the National Institute on Aging, developed a rat model to probe social cognition in the aging brain. 

As presented in their eNeuro paper, the researchers used 169 young and aged male rats to discover that while older rats were as social as younger ones, a subpopulation largely favored familiar peers over new ones. This preference was unrelated to differences in spatial memory, anxiety-like behavior, or motor abilities. Notably, smelling ability, which is important for social interaction in rodents, was also unrelated to peer preferences. Altering how neurons talk to each other using a noninvasive technique reversed social preferences in older rats, enhancing their approach towards new peers. 

According to the researchers, these findings suggest that aging may influence social behavior through a distinct, potentially modifiable neural system that is at least partly separate from mechanisms underlying age-related spatial memory decline. The researchers emphasize that their preclinical work provides not only a good tool to understand how the brain ages through a "social" lens, but also valuable insight into approaches for maintaining healthy aging. Future work will focus on assessing social networks in the brain as older rats interact with peers to unveil what neural mechanisms support different social behaviors, which could inform treatment interventions early on in the aging process.

New study shows how bacteria adapted a virus-derived injection system to recognize and attach to many different types of cells. By systematically identifying thousands of rapidly evolving receptor-binding proteins, the researchers explain how these systems can be retargeted again and again in nature by swapping the part that binds to cells. The work not only solves a long-standing mystery about how these bacterial machines function, but also demonstrates that they can be engineered to deliver proteins into specific human cells, pointing to future biomedical and biotechnological applications.

Viruses attack nearly every living organism on Earth. To do so, they rely on highly specialized proteins that recognize and bind to receptors on the surface of target cells, a molecular arms race that drives constant evolution.Now, a new study published in Nature Communications, led by Prof. Asaf Levy of the Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environment at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, reveals just how far this evolutionary creativity can go.Working over several years, doctoral researcher Nimrod Nachmias, together with collaborators Zhiren Wang and Xiao Feng from Prof. Peng Jiang's laboratory at the NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens in Beijing, uncovered a vast and previously hidden repertoire of receptor-binding proteins used by bacteria, many of them borrowed from viruses, plants, fungi, and even animals.

At the center of the discovery are extracellular contractile injection systems (eCISs), sophisticated, virus-like molecular machines derived from bacteriophage tails. While viruses use these structures to infect cells, many bacteria have repurposed them as toxin delivery devices, deploying them against competing host organisms such as insects, and likely against competing microbes."eCISs look like viral weapons, but they are now fully integrated into bacterial life," the researchers explain. "They are used in ecological battles we are only beginning to understand. It's amazing to observe how a virus (bacteriophage) injecting its DNA into specific bacteria evolved into a bacterial tools injecting protein toxins into large diversity of host cells".

For years, researchers have suspected that eCISs rely on specialized receptor-binding proteins, equivalent to viral spike proteins, to recognize their targets. But identifying these proteins proved extraordinarily difficult. Like the coronavirus spike protein, these receptor-binding protein domains, which are called tail fiber proteins, evolve extremely rapidly, constantly changing shape to keep up with their targets in what is defined as a molecular arms race. Traditional search methods repeatedly failed to detect them.To overcome this, the team developed a new computational algorithm capable of identifying these elusive genes across thousands of genomes.The result was striking.The researchers identified 3,445 eCIS tail fiber proteins encoded within 2,585 eCIS gene operons across 1,069 bacterial and archaeal species, the most comprehensive catalogue of its kind.

The study revealed that eCIS tail fibers are built from two distinct parts: 

Using structure prediction tools, the team classified these proteins 1,177 distinct domain fold families, many of which are predicted to bind sugars and proteins on the surface of bacterial or eukaryotic cells.Remarkably, genetic evidence suggests that many of these domains were acquired through horizontal gene transfer - not only from other bacteria and viruses, but also from plants, fungi, and components of animal immune systems. Horizontal gene transfer is a common phenomenon in bacteria. However, such a frequent gene acquisition from so many diverse eukaryotes, into one specific gene (the tail fiber gene of different microbes), is rare in nature."This is accelerated evolution on steroids," the researchers say. "Bacteria are essentially sampling the biological world for useful binding tools and repurposing them."

To test whether these findings had real-world implications, the researchers selected a candidate tail fiber from a Paenibacillus eCIS that resembles hemagglutinin, a receptor-binding protein best known from influenza and measles viruses. Namely, they speculated that it can bind to human cells.They engineered a chimeric eCIS particle, equipping it with this newly identified fiber, and showed that it could bind to and inject proteins into human THP-1 monocyte-like cells, while sparing other cell types.Further experiments suggested that D-mannose, a sugar found on human cell surfaces, may act as a key receptor, partially blocking binding when added externally.Electron microscopy images captured virus-like particles attaching to human cells moments before delivering their molecular payload.

While the team emphasizes that other groups, including several startups, are also exploring engineered eCIS systems, the scale of this discovery dramatically expands the toolkit available for future applications. This work uncovers thousands of naturally evolved receptor-binding proteins, and these could eventually be harnessed to deliver drugs, enzymes, or other therapeutic molecules into specific cell types.

Beyond its technological promise, the study opens fundamental biological questions."We still know very little about what many of these systems do in nature," the researchers add. "Which cells do they target? Under what conditions are they deployed? This catalogue gives us, for the first time, a map to start answering those questions."By revealing the extraordinary diversity of receptor-binding domains hidden within bacterial genomes, the Hebrew University-led research highlights how ancient viral machinery continues to shape life and how nature's solutions may inspire the next generation of biomedical tools.

In a comprehensive pharmacovigilance analysis, topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) were not associated with a statistically significant lymphoma safety signal in patients with atopic dermatitis when robust Bayesian methods were applied.

“While gold standard experimentation methods such as randomized controlled trials are required to confidently disbar the TCI-lymphoma association, this study may help provide reassurance to concerned clinicians in light of related mounting evidence supporting TCI safety,” the study authors wrote. Recent studies, they noted, have “also supported a lack of lymphomagenic potential associated with TCIs.”

The study was led by Domenico Arcuri, MD, PharmD, McGill University and St. Mary's Hospital, Montreal, Québec, Canada, and was published online on January 27 in JAAD International.

The analysis was limited by the impact of drug-drug interactions on adverse drug reaction genesis, potential duplicate reports, and reporting bias.

The study did not receive any funding. The authors did not declare any conflicts of interest.

Former U.S. men's national team striker Herculez Gomez has hit out at Mauricio Pochettino for his recent comments on World Cup ticket prices.

During a call with media last week, USMNT head coach Pochettino said that Tim Weah was wrong for his recent criticism of 2026 World Cup ticket prices.

"It is too expensive," the USMNT forward told French outlet Le Dauphiné. "Football should still be enjoyed by everyone. It is the most popular sport. This World Cup will be good, but it will be more of a show."

For Pochettino, Weah's comments were an unnecessary distraction from on-field matters.

"First of all, I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside of the (pitch)," Pochettino said. "It is not [Weah's] duty to evaluate the price of the ticket. And then also my duty is to prepare the team, the U.S. men's national team, in the best way to perform.

"We are not politicians. We are sport people that only we can talk about our job. And I think if FIFA does something or takes some decision, they know why, and it is their responsibility to explain why. But it's not up to us to provide our opinion."

Pochettino's comments didn't go down well with Gomez and his fellow ESPN analyst, former Trinidad and Tobago goalkeeper Shaka Hislop.

"It's the U.S. men's national team, the country, whats it's supposed to represent, land of the free, home of the brave. Except right now [Pochettino] is saying, 'You don't get the free speech,'" Gomez said on Futbol Americas.

"And he's equating [Weah's comments] to a political statement, which it is not. Timothy Weah expressed what many global citizens today have been expressing, that this World Cup has turned corporate, that ... it is no longer the game of the people. It's the game of the rich. Thousands of dollars for single gameday tickets to the World Cup.

"And here is one of the few players on your team with World Cup experience — that has scored a goal in a World Cup — voicing their opinion how they'd like their people, their fans in general, people of all races, colors, to enjoy the game — and you're saying, 'Shut up and dribble.'"

Hislop ehoed Gomez's words, calling Pochettino "tone deaf" for his remarks.

"It couldn't be more tone deaf," Hislop said. "This is harkening back to 60 or 70 years ago. It's beyond belief that in 2026 we have somebody like Mauricio Pochettino, given the position he holds in this country with its history of activism, of athlete activism, in this moment making this statement."

Pochettino made similar comments last year when the USMNT was facing Panama while U.S. President Donald Trump was openly discussing his desire to take back the Panama Canal.

"I think it's big mistake if we talk about politics because I think people are not waiting us to talk in this way," the coach said.

"That doesn't mean that I am not strong and I have my values and my vision about the situation, but I think being respectful and being a very clear and a strong guy is ... to say nothing and to be focused only to help players who perform and try to win."

N'Golo Kante reportedly refused to turn up for training with Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad on Tuesday after a move to Turkish giants Fenerbahce collapsed. The France international was set to fly to Istanbul to wrap up the transfer, but an administrative error from Al-Ittihad apparently stopped the deal from going through. There is still a chance of the transfer being completed, with Turkiye's transfer window not closing until Friday, February 6.

Kante was among the first group of high-profile players to move from Europe to the lucrative Saudi Pro League, joining Al-Ittihad in 2023 after seven-year spell with Chelsea came to an end. He has been a regular for the Jeddah-based side ever since, helping them win the 2024-25 league title as well as that season's Kings Cup.

However, it was revealed midway through the January transfer window that the former Leicester City star was being eyed by Fenerbahce, who were keen to add the World Cup winner to their ranks. 

A deal which would have seen Moroccan striker Youssef En-Nesyri move to Saudi Arabia appeared to have been agreed, but it emerged on deadline day that an error from Al-Ittihad in the Transfer Matching System would prevent the transfer from being completed.

Fenerbahce were furious and placed the blame squarely on Al-Ittihad, saying in a statement: "The transfer process involving N'Golo Kanté and Youssef En-Nesyri with Al-Ittihad Club was carried out meticulously in all aspects and as planned by our club.

"Following the requests of our technical staff, agreements were reached with the players; medical examinations were completed, necessary approvals were obtained, and our club fulfilled all its obligations within the specified timeframe. The transfer registration documents were uploaded to the system correctly and completely within the specified period. 

"However, due to the incorrect entry of the relevant TMS information by the other club, the process could not be completed within the transfer registration period, independently of our club. Accordingly, an extension was requested, necessary discussions were held with FIFA by our club, and all steps were taken to resolve the process. 

"Despite this, the other club has not completed the process without providing any justification. As a result of these developments, the transfer process has unfortunately not been finalised. We understand and share the disappointment this has caused within our community. 

"Our club continues its squad restructuring with the same determination and discipline in line with its sporting goals." 

Now, according to Ben Jacobs, Kante has refused to report for training with Al-Ittihad on Tuesday and still hopes that the transfer can be completed. He may get his wish, with Santi Aouna reporting that talks between the teams are set to resume.

L'Equipe add that Kante does not want to play for his current employers while he awaits a decision from FIFA over the failed move. Turkiye's transfer window does not close until Friday, which means there is still a chance for the administrative errors to be corrected and for Kante to get his move. En-Nesyri would not be able to head in the opposite direction, however.

The France legend's desired exit comes at a poor time for Al-Ittihad, who can't sign any players as their transfer window has now closed. Karim Benzema left on Monday, completing a shock transfer to Pro League rivals Al-Hilal, meaning the defending champions are in a poor state for the second half of the season. They have also failed to sign Gustavo Sa, a 21-year-old attacking midfielder currently plying his trade for Familicao in the Portuguese Primeira Liga.

Al-Ittihad won the 2024-25 league title but are down in seventh after 19 games this time around, training current leaders Al-Hilal by 13 points. They are currently enjoying a three-game unbeaten streak, however, most recently beating Al-Najma 1-0 on Sunday thanks to a goal from Mahamadou Doumbia. Both Kante and Benzema were absent from the squad for that game.

MANCHESTER, England — Pep Guardiola poked fun at Manchester City's critics on Tuesday, saying he was unhappy with the club's spending despite splashing out a reported $115 million on signings during the January transfer window. 

City was the biggest spender in the midseason window for the second year running following the signings of Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi. It has spent more than $500 million over the past 12 months and dominated English soccer with its exorbitant transfer dealings since being bought by the ruling family of Abu Dhabi in 2008. 

That has led to criticism over its spending power, but manager Guardiola pointed out that six of City's Premier League rivals had a higher net spend in recent years and put pressure on them to emulate his team's success. 

“I'm a little bit sad and upset because in net spend the last five years we are seventh in the Premier League," he joked. "I want to be the first, I don't understand why the club don't spend more money. I am a little bit grumpy with them.

“But, like we won in the past because we spent a lot, now six teams have to win the Premier Leagues, Champions Leagues and FA Cups because they spent more in the last five years."

According to figures on the stats website Transfermarkt, City's net spend over the past five years was $543 million. 

Manchester United is top with $925 million, followed by Arsenal ($908 million), Chelsea ($892 million), Tottenham ($786 million), Newcastle ($581 million) and Liverpool ($575 million).

Since the 2021-22 season City has won three league titles, the Champions League, FIFA Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup and the FA Cup. That period included the treble of the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup in 2023. 

Liverpool has won three trophies in that spell, including the title last year. Man United has won two domestic cups, while Tottenham won the Europa League and Newcastle won the English League Cup last season. Arsenal has won no trophies, but leads the Premier League this term. 

“Good luck to the six teams who are in front of us for net spend for the last five years. Let's go. I'm waiting,” said Guardiola, who has landed 15 major trophies since taking over in 2016. 

City is still in contention for a clean sweep of trophies this season and Guardiola was speaking ahead of the League Cup semifinal second leg against holder Newcastle on Wednesday.

His team leads 2-0 after the first leg and can win the trophy for a fifth time under Guardiola.

In spite of efforts to protect buyers from the perils of the resale market, the confusion of the process, coupled with sheer demand, has ultimately prevented devoted fans from getting tickets.





Javier Ochoa first saw Mexico's national soccer team play when he was a college student in North Carolina in 2009. He was hooked. That started a lifelong obsession for Ochoa, a Los Angeles resident with deep roots in Mexico.

But with the game coming to Mexico this summer on its biggest stage — the 2026 World Cup — Ochoa is resigning himself to the fact he may not be able to attend a game.

As with previous World Cups, FIFA is using a series of random draws through which fans can apply for tickets. The organization has said its methods prevent the influence of the resale market, maintain legitimacy of the tickets, and ensure revenue can be returned back to federations. But the confusion of the process, coupled with sheer demand, has ultimately prevented devoted fans like Ochoa from getting tickets.

The prevalence of the U.S. resale market — a factor that wasn't as relevant in Qatar, Russia, or Brazil in the last three tournaments – meant FIFA used variable pricing, with ticket costs changing based on demand, said Jhamie Chin, FIFA senior media relations officer. Variable pricing is often associated with price gouging, but in this case, was used in an attempt to keep prices relatively down to earth. That's a new model for this World Cup.

“If we had flat pricing that was very low, folks would scoop those tickets up and then charge them for 10 times on the resale market,” Chin said.

If fans were not successfully able to purchase tickets through the random draws, FIFA has said that remaining inventory will be sold closer to the tournament. Those fans can also browse FIFA's resale and exchange marketplace for tickets that have been listed by those applicants who were successful.

But those tickets, even on the official resale marketplace, are being listed at massively inflated prices. For the U.S. team's first game at the tournament — June 12 in LA against Paraguay — the cheapest ticket is listed at more than $1,300. 

For the final, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the lowest price for a ticket is nearly $10,000 on the marketplace. The highest price is around $230,000.

Chin said using FIFA's resale platform is the only way to ensure tickets are legitimate. Third party resale platforms like StubHub or TicketMaster began listing World Cup tickets as early as 2024, before tickets were even initially sold. Those were instances of “speculative selling,” Chin said, where resellers list tickets in hopes a consumer would opt to pay their often exorbitant prices before FIFA set their official pricing for tickets.

“That's definitely still an option for folks, but we've just been advising everyone to basically say that our platform is the only one that you can fully trust,” Chin said.

Effectively, FIFA has absorbed the resale market in an effort to protect fans. But members of supporters groups like Ochoa — who, with Ivan Toribio, runs the 200-member-strong L.A. branch of Pancho Villa's Army, a collective of U.S. residents who support the Mexican national team — say the outcome is the same. True fans are still being priced out.

“Some people are pretty frustrated,” Toribio said. “But I'm not complaining because I don't have a solution for the problem. I don't know how I would get the people who really want to be there to that game.”

Luck of the draw

Nearly a million tickets were available and sold in two random selection draws throughout the fall, Chin said. An initial draw was open from Sept. 10-19, available only for holders of qualifying Visa cards, and a second from Oct. 27-31. A third phase, which ran from Dec. 11 to Jan. 13,  has seen more than 500 million users submit applications, he said. That's a higher demand than in any previous World Cup, driving prices ever higher.

Around 8% of the ticketing allotment was also distributed to federations for each game they play. In U.S. Soccer's case, those tickets were set aside for “eligible insiders” during each of FIFA's three draws. 

Whitney Zalewski, operations manager for American Outlaws — one of the largest supporters groups for the U.S. Men's National Team with tens of thousands of members — said those tickets started at $60. But there weren't enough of those tickets available, nor was the process intuitive enough, she said. Applicants still had to enter the standard draws, meaning they had to commit to spending more money if they weren't selected for the insiders' tickets. 

“That turned a lot of people away,” she said. 

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has maintained that 90% of ticket revenue will be reinvested into boosting global development in each of the World Cup's participating federations. Chin said that FIFA's efforts to replace the secondary market had that commitment in mind.

There's a good chunk, 50% or maybe slightly less, that would not operate without funding from FIFA,” he said. “Think about smaller nations… That money is going back to football as opposed to going to scalpers.”

And while Zalewski agreed with that sentiment, and that of reducing the possibility of resellers taking advantage of desperate fans, she described some of the process as a “complete mess.”

“If that's their true intention, we always want to deter from that,” she said. “But it's hard to explain to someone who's been a member for a really long time that some random person with a Visa card got to potentially get tickets before them, because FIFA decided to do that drawing first.”

But just like Ochoa, Zalewski said supporters' groups will “deal with the cards they've been dealt.”

For the American Outlaws, that means attending the USMNT's send-off matches throughout this spring — with supporters' section tickets capped at $45 through an agreement with U.S. Soccer. 

Those who can't attend the games themselves plan to organize massive watch parties and events. Ochoa will be in Mexico City “no matter what,” and anticipates many of his friends with Pancho Villa's Army will join him. 

“I want to be realistic, but I do still have hope,” Ochoa said. “But regardless of whether I get selected to buy tickets, I'm still going to Mexico City, I'm still going to Guadalajara.”

Those events will be the substitute for these fans' World Cup experiences. And while it's not the same as being in the stadium to see their country play in their own backyard, supporters' groups realize it may be the unfortunate reality of the largest sporting event in the world.

“This World Cup is so inaccessible to so many that there's going to be some really cool community things happening,” Zalewski said.

Javier Ochoa first saw Mexico's national soccer team play when he was a college student in North Carolina in 2009. He was hooked. That started a lifelong obsession for Ochoa, a Los Angeles resident with deep roots in Mexico.

But with the game coming to Mexico this summer on its biggest stage — the 2026 World Cup — Ochoa is resigning himself to the fact he may not be able to attend a game.

As with previous World Cups, FIFA is using a series of random draws through which fans can apply for tickets. The organization has said its methods prevent the influence of the resale market, maintain legitimacy of the tickets, and ensure revenue can be returned back to federations. But the confusion of the process, coupled with sheer demand, has ultimately prevented devoted fans like Ochoa from getting tickets.

The prevalence of the U.S. resale market — a factor that wasn't as relevant in Qatar, Russia, or Brazil in the last three tournaments – meant FIFA used variable pricing, with ticket costs changing based on demand, said Jhamie Chin, FIFA senior media relations officer. Variable pricing is often associated with price gouging, but in this case, was used in an attempt to keep prices relatively down to earth. That's a new model for this World Cup.

“If we had flat pricing that was very low, folks would scoop those tickets up and then charge them for 10 times on the resale market,” Chin said.

If fans were not successfully able to purchase tickets through the random draws, FIFA has said that remaining inventory will be sold closer to the tournament. Those fans can also browse FIFA's resale and exchange marketplace for tickets that have been listed by those applicants who were successful.

But those tickets, even on the official resale marketplace, are being listed at massively inflated prices. For the U.S. team's first game at the tournament — June 12 in LA against Paraguay — the cheapest ticket is listed at more than $1,300. 

For the final, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the lowest price for a ticket is nearly $10,000 on the marketplace. The highest price is around $230,000.

Chin said using FIFA's resale platform is the only way to ensure tickets are legitimate. Third party resale platforms like StubHub or TicketMaster began listing World Cup tickets as early as 2024, before tickets were even initially sold. Those were instances of “speculative selling,” Chin said, where resellers list tickets in hopes a consumer would opt to pay their often exorbitant prices before FIFA set their official pricing for tickets.

“That's definitely still an option for folks, but we've just been advising everyone to basically say that our platform is the only one that you can fully trust,” Chin said.

Effectively, FIFA has absorbed the resale market in an effort to protect fans. But members of supporters groups like Ochoa — who, with Ivan Toribio, runs the 200-member-strong L.A. branch of Pancho Villa's Army, a collective of U.S. residents who support the Mexican national team — say the outcome is the same. True fans are still being priced out.

“Some people are pretty frustrated,” Toribio said. “But I'm not complaining because I don't have a solution for the problem. I don't know how I would get the people who really want to be there to that game.”

Luck of the draw

Nearly a million tickets were available and sold in two random selection draws throughout the fall, Chin said. An initial draw was open from Sept. 10-19, available only for holders of qualifying Visa cards, and a second from Oct. 27-31. A third phase, which ran from Dec. 11 to Jan. 13,  has seen more than 500 million users submit applications, he said. That's a higher demand than in any previous World Cup, driving prices ever higher.

Around 8% of the ticketing allotment was also distributed to federations for each game they play. In U.S. Soccer's case, those tickets were set aside for “eligible insiders” during each of FIFA's three draws. 

Whitney Zalewski, operations manager for American Outlaws — one of the largest supporters groups for the U.S. Men's National Team with tens of thousands of members — said those tickets started at $60. But there weren't enough of those tickets available, nor was the process intuitive enough, she said. Applicants still had to enter the standard draws, meaning they had to commit to spending more money if they weren't selected for the insiders' tickets. 

“That turned a lot of people away,” she said. 

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has maintained that 90% of ticket revenue will be reinvested into boosting global development in each of the World Cup's participating federations. Chin said that FIFA's efforts to replace the secondary market had that commitment in mind.

There's a good chunk, 50% or maybe slightly less, that would not operate without funding from FIFA,” he said. “Think about smaller nations… That money is going back to football as opposed to going to scalpers.”

And while Zalewski agreed with that sentiment, and that of reducing the possibility of resellers taking advantage of desperate fans, she described some of the process as a “complete mess.”

“If that's their true intention, we always want to deter from that,” she said. “But it's hard to explain to someone who's been a member for a really long time that some random person with a Visa card got to potentially get tickets before them, because FIFA decided to do that drawing first.”

But just like Ochoa, Zalewski said supporters' groups will “deal with the cards they've been dealt.”

For the American Outlaws, that means attending the USMNT's send-off matches throughout this spring — with supporters' section tickets capped at $45 through an agreement with U.S. Soccer. 

Those who can't attend the games themselves plan to organize massive watch parties and events. Ochoa will be in Mexico City “no matter what,” and anticipates many of his friends with Pancho Villa's Army will join him. 

“I want to be realistic, but I do still have hope,” Ochoa said. “But regardless of whether I get selected to buy tickets, I'm still going to Mexico City, I'm still going to Guadalajara.”

Those events will be the substitute for these fans' World Cup experiences. And while it's not the same as being in the stadium to see their country play in their own backyard, supporters' groups realize it may be the unfortunate reality of the largest sporting event in the world.

“This World Cup is so inaccessible to so many that there's going to be some really cool community things happening,” Zalewski said.

Weston McKennie has once again made himself into a vital piece for Mauricio Pochettino and the USMNT.

For the United States Men's National Team to turn heads at this summer's World Cup and fulfill its true potential, their best players will need to lead the way and rise to the occasion.  One of those “best players” is Juventus midfielder, Weston McKennie.

McKennie, a USMNT mainstay for the past 8 years, is assumed to be one of the core players on the yet-to-be-announced 2026 World Cup squad.  But after receiving just one national team call-up over the last 10 months, there were some questions as to how integral the 27-year-old was to Mauricio Pochettino's plans moving forward.

“The questions were real, by the way,” said Tim Howard on the most recent edition of Unfiltered Soccer regarding McKennie's status with the team.  “The questions were, where is he?  Give me the top ten best national teams in the world and give me their top two players. They're there every single time I'm asking.”



McKennie appeared in the Concacaf Nations League semifinal and third place match in March of 2025 but then did not appear for the U.S. again until their October friendlies against Ecuador and Australia.  At that point, it was widely believed that McKennie would be back in the team for good, but eyebrows were raised when he was then omitted from the November squad.

If this was meant to serve as a wakeup call or warning to the American star, it seems to have worked.  McKennie has scored 4 times in his last 8 matches for Juventus, and he has been vital to their rise up the table in Italy's Serie A.

“It's weird to say this now, but there has been a time where we were kind of not sure if Wes was even going to be in the mix with the national team,” said Howard's co-host and former USMNT teammate Landon Donovan.  “But now you're saying, how do you leave him off the field?”

“His talent has never been in question,” noted Howard.  “It's whether he aligns with the manager. It's a maturation process.”

All eyes will be fixed on the USMNT's next squad announcement for their March friendlies against global powerhouses Belgium and Portugal.  It is assumed that McKennie has played his way back into the fold and if he has and if his club form translates to his national team form, the ceiling for the U.S. team could be very high.

“This team can do some special things,” said Howard with Donovan then interjecting “that's why people get excited.

“He's playing at Juve, a top four team in Italy, and is probably the best player in the league over the last couple of months. Christian [Pulisic] has been the best player in the league for a few years. This is real stuff. We didn't do this in the past.”

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup just months away, a collection of USMNT stars and rising talents have continued to perform for their clubs overseas. Malik Tillman enjoyed a special, three-goal week for Bayer 04 Leverkusen, while midfield partner Weston McKennie extended his form with a match-winning goal for Juventus FC.

Elsewhere, Auston Trusty and Patrick Agyemang delivered clutch goals for their sides, Folarin Balogun tallied a match-deciding assist, and several other players earned key minutes in high-stakes UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League fixtures.

Tillman produced a match-winning, first-half brace to power Bayer 04 Leverkusen to a 3-0 victory against Villarreal CF in the UEFA Champions League, confirming Leverkusen's place in the knockout round.

Tillman was already the only United States international to score multiple goals in a single Champions League fixture, previously notching a brace for PSV Eindhoven in a 3-2 victory against FC Shakhtar Donetsk in 2024. Tillman's brace last week was his first for club or country since he scored twice for the USMNT in a 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup match against Trinidad and Tobago.

Returning to league play on Saturday, Tillman again bagged the winning goal, helping Leverkusen to a 3-1 road victory against Eintracht Frankfurt and helping his side remain at sixth in the table.

After scoring in each of his last three UEFA Champions League appearances for Juventus FC, McKennie kicked off the week by going 90 minutes in a scoreless draw against USMNT teammate Folarin Balogun's AS Monaco FC in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday.

The 27-year-old got back to his scoring ways in Serie A, though, as McKennie sealed Juventus' 4-1 road victory against Parma Calcio 1913 with a 37th-minute winner on Sunday.

The second-year Celtic FC man has now scored in back-to-back UEFA Europa League matches for the defending Scottish Premiership champions, scoring the final goal of Celtic's 4-2 victory against FC Utrecht on Thursday.

Now one goal shy of recording the third double-digit scoring season of his young professional career, Agyemang tallied his ninth goal of the season in Derby County FC's 5-0 thrashing of Bristol City FC in EFL Championship play on Friday—the club's largest road win since the the 1959/60 campaign. The 25-year-old East Hartford, Conn. native has scored or assisted in each of Derby County's last four league fixtures, extending the Rams' unbeaten streak to four as they inch closer to a spot in the promotion playoffs.

Inter Miami co-owner Sir David Beckham is being billed as “the one” to make a union between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo possible. Two all-time greats have competed against one another down the years, but have never graced the same team. That ultimate pact may yet happen, with CR7 seeing a move to MLS mooted on the back of his strike action at Al-Nassr.

Portuguese superstar Ronaldo is cutting a frustrated figure in the Saudi Pro League. He is reportedly disappointed at how that division is being managed, with transfer funds not being distributed evenly. He has taken to ruling himself out of contention for selection.

Inevitable questions are being asked of what happens next, with plenty of speculation to be found regarding a new challenge supposedly being sought by CR7. The ex-Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus forward has seen a return to Europe debated.

It has also been suggested that he could join Messi in chasing the American dream. If that path were to be trodden, then Beckham and Co at Inter Miami would undoubtedly be in the mix. There are several hurdles that need to be cleared before such a dream could become reality, with doubt still being cast over whether two GOATs will ever join forces.

Quizzed on whether that could happen, with ex-England captain Beckham involved, former MLS star Rob Earnshaw - speaking via bookmaker Betfree - told GOAL: “If there was a place that could happen, it would be somewhere like Inter Miami. Unfortunately, I don't think it will ever happen. All of the fanatics, we would love to see them play in a team one day and work together before they both retire. I don't think it will happen but if there was a chance, I think David Beckham would be the one to make that happen.”

Earnshaw - who spent time in North America with Toronto FC, the Chicago Fire and Vancouver Whitecaps - added on why Ronaldo may be reluctant to join Messi in South Florida: “You have these two great football players that are global figures, very famous, great footballers - I can't see it ever happening because you have two dominant figures that wherever they play, whatever team, it is their team.

“It might have to be a neutral team because if Ronaldo is going to go to Inter Miami, that is Messi's team, we know it as that, and I don't think that will happen. Same thing the other way around. If it was ever going to happen, it would have to be in a neutral team that they have both never played for and they are coming together. I hope we see it one day.

“Rewind back, they used to have Rest of the World vs Europe. I remember a Brazil vs Barcelona game, there was the Rest of the World team versus a team from Europe that used to get together. That might be the only way that we see these two come together in one team.”

Another former MLS and Premier League star, World Cup-winning ex-Brazil and Manchester United midfielder Kleberson, told GOAL recently when he was asked about the chances of Ronaldo following Messi to the United States: “Wow, imagine that happening, America is going to go crazy! They are going to sell everything to have those two guys together. In one locker room - Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and maybe Neymar. It's a dream team!”

Ronaldo is working on the most lucrative contract in world football at Al-Nassr, with an extension agreed last summer through to 2027 only a matter of months old. It could, however, be that said deal is broken as the 40-year-old frontman is freed to make another fresh start outside of the Middle East.

Messi will be patiently waiting in Miami if his eternal rival decides to join him in the U.S. as the Argentine icon has committed to an extension of his own that is set to keep him tied to the reigning MLS Cup champions through 2028.

Barcelona icon Andres Iniesta has tipped teenage sensation Lamine Yamal to reach the very pinnacle of world football, insisting the winger possesses the natural ability required to become an all-time great. The legendary midfielder also offered fascinating insight into his future, revealing his plans to return to the dugout soon as he completes his coaching badges in Dubai.

In the pantheon of Barcelona greats, few voices carry as much weight as Iniesta's. As the Catalan giants lead the charge for the Spanish league title, Yamal has firmly established himself as the face of the club's new era, shouldering a level of expectation that would crush most experienced professionals, let alone a teenager. The Masia graduate has become the team's creative hub, dazzling the Camp Nou faithful with a blend of audacity and technical precision that has drawn inevitable comparisons to the legends of the past.

While pundits and fans have been quick to crown him the next global superstar, validation from within the club's inner sanctum is often the most telling metric of a player's trajectory. Iniesta, who defined an era of dominance alongside Xavi and Lionel Messi, has been watching from afar as the 18-year-old continues to shatter records and defy logic. The World Cup winner believes that Yamal is not just a fleeting talent but a generational force who has the potential to etch his name alongside the very best to have ever played the game, provided he maintains his hunger and discipline.

Speaking while completing his coaching qualifications in Dubai, Iniesta did not hold back in his assessment of the Ballon d'Or runner-up. He highlighted the unique "naturalness" with which Yamal plays, but warned that the challenge now lies in consistency and annual growth.

When asked about the teenager's ceiling, Iniesta was unequivocal: "Lamine Yamal's challenge is to keep growing every year. He plays with incredible naturalness, and it is in his hands to become one of the greatest if he keeps pushing himself."

While his eyes remain fixed on his former club, Iniesta is also busy plotting his own next chapter. The 41-year-old is currently in the final stages of obtaining his Pro license, a process he is undertaking in Asia before launching his managerial career. He revealed that the transition from pitch to touchline has fundamentally shifted his perspective on the sport.

"My idea is to start coaching soon. I am missing the Pro license, which I am completing here in Asia," Iniesta explained. "As a coach, you start watching football differently, with a different perspective. The ball still attracts you, but today there are very few secrets. What matters now is preparing myself in the best possible way."

He elaborated on his philosophy, noting that while having a clear identity is crucial, a modern manager must be pragmatic. "When you start coaching, you first need to know the players you have and what they can give you. You must have a clear idea of how you want to play, but also the mentality to adapt to the situation."

The interview also touched upon another midfield jewel, Pedri. Often cited as Iniesta's spiritual successor, the Canary Islander has become the metronome of the Barcelona midfield. 

“Pedri feels very comfortable on the ball and is always involved,” he said. “He can organise the game but also provide imbalance. He is a very complete player with brutal qualities who will keep improving.”

Up next for Barcelona is a Copa del Rey tie against Albacete on Tuesday. It is a fixture that pulls at Iniesta's heartstrings, pitting the club where he became a legend against the boyhood side where it all began.

Despite his allegiance to the Blaugrana, he issued a stern warning to his former team. Albacete famously eliminated Real Madrid in the previous round, proving they are capable of toppling giants. "There are matches you simply cannot miss, and Albacete coming from eliminating Real Madrid is already a warning," Iniesta noted, confirming he would be watching intently from Dubai as Barcelona look to avoid the same fate as their eternal rivals.

Max Arfsten debuted for the U.S. men's national team at left back in January 2025 and has now appeared in 16 games for Coach Mauricio Pochettino. One of Arfsten's five assists came in a 2-0 win over Japan when he faked out Henry Mochizuki and delivered a perfect cross for Alex Zendejas. 

Before that stellar performance, Arfsten started five 2025 Gold Cup games, including a shootout win over Costa Rica in which he scored and assisted in the 2-2 tie. In a 2-1 win over Paraguay, his cross set up Gio Reyna's 4th-minute goal.

In 2025, Arfsten led the USMNT field players in starts (16) and minutes (1,085) — and did so as an outlier in this era of American soccer. Unlike the vast majority of Pochettino's player pool, Arfsten played college soccer before going pro. He never appeared for a U.S. youth national team nor did he play for a pro team's youth academy.

We spoke with Arfsten as he started preseason camp with the Columbus Crew, and after he visited his hometown of Fresno, California, where Arfsten played for the California Odyssey Soccer Club and San Joaquin Memorial High School.

SOCCER AMERICA: Most of your current teammates skipped college to go straight into the pros after playing for pro club youth academies. In your case?MAX ARFSTEN: I was never in an academy. San Jose was too far for my family, and so was L.A., and those were the only two options. So I went the Division I college route.

Women's Soccer

The Football Association (FA) has proposed a raft of significant reforms to the Women's FA Cup including seeding four teams, replacing the draw with a World Cup-style bracket from the last 32 and excluding tier seven clubs from the competition.

Under the proposals, the four seeded teams would be the top-four clubs from the previous Women's Super League (WSL) season, according to multiple sources, who wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships. The seeding would also mean the existing format of a draw to determine fixtures would be replaced by a bracket mapping out a route to the final from the last 32 onwards — the stage WSL clubs enter the competition.

Changes arrive as part of the FA's 2024-28 strategy to review the tournament in order to broaden its appeal and reach, as communicated in email correspondence and meetings with clubs, sources indicated.

The FA's plans have faced fierce pushback from clubs, according to sources from the second tier and below, who said teams made clear their opposition during a consultation process. Additionally, clubs further down the pyramid claim the consultation process was far from exhaustive. 

Any changes could be implemented as early as next season, though final plans have yet been agreed and the FA insists “no decisions have been made at this stage”.

The FA is bidding to make its flagship competition more marketable, particularly in its later stages, sources say.

According to documents disseminated with clubs earlier this week, the FA state the top-four seeding is a “temporary” measure and that the proposals will create the “highest chances of consistent high-quality matches throughout the later rounds” of the Cup.

According to the FA's proposal, a bracket strategy “enables the development of storytelling, and enhanced narrative to the competition. It enables clubs and fans to plot their road to Wembley Stadium, building momentum and excitement, whilst supporting operational planning.”

An FA Spokesperson said: “We committed in our women's and girls' game strategy, Reaching Higher, to review the Adobe Women's FA Cup, recognising the need to evolve the competition and strengthen its commercial potential. This would enable us to reinvest more funding into both the competition itself and the wider women's football ecosystem, which is vital for long-term, sustainable growth.

“While a comprehensive review of the current format has been completed, no decisions have been made at this stage. Any future changes will be shaped in close consultation with stakeholders across the entire pyramid, including clubs, players, fans, and our broadcast and commercial partners.”

The proposals wield an especially profound effect on lower-tier clubs.

As part of the new proposals, tier seven teams would no longer be permitted to compete in the competition. Tier seven consists of multiple amateur, county leagues, and sits six divisions below the WSL and four below the National League.

The consultation process undertaken by the FA has been called into question by lower-tier clubs.

According to numerous clubs in tier seven, the FA hosted meetings in January, one specifically for tier five, six and seven clubs, outlining potential changes to the competition.

The meeting outlined the plans for a bracket-style competition and seeding, with no mention of the impact for teams further down the pyramid. Until specifically asked about the involvement of lower-tier teams unlikely to reach the latter stages of the tournament, sources claim that they were then made aware of a proposed entry cut-off point.

Prior to the January consultation, only one team of 50 in the seventh-tier Greater London Women's Football League (GLWFL) was consulted directly about the proposal to remove seventh-tier sides, according to GLWFL chairman David Baker. When asked specifically about the consultation process by The Athletic, the FA declined to comment.

The suggestion is part of a tabled “entry tier review” for lower-league sides, with the FA citing a need to enhance minimum stadium standards. Tier seven standards across the national level vary greatly. Tier seven systems in London and Manchester, for example, are far more advanced than other areas and have more feeder leagues than elsewhere in the country.

Four tier seven teams reached the first-round proper this season: Leyton Orient, South London Women FC, Maidstone United and Milbrook.

Tier seven clubs in London have expressed frustration at being removed due to the opportunity to develop that the competition provides.

Tier seven clubs currently enter the competition at the preliminary round. This season the winning club would receive £600 with the loser receiving £150. From the first, second and third-round qualifying stages, winning clubs receive £1,800, £3,000 and £4,000 respectively, with the losing clubs receiving £450, £750 and £1,000.

Reaching the first round proper would bring a windfall of £6,000 to the winner and £1,500 to the loser.

Access to these financial streams have the ability to change a club and its future direction, teams argue. There is no current alternative to the FA Cup.

Seventh tier club South London Women FC, an independent women's football club that competes in the Premier Division of the GLWFL, has received more than £20,000 over two seasons for progressing to the first-round proper.

According to correspondence seen by The Athletic, tier seven clubs have told the FA of their concerns that potential exclusion would yield financially. One source likened the removal to the “pulling up of a drawbridge”. Another described a “detrimental impact on the ecosystem of the women's game”, adding the FA Cup “is a fundamental engine for growth, as well as financial support and visibility that allows a grassroots club like ours to thrive.”

Additionally, the entry fee for clubs to compete in the FA Cup has tripled from £25 to £75, a significant sum for clubs further down the pyramid who fear a potential “pricing out” strategy being put in place.

“The FA Cup is not broken for 99 per cent of clubs and the interests of the very few at the top of the game should never override the majority and lifeblood of our game,” said a source.

“The FA has repeatedly committed to expanding the women's football pyramid and ensuring ‘football is for all'. Removing tier seven clubs from the FA Cup feels like a step backwards from this mission,” added another.

While seeding is claimed to be a temporary measure, numerous clubs from WSL2 and further down the pyramid have voiced displeasure with the proposition, claiming that it places the top WSL teams in an even greater advantageous position.

Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City would be the seeded teams this season based on last season's WSL table. Incidentally they are the only clubs to have won the FA Cup since 2012, when Birmingham City, now in WSL2, lifted the trophy.

While seeding is claimed to be a temporary measure, numerous clubs from WSL2 and further down the pyramid have voiced displeasure with the proposition, claiming that it places the top WSL teams in an even greater advantageous position.

Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City would be the seeded teams this season based on last season's WSL table. Incidentally they are the only clubs to have won the FA Cup since 2012, when Birmingham City, now in WSL2, lifted the trophy.

Could we expect something bold for the Morocco strips from PUMA?

Morocco has officially qualified for the  FIFA World Cup 2026 and come into the tournament after losing the 2026 AFCON final against Senegal on home turf. They'll be looking to relinquish their demons and put their best foot forward on the grandest stage of all. While the home and away jerseys have not been officially unveiled, early looks at the away design have started circulating, with a stunning, intricate design element in the mix.

Of course, we expect the national colours of red and green to dominate on the home kit, but could we expect something unique for the away shirt? Ahead of the World Cup kick-off, here's everything you need to know about the Morocco home and away kits, including what they look like, when they launch, and how much they'll cost.

Morocco's home kit hasn't been released yet, but there have been some leaks that give us a sneak peek at what this shirt could possibly look like. The all-red base continues with the traditional home shirt looks, but the details are where it all comes alive.

The collar and sleeve cuffs are decorated with ornate patterns that are reminiscent of traditional tattoos and ancestral patterns. These are green on a white base, which gives these details on the shirt such a striking look. Meanwhile, the club badge is centralised, with a sign-off on the back of the neck finishing off the whole look.

Retail pricing for the PUMA shirts sits around €100 / £85 for standard fan replicas, with authentic match editions and bespoke options climbing higher depending on sizing and retailer. Youth sizes also tend to be available at lower price points. So, we expect to see the same pricing for the Morocco kits.

We also don't have an official release of the Morocco away kit, so we can only tell you what the leaks show. The leaked away design is very similar to the home shirt design, but instead of red, it sits on an all-white base. The sleeve cuffs and collar are once again detailed with fine patterning, is on a block green base. The side panels of the shirt include red and green, which complete the colours from the national flag.

Once official details are announced, pricing for the away kit is expected to mirror the home shirt's structure, with fan replica versions around €100 / £85 and higher-end authentic editions priced accordingly when they land in stores and online.

LA28 announced Tuesday the six U.S. stadiums that will host Olympic soccer group stage games while revealing a plan to have preliminary games move East to West to minimize travel demands. Instead of criss-crossing the country for the group stage games, teams will advance in the tournament and move progressively closer to the knockout rounds held at the Rose Bowl.

The country-wide tournament footprint begins in New York at New York City FC's new Etihad Park, which is scheduled to open in 2027. The venue  in Queens is the first soccer-specific stadium in New York City.

Purpose-built stadiums were the focus of the venue plan, with five of the six stadiums being primarily affiliated with Major League Soccer clubs. The Columbus Crew's ScottsMiracle-Gro Field, Nashville SC's Geodis Park, St. Louis CITY SC's Energizer Park and the San José Earthquakes' PayPal Park were also selected for group games.

Snapdragon Stadium, the shared home of San Diego State football, San Diego FC and San Diego Wave FC, figures to host some of the last group games as it is geographically closest to the Rose Bowl, where final stage games begin on July 24, 2028.

 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics 

The 2028 Olympics will celebrate hosting more female than male athletes by featuring the high profile women's 100-meter final on Day 1 of competition.

“Bringing Olympic Football group stage and knockout matches to stadiums across the United States means more fans will witness this global event and experience the Olympic spirit firsthand,” Shana Ferguson, LA28 chief of sport and Games delivery officer, said in a statement.

Group stage soccer matches are often spread across venues in a country during the Olympics, with a stadium in the host city holding the final games. The Rose Bowl will host the men's gold medal match on July 28, 2028 and the women's tournament ends on July 29.

For the first time, the Olympic soccer tournament will feature more women's teams than men's. The switch to expand the women's field to 16 teams while capping the men's tournament at 12 teams contributed to making the 2028 Games the first female-majority Olympic Games.

LA28 also announced it is working with the International Olympic Committee on an extended competition window that could start preliminary matches before the opening ceremony on July 14, 2028, to allow for increased recovery time between matches.

Schedules and match distribution for each stadium will be announced before the first ticket purchasing window in April 2026. Despite the expanded venue list that brings Olympic competition to six new cities, a presale beginning on April 2 will be limited to locals in Southern California and Oklahoma City, which will host multiple sports including softball.

Argentina are looking to retain their World Cup title over the summer(Image: (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images))

It's been over three years since Lionel Messi and Argentina claimed the World Cup trophy in Qatar after a spectacular final triumph against France. Now, the 2026 tournament is rapidly approaching.

After a winter tournament last time, football's ultimate spectacle returns to the traditional summer months, with the United States, Canada and Mexico serving as hosts, and, for the first time, featuring 48 nations at the finals. That translates to 104 matches spanning just over five weeks in what promises to be an exhilarating treat for supporters worldwide.

As the countdown to kick-off continues, we've challenged our chief football writers to share their selections and offer their predictions for what is being billed as the biggest and boldest FIFA World Cup ever. Can England finally end 60 years of hurt?

Winner: Spain

Final Four: Argentina, Spain, France, England

Dark Horse: Ecuador

Top Scorer: Julian Alvarez

Best Player: Lamine Yamal

Apologies for being so predictable, but I'm backing the four top seeds to reach the semi-finals in the revamped tennis-style draw. I genuinely appreciate the fresh format as it's thrilling to chart the nations and their journey through the rounds... nevertheless, history shows us it seldom - if ever - unfolds as expected.

Yet the top four - Argentina, Spain, France, and England - represent the standout sides in the tournament, in my opinion. And I fancy a heavyweight final following plenty of surprises and compelling narratives in the knock-out stages and group fixtures.

We cannot escape the reality that America is an extremely costly destination, and it's an enormous demand for supporters to travel across three nations with Canada and Mexico as co-hosts. However, it is essential that fans turn out in substantial numbers because their atmosphere, vibrancy and passion is what makes any tournament special.

My experience at the Club World Cup last summer was one of unpredictable weather, blistering heat and also a superbly organised tournament. American supporters pay higher prices for their sporting events and concerts and it's frequently far more than we are accustomed to here.

Yet, England fans to their eternal credit, always find a way and they will travel with genuine hope that Thomas Tuchel can deliver. I believe England are the outsiders in the final four because of the heat and also because the squad is just transitioning in certain areas.

England have a sensational striker in Harry Kane, incredible midfielders with Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham and great wide players, including Bukayo Saka. However, perhaps the defence is not as settled or strong as before. Ezri Konsa is a Tuchel favourite and Marc Guehi is his main man.

Reece James, too. Top players but a big ask. I believe Spain are the best team, they have a player who can own the stage in Lamine Yamal and they are the best of the final four.

Dark Horse: Morocco

Best Player: Lamine Yamal

This will be a World Cup like few others. Scorching temperatures, different time zones and thousands of miles travelling make it a demanding one for all those nations taking part, not to mention supporters planning to go.

Throw in the fact US president Donald Trump will seize the perfect opportunity to feed his obsession with narcissism, and anything could happen. This will be Lionel Messi's final World Cup, and he will be desperate to go back-to-back to cap a truly extraordinary career. He's so brilliant that it would take a foolish person to bet against him going out in a blaze of glory.

And can Lamine Yamal follow up his exploits at Euro 2024 and shine on the biggest stage of all? He has been hailed as Messi's heir apparent, and this is a wonderful chance for him to prove it.

It's difficult to pick a winner, but World Cups are generally won by one of the strongest nations, so it's impossible to look past the likes of Argentina, France and Spain.

Winner: Argentina

Final Four: Spain, France, Argentina, England

Dark Horse: Ecuador

Top Scorer: Harry Kane

Best Player: Lautaro Martinez

Only two teams in World Cup history have won back-to-back tournaments - Italy in 1934 and 1938, and Brazil in 1958 and 1962.

Argentina are one of three teams that have subsequently gone close to retaining a title, suffering a narrow and slightly controversial loss to Germany in 1990 after the Diego Maradona-inspired triumph in 1986. In 2026, they have every chance of doubling up.

Weather conditions won't pose problems; they possess an excellent mix of seasoned professionals and players in their peak years, and despite celebrating his 39th birthday during the competition, you can count on Lionel Messi delivering magical performances.

Lautaro Martinez remains somewhat underappreciated when discussing world-class forwards, and in Lionel Scaloni, they boast a remarkably accomplished international boss with one World Cup and two Copa Americas to his name. He has suffered defeat in just nine of his 92 matches at the helm of La Albiceleste.

I'm remaining in South America for my surprise package. Ecuador - with a midfield built around Moises Caicedo - will prove incredibly tough to overcome, despite appearing somewhat lacking in attacking firepower.

Numerous fixtures at this World Cup could turn into low-scoring, closely-fought encounters, and Ecuador might quietly progress deep into the knockout stages.

England will navigate their path to the final four, and if Harry Kane maintains his current club form, he could very well claim another Golden Boot. However, Thomas Tuchel's team are likely to encounter opposition slightly superior to them in the semi-finals, with Spain and France - who have defeated England at the previous two major tournaments - representing more credible European contenders.

These are probably uninspiring predictions, but I believe Spain's technical excellence and possession-focused approach will exhaust rivals in sweltering conditions. I'd love nothing more than England to go all the way, and I genuinely reckon they can because of the depth and talent in their squad.

Yet my only worry is the additional knockout stage and it's simply another physical and mental obstacle you've got to overcome on the lengthy journey to triumph.

France are always a threat and I wouldn't be surprised if they lifted the trophy, as Kylian Mbappe and Michael Olise possess the ability to damage any team. Senegal are my outsiders but I also reckon the USA will perform brilliantly, especially after seeing them land in a kind group.

My main observation is that I anticipate the players will be shattered at the conclusion of a gruelling season and my worry is the football - partly due to the sweltering conditions - will be short on quality and focus more on dead balls and structure. Substitutes are going to matter more than ever and that should favour England.

Infantino was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship medal by president Vladimir Putin after Russia hosted the 2018 World Cup

Ukraine's sports minister has called Fifa president Gianni Infantino "irresponsible" and "infantile" for saying that world football's governing body will look at lifting a ban on Russia.

Russian national teams and clubs were suspended from all competitions by Fifa and Uefa in February 2022 after the country's invasion of Ukraine.

With the war still going on, Infantino has said "this ban has not achieved anything" and "has just created more frustration and hatred".

He added: "Having girls and boys from Russia being able to play football games in other parts of Europe would help."

In response, Ukraine sports minister Matvii Bidnyi said in a social media post:, external "Gianni Infantino's words sound irresponsible - not to say infantile.  

"They detach football from the reality in which children are being killed.

"Let me remind you that since the start of Russia's full-scale aggression, more than 650 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russians. Among them were more than one hundred footballers."

Why are Russia still playing international football despite ban?

Infantino was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship medal by president Vladimir Putin after Russia hosted the 2018 World Cup.

However, since Russia's ban, they have been unable to compete at the 2022 World Cup and and Uefa's Euro 2024 and the country will not be part of the 2026 World Cup.

Russia has not completely stopped playing international football as they have played matches against non-Western nations without needing the permission of Fifa or Uefa.

"War is a crime, not politics," added Bidnyi. "It is Russia that politicises sport and uses it to justify aggression. 

"I share the position of the Ukrainian Association of Football, which also warns against Russia's return to international competitions.

"As long as Russians continue killing Ukrainians and politicising sport, their flag and national symbols have no place among people who respect values such as justice, integrity and fair play."

Serhii Palkin, chief executive of Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk, said Infantino's comments "represent a complete detachment from reality". 

"It is an attempt to pretend that war and aggression do not exist," he added.

"Football cannot exist outside reality and it has no right to turn a blind eye to evil.

"Such a decision carries responsibility, including responsibility for complicity in the silencing of war crimes."

Shakhtar, 15-time Ukrainian champions, have not played home matches in Donetsk since 2014 due to the war in eastern Donbas.

They have played at several different 'home' venues in the 12 years since, including in Poland and Germany. 

Last year, Ukraine criticised the International Paralympic Committee's (IPC) decision to lift a ban on athletes from Russia and its close ally Belarus.

The Ukrainian National Paralympic Committee said the IPC had allowed Russia and Belarus to "raise their flags, drenched in the blood of hundreds of thousands of people".

Despite the IPC lifting its ban, Russian and Belarusian Para-athletes will not be at next month's Winter Paralympics. 

Although the IPC oversees the Games, there are four separate governing bodies in charge of the six sports taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.

Three of the governing bodies have decided to keep their bans on athletes from the two countries, and although Russia and Belarus are now allowed to compete in ice hockey, the decision came too late for them to take part in qualifying.

Sarr has returned to Chelsea after his loan at Strasbourg was ended Alex Grimm/Getty Images

Speaking to British journalists in impressively fluent English during last summer's Club World Cup, Mamadou Sarr was asked about then-Strasbourg coach Liam Rosenior's public insistence that he has “world-class” potential.

“When I was a kid, I had a dream,” he replied. “It was to be the best centre-back in the world. I trust him (Rosenior), and I trust me.”

It was a response that revealed so much about Sarr, and also sheds light on why Rosenior is so keen to have the 20-year-old at his disposal for the rest of this season at Stamford Bridge. The defender's loan spell at Strasbourg was cancelled on Monday, with Sarr coming back to west London.

Sarr joined Chelsea permanently last summer and was part of the squad for the Club World Cup on the back of a 2024-25 season in which he had established himself as a key contributor for Rosenior, making 27 starts in Ligue 1. His experience in the United States was positive for his development — and his medal collection — but it was clear that Enzo Maresca did not deem him ready for a big role; he played just eight minutes from the substitutes' bench in a comfortable 3-0 group-stage win over ES Tunis.

Returning to Strasbourg and Rosenior last summer was the logical choice, and it gave Sarr six months more seasoning as a regular starter in Ligue 1. But circumstances at Chelsea have now shifted considerably; Rosenior has replaced Maresca, and Levi Colwill, the left-sided centre-back who was principally blocking the Senegal international's path to the starting XI, remains a long-term absentee as he recovers from an ACL injury.

Benoit Badiashile has not managed to seize what appeared to be his best opportunity to establish himself in the heart of Chelsea's defence in Colwill's absence. Rosenior could be seen talking to him several times about his passing out from the back in the first half against West Ham on Saturday. The Frenchman was then substituted at the break.

Wesley Fofana and Trevoh Chalobah are currently Rosenior's favoured centre-back pairing, but neither man is particularly confident with his left foot. While technically also right-footed, Sarr is very comfortable using his left, and that matters because of the additional angles it opens up when Chelsea are attempting to play out of defence, through and around opposition pressure.

During his breakthrough campaign for Strasbourg in 2024-25, Sarr marked himself out as being capable of breaking the opposition lines with passes punched through the middle of the pitch, as well as less risky balls down the left side…



It was a similar story for Sarr in the first half of this Ligue 1 season, with a slight shift towards more passes angled out towards the left touchline…



Sarr is also comfortable defending high up the pitch with space behind him, which should make him a good fit for Rosenior's aggressive man-to-man approach out of possession…



During their time together at Strasbourg, Rosenior encouraged Sarr to be more vocal on the pitch. It is something Sarr has also prioritised in his choice of role models.

“I want to be like Virgil van Dijk,” Sarr said last summer. “He's a leader. For a defender, it's very important to be a leader. I love Van Dijk, but some people tell me I play like Ibrahima Konate. It's very similar.”

Chelsea's desire for a centre-back with this particular blend of qualities was underlined by their exploration of signing Van Dijk as a free agent last summer, before he re-committed to Liverpool. It also manifested in their January pursuit of Rennes starlet Jeremy Jacquet, who ultimately decided on a move to Anfield instead.

There is a world in which recalling Sarr proves to be a better football decision than paying the market rate for Jacquet, as well as being the cheaper option. For starters, he is available to help Chelsea immediately, rather than being acquired as a marquee summer signing six months ahead of time.

Sarr also knows exactly what he is walking into at Cobham. He spent a very productive summer with this Chelsea squad and is particularly familiar with Malo Gusto — a former team-mate at Lyon — and Andrey Santos, who captained his Strasbourg team. Premier League football will be a big step up, but there will be no surprises in what Rosenior wants from him on the pitch.

Competition for minutes in Chelsea's defence in the second half of the season will be fierce, even if Colwill does not return.

Fofana and Chalobah have developed a productive chemistry through regular starts, while Badiashile and Tosin Adarabioyo are seasoned professionals who will expect to be involved when fit. Then there is Josh Acheampong, nine months younger than Sarr, whose lack of opportunities in recent weeks has become a source of growing angst for some in the fanbase.

But if the increased prominence of Santos since Rosenior's arrival is anything to go by, it would not be hugely shocking if Sarr ends up being much more than squad ballast at Chelsea.

FIFA's kicking soccer fans in the wallet again.

The organization is charging as much as $300 for Los Angeles' World Cup matches — even though the spots could be more than a mile away from SoFi Stadium.

FIFA's official World Cup parking website lists prices in the hundreds based on the demand of the matches, with the eye-watering cost of parking eclipsing the price tag of tickets themselves.

A spokesperson tried to defend the astronomical cash-grab.

“Parking prices are determined based on local market conditions and benchmarking against comparable major events previously held in each host city,” the spokesperson told The Athletic.

LA is set to host eight matches in the World Cup, including two involving the US national team and a quarterfinal — games expected to draw major crowds. Parking for those high-demand matches is priced at $300, while the remaining LA games are listed at $250.

Lower-tier match tickets for the cup are expected to fetch less than $200.

If a fan wanted to attend a Category 3 match — a lower-priced seating tier typically located in the upper level — they would pay under $200 for the ticket, but $250 just to park, according to The Athletic.

The parking locations appear to include garages near the Intuit Dome — the Clippers' new arena — with FIFA estimating a roughly 20-minute walk to SoFi Stadium, depending on security checkpoints and access routes, The Athletic reported. 

For context, parking at the same garage typically costs under $60 for NBA games and under $100 for other major events.

Fans tired of being treated like piggy banks blamed Los Angeles' public transportation system and the city's drive-first culture for getting taken to the cleaners.

“The metro area is absolutely massive and yes there are rail lines and buses, but it's rare that your starting and end point are on a line and it will most likely include at least one or two bus transfers at each end of the journey,” one frustrated fan fumed on Reddit.

“LA is a largely a giant disorganised suburban sprawl. The public transport sucks and the traffic is godawful,” another added.

While some were appalled by the prices, others said they were not surprised.

“I paid $100 to park at the LA Forum in 2021 for a regular season Browns/Chargers game,” one critic said.

Oleksandra Oliynykova continued her breakout start to the 2026 season, following up her star turn at the 2026 Australian Open with a maiden WTA quarterfinal at the Transylvania Open.While there, she continued to take a principled stand on behalf of Ukrainians fighting an ongoing invasion from Russia and Belarus, refusing to shake the hand of vanquished opponent Anna Bondar, 6-4, 6-4.Oliynykova, who played an entertaining first round against defending champion Madison Keys in Melbourne—and turned heads with her audacious temporary face tattoos—announced in a statement that her decision made prior to the match stemmed from Bondar's participation in a 2022 Russian tournament.

The North Palmyra Trophies, which took place six months after Russia's invasion into Ukraine, was sponsored by Gazprom, an oil company Oliynykova called “one of the key financial pillars of Russia's war machine.“These are the same funds Russia uses to kill and maim Ukrainian women and children, and to destroy our families and cities,” said the 25-year-old.“From a moral standpoint, accepting Gazprom money in December 2022 is equivalent to playing in Nazi Germany in 1941 and being paid with property taken from victims of death camps. The same evil—just 80 years later.”Oliynykova was open to shaking Bondar's hand provided the Hungarian issued an apology, but none was issued and the Ukrainian advanced over the No. 8 seed in straight sets.She won her first WTA main-draw match in Cluh Napoca earlier this week, ralling from a set down to dismiss Mayar Sherif. This result is projected to raise Oliynykova into a career-high ranking of No. 78—though she could move even higher with a win in the quarterfinals.First into the last eight, the unseeded Oliynykova awaits the winner of the second-round clash between No. 4 seed Wang Xinyu and either Elena-Gabriela Ruse or Rebecca Masarova.

Novak Djokovic may not have come away with the 25th Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open this year, falling to Carlos Alcaraz in four sets in the final, but he broke all kinds of records—and ended all kinds of streaks—along the way.Here are just 20 things the G.O.A.T. achieved in Melbourne:

Here are just 20 things the G.O.A.T. achieved in Melbourne:

HISTORIC❗🇷🇸 Novak Djokovic has just become the first tennis player EVER to win 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ or more matches at THREE DIFFERENT GRAND SLAMS. 🔥🔥🔥He already had 101 at Roland Garros and 102 at Wimbledon, and he just got his *100th* at the Australian Open:https://t.co/6yAnB4jY2s

Let's start at the beginning with his 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 win over Pedro Martinez in the first round, which made him just the second player ever, male or female, to record 100 career wins at the Australian Open, after Roger Federer, who finished his career with 102 wins in Melbourne. Serena Williams is next with 92.And having already won 101 at Roland Garros and 102 at Wimbledon, he became the first player ever, male or female, to have 100 or more career wins at three different Grand Slams. And he could very well complete his set later this year at the US Open, the only one he's missing, where he has 95 career wins.It was also his record-extending 76th first-round win in a row at Grand Slams, the longest streak for any player in the Open Era, male or female. It's now been 20 years since his last opening exit, to American Paul Goldstein at the 2006 Australian Open.Then, with an identical 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 win over Francesco Maestrelli in the second round, he's now won 64 matches in a row in the first two rounds of Grand Slams. It's now been nine years since he lost before the third round of a major, falling to wild card Denis Istomin in the second round of the 2017 Australian Open.He also improved to 32-0 against qualifiers at majors. Maestrelli had qualified to reach his first major main draw, then beat last year's Cincinnati semifinalist, Terence Atmane, in the first round.

And having already won 101 at Roland Garros and 102 at Wimbledon, he became the first player ever, male or female, to have 100 or more career wins at three different Grand Slams. And he could very well complete his set later this year at the US Open, the only one he's missing, where he has 95 career wins.It was also his record-extending 76th first-round win in a row at Grand Slams, the longest streak for any player in the Open Era, male or female.

ANOTHER RECORD BROKEN❗🇷🇸 @DjokerNole has broken the men's record for most round of 16 appearances at Grand Slams, reaching his *70th* tonight. 🔥🔥🔥He already has the most titles (24), finals (37), semifinals (53), quarterfinals (64) AND wins (400):https://t.co/1rNcmr08RS

With his 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory over Botic van de Zandschulp in the third round, Djokovic became the first player in tennis history, male or female, to record 400 career wins at Grand Slams. He already held that record by a long way, with Federer and Serena in second and third place with 369 and 367.That third-round win also put him through to his 70th career round-of-16 appearance at a Grand Slam, breaking the record for most for a man in the Open Era, surpassing Federer's 69.And that's not all—with that victory he also improved his already-flawless record in third-round matches at the Australian Open to 18-0. He's 52-5 in sets in those matches.There was a reprieve in the fourth round, as his scheduled opponent, Czech Jakub Mensik, was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to an abdominal injury. With that, Djokovic moved into the 16th Australian Open quarterfinal of his career, a new all-time men's record, surpassing Federer's 15.He also moved into the 65th Grand Slam quarterfinal of his career, extending the all-time men's record he's already had for almost two years now. Federer has the next-most with 58.

THIS POINT FROM NOVAK 🔥🦾🫢 @DjokerNole#AusOpen pic.twitter.com/7J3g1qc3uF

After advancing past Lorenzo Musetti via retirement in the quarterfinals, Djokovic truly shone in the semifinals against Jannik Sinner, taking him out in five grueling sets, 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, and in doing so he ended the two-time defending champion's 19-match winning streak at the Australian Open.And that wasn't the only Sinner winning streak Djokovic snapped—the world No. 2 had won his last five matches in a row against Djokovic, 20 matches in a row on the tour, 29 matches in a row against Top 10 players other than Alcaraz, and 37 matches in a row at Grand Slams against players other than Alcaraz.Djokovic ensured that he, at least for now, would remain the only man in the Open Era to win the Australian Open three years in a row. Sinner was going for his third in a row this year. Djokovic is the only man to three-peat in Melbourne in the Open Era, doing it twice, from 2011 to 2013 and from 2019 to 2021.He also ensured there would be no fourth Grand Slam final in a row between Alcaraz and Sinner, which means that again, at least for now, Djokovic and Nadal keep their record for most major finals played in a row by two men in the Open Era, with four in a row between 2011 Wimbledon and 2012 Roland Garros.His victory over Sinner was his 20th career win over a Top 5 player at the Australian Open, tying Nadal (at Roland Garros) for most career Top 5 wins for a man at a single Grand Slam event in ATP rankings history, which dates back to 1973.And to circle back to an earlier stat, his win over Sinner was also his 104th win at the Australian Open, now two clear of Federer for most career wins for any player in Australian Open history.

And that wasn't the only Sinner winning streak Djokovic snapped—the world No. 2 had won his last five matches in a row against Djokovic, 20 matches in a row on the tour, 29 matches in a row against Top 10 players other than Alcaraz, and 37 matches in a row at Grand Slams against players other than Alcaraz.Djokovic ensured that he, at least for now, would remain the only man in the Open Era to win the Australian Open three years in a row.

Djokovic's heroic semifinal victory over Sinner put him through to his 11th career Australian Open final, extending his all-time men's record, as well as his 38th career Grand Slam final, extending his all-time record for any player, male or female.At 38 years young, he also became the oldest men's player to reach the Australian Open final in the Open Era, and the oldest men's player to reach the final at any Grand Slam since 1974, when Ken Rosewall reached his last two career Grand Slam finals as a 39-year-old at Wimbledon and the US Open.This is the record-extending 17th different season in his career where he's reached at least one major final, doing it in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and now 2026. It's the most for a man in the Open Era, with Federer and Nadal tied for second place at 15.He's now reached 38 finals in the 81 majors he's played in his career, which is already ridiculous, but he's also reached 38 finals in the last 70 majors he's played, an unbelievable stretch that dates back to his first major final at the 2007 US Open.And finally, after all of that, he's now back in the Top 3. The 24-time Grand Slam champion, who's spent a record 428 career weeks at No. 1, had been bouncing around the No. 4-7 range for the last 16 months, but with this result he moves back to No. 3, his first time in the Top 3 since the two weeks of the 2024 US Open.This is his mindblowing 757th career week in the Top 3 of the ATP rankings, which is more than 14 years' worth of weeks!

Gea closed out the first set one point later with a big serve that Mpetshi Perricard could only steer wide. Though he seemed to briefly consider continuing, the Frenchman ultimately retired after consulting his team, trailing 6-3 (ret.).As a result, world No. 168 Gea advances to face No. 3 seed Tomas Machac in the second round.“It's never easy to see a friend (injured) like this,” Gea said during his on-court interview. “Obviously, I didn't want to do (it like) this, but it's the game. He touched the ball, (it was) not on purpose.“I was handling the match really (well) in the beginning. I was really good on the court and he was also playing really good. It was really stressful, but it was a good match.”

F1 Barcelona Shakedown 2026: Day 5 Highlights

Newey 'always teaching us something', says Fernando Alonso

Adrian Newey's very first Aston Martin F1 car broke cover at the Barcelona Shakedown last week.

F1 design legend and Aston Martin Team Principal Adrian Newey has spoken about the process behind his maiden creation for the squad, the AMR26, and how the entire workforce “rose to the challenge” in preparing it.

Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso completed their first laps in the car at last week's Barcelona Shakedown, with Aston Martin taking to the track on the final two days of the gathering after a particularly busy winter that also marked the start of a works Honda engine deal.

According to Newey, who joined Aston Martin as Managing Technical Partner last March, just before their new wind tunnel became fully operational, the team faced “a very compressed timescale and an extremely busy 10 months” to get the all-new challenger ready.

“2026 is probably the first time in the history of F1 that the power unit regulations and chassis regulations have changed at the same time,” said Newey in an interview for the official Aston Martin website. “It's a completely new set of rules, which is a big challenge for all the teams, but perhaps more so for us.

“The reality is that we didn't get a model of the ‘26 car into the wind tunnel until mid-April, whereas most, if not all of our rivals would have had a model in the wind tunnel from the moment the 2026 aero testing ban ended at the beginning of January last year.

“That put us on the back foot by about four months, which has meant a very, very compressed research and design cycle. The car only came together at the last minute, which is why we were fighting to make it to the Barcelona Shakedown.”

Asked to break the core elements of the design down, he continued: “It starts with the overall packaging of the car: where is the car carried over the wheelbase, where are the main masses carried.

“Then it's worked through to the front and rear suspension – the front and rear suspension both have their own very important part to play in that manipulation of the flow field. You've got the front wing and the nose shape, which are somewhat different this year. You keep moving through to the sidepods, and the treatment around the rear of the car, which is certainly different to what we've done previously.

“Now, whether other people come up with a similar solution to ours, we don't know and we won't until we start seeing other people's cars. We've just tried to pursue what we think is the correct direction for us. Other people might have pursued other directions. It's part of the excitement of new regulations, seeing what everybody comes up with.”

With several rivals already taking note of the car, Newey admitted “the direction we've taken could certainly be interpreted as aggressive”, given “it's got quite a few features that haven't necessarily been done before”, while pointing to one of his trademarks.

“The car is tightly packaged – much more tightly packaged than I believe has been attempted at Aston Martin Aramco before,” he commented.

“This has required a very close working relationship with the mechanical designers to achieve the aerodynamic shapes we wanted, but I have to say that all the mechanical designers here have really embraced that philosophy. It hasn't made their life easy, quite the opposite, but they've really risen to the challenge.”

As for what to expect from the AMR26 at the start of the season, and what might be to come in terms of updates, Newey said: “We've attempted to build something that we hope will have quite a lot of development potential.

“What you want to try to avoid is a car that comes out quite optimised within its window but lacks a lot of development potential. We've tried to do the opposite, which is why we've really focused on the fundamentals, put our effort into those, knowing that some of the appendages – wings, bodywork, things that can be changed in season – will hopefully have development potential.”

EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, Netflix has acquired the action thriller spec Kill Switch from Harrison Query, with Jake Gyllenhaal attached to star.


	Described by sources as falling somewhere between Collateral and Sicario, the film's logline is being kept under wraps. 6th & Idaho's Matt Reeves & Lynn Harris will produce along with Gyllenhaal & Josh McLauglin's Nine Stories banner and Scott Glassgold and his 12:01 Films. Query will executive produce.


Kill Switch is the second hot package to sell recently from the same team. Last June, Query set up his political thriller short story “Code Black” at Amazon MGM, with Gyllenhaal set to star, and the triumvirate of 6th & Idaho, Nine Stories and 12:01 aboard to produce.

	











	On a pretty incomparable heater lately, Query returns to Netflix after securing a straight-to-series order from the streamer for his A24-produced TV series Trigger Point, following a seven-way bidding war. As previously reported, Joel Edgerton will star, with Jeremy Saulnier directing, and Query showrunning and exec producing the show he created. In December, Query also sold his spec script The Operator to Netflix with Mark Wahlberg starring and producing alongside The Picture Company and 12:01 Films.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Last year, Query saw his Amazon MGM action comedy Heads of State, starring John Cena and Idris Elba, debut as the fourth-most-streamed movie of all time for the service. Up next for him is the Paramount+/101 Studios JonBenét Ramsey limited series Unspeakable, starring Melissa McCarthy and Clive Owen, which he co-created and executive produced. Query is repped by CAA, Ground Control and Jeff Frankel.

	











	After executive producing and starring in Apple's Presumed Innocent and seeing the critically acclaimed series break out as one of Apple's most-watched dramas of all time, Gyllenhaal is back on board as executive producer of the forthcoming second season. He's also returned for a Road House sequel, directed by Ilya Naishuller, after seeing his 2024 Amazon MGM remake from Doug Liman break records with more than 50 million viewers in its first two weekends on Prime Video. On March 6, he'll be seen in Warner Bros.' Frankenstein-inspired gothic crime flick The Bride!, directed by his sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal. Also on his upcoming slate is M. Night Shyamalan's supernatural romantic thriller Remain, which Warner Bros. releases on October 23. Gyllenhaal is repped by WME and Carlos Goodman.


	6th & Idaho's The Wrecking Crew, starring Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista, is currently No. 1 worldwide on Prime Video. In pre-production on the Reeves-helmed The Batman Part II, the company is at the same time shooting Dynamic Duo for DC and Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, with Clayface in post for DC Studios. They are repped by CAA and Karl Austen.


	The sale of Kill Switch continues a fast start to 2026 for Glassgold and his 12:01, having recently packaged and sold the sought-after short story “Grand Rising” to Searchlight, with Lena Waithe adapting and Steve Caple Jr. directing. Last year, high-profile sales included Ripped at 20th starring Dwayne Johnson, Earthling at Sony with Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein directing, After Shock at Lionsgate with Brandon Sklenar starring, Drift at Paramount/Skydance, Fake Wedding at Amazon with Lili Reinhart starring, Fallen Astronaut at Apple, plus the aforementioned The Operator and Code Black. Up next, he's set to enter production on Drew Hancock's adaptation of Query's bestselling novel, My Wife and I Bought a Ranch, for Amazon MGM Studios. Glassgold's 12:01 is repped by Verve and McKuin Frankel Whitehead.

EXCLUSIVE: Tracie Laymon, the filmmaker behind recent SXSW prize-winner Bob Trevino Likes It, has been enlisted to write and direct a live-action Tony the Tattooed Man feature for Mattel Studios.


	First introduced in 1992, Tony the Tattooed Man was an illustratable muscle-bound action figure, inviting kids to decorate his body with soluble temporary tattoos applied by hand and to continually customize and reimagine his appearance. Given its short time on the market, the novelty toy has added value now as a rare vintage collectible.


	Laymon aims to reimagine the cult-favorite action figure as the centerpiece of a character-driven drama that blends surreal fantasy with emotional depth. The project will be overseen by Darian Greenbaum and Steve Spohr for Mattel Studios, with Robbie Brenner producing on behalf of Mattel. Ivan Sanchez is also serving as a producer.

	











	Brenner, Mattel Studios' President and Chief Content Officer, said: “After seeing Bob Trevino Likes It and the specificity and emotional depth that Tracie brings to her characters, I knew that she was the perfect person to develop Tony the Tattooed Man. It's a story that feels especially relevant today, one that explores looking beyond first impressions and leading with empathy.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Laymon shared, for her part: “I was immediately drawn to Tony the Tattooed Man from the minute I saw his name and then learned about his short-lived journey as a discontinued toy. His story is a reminder of the healing power of second chances and not judging a book – or a person – by their cover, a message I believe the world needs right now. It is an honor to partner with Mattel, who are true allies for artists, on a film that will help restore our faith in humanity.”

	











	Laymon's breakout feature Bob Trevino Likes It, starring John Leguizamo and Barbie Ferreira, premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival, where it won both the Grand Jury Award for Best Narrative Feature and the Audience Award. Following a lonely young woman who strikes up a relationship online with a stranger who shares her father's name, the film was acquired by Roadside Attractions and released in theaters in March of last year.


	A Texas-native, Laymon spent some of her formative teen years in Russia before returning to the States for college. As a fierce advocate for the inclusion and representation of gender diversity and people with disabilities in front of and behind the camera, her goal is to amplify diverse perspectives through underdog stories. In addition to Tony the Tattooed Man, she is currently writing her next original feature.


	Mattel Studios recently enlisted Hannah Hafey & Kaitlin Smith to write their live-action Monster High movie, as we first reported early last month. The studio's anticipated first live-action feature, on the heels of the 2023 cultural phenomenon Barbie, is Masters of the Universe, starring Nicholas Galitzine, which Amazon MGM releases in North America on June 5. Apple, Skydance and Mattel's live-action Matchbox movie, starring John Cena, is also expected to bow in 2026.


	Laymon is represented by Verve, Artists First, and Yorn, Barnes, Levine.

Congrats to the director but just emblematic to the issues of being a producer in this industry. The producers of her small (successful) independent film went to the mat, sleepless nights, and just rode for the director all throughout, and the director basically gets to ride the spoils of that, and gets the studio film, as the producers get left in the dust to produce another film (if they are lucky) for pennies. It's not their fault, but just reality, and sad.

Editor-In-Chief


	In March 2014, Disney/ABC TV Group President Anne Sweeney left Disney as the company was nearing a decision on who would replace Bob Iger as CEO. While she was not among the finalists for the job, at the time, Sweeney was the closest a woman had ever gotten to the CEO job at Disney.


	Twelve years later, Dana Walden, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment, came a lot closer as one of the two main contenders to succeed Iger in the top job alongside Disney Parks & Experiences chief Josh D'Amaro. Ultimately, the outcome was the same, with D'Amaro named Disney CEO this morning, and the glass ceiling for a woman becoming CEO of a major media company remains unbroken.

	











	In a Solomonic decision allowing Disney to keep two strong executives with different areas of expertise – something very rare in the aftermath of a CEO bakeoff – Walden was named President and Chief Creative Officer, creating a new position for her, in which she will oversee Disney Entertainment — both film and TV — as well as Hulu, Disney+ and TWDC Marketing, reporting to D'Amaro. Fellow Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman now will report to Walden; ESPN remains a standalone unit run by Jimmy Pitaro, who will report to D'Amaro. In a SEC filing, D'Amaro's initial compensation package is valued at $38M, Walden's at $24M.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I'm honored to be named Disney's first President and Chief Creative Officer,” Walden said in an Instagram post, which you can see below. “This is a dream job for me – I'm grateful to Bob Iger and the Disney board for this opportunity to build on Disney's wonderful legacy and carry our creative endeavors into the future.”


	Walden still follows in Iger's footsteps as a Disney TV executive who went on to run both film and television. It's too early to tell whether one or more of her current reports would be elevated and take on additional responsibilities with her portfolio expanding to features.


	Last fall, Iger reportedly quizzed Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos about the effectiveness of Netflix's co-CEO structure, raising speculation that Disney was mulling a similar setup with D'Amaro and Walden.

	











	While that idea was abandoned, the company still took a page out of Netflix's playbook with a Chief Creative Officer role across film and TV, giving Walden a new area to play in and keeping her – and her talent relationships with top creators such as Ryan Murphy – in the fold. (Netflix has two co-CEOs, Sarandos and Greg Peters, and a Chief Content Officer over film and TV, Bela Bajaria.)


	While parks, experiences and games – the three areas D'Amaro had been overseeing – are considered key to Disney's growth, Disney is still an entertainment company, and Walden provides the Hollywood standing D'Amaro is currently lacking.


	“We're so blessed at this company. We had four incredible top executives with Jimmy Pitaro and Alan Bergman, Dana and Josh,” James Gorman, the chair of Disney's board, told CNBC this morning, listing the four top executives under Iger who had been considered his potential successors until the field narrowed down to D'Amaro and Walden.


	Calling Walden “unbelievable executive,” Gorman said, “If you think about what is the heart of the Disney company, it's the creativity. It's this amazing IP that's been produced over decades, going back to Walt, and the storytelling that comes from that creativity. And I think Dana, working with Josh and ensuring that the best creativity permeates all of our businesses, is what we wanted.”


	Just yesterday, Iger spoke of Disney's own heated rivalry – or as he put it “healthy competition” – between parks and entertainment “in terms of which of those two businesses is going to essentially prevail as the number one driver of profitability,” saying that he is confident that “both have the ability to grow nicely into the future.”


	They will now be able to grow – at least for now – with the leaders who got them to this point.


	A former top executive at Fox – where she did hold a CEO title within the Fox Television Group – Walden joined Disney following the 2019 acquisition, starting off with a portfolio that included ABC and the Disney Television Studios. She subsequently rose to co-chairman of Disney Entertainment where she was responsible for the P&L for all entertainment media, news and content businesses globally, direct-to-consumer, technology, advertising, platform distribution, and international content and operations.


	Inheriting a DTC business after the botched DMED reorg under CEO Bob Chapek that had lost billions, she and Bergman helped turn it into an earnings report standout.


	Walden faced a lot more obstacles in the public bakeoff than D'Amaro as she had to navigate the bruising, lengthy YouTube TV blackout of Disney channels and the temporary suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! over comments Kimmel had made following Charlie Kirk's murder. In handling the latter, she picked up Kimmel's endorsement for the CEO job.


	There was also the $15M ABC News payment to Donald Trump to settle a lawsuit over a comment by George Stephanopoulos.


	Walden also has had her hands full doing a Disney streaming technology upgrade. Hulu has been operating on an old tech platform from before Disney took over the former joint venture that was plagued with glitches during the live Oscar telecast last year. 


	Hulu has not been able to launch a massive scripted hit of the size of Stranger Things or The Summer I Turned Pretty or Ted Lasso but it has found a massive unscripted one in The Secret Lives of Mormon Lives while fielding crowd pleasers such as Only Murders In the Building. The streamer also has been boosted by the output of FX and ABC — homes of breakouts like Shōgun and High Potential — as building an integrated entertainment ecosystem of Disney's linear and streaming businesses has been a priority for Walden.

	











	Over her decades at Disney and Fox, she also has shepherded such hit shows as 24, 9-1-1, Abbott Elementary, American Horror Story, American Idol, The Bear, Bluey, Bob's Burgers, Dancing With the Stars, Family Guy, Glee, Grey's Anatomy, The Handmaid's Tale, Homeland, The Kardashians, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Spidey and his Amazing Friends, The Simpsons and This Is Us.


	When Sweeney stepped down in 2014, she said she was leaving to become a TV director. (She has since become a director on the Netflix board.) While Walden would not discuss the CEO search when asked about it over the past year, she would joke that regardless of the outcome, TV directing is not in the cards for her.


	Still, in her new role at Disney, Walden will continue to work with TV directors — and now she will collaborate with film directors too.

Dana Is Great!  Please Bring Marvel Back to Los Angeles – We need a break here

Still a boys club at the Mouse House. Sigh.

Dana Walden should not be supervising the film side of Disney at all

ESPN guy would have been wrong for so many reasons..

As if their film studio needed to get any worse… RIP

Walden was in charge of television, not film. And I'm pretty sure Disney is crying all the way to the bank after Zootopia 2, Lilo & Stitch, and Avatar: Fire and Ash.

As of February 3, 2026, the 84-year-old mother of “today” anchor Savannah Guthrie is still missing, and now, Guthrie's husband Michael Feldman has broken his silence on the situation, and his comments reveal the heartbroken family's desperation. 

Page Six reported around 11 AM Tuesday morning that Feldman exclusively told them he does not “have anything new to report” in the search for his mother-in-law, Nancy Guthrie. She was last seen on the night of Saturday, January 31.

The outlet says Feldman, a PR and communications consultant, told them he's “just being responsive” but feels “mostly unhelpful.” Page Six also says Feldman thanked them for the “thoughtfulness” of their coverage on the gut-wrenching story.

CBS News reported on the morning of Tuesday, February 3 that a law enforcement source familiar with the case told them “a little bit of blood” was found inside the missing octogenarian's Arizona in the Catalina Foothills from which she is believed to have been abducted.

Test results to attempt to determine who the blood belongs to are underway, and investigators and crime scene analysts are currently “combing through the house” in search of clues, per the report.

CBS says Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos previously told them he believes Nancy was abducted from her home “in the middle of the night,” and he doesn't believe there's a possibility she could have wondered away because of her mental sharpness and inability to walk far.

The Sheriff also said Nancy left behind her essential medications, supporting the theory that she was taken against her will. 

A little after 8 PM on the evening of Monday, February 2, Savannah posted a plea for prayers on Instagram. Celebrities flooded the comments with love and support. Here are some of their reactions:

Jenny Marrs: “I am lifting up your mom and your family. May we all bear witness to a miracle.”

Gwen Stefani: The singer left a praying hands emoji.

Monica Lewinsky: Left prayer hands and hearts.

Mindy Kaling: “Praying.”

Bobby Flay: “Praying NOW.”

Laurie Hernandez: “Sending millions.”

Joy Bauer: “Sooo much love and strength and continuous prayer.”

Nicky Hilton: Left three prayer emojis.

Martina McBride: Prayer hands.

Shaun Robinson: “GOD IS ABLE.”

Guthrie's longtime “Today” co-anchor Hoda Kotb mas made 3 posts to her own Instagram about the missing person's case. 

The first one was a picture of the word “Hope,” which she captioned with a pair of heart emojis. Her next post was a shot of Guthrie and her mother, and the third was the phone number to the Pima County Sheriff's Department. Kotb wrote alongside that post, “If you know anything.. pls help.”

Disney's incoming chief executive Josh D'Amaro will start at an annual base salary of $2.5 million, payable weekly, with an annual target incentive bonus of 250% of the base salary at the end of each fiscal year.


	According to filings with the SEC on Tuesday, D'Amaro will receive a long-term stock incentive of $26.25 million for each fiscal year he serves as CEO. The current chairman of Disney Parks & Experiences will pocket a one-time payout with a target value of $9.705 million tied to his promotion.


	Newly anointed President and Chief Creative Office Dana Walden will have an annual base salary of $3.75 million and be eligible for an annual target bonus equal to 200% of that. She'll receive a long-term stock award of $15.75 million for each full fiscal year during her tenure. And she'll receive a one-time long-term incentive award valued at $5.26 million related to her new role.

	Disney's fiscal year runs through September. Both executives will start their new gigs after the upcoming March 18 annual shareholders meeting. The filing said Walden's contract runs through March 2030 and that she will report “solely and directly to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and will be responsible for Disney Entertainment, Hulu, Disney + and TWDC Marketing.”

	Disney also amended outgoing CEO Bob Iger's contract dating from November 2022. After March 18, Iger will continue to serve on the board and as an employee of the company with the title of Senior Advisor. His CEO contract had been set to expire at the end of 2026, but he'll be stepping away from that role earlier.

	











	Disney's board unveiled the long-awaited announcement of its new CEO this morning after a search process of several years. It had promised news early in 2026.

Start the countdown clock till Bob Iger comes roaring back.

Ummm. He could probably go work for a competitor and earn more.  Could someone explain how this is even close to CEO level comp?  How about how it compares to Chapek or Feige?  Had read Iger wants to spend time on his yacht.  Josh would need a number of good years to be able to afford a second home of his stature let alone a yacht.

He's making up to $33m a year in cash and stock. That's good.

Learn math.
He's getting possibly $18m a year plus ~&25m PER YEAR in stock. Plus a one time gift of ~$10m in stock for no reason.
I think he'll be able to buy a yacht.

*8m a year

Donald Trump's approval numbers are in the tank, which may or may not have something to do with the fact that on multiple occasions in recent weeks he has teased the idea of somehow canceling the midterm elections. The White House has insisted Trump was “joking,” but it certainly didn't seem like he was playing around when he proposed another wild idea to Dan Bongino: that Republicans should “take over” and “nationalize” the nation's voting systems.


	“The Republicans should say, we want to take over, we should take over the voting, the voting in at least many — 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting,” the president told the podcaster-turned-top FBI official-turned-podcaster in an interview that aired Monday, after pushing the false idea that Democrats bring non-citizens into the United States specifically so they will vote for them.


	“We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes,” Trump continued. “We have states that I won, that show I didn't win. Now you're going to see something in Georgia where they were able to get with a court order, the ballots. You're going to see some interesting things come out. The 2020 election, I won that election by so much. Everybody knows it.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	There is no evidence that significant fraud occurred during the 2020 election, despite the conspiracy theories Trump has been pushing relentlessly for half a decade. Trump has repeatedly claimed he and his allies have already proved the election was rigged, while simultaneously claiming proof of wrongdoing will soon “come out,” as he did again on Monday.

	











	The latest fishing expedition is in Georgia, with federal agents descending on Fulton County last week to seize 2020 election records. Trump directed Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to oversee the operation on the ground, an unusual role for a top intelligence official like Gabbard. The New York Times reported that at one point Gabbard called Trump, and put the president on speakerphone so he could talk directly with FBI agents — another unusual move, to say the least. Gabbard denied Trump asked any questions or issued any directives on the call, according to a letter she sent to lawmakers.


	Fulton County has already said it plans to sue over the administration's raid of its election materials.

	Trump has been posting a slew of election conspiracies on Truth Social as the situation in Fulton County develops, while continuing to claim publicly that he won the 2020 election. His new idea to “take over” elections from states is — as is the case with many of Trump's ideas since he retook office — unconstitutional. He's also not even just saying that the federal government should oversee elections; he's saying specifically that the Republican Party should “take over.”


	Trump didn't mention which “15 places” he feels have issues, but we're going to take a wild guess and say he lost all 15 of them in 2020.

UPDATE, 6 AM: A longer trailer for the Zendaya– and Robert Pattinson-starring The Drama has arrived, giving more context to what may have unsettled the pair leading up to their characters' wedding.


	Emma (Zendaya) and Charlie (Pattinson) are preparing for the big day by taking dance lessons, fine-tuning speeches and more when another couple with whom they are friends (played by Alana Haim and Mamoudou Athie) prompts them to say the worst thing they've ever done before they tie the knot. This leads to what may be a unrecoverable confession from Emma that adds tension to the lead-up to their nuptials.

	











	Earlier on in the clip, Emma admits to Charlie being both her first love and first crush. Haim's character asks, in shock, “At 30?”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Things escalate in a montage of a car crashing into a tree, an argument at the wedding ceremony, Pattinson's Charlie throwing a chair and Zendaya's Emma pulling a knife on Charlie.


	“It's just, there's some drama,” Pattinson says at the end.


	The film also stars Hailey Gates and Zoë Winters. The Drama arrives in theaters April 3 via A24.


	See the full trailer above and first trailer below.


PREVIOUSLY, December 10, 2025: Save April 3, 2026 as the date for A24's The Drama starring Zendaya and Robert Pattinson. The film's first trailer is here.


	Directed by Kristoffer Borgli, the film watches Zendaya and Pattinson, a happily engaged couple, get tested when their wedding week goes off the rails thanks to an unexpected turn.


	The clip opens on an awkward-looking Emma Harwood (Zendaya) and Charlie Thompson (Pattinson) getting some photos taken ahead of their wedding. The photographer senses “some nerves” and tries posing them next to each other against a gray backdrop, asking them to smile like they would in life.


	As the photographer asks each part of the couple their favorite things about the other, a montage of their daily life flows as Charlie calls Emma “beautiful” and “funny” and says she has “the best life.” Emma, in turn calls Charlie “caring, understanding and open-minded,” the last word landing during a shot of her slapping Pattinson's character in the face during sex.

	











	“Remember, you know each other really well,” the photographer says, encouraging the pair to hold onto those thoughts. Mamoudou Athie makes a toast at their wedding, an alarm blares in a dark entryway, Pattinson's Charlie throws a chair and then can be seen saying “just some drama” on the street before Zendaya's Emma chugs some brown liquor.

In the two decades since acquiring The Muppets, Disney has never appeared to have a clear idea of what to do with Jim Henson's beloved characters. 

Things started off strong with the 2011 film “The Muppets,” a charmingly nostalgic reboot that went out of its way to remind us why we loved Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, and Gonzo in the first place. The film's success suggested that a new era of big-screen adventures was on the horizon, but that fizzled out after 2014's “Muppets Most Wanted” disappointed at the box office. 

The franchise then shifted its efforts to the small screen with Bill Prady and Bob Kushell's 2015 mockumentary series (which was also titled “The Muppets”), which stripped the characters from their vaudeville roots and presented them in a dryly hilarious single-camera sitcom that didn't shy away from adult situations. That series remains one of the boldest and funniest experiments in the franchise's history, but it quickly ran into a roadblock: Many fans didn't want to see these characters grow up. Storylines about Kermit committing infidelity and Fozzie getting confusing dating app results after describing himself as “a bear looking for love” were too far for some purists, and the show was shamefully cancelled after a season.

Since then, the Muppets have largely sat on the sidelines of the Disney empire. There has been safe short-form content (“Muppets Now” and “Muppets Haunted Mansion”) and spinoffs about side characters (“The Muppets Mayhem”), but it's been a decade since the company made any serious attempt at bringing the primary characters back into the mainstream.

 










It's out of character for a conglomerate that's so ravenous for content to sit on a blue-chip IP for so long, but the delay reflects a real predicament: the Muppets are timeless and beloved, but there's a narrow range of situations you can place them in without changing things too much. If the modern Muppet audience isn't broad enough to support consistent theatrical films, and the diehard fanbase doesn't want things to change too much, what do you do?

Apparently, you give everyone exactly what they're used to. That's the approach taken in the new reboot of “The Muppet Show,” which hails from executive producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. The half-hour variety show faithfully reassembles the format that made the Muppets household names in the 1970s: a mixture of sketches and musical numbers with a hearty dose of backstage antics as Kermit and his loyal theater troupe put on a show with a rotating celebrity host. Scooter is still the frazzled stage manager, Miss Piggy is still making diva demands about her wardrobe and screen time, and Statler and Waldorf are still roasting the entire product from their box seats. If you squint hard enough to mask the fact that the camerawork is slightly better than the original series, you could convince yourself that it's still 1974. Until Sabrina Carpenter shows up.

 










In between performing her hits, she fawns over Miss Piggy and duets with Kermit with the appropriate amount of expressiveness and theatricality. There's no objective way to quantify this, but Carpenter passes the same “human with Muppet-like qualities” eye test that made Jason Segel such a great Muppet co-star a decade ago. The single best choice the reboot makes is its host, as it's hard to imagine anyone who understands the assignment better than Sabrina does here.

More than anything, this iteration of “The Muppet Show” is safe. The episode is filled with precisely constructed one-liners that have been the foundation of Muppet humor from the very beginning. (Adult topics are occasionally alluded to, but plausible deniability is always there for parents who need to explain why they're laughing.) Most of the jokes are funny, some are hysterical, and a few others fall flat… but that's always been the “Muppet Show” experience. The show is essentially a kid-friendly “Saturday Night Live” with puppets, and its value proposition is not that different from Lorne Michaels' longtime show: a comforting weekly format with an ensemble cast you grow to love, a different celebrity every week, and a collection of sketches of varying quality that will always contain enough gems to keep you somewhat entertained. That was the standard set by the original series, and the reboot clears that bar beyond any reasonable doubt.

 










The pilot is ostensibly a one-off special, though Kermit himself makes it clear that more episodes are in the cards if all goes well. Viewed through that lens, it's hard to dock the first episode too many points for originality. When rebooting a property as beloved as “The Muppet Show,” the first priority is not to screw anything up. Rogen and company managed to achieve that, providing a nostalgic foundation that should give them as much runway as they want for future experimentation. The real test will be how much they take advantage of that runway — the new special is a fun trip down memory lane, but it's easy to see the throwback format getting old after a while — and how far Disney and Muppet fans will let them go. 

But even if the pilot proves inconclusive, we should all be grateful to live in a world where new episodes of “The Muppet Show” are being produced. And this creative team, which also includes veteran Broadway director Alex Timbers, demonstrates enough love for the source material to earn the benefit of the doubt. The Muppets are beloved enough that this could become the rarest of pop-culture rarities in 2026: a monocultural event. Just like celebrity week on “Sesame Street” is one of the most coveted gigs in Hollywood each year, it's easy to see a world where every A-lister with a project to promote wants to stop by “The Muppet Show” and have Kermit and Scooter barge into their dressing room with a crisis to mitigate. Here's hoping the reboot grows into its own style and a new golden age of Muppets is upon us.

 










“The Muppet Show” streams on Disney+ beginning on Wednesday, February 4.

O
n Jan. 5, Tekashi 6ix9ine was driving with his sunroof open, enjoying his last full day of fresh air and blue sky before surrendering to authorities to begin serving his three-month sentence in New York's Metropolitan Detention Center. The rapper, born Daniel Hernandez, was familiar with the Brooklyn jail; he'd been held there multiple times before, including recently in 2024.


	“Remember when I told you that I was arrested, I was in prison with Diddy, the president of Honduras, and Sam Bankman-Fried,” Hernandez told his fans, on a video he later posted to Instagram. “And you guys thought I was lying?


	“Now, I'm about to go meet the president of Venezuela,” he continued, referring to Nicolas Maduro, who is currently being detained at MDC. “I have that luck of just being locked up with presidents. Oh, and I'm about to meet Luigi, too — Luigi Mangione. About to play chess with them niggas, eat ramen noodles.”


	New York City's main federal jail does not have the name recognition of Rikers, which is a state facility, but the recent slew of high-profile inmates has propelled MDC into the headlines. Along with Sean “Diddy” Combs, disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, and accused UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Mangione, recent inmates include R. Kelly, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Martin Shkreli.

	In January, Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken to MDC after being arrested in a middle-of-the-night raid, prompting international attention and a slew of memes and AI-generated GIFs of Maduro hanging out with Combs behind bars. (In fact, Combs is no longer at MDC — he was moved to FCI Fort Dix in October to finish out his four-year sentence.) Some on social media have joked MDC is the real-life Arkham Asylum, a reference to the fictional psychiatric hospital that houses villains from Batman's Gotham City. Others question whether MDC is partly a celebrity jail, in which VIP inmates are sectioned off and treated more luxuriously than others.

	The truth is, MDC has historically been known not for the inmates it houses, but for the horrific conditions inside the jail. Most of the inmates are awaiting their trials and sentencing, with only a small percentage serving time after being found guilty. The federal detention center is famous for its extended lockdowns, lack of outside space, poor medical care, and violent brawls — it's known for being cruel even when compared to other jails. Multiple federal judges have declined to send their defendants there and one lawyer, whose 36-year-old client died after he was injured in a fight while incarcerated, referred to MDC as “hell on earth.”


	MDC IS A HULKING CONCRETE-AND-BRICK structure that sits between the Gowanus Canal and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. On a recent dreary January afternoon, correctional officers patrol the outside, and passersby catch the sulphuric scent of the nearby waterway. The Federal Bureau of Prisons logo adorns the building, advertising “NOW HIRING.” Near the jail, shoppers walk in and out of the home goods big-box chain Floor & Decor with tile samples, and children climb a rock wall inside Industry City shopping center.


	“There is nothing special going on at MDC; it is not a ‘Club Fed' or privileged type of prison,” says criminologist Craig Rothfeld. “It is just one of those moments in time where you have many more high-profile individuals being indicted in the Southern District of New York,” versus other New York federal districts. (State crimes violate local laws whereas federal crimes involve breaking a federal law, or involve a crime that occurs across states like terrorism, tax evasion, or drug trafficking. People are sent to MDC from the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York — which comprise 13 counties, including all five boroughs.)

	Rothfeld runs the prison consulting business Inside Outside Ltd. and has worked with clients like Mangione, NXIVM cult leader Keith Raniere, and Harvey Weinstein (who is at Rikers) to advise them while they serve their time. He explains how to interact with other inmates as well as prison officials, and how to request items like necessary medical equipment. Formerly incarcerated himself, Rothfeld says he now “mitigates, advocates, and solves problems for incarcerated individuals and their loved ones to help them navigate through arguably the worst period of time in their lives.”


	MDC is made up of two buildings that currently house about 1,300 inmates, most of whom are awaiting trial or sentencing. (Last year, MDC also began housing ICE detainees.) Inmates in both the east and west buildings are served the same food, subject to lockdowns, and given the same amount of time to spend on the pay phones — 500 minutes a month with calls limited to 15 minutes each, and a waiting time of one hour between calls. (For comparison's sake, in New York state jails, inmates have virtually unlimited free phone time from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Federal detention centers often have stricter phone policies.)

	











	The majority of the inmates are housed in the west building, in two-person, eight-by-10 feet cells with minimal floor space, metal bunk beds, lockers, a fold-down desk and shelf, and a stainless steel combination sink-toilet, known as a comby. There are often 60 cells to a unit, 30 upstairs and 30 downstairs, meaning there can be about 120 people together in a unit sharing showers, public televisions, TVs, wall computers, and pay phones. The west building also contains multiple special housing units (SHU) that are high-security solitary confinement areas with 24-hour monitoring as well as the Special Administrative Measures (SAMS) unit, where inmates requiring very high security are held. 


	The east building houses women, including Maduro's wife, Flores, and a cadre unit, meaning inmates who have been designated to serve their post-trial sentences at MDC and are often given jobs that allow them to move around more freely. The east building also contains the “4 North” unit, which can house about 20 high-profile inmates at a time. Rothfeld explains that these inmates have been deemed low security risks or need to be separated from the general population for their safety. Rather than containing two-person cells, the east building housing is dorm-style barracks, with a more open floor plan where multiple beds are placed next to each other. Combs and Bankman-Fried were both held in the 4 North unit at the same time and could have had beds next to each other in the same dorm. Tekashi 6ix9ine has said he also spent time in this unit with Combs, Bankman-Fried, and the former president of Honduras.


	However, celebrity status is not what solely determines where inmates are assigned. There have been high-profile inmates like R. Kelly and luxury real estate brokers and brothers Oren and Tal Alexander, who were housed with the general population in the west building. 


	Rothfeld stresses that no matter what unit inmates are assigned to, the conditions in MDC are deplorable. “It's not like some cushy setup. It's the worst of the worst,” Rothfeld says. “Four North just happens to be the best of the worst.”


	MDC opened in 1994 to try and help reduce overcrowding in Manhattan's federal jail, Metropolitan Correctional Center. In 2021, the Bureau of Prisons permanently closed MCC, due to concerns about its conditions. This left MDC as the sole NYC facility for inmates awaiting arraignment and sentencing. But lawyers tell me MDC has as many problems as the shuttered MCC. The Justice Department has issued critical reports about the jail, following investigations into how inmates are treated. 

	











	In 2019, a former MDC warden told The New York Times that the jail was “one of the most troubled, if not the most troubled facility in the Bureau of Prisons.” 


	IN OCTOBER, PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA CIRCULATED a photo of Mangione, the prime suspect in the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting, in an off-white T-shirt over a sweatshirt standing with four other similarly clad MDC inmates. He has the faintest of smiles as he stands in front of a red-tiled wall. Standing two people to the left of him, in white pants, is former Venezuelan general and military intelligence chief Hugo “El Pollo” Carvajal. Carvajal, who faces life in prison, has written a letter to President Donald Trump saying he wants to provide evidence about Venezuela's politicians participating in criminal activity.


	As soon as Maduro was extradited from Venezuela to MDC, unsubstantiated rumors swirled on X that the president had already met and interacted with Mangione. It's unclear where Maduro is currently being held within MDC, although typically high-profile inmates are held in solitary confinement when they first arrive. And since Carvajal could potentially be used as a key witness against Maduro, it's unlikely they'd be housed in the same unit.


	It's a common misconception that all the high-profile inmates are housed together, making MDC some sort of special celebrity detention center. In reality, the explanation for why so many big names are all in there together is quite simple: It's because it's New York, explains criminal defense attorney Lance Clarke. 


	“We put all the people in that one place whether you rob the bodega or you're Bernie Madoff,” says Clarke, who is based in Manhattan. 


	He explains that the Southern District of New York (SDNY) is known as the “Mother Court” in the United States — it's the oldest federal court in the country, predating the Supreme Court — and often leads high-profile investigations that can involve extraditing people from all over the world, like Maduro. The SDNY started investigating Maduro for narco-terrorism in 2011, unsealing an indictment against him in 2022 and another one in 2026. Because the investigation began with the New York City court, Maduro was extradited to the NYC federal jail.


	Brandon, a former inmate who served a year at MDC in 2024 and asked to use a pseudonym for anonymity, tells me it didn't seem to him like high-profile inmates got special treatment. He says that even if some of the inmates are famous, there are people who are more popular than a celebrity because of their international status and power, like politicians or drug cartel leaders. 

	











	THE PEOPLE DETAINED AT MDC OFTEN don't see the sky for weeks at a time. The little sunlight they get falls through small windows at the tops of a wall in the recreation center. When it's cold, inmates stand in the squares of light, lifting their faces to the ceiling, to soak it in.


	Brandon says that typical days are spent reading, working out, listening to music on tablets that can be purchased from the commissary, or watching movies available to rent. On the second Tuesday of each month, 10 new films are added to the rental queue and 10 are removed. The common area includes tables and chairs that are bolted down with TVs and access to computers mounted on the wall. Inmates play games like chess to pass the time. No internet access is allowed outside of the jail's email system. There are some inmates who have jobs within the jail. Mangione, for example, has been assigned to clean the showers and bathrooms in his unit.


	Some detainees who are held for years before their trial only breathe open air in the brief moments getting in and out of the prison van while being transported to and from court.


	“You're not breathing fresh air,” says Brandon, who adds that the windows are so small it's sometimes hard to tell whether it's day or night.


	The lack of access to fresh air is what makes MDC distinct from other federal prisons, where inmates are typically allowed an hour a day in outside yards. Brandon says the indoor rec centers resemble a high school gym, a square contained by four walls, only one with a window, with nothing inside but a basketball court. 


	“You got to go to the box to get fresh air,” says Brandon, referring to the solitary confinement units on the eighth floor. He explains that on that floor, the rec center is outside. “It's a little cube with a cage around it, like a dog cage. You can look up and see the sky, if it's raining you could feel the rain.”


	But Brandon explains nobody wants to be in solitary confinement, where conditions are even worse than in general population. Sometimes, correctional officers leave the lights on in the tight cell for days, and if they perceive an inmate as having an attitude, Brandon says they use pepper spray through a slot in the cell door. (The Bureau of Prisons didn't respond to a request to comment about this specific allegation.)


	R. Kelly, who was found guilty of sex trafficking and racketeering charges in September 2021 and was held in MDC from June 2021 to July 2022, sued MDC in 2022 for placing him on suicide watch for what his lawyer claimed were “purely punitive reasons” that violated his Eighth Amendment rights because it was “cruel and unusual punishment.” 

	











	Kelly's 2022 lawsuit stated, “They cannot shower or shave and are sometimes not even afforded toilet paper. Meals are not provided with utensils, forcing inmates to eat with their hands. They have no ability to consult with loved ones or supportive figures. Ironically, individuals on ‘suicide watch' don't even receive psychiatric care.”


	The Bureau of Prisons said at the time that a staff psychologist placed Kelly on suicide watch after he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. When Rolling Stone reached out for comment on the multiple allegations about the conditions at MDC, they responded in an email that, “for privacy, safety, and security reasons” they could not speak about internal procedures, anecdotal allegations, or conditions of confinement. A public affairs representative added: “MDC Brooklyn takes seriously our duty to protect the individuals entrusted to our custody, as well as maintain the safety of correctional employees and the community.  We make every effort to ensure the physical safety and health of the individuals confined to our facilities through a controlled environment that is secure and humane.” 


	There have been a series of lawsuits against the detention center for inhumane conditions, particularly during the Covid pandemic. At least three federal judges in recent years have refused to send defendants to MDC because of the conditions and frequent lockdowns, which can leave inmates in their cells for days at a time with no access to showers. In January 2024, federal judge Jesse Furman issued a 19-page decision about MDC's conditions, citing a case in which the jail had refused to transport an inmate for surgery to repair his cheekbone, which another inmate had broken in a fight. The defendant had to have his cheek rebroken ahead of his surgery in order to heal properly.


	In August 2024, a federal judge from the Eastern District of New York said he'd identified “shocking instances of brutal violence” within MDC in just the previous five months, including two homicides, two stabbings, and an assault resulting in fractured eye socket. He highlighted an incident where three inmates stabbed another inmate 44 times in an “open area without supervision,” and the judge wrote the response to the event took an “unconscionably long time.”


	Just this past December, an inmate died in custody after MDC's medical staff missed a lung cancer diagnosis for an inmate complaining of chest pain. A jail doctor ordered a CT scan in early November 2023, and the test was delayed for months. The inmate wasn't told about the mass the CT found until the end of April 2024, after he was already coughing up blood and had repeatedly requested his test results.

	











	“The results were somehow missed by the health services department, and the delay was unfortunate,” the medical staff wrote in response to the missed diagnosis.


	Criminal defense attorney Anna Estevao says there have been multiple accounts of fatal medical diagnoses being missed. “The MDC has a long and documented history of inhumane conditions, including chronic overcrowding, severe understaffing, and woefully inadequate medical care,” Estevao tells me. She adds there have also been repeated reports of maggot-infested meals, and recently an inmate had to be treated medically for choking on a piece of plastic in his food. 


	Brandon says meals are served cold and often reused and repeated for days. “It's like if you take the chopped meat out of a taco from Taco Bell, rinse it off with water, leave it sitting in water for days and then put some gravy on it or add beans and then serve it,” he says. “Then the next day you have the beans and gravy in it, and you just put corn in and serve it again.”


	The Bureau of Prisons did not specifically respond to our request for comment on their food, but in the past they have cited their manual and said MDC “provides nutritionally adequate meals, prepared and served in a manner that meets established government health and safety codes.” They did previously admit in a court document that they'd found weevils in their beans.


	Combs' lawyers said he was threatened by an inmate with a shiv once. And Clarke says he's gone to see clients whose entire faces have changed from one visit to another because of the violent fights. Clarke says, “What people experience at MDC, it's not just punishment, it's neglect, chronic understaffing, systematic failure, dehumanization.”


	Rothfeld agrees. He won't comment on any specifics regarding his clients, but he's worked with people housed in both the east and west buildings of MDC as well as other facilities like Rikers, where he was held in 2016-17 for financial crimes. He believes “blame doesn't rest with the employees” and staff at MDC, it's a larger problem that needs systemic solutions. For several years, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General has issued reports about the challenges at the Federal Bureau of Prisons, including “staffing shortages and deteriorating infrastructure.”


	 “The prison system in general, whether federal or state, is a Byzantine black hole,” says Rothfeld, but he finds MDC particularly “draconian, cruel, and unsanitary.” 

	











	ON JAN. 6, HERNANDEZ livestreamed his last two hours of freedom with his friends on Adin Ross' YouTube channel. He joked to the controversial streamer he wanted to cook for Maduro, saying he would make him “spaghetti tacos.”


	Hernandez and his friends tried to keep it light as they took a limo to Sunset Park, belting out Justin Bieber's “Baby” and “Hold On” by Lil Tjay. Hernandez said he plans to read the Bible in prison, and will try to work out and lose weight.


	As they got closer, the mood changed. Hernandez got on the phone with someone and said in Spanish that he understands he's going to be in solitary his first week and that he's prepared for it.


	At 2 p.m., the rapper arrived at MDC to start serving the 90 days for violating the terms of his supervised release following his plea deal in the federal racketeering and firearms case. Hernandez's friends turned solemn after he walked into the hulking concrete detention center.

The parks and experiences chief succeeds Bob Iger, who is once again stepping aside from the entertainment giant.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The Walt Disney Co. has found its next CEO: Josh D'Amaro, the chairman of the company's experiences division.


	The entertainment giant formally revealed D'Amaro's promotion Tuesday morning, also elevating Dana Walden to president and chief creative officer.  The pair will move into their new roles on March 18, the same day Disney holds its annual meeting. D'Amaro will also be named to the company's board at that time.




	“Josh D'Amaro possesses that rare combination of inspiring leadership and innovation, a keen eye for strategic growth opportunities, and a deep passion for the Disney brand and its people – all of which make him the right person to take the helm as Disney's next CEO,” said James Gorman, chairman of Disney's board of directors. “Throughout this search process, Josh has demonstrated a strong vision for the company's future and a deep understanding of the creative spirit that makes Disney unique in an ever-changing marketplace. He has an outstanding record of business achievement, collaborating with some of the biggest names in entertainment to bring their stories to life in our parks, showcasing the power of combining Disney storytelling with cutting-edge technology. The Board believes he is exceptionally well prepared to guide this global company forward to serve our consumers around the world and create long-term value for shareholders.”

	“I am immensely grateful to the Board for entrusting me with leading a company that means so much to me and millions around the world,” said Josh D'Amaro. “Disney's strength has always come from our people and the creative excellence that defines our stories and experiences. There is no limit to what Disney can achieve, and I am excited to work with our teams across the company and brilliant creative partners to honor Disney's remarkable legacy while continuing to innovate, grow, and deliver exceptional value for our consumers and shareholders. I also want to express my gratitude to Bob Iger for his generous mentorship, his friendship, and the profound impact of his leadership.”

	Disney, with its long and illustrious history and dominating cultural influence, is seen as something of a bellwether for the entire entertainment industry, and the naming of a new CEO garners close attention from across the world of business.


	D'Amaro succeeds Iger, who will step aside from the top position once again, three years after returning to the company in 2022.


	“Josh D'Amaro is an exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO,” said Iger. “He has an instinctive appreciation of the Disney brand, and a deep understanding of what resonates with our audiences, paired with the rigor and attention to detail required to deliver some of our most ambitious projects. His ability to combine creativity with operational excellence is exemplary and I am thrilled for Josh and the company.”


	Iger was CEO of Disney from 2005 until 2020, when Bob Chapek (also a veteran of the theme park division) was named his successor in a move that stunned Wall Street and Hollywood, and seemed to come out of left field. A tumultuous few years however, punctuated by the COVID-19 pandemic, led to Iger's surprise return in late 2022.


	The ascension of D'Amaro bore little resemblance to the Chapek choice.


	Instead, D'Amaro's elevation to CEO also ends a years-long (and extremely public) succession bake-off, with D'Amaro, Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden frequently cited as the top internal candidates, and the Disney board, led by former Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, also exploring if there were any viable external candidates.

	











	By also elevating Walden, Gorman is taking a cue from his own experience at Morgan Stanley, where he held a public succession bake-off, and promoted the two candidates who ultimately did not get the CEO job, keeping them in the fold.


	“Dana Walden is an excellent leader who commands tremendous respect from the creative community,” Iger added. “Given that creativity is at the heart of everything Disney does, she is a wonderful choice to serve in this new leadership role. In the years since Dana joined Disney, she has accumulated great knowledge about the many facets of our businesses and brands, and is very well prepared to be president and chief creative officer.”


	Disney says that Walden's entertainment co-chair Alan Bergman, and ESPN chief Jimmy Pitaro, will continue working in their “critical” roles.


	Disney is an unusual company among the entertainment giants, because it has an experiences division that is a major financial force, and a major complexifier. D'Amaro was also tasked with overseeing a $60 billion expansion of that business, including a slew of new attractions based on well-known IP, multiple new cruise ships, and even a new theme park and resort in Abu Dhabi.


	The successful leadership of that division likely helped in his effort to succeed Iger.


	At the center of the company, however, is the studio: The content engine that feeds the rest of the company. And while D'Amaro is not a creative by trade, it is an area he made a point to highlight whenever he could.

	











	“This goes back to Walt when he envisioned what this company ultimately was going to be,” D'Amaro told The Hollywood Reporter last year. “He had storytelling and content in the middle and all of these businesses surrounding it, such that we could stay with the consumer, wherever they were, literally in the world.”


	D'Amaro also made a point of maintaining a close relationships with creatives at the company, something Chapek was not able to do.


	But his elevation will also end the Bob Iger era, with the executive set to serve as an adviser and board member only through the end of the year, when he will officially retire from the company.


	“On behalf of the entire Board, we extend our deepest gratitude to Bob Iger for his extraordinary leadership and dedication to The Walt Disney Company,” added Gorman. “The Board asked Bob to return as CEO in 2022 for two critical reasons. First, to lead the company through a challenging transition and ensure Disney was fit for purpose for the future. Second, to strengthen the leadership bench and to help develop candidates for the CEO transition. Bob has delivered on both priorities, while also guiding Disney through a transformative period with an ambitious strategy that has further strengthened its position as the world's premier entertainment company. After nearly two decades leading Disney, the Iger era has been defined by enormous growth, an unyielding commitment to excellence in creativity and innovation, and exemplary stewardship of this iconic institution.”

Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D'Amaro has been elevated to CEO of the Walt Disney Co., capping a closely watched multiyear process of identifying Bob Iger‘s successor.


Dana Walden, Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman, has been named President and Chief Creative Officer, a newly created role.


	Disney's board of directors voted unanimously on the moves, which were announced Tuesday and will take effect at the company's annual meeting March 18. The board also intends to add D'Amaro to the board at the meeting.


	Walden will report directly to D'Amaro. Iger is staying on as a senior advisor until the end of his current contract on December 31, surrendering the CEO title at the meeting.

	











	“Josh D'Amaro is an exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO,” Iger said in the official announcement. “He has an instinctive appreciation of the Disney brand, and a deep understanding of what resonates with our audiences, paired with the rigor and attention to detail required to deliver some of our most ambitious projects. His ability to combine creativity with operational excellence is exemplary and I am thrilled for Josh and the company.”

	Walden “is an excellent leader who commands tremendous respect from the creative community,” Iger added. “Given that creativity is at the heart of everything Disney does, she is a wonderful choice to serve in this new leadership role.”

	











	Disney Chairman James Gorman said D'Amaro “possesses that rare combination of inspiring leadership and innovation, a keen eye for strategic growth opportunities, and a deep passion for the Disney brand and its people – all of which make him the right person to take the helm as Disney's next CEO.”


	The press release announcing the moves did not include specifics about Walden's new duties. It said she will “ensure that storytelling and creative expression across every audience touchpoint consistently reflect the brand, engage audiences at scale, and advance core business objectives, while driving enterprise-wide initiatives and translating vision into action.”


	D'Amaro, 54, is a 28-year company veteran. He had been one of four internal CEO candidates, along with Walden, ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro and Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman. Pitaro and Bergman will continue to serve in their current posts, the company said.


	During the multiyear efforts of the Disney board's succession committee, a couple of names of external candidates briefly surfaced but did not appear to gain traction with the committee. With 231,000 global employees, a business spanning several continents and a singular consumer brand, Disney would present a formidable challenge for any outside leader. D'Amaro is just the eighth person to hold the title since the company's founding in 1923.


	The company had reportedly considered making D'Amaro and Walden Co-CEOs but ended up going the conventional solo route. While splitting the top job in two remains unusual in the corporate world, it has recently gained favor in entertainment, with Netflix, Comcast and Spotify adopting the structure.


	After joining Disney in 1998 in an exec role at Disneyland, D'Amaro has gone on to hold posts in the U.S. and internationally across finance, business strategy, marketing, creative development and operations. He was promoted to head the company's parks unit in 2020 and had to navigate through the months-long shutdowns and uncertainty of Covid. His past positions include Chief Financial Officer of Disney Consumer Products Global Licensing, and president of Disneyland and Walt Disney World in Florida. A Boston native, D'Amaro graduated from Georgetown.


	Walden and Bergman were named co-heads of the entertainment unit in 2023 after Iger restructured the company to give studio execs more responsibility in streaming. Her portfolio has included the operations of ABC, Disney Television Studios and FX as well as direct-to-consumer, technology and ad sales groups, along with international content and operations.


	Under Walden, who came to Disney in 2019 after the company acquired most of 21st Century Fox (where she was CEO of Fox Television Group), ABC has been the No. 1 entertainment network for the past four years. Among the notable titles she has shepherded are ABC comedy series Abbott Elementary and Hulu's Only Murders in the Building. Known for her way with talent, the former publicist earned a public shout-out from Jimmy Kimmel last fall for navigating a challenging sequence of events with his late-night show. Jimmy Kimmel Live! was pulled off the air for several days after an uproar over an aside in Kimmel's monologue about the reaction among many Donald Trump supporters to the murder of Charlie Kirk.


	The Disney succession process was spearheaded by Gorman, the veteran finance executive who became chairman of the company's board of directors last year. Gorman was CEO of Morgan Stanley from 2010 to 2023. He won points at the bank and on Wall Street with his deft handling of his own succession process, a task that Disney has notably struggled with since Michael Eisner clung to power in the early 2000s.

	











	Iger, 74, reversed his own stated retirement plans multiple times during his initial tenure as CEO, which began in 2006, before finally departing in 2020. The decision at the time to give the top job to Disney veteran Bob Chapek, best known for his stints in the company's home entertainment, consumer products and theme park units, backfired after Chapek made a number of missteps.


	Chapek's miscues were magnified because Iger didn't fully exit the organization. Instead, he stayed on as executive chairman for nearly a year and retained the nebulous duty of “directing creative endeavors” at the company. After Chapek was ousted by the board in 2022, Iger returned to the corner office, with a more robust structure around the effort to determine who would lead the company after his contract expires at the end of 2026. Nearly six years after Iger's seismic move – which stunned the media and business worlds and came just prior to the devastation of Covid and when the exec was well shy of his 70th birthday – his motivations to leave remain largely a mystery.


	Parks, resorts, cruise ships and other components of the Experiences division have become a reliable growth engine for Disney, which in 2023 announced plans to invest $60 billion on the segment over 10 years. One marquee project is a new theme park planned for the Middle Eastern emirate of Abu Dhabi. Apps and video games are also under Experiences, meaning D'Amaro managed the company's relationship with Epic Games, encouraging Iger to back the plan to take an equity stake in the company in 2023. Revenue in the Experiences segment grew 6% in fiscal 2025 compared with the prior year, finishing at $36.2 billion. Entertainment revenue grew 3% to $42.5 billion.


	Artificial intelligence will be the next frontier for Disney, with the technology now being deployed in parks and in some aspects of film and TV production. After threatening legal action against Google and suing a smaller AI player, Midjourney, Disney last December stunned the entertainment and tech sectors by investing in OpenAI and granting the Sora video platform maker licenses to select characters. Tensions between AI firms and Hollywood remain, though, with above-the-line guilds soon to start contract talks with Disney and other studios and streamers.


	As Iger himself has conceded, the role of Disney CEO has gotten far more complex and challenging in recent years, as Disney and other traditional media companies have sought to respond to competition from Silicon Valley. Disney's post-Iger leaders will face number of headaches, including managing ongoing declines in linear TV, coping with the surging cost of sports rights and refining the strategy in streaming. During Iger's first stint as CEO, he spearheaded a number of moves, chief among them the $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox, as the legacy media player committed to direct-to-consumer streaming.


	While Disney's overall streaming business has turned a profit within the past year, the margins and future economic profile of streaming remain murky for all recent challengers to Netflix.


	Iger left his first chapter as CEO as perhaps one of the most widely respected executives in corporate America. In the fall of 2019, he published his memoir, The Ride of a Lifetime, in which he recounted accomplishments like the string of acquisitions of Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel.


	Soon after returning, however, Iger was confronted by a proxy battle waged by activist investor Nelson Peltz. Believing the company had lost its way in many areas, Peltz spent tens of millions of dollars in an effort to get multiple execs added to Disney's board of directors. He also repeatedly criticized Disney for being inefficient and too wedded to its past.

	











	Iger and Disney ultimately prevailed in the fight, which fizzled out in early 2023 after at one point seeming to threaten Iger's legacy. One key move initiated by Iger in 2022, as the proxy war was heating up, was initiating multiple rounds of cost cuts and layoffs. Ultimately, those cutbacks achieved $7.5 billion in cost savings, well north of the initial target of $5.5 billion, according to the company. In all, about 7,000 employees were affected, among them numerous long-tenured executives in Burbank and a host of familiar on-air faces on ESPN.


	Iger fielded numerous succession questions from Wall Street analysts during Disney's quarterly earnings call Monday morning. He was invited to offer advice to his successor and reflect on his return and the state of the company as the management baton pass unfolds.


	“The good news is that the company is in much better shape today than it was three years ago,” he said. “We have done a lot of fixing but also put in place a number of opportunities. In a world that changes as much as it does, in some form or another trying to preserve the status quo is a mistake and I'm certain my successor will not do that.”

hmmmmm…… a little to late. As much as I admire what Disney was able to accomplish, they did miss a critical opportunity, as time will tell shortly. Time to bring in the consolidator to finalize this story…. Apple

The Apple has been too far from the tree for decades.  I didn't even realize that rumor still had a heartbeat…

It's a shame, I still feel Dana would have been a better choice for CEO…

As Disney executives collect their badges for what division they ran, the parks, consumer products, etc., “Experiences” is a powerful one.

100% – Dana was made for the job and consistently proved to be an exec who spearheaded incredibly successful endeavors. Perhaps because she didn't have “PARK” experience was the reason, but I think it's easier to have park experience than film & Tv experience.

The Svedka spot features LLM robots and synthetic people. Get ready for the Slopper Bowl?


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	The fembot has been prompted.Svedka's famous robot character, gone from pop culture for nearly 13 years, has returned to the brand's ad campaigns recently and will now appear in a Super Bowl commercial. The catch? Pretty much the whole spot has been created with AI.The 30-second commercial features Fembot and her new companion Brobot as they dance in front of a group of human partiers while discovering  Svedka products within their casing, in a video that was almost entirely prompted by AI instead of conventionally shot. The pair's TikTok-y dance was selected from among a slew of user submissions as part of a contest (it was won by a 23-year-old Nashville native named Jessica Rizzardi), which puts the commercial at the nexus of more than just one tech-platform trend. Svedka owner Sazerac is touting the spot as the first known Super Bowl ad created “primarily” through AI.

	“We always knew we were signing up for risk because a vodka ad in the Super Bowl is polarizing to a certain degree,” Sara Saunders, chief marketing officer at Sazerac, told The Hollywood Reporter. “So the rest of it was ‘we might as well create conversation.'”




			Related Video		







	An even further irony: despite the AI auspices, the ad is meant to suggest the importance of putting down the tech and getting out there to dance and meet people the analogue way. (The message is subtly coded when Brobot drinks Svedka and short-circuits.) “The entire idea of the campaign is that the robots have returned to remind the humans to be more human,” Saunders said. “Our message is ultimately pro-human.”

	











	Vodka is indeed a bit of a lift for a broad Super Bowl ad — the game usually features beer commercials, not plugs for harder drinks (Smirnoff is joining Svedka as the first vodka brand to advertise at the game in three decades). And because vodka itself isn't a product with as many built-in possibilities as some other products, the company decided to lean in to the techno aspects. “It's odorless, it's colorless  — we needed something that would go the other way,” said Saunders. The AI shaping of the robots' moves, she added, did offer more humanistically expressive possibilities than conventional animation.Saunders said the ad didn't save as much money and certainly not a ton of time compared to a conventional shoot; the company chose to make the ad this way because of the aesthetic and thematic value. “For us its never been an efficiency play, it's been a storytelling play; that's why we've always had strong hands on the keyboard,” she said of the spot, which will air just after halftime.


	The milestone is a culmination of an increasingly AI presence in Big Sports advertising. Last year's Super Bowl featured a number of commercials promoting the power of AI, like a Google Pixel commercial in which a father preparing for a job interview is guided through the process by Gemini, while the NBA Finals this summer showcased an online ad for Kalshi that ran through a series of whacked-out AI-generated memes. LLM-driven robots is pretty much the only place this could go.Other Super Bowl spots this year will use AI, but as more of a tool, like to change the appearance of characters from Jurassic Park or of the visage of Guy Fieri. And there will be ads from chatbot companies themselves, like a reported 60-second OpenAI spot. But a full tableau of AI images appears to be Svedka's domain alone.  GenAI has become an increasingly large force in other big-budget ad campaigns, with equally forceful criticism to match. This holiday season Coca-Cola tried an AI ad that saw a slew of animals reacting to a convoy of beverage trucks. The company said it was the future;  many viewers weren't so sure. (One of the studios involved in the soft-drink ad, Silveside AI, was the studio behind the Svedka ad.)Advertising experts say there will be more ads made with AI throughout the year as brands seek to cut costs. The Super Bowl, a place not known for cost-cutting, is thus a strange place to see content of a more slop-ified shade. But its presence there will almost certainly open the door to other high-profile uses. As for this particular airing, a backlash isn't out of the question, though that doesn't mean viewers won't be watching or talking about the ad, which in the upside-down logic of Madison Avenue can sometimes bring more value than a genially tolerated ad that everyone forgets.


	Asked about the potential for criticism, Saunders made few bones. “We expect it and we welcome it,” she said, smiling. “We think that [the question of humans vs. technology] is a dialogue we should be having no matter which side you're on.”

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Oscar nominee Benedict Cumberbatch has been set to star in thriller Last Flight, in which he will portray a U.S. man who helped persecuted people find safe passage out of Iraq and Afghanistan.


	BAFTA-winner Babak Anvari (Under The Shadow) is directing the movie, which is based on a script by one of the inspirations for the film, Kirk Wallace Johnson.


	Johnson is an author and former USAID (United States Agency for International Development) coordinator who assisted in the reconstruction of Fallujah in Iraq, and the founder of the List Project, a charity resettling Iraqis who assisted the allies in the war. After returning from Iraq with PTSD, he worked closely with Senator Ted Kennedy to create the Special Immigrant Visa program, designated for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for the U.S. during the conflicts.

	Johnson's script “unfolds over the final days of a twenty-year war. The film follows Ali, a young Afghan man, who is fighting for his entire family's life to find safe passage out of Afghanistan, before he is sent to certain death. To reach the border, he must put his trust in Kirk Johnson, an American stranger 7,000 miles away who is desperately trying to put the war behind him.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Filming is being lined up for May 2026 in the UK, Morocco and Jordan.


	The project is produced by Two & Two (I Came By) and Cumberbatch's SunnyMarch (We Live In Time); Lucan Toh and Babak Anvari are producing for Two & Two, and Leah Clarke and Adam Ackland are producing for SunnyMarch. The Imitation Game and Doctor Strange star Cumberbatch will serve as an executive producer for SunnyMarch and Dave Bishop, George Hamilton and James Pugh from Protagonist Pictures will also serve as executive producers. WME Independent is representing U.S. distribution rights.

	











	“Last Flight is a rare thriller that combines relentless edge of your seat tension with profound humanity,” said Protagonist Pictures CEO Dave Bishop. “Babak Anvari brings extraordinary urgency and compassion to this story, grounding its high-stakes momentum in the deeply human choices that define us. Benedict Cumberbatch will undoubtedly bring the intelligence, depth, and moral complexity this role demands. It's an important story that speaks directly to our moment: a story about trust, responsibility, and the enduring bonds between people across borders. We're incredibly proud to be introducing the project to buyers at EFM.”


	British-Iranian filmmaker Anvari commented: “This story is deeply personal to me. I come from the region, and what sits behind Last Flight is immediate and lived. It is a thriller built on pressure, momentum, and impossible choices, always driven by human consequence. I have admired Benedict Cumberbatch for years, and having him at the centre of this film is incredibly exciting. He brings a rare presence that makes the stakes feel urgent and alive.” 


	“Last Flight is a moving, wild ride that is also a galvanising call to action: it reminds us that, even if you're on the other side of the world and all you have is a phone, an internet connection, and a desire to help, you can make a difference,” added Two & Two and SunnyMarch.

Jon Stewart delved into the newly released batch of Jeffrey Epstein files on the latest episode of The Daily Show, noting that it feels like this has already happened.


	“Yup, it's Groundhog Day,” Stewart said. “We call it Groundhog Day because this is the day when Donald Trump sees Epstein's shadow, and we get six more weeks of not knowing who any of the co-conspirators are in this multinational sex trafficking case. And, also, because Punxsutawney Phil is all over the files.”


	He added, “The point I'm trying to make is the Epstein files thing? We've been through this before.” Stewart then playing several news clips that wondered whether the documents would “break MAGA.”


	“The chances of this breaking MAGA are actually worse than Trump just lowering the age of consent to be done with the whole fucking thing,” Stewart added. “Which is not to say there isn't awful shit in this new Epstein dump.”


	The late-night host recounted some of the names in the new files, including Steve Bannon, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, Brett Ratner, Prince Andrew, and Richard Branson. Trump's name, of course, was also in the files with “thousands of mentions.” Stewart admitted that he himself is in the files.

	“This is actually true,” he said before explaining why. “I take you to the scene. It is midnight. Aug. 29, 2015. Jeffrey Epstein lies wide awake, his mind turning with ideas. He jots a quick note to a producer named Barry Josephson, saying, ‘I suggested to Woody [Allen]' — y'all know which Woody, right? It's the Epstein files, it ain't Harrelson, or the cowboy from Toy Story. You know which one — quote: ‘I suggested to Woody that he do an exclusive new stand-up routine for either Apple TV or Amazon.'”

	











	He continued, “Oh, Jeffrey Epstein always had his finger on the pulse of what America was clamoring for in 2015. But Barry Josephson, thinking like the out-of-the-box television professional that he was, pitched this idea. This is true, quote: ‘Make a true biographical experience with his stand-up being the capper. Somebody like Jon Stewart could host/narrate the biographical part.'”

	Stewart added, “Excuse me? I am offended. Somebody like Jon Stewart, or Jon Stewart? My point is, do I have the offer, or is this an audition?”


	Despite the breadth of new information, Stewart reminded there are still many more files yet to be released. “Look, man, we always knew that the people at DOJ releasing these documents weren't on a fact-finding mission; they were running interference,” he noted. “And the guy they're running interference for seems very satisfied with these results.”


	Stewart concluded his monologue by comparing the lack of legal accountability for those named in the Epstein files and Trump's current ICE takeover. Despite all of the information about notable public figures in the files, there is nothing that could lead to a prosecution.

	“Nothing has happened to any of them,” Stewart said. “Oh, except Prince Andrew … I'm just not sure anybody is going to be held accountable for any of this.”


	He continued, “After watching the politically well-connected skirt any form of legal accountability for horrible fucking crimes, it seems pretty clear to me that there is a sanctuary city in this country,” Stewart said. “But guess what, this kid don't live in it. The real sanctuary city is where money and power protect you from the consequences of sex trafficking, or influence peddling, or taking half a billion dollars and giving away America's AI infrastructure. Not the small Midwestern city where trying to help a lady get up after she gets maced gets you shot in the back of the fucking head.”

	Chuck Negron, one of the founding members and lead singer of rock hounds Three Dog Night, died on Monday. He was 83.


	Negron passed away at his home in Studio City, California, surrounded by family, according to a representative for the artist. Although a cause of death was not given, a statement said that the singer battled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, for decades, and in his final months suffered from heart failure.


	Born in Manhattan on June 8, 1942, Negron sang in doo-wop groups and played basketball while growing up in the Bronx. After high school, he was recruited to play basketball at Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, California, and later at California State University in Los Angeles.


	After landing in Los Angeles, Negron began exploring Hollywood's music industry, and in 1967, he founded Three Dog Night with fellow singers Danny Hutton and Cory Wells. With roots in R&B, rock & roll, and doo wop, the group would land its first big hit with “One (Is the Loneliest Number),” written by Harry Nilsson, and it peaked at Number Five on the Billboard Hot 100. The band would go on to garner 21 consecutive Top 40 hits between 1969 and 1975 through songs written by other musicians, including two-time Grammy-nominated “Joy to the World” (Hoyt Axton), Eli's Coming” (Laura Nyro), “Mama Told Me Not to Come” (Randy Newman), and “An Old-Fashioned Love Song” (Paul Williams).

	











	In a 1972 Rolling Stone cover story, Three Dog Night were described as “the discoverers, in the sense that they put them on the pop charts, of Nyro, Nilsson, Newman, and even Elton John and Bernie Taupin,” noting that any song the group put on an album “is liable to become a hit single by album airplay and radio station responses.” At the time, as the band began selling out every headlining show, Three Dog Night were out-grossing the likes of Sly and the Family Stone, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elvis Presley, and even the Rolling Stones.

	Then, at the height of the band's career, the wild success broke down due to Negron's struggles with drug abuse and heroin addiction. For a time, the singer lived on Los Angeles' skid row after losing the millions he had made on drugs. The group disbanded in 1976 and reunited in 1982 before breaking up again in 1985 following Negron's relapse. Hutton and Wells continued under the Three Dog Night banner, and Hutton, the lone original member, still tours today.

	After 37 stints in rehab and 13 years, Negron was able to get clean in 1991 and launched a solo career, releasing seven albums between 1995 and 2017. He documented his journey's vast highs and lows in his 1999 book, Three Dog Nightmare.


	In 2015, Wells died from blood cancer. After decades of estrangement from Hutton, Negron and Hutton met last year “in a timely effort to exchange apologies and bury the hatchet,” according to a statement.

	In a 1998 interview with the Las Vegas Sun, Negron reflected on what he wanted out of life at that point in his career. “I've learned that for me, going out there and trying to make 50 No. 1 records or sell another 90 million records won't do anything for me,” he said. “I know what fixes me: Doing the work, being a musician … earning a living, taking care of my family and having my priorities in order.


	“You must find some peace inside; you must come to terms with the gifts you have, the faults you have … and learn to embrace your life,” said the singer. “I'm getting more out of life than I ever have because of that.”

“Today” host Savannah Guthrie is begging for prayers amid her mom Nancy Guthrie's disappearance. 

Savannah took to social media on Monday, February 2, to beg fans to continue praying for her mother's safe return. 

“We believe in prayer. We believe in voices raised in unison, in love, in hope. We believe in goodness. We believe in humanity. Above all, we believe in Him,” she began. 

Guthrie continued, “Thank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy, a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant. Raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment.”

“We need you,” the host pleaded. “Bring her home.”

Guthrie was last seen on Saturday evening when she had dinner with her eldest daughter, Annie, likely to celebrate her 84th birthday. 

After a friend noticed she was absent from church on Sunday, Nancy's children were contacted. They quickly realized something was wrong and contacted authorities. 

According to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos, the mother of three was likely “harmed” as she was abducted from her bed. 

“[Nanos] would not tell us the extent of those injuries,” NBC News reporter Liz Kreutz said on Monday, February 2. “I was just in the neighborhood where this happened with some members of the community driving around with a photo of Nancy, desperately trying to find anyone who may have seen her.”

The family revealed that Nancy is without her life-saving medication, which Nanos explained “could be fatal.”

Guthrie's disappearance is “not dementia-related,” the Sheriff said during a press conference. “She's very alert, of good, sound mind — just some physical ailments that limit her ability to move around.”

Despite being described as “sharp as a tack,” Nanos added, “From what the family has told us and everything we have learned, she could not walk out of that home 50 yards. We believe she was taken out of the home against her will, and that is how this investigation is moving.”

The “Today” host shared a statement with her colleagues on Monday, thanking investigators and fans for their support. 

“On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers, and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom,” the statement read. “We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff's Department at 520-351-4900.”

The former CNN anchor went on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to speak about his recent arrest stemming from his reporting of an anti-ICE protest at a Minnesota church.

Don Lemon is speaking out following his arrest last week over his reporting of an anti-ICE protest at a Minnesota church last month.


	The former CNN anchor and journalist went on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday, where he shared that he's doing “OK” after the arrest, adding, “I'm not going to let them steal my joy, but this is very serious. I mean, these are federal criminal charges.”




	Host Jimmy Kimmel asked in a follow-up question, “Is there a difference between whether those protesters had the right to go into a church and whether a credentialed journalist like yourself had the right to go in and cover them going into the church?”

	“I'm in the middle of this, so I can't say a lot,” Lemon replied. “There's a lot that I cannot say, but what I will say is that I'm not a protester. I went there to be a journalist. I went there to chronicle and document and record what was happening. I was following that one group around. And so that's what I did. I reported on them. But I do think that there is a difference between a protester and a journalist.”

	After Lemon recalled details of how his arrest went down in Los Angeles, Kimmel jokingly asked, “Who did you make your one phone call to?”


	“Here's the interesting thing. I didn't have a ‘one phone call,'” the journalist confirmed. “I asked them, ‘Do I get my one phone call, Jimmy?' They said, ‘No, you don't. You get to talk to your attorney whenever the court says that you can.' And so that wasn't until the next day,” following his night in a holding room.

	











	Later in his chat with Kimmel, Lemon also thanked “everybody for all of their support, especially the journalists, especially the people out there. I mean, it's been amazing just walking down the street or wherever I am and people will say, ‘It's good to see you.' I said, ‘Yeah, it's good to be seen,' but it's a lot of support.”


	Last week, Lemon was arrested following his reporting of an anti-ICE protest that took place in a Minnesota church during Sunday services on Jan. 18. He shared videos on his social media accounts of him interviewing protesters before they interrupted the service, chanting “ICE out” and demanding justice for Renee Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent last month. One of the church officials also allegedly worked at a local ICE office.


	The former CNN anchor was charged with violating federal laws by allegedly crossing a line from activity protected by the First Amendment to impeding others' rights to practice their religious beliefs.


	Following his arrest, Lemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, shared in a statement at the time, “Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done. The First Amendment exists to protect journalists whose role it is to shine light on the truth and hold those in power accountable. There is no more important time for people like Don to be doing this work.”

	











	During a hearing at a downtown Los Angeles courthouse on Jan. 30, a judge allowed Lemon to be released on a no money bond. Lemon's attorney said he later intends to plead not guilty.


	Once videos of the protesters interrupting the church service started circulating on social media, some people quickly criticized it, including rapper Nicki Minaj, who has publicly aligned herself with President Donald Trump in recent months.


She even called Lemon a homophobic slur over his reports on ICE protests, to which the former anchor snapped back at Minaj, calling her a “homophobic, bigoted, ignorant woman.”

The Daily Show isn't above conspiracy theories. Hell, they recently hired Whitney Cummings, who has been crashing out on all sorts of made-up shit for the last few years, ranting about how COVID-19 was a bioweapon and that she thinks homeless people were paid to start the Los Angeles wildfires. But we digress. Not even Jon Stewart is immune to going off about the widely discredited “lab leak” theory every now and then. When it comes to the granddaddy of conspiracy theories, the secret cabal of billionaire pedophiles, all roads lead to Epstein. After the Department of Justice released millions of pages of correspondence between Epstein and the world's richest and most powerful passengers of the Lolita Express, it became clear that Epstein spent the last two decades of his life attempting to send the world into chaos. It worked, and in the end, he's probably going to get away with it.



On a new Daily Show, Stewart spent the main segment going through some of the more humorous revelations of the Epstein files. He played the hits: Elon Musk spending Christmas Day begging Epstein for an island invite; Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick announcing that he never had anything to do with Epstein after 2005, only to spend many sleepless nights emailing the most notorious sex trafficker in history. The host even found his own name in the files when a producer corresponding with Epstein suggested that Stewart narrate a Woody Allen documentary. But after creating a penis-shaped map of the powerful participants in Epstein's orbit, Stewart can't find any path to justice for the girls and women Epstein abused. With the Trump DOJ essentially saying the Epstein investigation is over, it's hard to imagine anyone facing any consequences for asking Epstein about girls or visiting him on pedophile island. The administration would rather focus on defunding Sanctuary Cities and sending masked agents to cities around the country to kidnap and kill people.

“None of these dudes—they've been on the plane. They've been on the island. They've been to his house. They've given him creepy cards with pubic hair. They've been accused by a multitude of women of a multitude of wrongdoings, and nothing has happened to any of them,” Stewart says. “I gotta be honest, I'm just not sure anybody is going to be held accountable for any of this.”

In addition to discussing Epstein, Stewart also interviewed Heather Ann Thompson, whose new book, Fear And Fury: The Reagan Eighties, The Bernie Goetz Shootings, And The Rebirth Of White Rage, has more than a few parallels with our current hellscape.

We think we've found the cure for the Deep Hurting that's plaguing society. Announced earlier today, the RiffTrax crew will be returning to the Satellite of Love for four brand-new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Mystery Science Theater 3000: The RiffTrax Experiments will celebrate RiffTrax's 20 years of movie mockery by bringing Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett, and Kevin Murphy back to where their journey began, aboard a spaceship where they're forced to watch schlock until they go insane. This also means the return of the original voices of Tom Servo and Crow, with Corbett and Murphy shoving their hands up the butts of their beloved plastic bots and controlling their characters once again.

Since the show ended in 1999, Mystery Science Theater split into various movie-commentary groups, including Cinematic Titanic, RiffTrax, and MST3K. RiffTrax launched in 2006, releasing movie commentary tracks as digital downloads, and MST3K returned on Netflix in 2017 for a few seasons before launching its own platform, the Gizmoplex, in 2021. Earlier this year, show creator Joel Hodgson sold the property to Radial Entertainment, the company formed by the merger of Shout! Studios and FilmRise. It had previously been owned by Hodgson and Shout! since 2015. “Creating your own comedic art form like MST3K is deeply fulfilling and fun—but that doesn't mean I'm required to work on it every day for the rest of my life,” Hodgson said of the sale. “This move feels like the best way to encourage MST3K to find its future, while I find mine, including the chance to focus on some new and different projects with fewer moving parts.” Unfortunately, all this good news means there will be no RiffTrax live shows this year. Fans will have to settle for one of the new MST3K episodes landing in theaters as a Fathom Event later this year.

Like many MST3K projects before it, this one will be crowdfunded. The crew launched a Kickstarter for the new episodes, which they plan to produce in Minnesota this year for a 2026 release. For more information on rewards, contributing, and updates, visit Kickstarter.

Kelly Clarkson, the shining light in the valley of daytime chat shows dominated by The View, has announced the end of her long-running talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show. With the show currently entering its seventh season, Clarkson says she will continue through the rest of the season and deliver the final installment of Kellyoke in the fall. She didn't announce a big reason for leaving the show, aside from simply “stepping away” from the rise-and-grind lifestyle of maintaining a cheerful demeanor for celebrities and the viewers who find warmth in her glow, so she can “prioritize” her kids. It's hard to fault her for that, especially when, as she says, “[it] feels necessary and right for this next chapter of our lives.”

​​”I have been extremely fortunate to work with such an outstanding group of people at The Kelly Clarkson Show, both in Los Angeles and New York,” Clarkson said in a statement. “There have been so many amazing moments and shows over these seven seasons. I am forever grateful and honored to have worked alongside the greatest band and crew you could hope for, all the talent and inspiring people who have shared their time and lives with us, all the fans who have supported our show and to NBC for always being such a supportive and incredible partner. Because of all of that, this was not an easy decision, but this season will be my last hosting The Kelly Clarkson Show.”

While she's so moving on from the talk show circuit, Clarkson promises, “This isn't goodbye, I'll still be making music, playing shows here and there and you may catch me on The Voice from time to time.” More threateningly, she warns, “…you never know where I might show up next.” This is how you make an exit: Give a heartfelt farewell while reminding your enemies that you can strike at any moment. Sun Tzu would be proud.

Though it feels like The Kelly Clarkson Show has always been with us, it actually premiered less than a decade ago, in 2019. She's reportedly been trying to get out of the show for a while and was waiting for her contract to expire so she could devote more time to her kids at one of her many homes across the South. Sadly, we only have a few more months left of hearing what Kelly's Liking on social media before we have to visit one of these hellsites to find out. In the meantime, chat, what do we think the final Kellyoke jam will be? Keep in mind, she's already crushed “Return Of The Mack.”

The NFL commissioner is asked whether Bunny would make a political statement during halftime, like he did at Sunday's Grammys.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	While Bad Bunny used one of his Grammy acceptance speeches on Sunday night to condemn escalated operations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents across the country, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell doesn't seem to be expecting to hear the same message this Super Bowl Sunday.


	During a pre-Super Bowl press conference on Monday (Feb. 2), Goodell was asked a two-part question: whether he expected ICE agents to be present at Super Bowl events around San Francisco or at Levi's Stadium during Sunday's game and whether he thought Bad Bunny would repeat the same anti-ICE sentiment of his Grammy speech during the halftime show.

	











	After saying he expects the same high security standard at and around the game as any other year, Goodell conveyed to reporters that the Super Bowl is not a time for divisive political statements — and said he believed Bad Bunny “understood” that assignment.op


	“Bad Bunny – I think it was demonstrated last night – is one of the greatest artists in the world,” Goodell said of Bunny, who picked up three new Grammy Awards on Sunday night, including album of the year for Debí Tirar Más Fotos. “That's one of the reasons we chose him. But the other reason is that he understood the platform he was on. This platform is used to unite people, to be able to bring people together with their creativity and their talents and to be able to use this moment to do that. And I think artists in the past have done that. I think Bad Bunny understands that, and I think he'll have a great performance.”

	











	When Bunny made his first speech at Sunday's Grammys telecast, accepting best música urbana album for DTMF, he started by referencing the “ICE Out” message worn by dozens of musicians on small black-and-white buttons that night.


	“Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say ICE Out!” he declared as the room gave him a standing ovation. “We're not savages, we're not animals, we are not aliens; we are humans and we are Americans. I know it's tough not to hate on these days. … The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. We don't hate them. We love our people, we love our family, and that's the way to do it. We love. That's the way to do it. Thank God, and thanks to the academy.”

Savannah Guthrie's mom, Nancy Guthrie, was likely “harmed” when she was taken from her home outside of Tucson, Arizona, according to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos.

“[Nanos] would not tell us the extent of those injuries,” NBC News reporter Liz Kreutz said in a special report on Monday, February 2. “I was just in the neighborhood where this happened with some members of the community driving around with a photo of Nancy, desperately trying to find anyone who may have seen her.”

Authorities are calling the search for the 84-year-old a “race against time,” as she is without her life-saving medication. 

“From what the family has told us and everything we have learned, she could not walk out of that home 50 yards,” Nanos told NBC News. “We believe she was taken out of the home against her will, and that is how this investigation is moving.”

He continued, “Look, if she is alive right now, her meds are vital. I can't stress that enough, you know. I has been better than 24 hours, and the family tells us, if she doesn't have those meds, it could be fatal.”

Nanos went on to confirm that Guthrie was believed to have been abducted from her bed.

“I can't think of the last time where, in the middle of the night, in someone's bed, an 84-year-old woman disappeared on us,” he continued. “That's a challenge for us. We just want her back.”

The mother of the beloved “Today” host was last seen Saturday evening at her home. She was reported missing around noon on Sunday, February 1, after a friend noticed she had missed church that morning. 

After reaching out to Guthrie's children, they visited her home and “did some searching and realized, ‘We need some help,' and they called 911.”

Despite needing daily medication, Nanos explained that Guthrie's disappearance is “not dementia-related.”

“She's very alert, of good, sound mind — just some physical ailments that limit her ability to move around,: Nanos said during a Monday press conference, calling her “sharp as a tack.”

The Guthrie family released a statement thanking law enforcement and fans for their love and support.

“On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers, and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom,” the statement, which was shared on the “Today” show read. “We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff's Department at 520-351-4900.”

Debmar-Mercury says it will try to explore alternatives for the program on other platforms.


							By

	Another syndicated daytime talk show will end its run after this season.


	Debmar-Mercury, the Lionsgate-owned syndicated TV production company, says that it is canceling Sherri, the talker hosted by Sherri Shepherd, after four seasons.




	“This decision is driven by the evolving daytime television landscape and does not reflect on the strength of the show, its production — which has found strong creative momentum this season — or the incredibly talented Sherri Shepherd,” said Debmar-Mercury co-presidents Ira Bernstein and Mort Marcus in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “We believe in this show and in Sherri and intend to explore alternatives for it on other platforms.”

	Production on Sherri's fourth season will continue as planned, with the final episodes slated to air this fall.


	The news of Sherri's cancellation came just hours after NBCUniversal announced plans to sunset The Kelly Clarkson Show after seven seasons. As the Debmar-Mercury executives noted, the marketplace for daytime talk shows (and frankly, TV talk shows in general) has deteriorated in recent years amid pay-TV declines, a challenging advertising environment and fierce competition from video podcasts on platforms like YouTube.


	While daytime talk show hosts were once some of the most prominent people in all of TV (just ask Oprah Winfrey or Ellen DeGeneres) the market has cooled off in recent years. It is not clear what other platforms the production company could pursue for the show or if it would retain its format.


Sherri debuted in 2022, with the comedian delivering celebrity interviews, pop culture talk and comedy bits typical of the genre. The show utilized the Fox TV stations as a primary affiliate partner in the major cities, with Nexstar, Hearst and Sinclair also picking it up in smaller markets.

Assistant Editor


Netflix is getting in the BTS business. 


	The K-pop supergroup is set to make their long-awaited return in March, releasing their first album in years, Arirang, following their group hiatus so the members could complete their mandatory military service in Korea. 




	Netflix announced BTS The Comeback Live | Arirang on Monday, a special live stream performance of the seven-member group, which will stream on the platform on March 21. The live stream — the first global performance of the album, which is being released on March 20 — is being broadcast live from Gwanghwamun, a well-known Seoul landmark offering views of the city's iconic Gyeongbokgung palace.

	The seven-member K-pop supergroup is also preparing to embark on their first full-scale, all-group tour in years. The tour, spanning 2026 and 2027, will hit Asia, North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, making it one of the most expansive tours of the group's career.


	The tour will kick off with three nights in Goyang, South Korea, before heading to Tokyo for two nights. BTS is set to then head to the U.S. for a stop in Tampa. The group then zigzags around the world with U.S. stops sprinkled throughout. The group is anticipated to make 79 stops.

	











	After their supersized sold-out 2021 Permission to Dance on Stage engagements in Los Angeles, the group is set to make their return to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood on Sept. 1-2 and Sept. 5-6. The tour will feature a 360-degree, in-the-round stage design, making for an immersive experience for the audience.


BTS The Comeback | Arirang will stream on March 21 at 8 p.m. Korean standard time, which is 3 a.m. PT and 6 a.m. ET

Supernatural needs to come back as an animated series. That's the only way a revival could truly capture the magic of the original series' run. Fans aren't ready to move on from Sam and Dean yet, but only an animated show presents the opportunity to spend more time with the Winchester brothers as fans know and love them. 

The new Supernatural comic series from author Greg Pak and publisher Dynamite Entertainment is set during Season One of the show. 

The book's early issues have had their moments, but they also expose the limits of adapting Supernatural to the page. Which, in turn, makes the solution that much more obvious. 

Dynamite Entertainment's new ongoing Supernatural series is designed to be a series of standalone "Monster of the Week" stories, set during the first season of the series. This is one huge benefit of continuing the franchise in the comic medium: Sam and Dean can be young again. The comic doesn't have to be a sequel, or a reboot. 

The Supernatural comic has had its exciting moments so far. Most of all, author Greg Pak has nailed the dialogue and dynamic between Sam and Dean from the start. It leans into the campier side of Supernatural, but not necessarily in a bad way. Where the comic's initial issues have faltered has been a matter of pacing. 

As a network TV show, Supernatural episodes methodically clock in at around the 42-44 minute mark. Dynamite's Supernatural comic is in the 22-25 page range. A comic was never going to precisely capture the pacing of the show, but the stories so far have seemed especially compressed and, at times, choppy. 

Resurrecting Supernatural on television isn't as easy as bringing Sam or Dean back from the dead...Which brings us to the one "have your cake and eat it too" scenario: an animated series. 

That isn't to say the series can't find its footing as it continues. It does, however, highlight the fact that Supernatural stories need room to breathe. That's one big reason the franchise thrived in the TV medium. And it's one point in favor of the argument that Supernatural needs to be a TV franchise first and foremost. 

Yet resurrecting Supernatural on television isn't as easy as bringing Sam or Dean back from the dead. There are a lot of complicating factors when it comes to a Supernatural comeback. Which brings us to the one "have your cake and eat it too" scenario: an animated series. This would combine the best of the show with the new comic's appeal. 

A big sticking point when it comes to a future Supernatural series is the involvement of stars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Fans of the franchise aren't thrilled with the idea of rebooting its canon and recasting its heroes. At the same time, if Ackles and Padalecki were to reprise the roles, it would have to be a sequel series.

An anime version of Supernatural was produced in Japan during the show's run. Sam was voiced by Jarad Padalecki, but Dean was only performed by Jensen Ackles in select episodes. The series lasted just 22 episodes, but it showed the animated potential of the franchise.

Unless, of course, they returned as voice actors. An animated show could take a cue from Dynamite's Supernatural comic and take place early in the live-action show's run, while still maintaining Sam and Dean's signature voices. This would satisfy fans' desire for Ackles and Padalecki's involvement, and the Winchesters' return, while hewing closer to the OG show's pacing. 

Even a half-hour animated TV episode would be closer to the structure of a classic Supernatural episode than Dynamite's comic has been able to replicate. Part of what makes the show a classic is that its best moments tend to happen in between an episode's plot beats. The pace of the Supernatural comic, so far, has been too brisk to allow this. 

Author Greg Pak has quickly proven that he knows how to write Sam and Dean. Plus, Pak has a keen sense of the franchise's fictional world. It certainly isn't him failing Supernatural, but rather the comic medium is proving to be a less-than-perfect fit for the franchise. Pak's vision would be better suited for the screen, in animated form. 

The Supernatural prequel series The Winchesters only survived one season, and it remains to be determined how long Dynamite Entertainment's comic series will run for. Supernatural is at a crossroads right now. Its dedicated fanbase isn't going anywhere, but what the future looks like for the franchise is very uncertain.

An animated series could be the unexpected new form that breathes fresh life into the franchise. Like the comic, a cartoon could take Supernatural's monsters and mayhem to the next level visually, in a way the live-action series couldn't, but it could also hew closer to the recognizable style and vibe of the show.

An animated show is ultimately the only path forward for a version of Supernatural that brings back Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, and more of the show's familiar faces, or voices, while avoiding the pitfalls of a sequel. It could be the salvation of Supernatural that diehard fans are begging for.

Coming off the heels of Attorney General Pam Bondi's demand for access to Minnesota voter rolls and the state's decisive refusal to comply with that demand, President Trump is now spreading conspiracy theories about the state and is again threatening to try to exert control over the nation's election systems.

Last month, Bondi attempted to tie the Trump administration's months-long campaign to seize sensitive voter information from various states across the country, with the recent killing of a U.S. citizen Alex Pretti by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. In a letter to Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz following Pretti's death, Bondi asked Walz for the state's voter data in exchange for an end to the “chaos” in Minnesota.

Both Walz and Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon refused to comply and slammed Bondi for her demands. Simon called the letter “an apparent ransom to pay for our state's peace and security.”

Against this backdrop, Trump's fixation with Minnesota's residents and the state's election administration has continued. In a recent podcast with MAGA conspiracy theorist and former deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, Trump raised bizarre conspiracy theories about the Somali community in Minneapolis, a group he has long demonized.

“I won the state three times, but I got no credit for it. I won that state three times, but it's a rigged state. Really rigged badly with the Somalians, and the Somalians and the theft. These are people who don't work,” Trump told Bongino on a Monday podcast episode. “These are people that are just not an asset to our society to put it mildly. We gotta get 'em out, most of them…”

And at a later point during the same podcast episode, Trump put out a call for Republicans to “nationalize voting,” and take over election administration from the states. That is, of course, something that he constitutionally cannot do.

“The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over,'” he told Bongino. “We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many — 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.”

He did not specify what “15 places” he was referring to.

Trump's call to “nationalize the voting,” like his administration's ongoing crusade to seize states' voter rolls to, it seems, create some sort of national voter file, is yet another way in which he is attempting to exert control over the election system — a system managed by the states and not the federal government.

Trump also issued an executive order trying to enact nationwide election administration changes, like mandating documentary proof of citizenship and calling for all mail-in ballots to be received by Election Day. Those orders have been mostly shot down by the courts.

For months now, the Trump administration has been demanding sensitive voter data from 44 states across the country. This data, which includes things like social security numbers and driver's licenses, is not information the federal government is entitled to. The DOJ is currently suing 24 states — including Minnesota — who have not compiled with the demand. Experts have previously explained to TPM that the most likely reason the administration could want this information is to interfere in the midterm elections and continue to sow seeds of doubt in the nation's election systems.

Physicists have put thousands of atoms into a "Schrödinger's cat" state — smashing the record for the most macroscopic object to be observed in a quantum state.

In a new study, researchers observed nanoparticles of 7,000 sodium atoms acting as a cohesive wave, pushing the strange world of quantum mechanics to new limits. Building on this research, future experiments could finally put biological molecules into a quantum state, opening up new ways to investigate their physical properties.

In the experiment, the team produced a beam of sodium nanoparticles and aimed it at a narrow slit. Their results, published Jan. 21 in the journal Nature, show that the sodium nanoparticles spread out to produce an interference pattern, exhibiting the strange quantum behavior known as wave-particle duality. These sodium nanoparticles have now collectively set the record for the most macroscopic objects to be observed in a quantum superposition.

"Usually when people think of quantum mechanics, they associate it with small, tiny things, maybe photons, maybe electrons," lead study author Sebastian Pedalino, a physicist at the University of Vienna, told Live Science. "But quantum mechanics itself doesn't state any limits. And that's what we are testing."

In the quantum realm, particles can be both here and there. This strange phenomenon is known as quantum superposition.

The quantum physicist Erwin Schrödinger likened this to placing a cat in a sealed box with a vial of poison that is set to be released when a radioactive source decays, meaning the cat could be killed at any moment after the box has been sealed. This puts the cat into a superposition of being both dead and alive. It is only if the box is opened and the cat is observed that the superposition collapses and the cat is defined as either dead or alive.

Incredibly, this is how particles behave at the quantum scale; they are in multiple places at once and act as both a particle and a wave until they are observed.

This bizarre world raises a question: Where is the boundary between the quantum world and the one we observe every day? At what point does a particle start acting like a wave?

The reason we don't see quantum superposition all around us is because of a process called decoherence. If something in a quantum superposition interacts with its environment, it will decohere and no longer be both here and there; instead, it will be forced into one place. Larger objects are constantly interacting with their environment, so they can't maintain a quantum superposition. So the real challenge when trying to observe larger particles acting as a wave is to isolate them so they can stay in a coherent quantum superposition.

For the new study, Pedalino attempted to observe the large nanoparticles of sodium in a quantum superposition. To do this, he and his team converted a few grams of sodium into a beam of nanoparticles, which he then aimed at a narrow slit.

 




If the sodium nanoparticle was in a quantum superposition, this would mean that it spread out like a wave after passing through the slit. This would then produce an interference pattern. However, if it decohered and started acting like a normal particle, the sodium would pass straight through the slit and the team would see a flat line.

"For two years, I was looking at flat lines," Pedalino said. "We were trying to see the interference pattern, but we had flat lines. And in the end, the flat line is not really helpful, as it is inconclusive."

Finally, the single line they had been seeing on the detector widened and became the unmistakable interference pattern that meant the sodium nanoparticles were behaving as both particles and waves.

"That moment was unbelievable," Pedalino said. "It was already late in the night, and I called my professor. And he came back to the lab, and we took measurements until 3 a.m., when we ran out of the sodium."

The team determined the "macroscopicity" — a quantity that describes how much a quantum object pushes into the classical world — of the sodium nanoparticles to be 15.5, beating the previous record for macroscopicity by an order of magnitude.

This discovery opens the door for future experiments where scientists could feasibly observe biological materials, such as a virus or proteins, in a quantum superposition. The experiment represents a major step forward and brings this strange quantum phenomenon tantalizingly close to the real world.

Nobody wants to think about a dead cat — so why is Schrödinger's thought experiment so enduring in physics? In part, it's because superposition reveals a stark break in our understanding of the universe. 

Decades of experiments show that tiny particles follow one set of rules (quantum mechanics), while larger structures, such as stars, galaxies and — yes — house cats, follow another (Einstein's relativity). Scientists have long sought to reconcile these two rule sets into a "theory of everything," but they have so far come up short. However, recent research hints that tweaks to Schrödinger's equations could provide a pathway to a solution.

Director Sam Raimi is best known for his horror movies and his superhero movies. His latest film, "Send Help," is a wicked and fun horror comedy about office workers trapped on a deserted island, and it possesses all of the goop and violence that Raimi has become known for. The director's fans can easily see echoes of Raimi's famed "The Evil Dead" still lurking inside of it.

Raimi, however, is perfectly capable of more adult material and proved his directorial chops with his first grown-up drama, "A Simple Plan," released in 1998. "A Simple Plan" was a dour and cynical crime story about a small group of remote Minnesotans — including Bill Paxton, Bridget Fonda, and Billy Bob Thornton — who discover a suitcase full of cash in the woods. Having the cash in their presence, however, introduces paranoia and resentment, and it tears them all apart. It was nominated for two Academy Awards, including for Thornton's performance.

In 2000, Raimi made what might be his most underrated film, a Southern noir with a supernatural twist called "The Gift." It also marked an additional collaboration between Raimi and Billy Bob Thornton, who also co-wrote the screenplay. In "The Gift," Cate Blanchett plays a woman named Annie who is possessed of mild clairvoyant powers. The plot follows Annie after she has a vision of a local murder. The film's impressive cast also included Hilary Swank, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, Greg Kinnear, Giovanni Ribisi, and J.K. Simmons. 

Thornton does not appear in the movie, but it seems that "The Gift" was very dear to him. On Thornton's official website (handily archived in its early 2000s form), it is noted that Thornton wrote "The Gift" to be based on his mother's own psychic experiences.

Billy Bob Thornton's mother, born Virginia Faulkner, was a self-proclaimed psychic, something he discussed in his episode of the interview show "Inside the Actor's Studio" (handily archived online). The show's host, James Lipton, asked Thornton quite directly about his mother's "gift," and Thornton was frank in response, saying: 

"She has the gift of E.S.P. People can believe what they want, but I've seen it in action. [...] My mom was called a witch and everything. That happened quite a bit at school. But everybody came to see her. And eventually people from New York and other places came to see her. [...] We were poor. I was raised with no electricity or running water. And we ate what my grandfather killed until I was six or seven." 

According to the Thornton website, his mother used the same patterned psychic cards — called Zener cards — that Blanchett's character, Annie, can be seen using in "The Gift." Thornton's father died in 1974, and Thornton has noted that he never really talked with him, so his mother took up the job of raising Billy and his brothers. It's not stated if Annie's personality closely matches Thornton's mother, but the parallels are clear, given that she's a widow who is also raising three children and making a living on the side as a professional psychic. 

Also on the website, it's stated that Thornton's mother predicted that he would be a successful actor. Specifically, she said that Billy would grow up and star on screen with Burt Reynolds. This prediction astonishingly came true when Thornton, way back in 1990, had a bit part as a flower deliveryman on the sitcom "Evening Shade." "Evening Shade" starred Burt Reynolds. 

It should be noted that Billy Bob Thornton wrote "The Gift," and several other screenplays, with his longtime writing partner, Tom Epperson. Epperson and Thornton penned the scripts for "One False Move" (which starred Thornton's "A Simple Plan" so-star Bill Paxton), as well as "A Family Thing," the TV movie "Don't Look Back," "Camouflage," and "Jayne Mansfield's Car," which Thornton also directed. They have had a long and lucrative career together. 

"The Gift," meanwhile, is almost a forgotten film in Sam Raimi's filmography. Perhaps because, like "A Simple Plan," it is devoid of the type of wild, stylish camerawork that is more typically Raimi's trademark. "The Gift" is a downbeat character drama about Annie and her trials, while also being a sweaty airport-style potboiler about murder and corruption in small-town Georgia. It's about abusive husbands and the fate of the town's "bad girl." I will remain vague on plot details, as the script is twisty and the film deserves to be discovered through its thick Southern atmosphere. "The Gift" was also a modest hit, making $46.6 million on its modest $10 million budget. 

Critics weren't super-kind to "The Gift," as it currently only holds a middling 57% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes (based on 123 reviews). Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, admiring that Annie took her psychic duties with a pragmatic air, presenting them as very matter-of-fact. He also noted, however, that the characters all live in a "swamp of melodrama," presenting a lot of Southern Gothic archetypes without much variation from the clichés he was used to. Curt Fields, meanwhile, writing for the Washington Post, wrote in his quote negative review that "The Gift" had no originality at all. 

/Film, however, thinks it's wholly underrated.

Some UFOS move at incredibly fast speeds(Image: Jam Press/Charlotte Helyer)

A former submarine worker claims he was made aware of the horrifying logbooks the US Navy kept of chilling fast moving unidentified objects moving across oceans.

In 2024 a document revealed 21 unexplained UFO sightings with the US government confirming the shock findings after congress received the document from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), with the new paper detailing eyewitness accounts that had been investigated.

A Reddit user named Dabier claims to have worked with a retired Cold War submariner, and asked him about the “fast movers”. A fast mover is an unidentified aerial or submerged object (UASO) that travels at incredibly high speeds that military systems pick up on.

He explained he asked the man after reading a post on Reddit about how the government tracks fast movers.

One Redditer claimed to have met a man who tracked UFOs(Image: Jam Press)

He said: “He worked in the sonar room, so he was the guy to ask about it. He said that they would put all ‘unidentified' contacts (as in clearly not biological - there's a lot of unidentified biological noise) in the unidentified section of this logbook style thing they had.

“It was like a file with all the navy's info on how other ships sound. He said there were some entries they made which were really weird, either very fast with nothing in the area that could've made that noise or just weird as in strange noises like buzzing or something that's clearly not natural but sounds like no ship they've ever heard.

“I guess that file and all the recordings would be sent off the boat periodically. No word what happened with it after that.”

The Reddit user added that the man was a “sonarman so tracking things was literally his job.”

Claims of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), also known as UFOs, ranged from a green fireball and a flashing. Other concerns which were flagged included multicoloured jellyfish and a 6ft rocket.

While some objects were later linked back to common things such as balloons, birds and satellites, some cases remain unresolved.

Unresolved sightings include the so-called 'GOFAST' video of a U.S. Navy F/A-18 jet crew's encounter with an UAP, and a fast-moving silver ball captured on camera by a U.S. drone in the Middle East.

Reports of the US military dealing with UFOS privately have surfaced over the years

AARO said: "It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology."

They added: "None of these resolved cases substantiated advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies."

Regarding the unresolved cases, they added: "AARO is working closely with its IC (Intelligence Community) and S&T (Science and Technology) partners to understand and attribute the 21 cases received this reporting period that merit further analysis based on reported anomalous characteristics and/or behaviours.

AARO will provide immediate notification to Congress should AARO identify any cases that indicate or involve a breakthrough in foreign adversarial aerospace capability."

Mike Gold, formerly NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Policy, warned the House of Representatives that "the truth is out there".

He called for NASA to take action and says the agency could map the flights of potential UFOs to track down their origins, reports Forbes.
