                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former U.S. men's national team striker Herculez Gomez has hit out at Mauricio Pochettino for his recent comments on World Cup ticket prices. During a call with media last week, USMNT head coach Pochettino said that Tim Weah was wrong for his recent criticism of 2026 World Cup ticket prices. "It is too expensive," the USMNT forward told French outlet Le Dauphiné. For Pochettino, Weah's comments were an unnecessary distraction from on-field matters. "First of all, I think players need to talk on the pitch, playing football, not outside of the (pitch)," Pochettino said. And I think if FIFA does something or takes some decision, they know why, and it is their responsibility to explain why. Pochettino's comments didn't go down well with Gomez and his fellow ESPN analyst, former Trinidad and Tobago goalkeeper Shaka Hislop. Except right now [Pochettino] is saying, 'You don't get the free speech,'" Gomez said on Futbol Americas. "And he's equating [Weah's comments] to a political statement, which it is not. Timothy Weah expressed what many global citizens today have been expressing, that this World Cup has turned corporate, that ... it is no longer the game of the people. Thousands of dollars for single gameday tickets to the World Cup. "And here is one of the few players on your team with World Cup experience — that has scored a goal in a World Cup — voicing their opinion how they'd like their people, their fans in general, people of all races, colors, to enjoy the game — and you're saying, 'Shut up and dribble.'" Hislop ehoed Gomez's words, calling Pochettino "tone deaf" for his remarks. "It couldn't be more tone deaf," Hislop said. It's beyond belief that in 2026 we have somebody like Mauricio Pochettino, given the position he holds in this country with its history of activism, of athlete activism, in this moment making this statement." Pochettino made similar comments last year when the USMNT was facing Panama while U.S. President Donald Trump was openly discussing his desire to take back the Panama Canal. "I think it's big mistake if we talk about politics because I think people are not waiting us to talk in this way," the coach said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>N'Golo Kante reportedly refused to turn up for training with Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad on Tuesday after a move to Turkish giants Fenerbahce collapsed. He has been a regular for the Jeddah-based side ever since, helping them win the 2024-25 league title as well as that season's Kings Cup. A deal which would have seen Moroccan striker Youssef En-Nesyri move to Saudi Arabia appeared to have been agreed, but it emerged on deadline day that an error from Al-Ittihad in the Transfer Matching System would prevent the transfer from being completed. Fenerbahce were furious and placed the blame squarely on Al-Ittihad, saying in a statement: "The transfer process involving N'Golo Kanté and Youssef En-Nesyri with Al-Ittihad Club was carried out meticulously in all aspects and as planned by our club. Accordingly, an extension was requested, necessary discussions were held with FIFA by our club, and all steps were taken to resolve the process. As a result of these developments, the transfer process has unfortunately not been finalised. We understand and share the disappointment this has caused within our community. Now, according to Ben Jacobs, Kante has refused to report for training with Al-Ittihad on Tuesday and still hopes that the transfer can be completed. He may get his wish, with Santi Aouna reporting that talks between the teams are set to resume. L'Equipe add that Kante does not want to play for his current employers while he awaits a decision from FIFA over the failed move. Turkiye's transfer window does not close until Friday, which means there is still a chance for the administrative errors to be corrected and for Kante to get his move. En-Nesyri would not be able to head in the opposite direction, however. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting The France legend's desired exit comes at a poor time for Al-Ittihad, who can't sign any players as their transfer window has now closed. They have also failed to sign Gustavo Sa, a 21-year-old attacking midfielder currently plying his trade for Familicao in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. Al-Ittihad won the 2024-25 league title but are down in seventh after 19 games this time around, training current leaders Al-Hilal by 13 points. Both Kante and Benzema were absent from the squad for that game.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola gestures during a press conference in Manchester, England, Tuesday Jan. 27, 2026, one day ahead of their Champions League soccer match against Galatasaray. MANCHESTER, England — Pep Guardiola poked fun at Manchester City's critics on Tuesday, saying he was unhappy with the club's spending despite splashing out a reported $115 million on signings during the January transfer window. It has spent more than $500 million over the past 12 months and dominated English soccer with its exorbitant transfer dealings since being bought by the ruling family of Abu Dhabi in 2008. That has led to criticism over its spending power, but manager Guardiola pointed out that six of City's Premier League rivals had a higher net spend in recent years and put pressure on them to emulate his team's success. “I'm a little bit sad and upset because in net spend the last five years we are seventh in the Premier League," he joked. I am a little bit grumpy with them. “But, like we won in the past because we spent a lot, now six teams have to win the Premier Leagues, Champions Leagues and FA Cups because they spent more in the last five years." Liverpool has won three trophies in that spell, including the title last year. Arsenal has won no trophies, but leads the Premier League this term. “Good luck to the six teams who are in front of us for net spend for the last five years. I'm waiting,” said Guardiola, who has landed 15 major trophies since taking over in 2016. City is still in contention for a clean sweep of trophies this season and Guardiola was speaking ahead of the League Cup semifinal second leg against holder Newcastle on Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But with the game coming to Mexico this summer on its biggest stage — the 2026 World Cup — Ochoa is resigning himself to the fact he may not be able to attend a game. As with previous World Cups, FIFA is using a series of random draws through which fans can apply for tickets. But the confusion of the process, coupled with sheer demand, has ultimately prevented devoted fans like Ochoa from getting tickets. The prevalence of the U.S. resale market — a factor that wasn't as relevant in Qatar, Russia, or Brazil in the last three tournaments – meant FIFA used variable pricing, with ticket costs changing based on demand, said Jhamie Chin, FIFA senior media relations officer. Variable pricing is often associated with price gouging, but in this case, was used in an attempt to keep prices relatively down to earth. That's a new model for this World Cup. “If we had flat pricing that was very low, folks would scoop those tickets up and then charge them for 10 times on the resale market,” Chin said. If fans were not successfully able to purchase tickets through the random draws, FIFA has said that remaining inventory will be sold closer to the tournament. Those fans can also browse FIFA's resale and exchange marketplace for tickets that have been listed by those applicants who were successful. But those tickets, even on the official resale marketplace, are being listed at massively inflated prices. Chin said using FIFA's resale platform is the only way to ensure tickets are legitimate. Third party resale platforms like StubHub or TicketMaster began listing World Cup tickets as early as 2024, before tickets were even initially sold. Those were instances of “speculative selling,” Chin said, where resellers list tickets in hopes a consumer would opt to pay their often exorbitant prices before FIFA set their official pricing for tickets. Effectively, FIFA has absorbed the resale market in an effort to protect fans. I don't know how I would get the people who really want to be there to that game.” Nearly a million tickets were available and sold in two random selection draws throughout the fall, Chin said. A third phase, which ran from Dec. 11 to Jan. 13,  has seen more than 500 million users submit applications, he said. Around 8% of the ticketing allotment was also distributed to federations for each game they play. In U.S. Soccer's case, those tickets were set aside for “eligible insiders” during each of FIFA's three draws. “That turned a lot of people away,” she said. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has maintained that 90% of ticket revenue will be reinvested into boosting global development in each of the World Cup's participating federations. There's a good chunk, 50% or maybe slightly less, that would not operate without funding from FIFA,” he said. But just like Ochoa, Zalewski said supporters' groups will “deal with the cards they've been dealt.” For the American Outlaws, that means attending the USMNT's send-off matches throughout this spring — with supporters' section tickets capped at $45 through an agreement with U.S. Soccer. Those who can't attend the games themselves plan to organize massive watch parties and events. Ochoa will be in Mexico City “no matter what,” and anticipates many of his friends with Pancho Villa's Army will join him. Those events will be the substitute for these fans' World Cup experiences. “This World Cup is so inaccessible to so many that there's going to be some really cool community things happening,” Zalewski said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weston McKennie has once again made himself into a vital piece for Mauricio Pochettino and the USMNT. For the United States Men's National Team to turn heads at this summer's World Cup and fulfill its true potential, their best players will need to lead the way and rise to the occasion. One of those “best players” is Juventus midfielder, Weston McKennie. But after receiving just one national team call-up over the last 10 months, there were some questions as to how integral the 27-year-old was to Mauricio Pochettino's plans moving forward. McKennie appeared in the Concacaf Nations League semifinal and third place match in March of 2025 but then did not appear for the U.S. again until their October friendlies against Ecuador and Australia. At that point, it was widely believed that McKennie would be back in the team for good, but eyebrows were raised when he was then omitted from the November squad. McKennie has scored 4 times in his last 8 matches for Juventus, and he has been vital to their rise up the table in Italy's Serie A. “It's weird to say this now, but there has been a time where we were kind of not sure if Wes was even going to be in the mix with the national team,” said Howard's co-host and former USMNT teammate Landon Donovan. “His talent has never been in question,” noted Howard. All eyes will be fixed on the USMNT's next squad announcement for their March friendlies against global powerhouses Belgium and Portugal. It is assumed that McKennie has played his way back into the fold and if he has and if his club form translates to his national team form, the ceiling for the U.S. team could be very high. “This team can do some special things,” said Howard with Donovan then interjecting “that's why people get excited. We didn't do this in the past.” New episodes of “Unfiltered Soccer” drop every Tuesday. Follow the show @UnfilteredSoccer on Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and Facebook for bonus content.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the 2026 FIFA World Cup just months away, a collection of USMNT stars and rising talents have continued to perform for their clubs overseas. Malik Tillman enjoyed a special, three-goal week for Bayer 04 Leverkusen, while midfield partner Weston McKennie extended his form with a match-winning goal for Juventus FC. Elsewhere, Auston Trusty and Patrick Agyemang delivered clutch goals for their sides, Folarin Balogun tallied a match-deciding assist, and several other players earned key minutes in high-stakes UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League fixtures. Tillman produced a match-winning, first-half brace to power Bayer 04 Leverkusen to a 3-0 victory against Villarreal CF in the UEFA Champions League, confirming Leverkusen's place in the knockout round. Tillman's brace last week was his first for club or country since he scored twice for the USMNT in a 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup match against Trinidad and Tobago. Returning to league play on Saturday, Tillman again bagged the winning goal, helping Leverkusen to a 3-1 road victory against Eintracht Frankfurt and helping his side remain at sixth in the table. After scoring in each of his last three UEFA Champions League appearances for Juventus FC, McKennie kicked off the week by going 90 minutes in a scoreless draw against USMNT teammate Folarin Balogun's AS Monaco FC in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday. The 27-year-old got back to his scoring ways in Serie A, though, as McKennie sealed Juventus' 4-1 road victory against Parma Calcio 1913 with a 37th-minute winner on Sunday. Weston McKennie was at it again for @juventusfc on Sunday! Back of the net in back-to-back Europa League matches for @Auston_Trusty! The 25-year-old East Hartford, Conn. native has scored or assisted in each of Derby County's last four league fixtures, extending the Rams' unbeaten streak to four as they inch closer to a spot in the promotion playoffs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home for America's Passionate Soccer Fans Max Arfsten debuted for the U.S. men's national team at left back in January 2025 and has now appeared in 16 games for Coach Mauricio Pochettino. One of Arfsten's five assists came in a 2-0 win over Japan when he faked out Henry Mochizuki and delivered a perfect cross for Alex Zendejas. Before that stellar performance, Arfsten started five 2025 Gold Cup games, including a shootout win over Costa Rica in which he scored and assisted in the 2-2 tie. In a 2-1 win over Paraguay, his cross set up Gio Reyna's 4th-minute goal. Unlike the vast majority of Pochettino's player pool, Arfsten played college soccer before going pro. He never appeared for a U.S. youth national team nor did he play for a pro team's youth academy. We spoke with Arfsten as he started preseason camp with the Columbus Crew, and after he visited his hometown of Fresno, California, where Arfsten played for the California Odyssey Soccer Club and San Joaquin Memorial High School.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Changes arrive as part of the FA's 2024-28 strategy to review the tournament in order to broaden its appeal and reach, as communicated in email correspondence and meetings with clubs, sources indicated. The FA's plans have faced fierce pushback from clubs, according to sources from the second tier and below, who said teams made clear their opposition during a consultation process. Any changes could be implemented as early as next season, though final plans have yet been agreed and the FA insists “no decisions have been made at this stage”. The FA is bidding to make its flagship competition more marketable, particularly in its later stages, sources say. It enables clubs and fans to plot their road to Wembley Stadium, building momentum and excitement, whilst supporting operational planning.” An FA Spokesperson said: “We committed in our women's and girls' game strategy, Reaching Higher, to review the Adobe Women's FA Cup, recognising the need to evolve the competition and strengthen its commercial potential. This would enable us to reinvest more funding into both the competition itself and the wider women's football ecosystem, which is vital for long-term, sustainable growth. “While a comprehensive review of the current format has been completed, no decisions have been made at this stage. Any future changes will be shaped in close consultation with stakeholders across the entire pyramid, including clubs, players, fans, and our broadcast and commercial partners.” The proposals wield an especially profound effect on lower-tier clubs. As part of the new proposals, tier seven teams would no longer be permitted to compete in the competition. Tier seven consists of multiple amateur, county leagues, and sits six divisions below the WSL and four below the National League. According to numerous clubs in tier seven, the FA hosted meetings in January, one specifically for tier five, six and seven clubs, outlining potential changes to the competition. Until specifically asked about the involvement of lower-tier teams unlikely to reach the latter stages of the tournament, sources claim that they were then made aware of a proposed entry cut-off point. Prior to the January consultation, only one team of 50 in the seventh-tier Greater London Women's Football League (GLWFL) was consulted directly about the proposal to remove seventh-tier sides, according to GLWFL chairman David Baker. The suggestion is part of a tabled “entry tier review” for lower-league sides, with the FA citing a need to enhance minimum stadium standards. Tier seven standards across the national level vary greatly. Tier seven systems in London and Manchester, for example, are far more advanced than other areas and have more feeder leagues than elsewhere in the country. Four tier seven teams reached the first-round proper this season: Leyton Orient, South London Women FC, Maidstone United and Milbrook. Tier seven clubs in London have expressed frustration at being removed due to the opportunity to develop that the competition provides. Access to these financial streams have the ability to change a club and its future direction, teams argue. There is no current alternative to the FA Cup. Seventh tier club South London Women FC, an independent women's football club that competes in the Premier Division of the GLWFL, has received more than £20,000 over two seasons for progressing to the first-round proper. According to correspondence seen by The Athletic, tier seven clubs have told the FA of their concerns that potential exclusion would yield financially. Another described a “detrimental impact on the ecosystem of the women's game”, adding the FA Cup “is a fundamental engine for growth, as well as financial support and visibility that allows a grassroots club like ours to thrive.” Additionally, the entry fee for clubs to compete in the FA Cup has tripled from £25 to £75, a significant sum for clubs further down the pyramid who fear a potential “pricing out” strategy being put in place. While seeding is claimed to be a temporary measure, numerous clubs from WSL2 and further down the pyramid have voiced displeasure with the proposition, claiming that it places the top WSL teams in an even greater advantageous position. Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City would be the seeded teams this season based on last season's WSL table. Megan Feringa  is The Athletic's UK-based women's football writer.</p>

The collar and sleeve cuffs are decorated with ornate patterns that are reminiscent of traditional tattoos and ancestral patterns. Retail pricing for the PUMA shirts sits around €100 / £85 for standard fan replicas, with authentic match editions and bespoke options climbing higher depending on sizing and retailer. Youth sizes also tend to be available at lower price points. We also don't have an official release of the Morocco away kit, so we can only tell you what the leaks show. The leaked away design is very similar to the home shirt design, but instead of red, it sits on an all-white base. The sleeve cuffs and collar are once again detailed with fine patterning, is on a block green base. Once official details are announced, pricing for the away kit is expected to mirror the home shirt's structure, with fan replica versions around €100 / £85 and higher-end authentic editions priced accordingly when they land in stores and online.</p>

LA28 announced Tuesday the six U.S. stadiums that will host Olympic soccer group stage games while revealing a plan to have preliminary games move East to West to minimize travel demands. The Columbus Crew's ScottsMiracle-Gro Field, Nashville SC's Geodis Park, St. Louis CITY SC's Energizer Park and the San José Earthquakes' PayPal Park were also selected for group games. Snapdragon Stadium, the shared home of San Diego State football, San Diego FC and San Diego Wave FC, figures to host some of the last group games as it is geographically closest to the Rose Bowl, where final stage games begin on July 24, 2028. The 2028 Olympics will celebrate hosting more female than male athletes by featuring the high profile women's 100-meter final on Day 1 of competition. “Bringing Olympic Football group stage and knockout matches to stadiums across the United States means more fans will witness this global event and experience the Olympic spirit firsthand,” Shana Ferguson, LA28 chief of sport and Games delivery officer, said in a statement. Group stage soccer matches are often spread across venues in a country during the Olympics, with a stadium in the host city holding the final games. For the first time, the Olympic soccer tournament will feature more women's teams than men's. LA28 also announced it is working with the International Olympic Committee on an extended competition window that could start preliminary matches before the opening ceremony on July 14, 2028, to allow for increased recovery time between matches. Schedules and match distribution for each stadium will be announced before the first ticket purchasing window in April 2026. Despite the expanded venue list that brings Olympic competition to six new cities, a presale beginning on April 2 will be limited to locals in Southern California and Oklahoma City, which will host multiple sports including softball.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Argentina are looking to retain their World Cup title over the summer(Image: (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images)) It's been over three years since Lionel Messi and Argentina claimed the World Cup trophy in Qatar after a spectacular final triumph against France. As the countdown to kick-off continues, we've challenged our chief football writers to share their selections and offer their predictions for what is being billed as the biggest and boldest FIFA World Cup ever. We cannot escape the reality that America is an extremely costly destination, and it's an enormous demand for supporters to travel across three nations with Canada and Mexico as co-hosts. However, it is essential that fans turn out in substantial numbers because their atmosphere, vibrancy and passion is what makes any tournament special. My experience at the Club World Cup last summer was one of unpredictable weather, blistering heat and also a superbly organised tournament. Spain are the reining European champions(Image: (Photo by ANP via Getty Images)) Yet, England fans to their eternal credit, always find a way and they will travel with genuine hope that Thomas Tuchel can deliver. England have a sensational striker in Harry Kane, incredible midfielders with Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham and great wide players, including Bukayo Saka. WATCH: Check out episode one of our World Cup podcast Make Football Great Again Argentina are the World Cup holders(Image: (Photo by Peter Joneleit/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)) This will be a World Cup like few others. Scorching temperatures, different time zones and thousands of miles travelling make it a demanding one for all those nations taking part, not to mention supporters planning to go. Throw in the fact US president Donald Trump will seize the perfect opportunity to feed his obsession with narcissism, and anything could happen. This will be Lionel Messi's final World Cup, and he will be desperate to go back-to-back to cap a truly extraordinary career. He has been hailed as Messi's heir apparent, and this is a wonderful chance for him to prove it. It's difficult to pick a winner, but World Cups are generally won by one of the strongest nations, so it's impossible to look past the likes of Argentina, France and Spain. If you can't see the poll, click here. Harry Kane's form will be vital to England's World Cup hopes(Image: Getty) Argentina are one of three teams that have subsequently gone close to retaining a title, suffering a narrow and slightly controversial loss to Germany in 1990 after the Diego Maradona-inspired triumph in 1986. Weather conditions won't pose problems; they possess an excellent mix of seasoned professionals and players in their peak years, and despite celebrating his 39th birthday during the competition, you can count on Lionel Messi delivering magical performances. Lautaro Martinez remains somewhat underappreciated when discussing world-class forwards, and in Lionel Scaloni, they boast a remarkably accomplished international boss with one World Cup and two Copa Americas to his name. I'm remaining in South America for my surprise package. Ecuador - with a midfield built around Moises Caicedo - will prove incredibly tough to overcome, despite appearing somewhat lacking in attacking firepower. England will navigate their path to the final four, and if Harry Kane maintains his current club form, he could very well claim another Golden Boot. However, Thomas Tuchel's team are likely to encounter opposition slightly superior to them in the semi-finals, with Spain and France - who have defeated England at the previous two major tournaments - representing more credible European contenders. Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page Kylian Mbappe and France were beaten finalists in 2022(Image: Getty) These are probably uninspiring predictions, but I believe Spain's technical excellence and possession-focused approach will exhaust rivals in sweltering conditions. I'd love nothing more than England to go all the way, and I genuinely reckon they can because of the depth and talent in their squad. Yet my only worry is the additional knockout stage and it's simply another physical and mental obstacle you've got to overcome on the lengthy journey to triumph. France are always a threat and I wouldn't be surprised if they lifted the trophy, as Kylian Mbappe and Michael Olise possess the ability to damage any team. Senegal are my outsiders but I also reckon the USA will perform brilliantly, especially after seeing them land in a kind group. Substitutes are going to matter more than ever and that should favour England.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's sports minister has called Fifa president Gianni Infantino "irresponsible" and "infantile" for saying that world football's governing body will look at lifting a ban on Russia. He added: "Having girls and boys from Russia being able to play football games in other parts of Europe would help." In response, Ukraine sports minister Matvii Bidnyi said in a social media post:, external "Gianni Infantino's words sound irresponsible - not to say infantile. "They detach football from the reality in which children are being killed. "Let me remind you that since the start of Russia's full-scale aggression, more than 650 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russians. Russia has not completely stopped playing international football as they have played matches against non-Western nations without needing the permission of Fifa or Uefa. Serhii Palkin, chief executive of Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk, said Infantino's comments "represent a complete detachment from reality". "It is an attempt to pretend that war and aggression do not exist," he added. Last year, Ukraine criticised the International Paralympic Committee's (IPC) decision to lift a ban on athletes from Russia and its close ally Belarus. Despite the IPC lifting its ban, Russian and Belarusian Para-athletes will not be at next month's Winter Paralympics. Three of the governing bodies have decided to keep their bans on athletes from the two countries, and although Russia and Belarus are now allowed to compete in ice hockey, the decision came too late for them to take part in qualifying.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA's kicking soccer fans in the wallet again. The organization is charging as much as $300 for Los Angeles' World Cup matches — even though the spots could be more than a mile away from SoFi Stadium. A spokesperson tried to defend the astronomical cash-grab. “Parking prices are determined based on local market conditions and benchmarking against comparable major events previously held in each host city,” the spokesperson told The Athletic. LA is set to host eight matches in the World Cup, including two involving the US national team and a quarterfinal — games expected to draw major crowds. Lower-tier match tickets for the cup are expected to fetch less than $200. If a fan wanted to attend a Category 3 match — a lower-priced seating tier typically located in the upper level — they would pay under $200 for the ticket, but $250 just to park, according to The Athletic. Fans tired of being treated like piggy banks blamed Los Angeles' public transportation system and the city's drive-first culture for getting taken to the cleaners. “The metro area is absolutely massive and yes there are rail lines and buses, but it's rare that your starting and end point are on a line and it will most likely include at least one or two bus transfers at each end of the journey,” one frustrated fan fumed on Reddit. “I paid $100 to park at the LA Forum in 2021 for a regular season Browns/Chargers game,” one critic said.</p>
