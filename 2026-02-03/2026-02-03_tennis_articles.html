The North Palmyra Trophies, which took place six months after Russia's invasion into Ukraine, was sponsored by Gazprom, an oil company Oliynykova called “one of the key financial pillars of Russia's war machine.“These are the same funds Russia uses to kill and maim Ukrainian women and children, and to destroy our families and cities,” said the 25-year-old.“From a moral standpoint, accepting Gazprom money in December 2022 is equivalent to playing in Nazi Germany in 1941 and being paid with property taken from victims of death camps.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He may not have won the title, but he broke all kinds of records—and ended all kinds of streaks—along the way.ByJohn BerkokPublished Feb 03, 2026 copy_link HISTORIC❗🇷🇸 Novak Djokovic has just become the first tennis player EVER to win 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ or more matches at THREE DIFFERENT GRAND SLAMS. And he could very well complete his set later this year at the US Open, the only one he's missing, where he has 95 career wins.It was also his record-extending 76th first-round win in a row at Grand Slams, the longest streak for any player in the Open Era, male or female. It's now been 20 years since his last opening exit, to American Paul Goldstein at the 2006 Australian Open.Then, with an identical 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 win over Francesco Maestrelli in the second round, he's now won 64 matches in a row in the first two rounds of Grand Slams. It's now been nine years since he lost before the third round of a major, falling to wild card Denis Istomin in the second round of the 2017 Australian Open.He also improved to 32-0 against qualifiers at majors. Maestrelli had qualified to reach his first major main draw, then beat last year's Cincinnati semifinalist, Terence Atmane, in the first round.

He already held that record by a long way, with Federer and Serena in second and third place with 369 and 367.That third-round win also put him through to his 70th career round-of-16 appearance at a Grand Slam, breaking the record for most for a man in the Open Era, surpassing Federer's 69.And that's not all—with that victory he also improved his already-flawless record in third-round matches at the Australian Open to 18-0. With that, Djokovic moved into the 16th Australian Open quarterfinal of his career, a new all-time men's record, surpassing Federer's 15.He also moved into the 65th Grand Slam quarterfinal of his career, extending the all-time men's record he's already had for almost two years now.

There was a reprieve in the fourth round, as his scheduled opponent, Czech Jakub Mensik, was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to an abdominal injury. With that, Djokovic moved into the 16th Australian Open quarterfinal of his career, a new all-time men's record, surpassing Federer's 15.He also moved into the 65th Grand Slam quarterfinal of his career, extending the all-time men's record he's already had for almost two years now. He also moved into the 65th Grand Slam quarterfinal of his career, extending the all-time men's record he's already had for almost two years now. Sinner was going for his third in a row this year. Djokovic is the only man to three-peat in Melbourne in the Open Era, doing it twice, from 2011 to 2013 and from 2019 to 2021.He also ensured there would be no fourth Grand Slam final in a row between Alcaraz and Sinner, which means that again, at least for now, Djokovic and Nadal keep their record for most major finals played in a row by two men in the Open Era, with four in a row between 2011 Wimbledon and 2012 Roland Garros.His victory over Sinner was his 20th career win over a Top 5 player at the Australian Open, tying Nadal (at Roland Garros) for most career Top 5 wins for a man at a single Grand Slam event in ATP rankings history, which dates back to 1973.And to circle back to an earlier stat, his win over Sinner was also his 104th win at the Australian Open, now two clear of Federer for most career wins for any player in Australian Open history.
