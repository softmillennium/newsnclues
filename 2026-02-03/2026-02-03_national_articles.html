                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It now heads to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature. • Petro in Washington: Colombian President Gustavo Petro met with Trump today, a visit comes after a yearlong public quarrel between the two leaders over immigration and drug trafficking. • Trump's call to “nationalize” voting: In comments slammed by Democrats, Trump said Republicans should “take over” elections in at least 15 states ahead of the midterms. The White House claims Trump was referring to support for a voter ID law. It comes as a US carrier shot down an Iranian drone in the Arabian Sea and armed boats threatened a US tanker in the Strait of Hormuz. “It will be part of the discussion over the next couple of weeks, and we'll see how that shakes out. Johnson stopped short of saying he would attach it to DHS funding, saying, “I'm not going to tell you in advance how this negotiation will go. Johnson did not say he agreed with President Donald Trump on his call to “nationalize” voting but chalked the comment up to “frustration” with Democrat-led States. “What you're hearing from the president is his frustration about the lack of some of the blue states, frankly, of enforcing these things and making sure that they are free and fair elections. I don't know what the ultimate solution is going to be,” he said. He said he would “not get ahead of the negotiations here” but said it would be a “continuing theme. The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said Tuesday that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's presence at an FBI search of an elections office in Georgia is part of a broader Trump administration effort to interfere in free and fair elections in the US. “When you put all of this together, it is clear that what happened in Fulton County is not about revisiting the past,” Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said at a press conference on Capitol Hill. “It's about shaping the outcome of future elections, and quite honestly dismantling the very guardrails that were put in place to keep them free and fair.” “I am deeply concerned about it spreading to other states,” he added. “He did not ask any questions, nor did he or I issue any directives,” Gabbard wrote in a letter this week to Warner and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. “That phone call alone should concern every American because it didn't occur in a vacuum,” Warner said. “I want to underscore a core legal boundary: US intelligence agencies are structured to operate overseas, not on domestic soil,” Warner said Tuesday. A classified whistleblower complaint alleging wrongdoing by Gabbard had yet to be transmitted to Congress, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Gabbard's office has called the complaint “baseless and politically motivated.” Warner said Tuesday that he expected to receive the complaint “today or tomorrow.” Trump and GOP leaders had pushed hard for their GOP members to fall in line despite their own private grumblings about the bill, eager to avoid a debilitating shutdown like the one that paralyzed Washington for 43 days last fall. The vote was a hard-fought victory for both Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who had to cajole the fractious GOP conference to back a deal that only temporarily funds DHS and excludes certain conservative priorities. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that President Donald Trump tapped Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to oversee election security while describing her unusual involvement in an FBI search of a Georgia elections office. She's working directly alongside the FBI director, Kash Patel,” Leavitt said. “This is a coordinated whole-of-government effort to ensure that our elections again are fair and transparent moving forward. I don't see anything wrong with the president tasking a Cabinet member to pursue an issue that most people want to see solved,” she added. Some background: After the administration gave conflicting accounts on Gabbard's involvement in the controversial search, the DNI in a letter released Monday night said she had accompanied top FBI agents at Trump's request. Their traditional role in US elections is to protect them from foreign interference. After widespread pushback over comments suggesting she will target gun owners in Washington, DC, for prosecution, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said in a video that she is focused on taking firearms “out of the hands of criminals.” Pirro found herself in hot water after saying in a Fox News interview Monday evening that “you're going to jail” if you bring a gun into DC, whether or not you have a license in another district. Even the NRA recognizes congress needs to act here. DC requires gun owners to register their firearms with the district and does not recognize concealed carry permits from other states. In the video posted on X Tuesday, Pirro said that she wanted to be “crystal clear” about her support for the Second Amendment. “However, you need to be responsible,” Pirro said, “and every responsible gun owner that I know makes sure that they understand the laws where they are going and understand whatever registration requirements there might be.” The bill funds a number of critical departments, but also creates another funding cliff for the Department of Homeland Security in two weeks. President Donald Trump was “unsurprised” by Russia's major missile and drone attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the White House said Tuesday, even after he took credit for convincing President Vladimir Putin to temporarily pause such assaults. Speaking to reporters at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said planned negotiations between Russia and Ukraine would proceed later this week in Abu Dhabi, with the US in a mediating role. “I spoke with the president about it this morning, and his reaction was, unfortunately, unsurprised,” she said when asked about the fresh round of bombardment. The overnight assault cut heat to tens of thousands of people and ended a brief reprieve agreed to by Moscow and Washington as Ukrainians grapple with plummeting winter temperatures. Trump had taken credit for arranging the pause, saying he made a personal request to Putin to stop striking Ukrainian cities amid a cold snap. But Tuesday's assault made clear the break was short-lived. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's attack was focused on energy facilities across at least six regions and involved 70 missiles and 450 attack drones. “What the president was referring to is the SAVE Act,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that Trump had spoken with GOP congressional leaders about the legislation, which would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. “It provides very commonsense measures for voting in our country, such as voter ID.” Trump, in a radio interview that aired Monday, also advocated for Republicans to take over the voting in “at least” 15 places. Leavitt said that was also tied to his desire for a voter ID law, insisting he was referring to states where he believes there's been a “high degree” of election fraud. Some House conservatives pushed to attach the SAVE Act to a government funding bill ahead of a vote on the package today. But Trump declined to support that effort over concerns about a lengthy shutdown. Leavitt said he'll instead push for a separate vote on the measure. The SAVE Act: Critics have warned that the bill threatens to restrict voting access by creating unnecessary hurdles that will make it harder to register to vote and wrongfully disenfranchise legitimate voters. It is already against the law for people who aren't US citizens to vote in federal elections, and experts say it rarely happens. “I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks, as of right now, are still scheduled,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in the White House driveway. “You need a willing partner to achieve diplomacy, and that's something that special envoy Witkoff is intent on exploring and discussing.” The new demands could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions. Leavitt said Trump was still keeping open the option of military strikes if diplomacy fails. “The president has a range of options on the table with respect to Iran as commander in chief,” she said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday expressed optimism that the government will reopen and that the president will sign Congress' funding deal later today. “We're extremely optimistic the government is going to reopen, that all Republicans are going to stick together and vote accordingly, and that bill to reopen the government will be right here at the White House, we hope in just a few short hours, to the president's desk for signature,” Leavitt said on Fox News. It follows a fierce lobbying push by President Donald Trump on Republican holdouts. A US aircraft carrier shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively approached” the ship in the Arabian Sea today, hours before two gunboats operated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and threatened to board and seize the ship, according to a US military spokesperson. The two incidents occurred days before US and Iranian officials are due to meet Friday for diplomatic negotiations meant to avert a military clash. “The Iranian drone continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by US forces operating in international waters,” Hawkins said. And I support that,” he told reporters on Tuesday. The former president is scheduled to appear on February 27 and the former Secretary of State to appear on February 26. “All right so we were given very limited information,” the unidentified Fulton Police officer told Peter Ellis, acting special agent in charge at the FBI's Atlanta field office after the two men exchanged a handshake. “So we have a search warrant for this like, one for the like entire location,” Ellis told the officer. “Because one way or another the records are coming with us today,” he said. Talks between the US and Iran planned for later this week hit a snag Tuesday after Tehran requested they be relocated, that regional participants be excluded, and that the discussions' scope be limited to the country's nuclear program, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The new demands could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions. The talks had been set for Istanbul, with foreign ministers from Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also expected to attend. Tehran is now asking for an alternate location: Oman, the small Gulf sultanate that has previous hosted talks between the US and Iran. Already, some American officials had privately warned that Iran may be using diplomacy to play for time in preventing military action. Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday successfully quelled a conservative rebellion within his own party that threatened to block a massive funding bill, putting Congress on a path to reopening the government within hours. Johnson and his leadership team – with help from President Donald Trump — convinced all but one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, to back the procedural vote on the floor Tuesday. Trump and his team leaned hard on those rogue Republicans who had vowed to block the funding bill unless GOP leaders agreed to attach a strict voter ID bill to the package. House Oversight Chair James Comer has agreed to the dates Bill and Hillary Clinton proposed for depositions in the panel's Jeffrey Epstein probe, putting an end to the contempt of Congress proceedings that had been moving forward against them. Two sources had earlier told CNN that the Clintons agreed to appear for depositions on the panel's terms, but also suggested they wanted public hearings. Several senior Senate Democrats this morning slammed President Donald Trump's call to “nationalize” elections as an unconstitutional attempt to control the outcome of future elections. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal argued that “it's grounds for impeachment.” “Trump shouts the quiet part out loud,” Blumenthal said in a post on X. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, agreed with Blumenthal's warnings, though he did not go so far as to suggest impeachment. He wants to put his enforcers, whoever they may be, ICE or National Guard, that are loyal to him, at the polling places, to intimidate voters in the next election,” Durbin said.“What it tells us is he's very worried about the outcome of that election.” GOP Rep. Don Bacon also expressed his opposition to the idea. I'll oppose this now as well,” the congressman from Nebraska said in a post on X. Meanwhile, Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley downplayed the president's remarks, telling reporters he believed Trump was pushing for a Republican-led voter ID law known as the SAVE Act, rather than saying that the federal government should administer elections. The Constitution says that, but the due process clause, as well as other federal statutes, provide some ground rules about what you can and cannot do, and Congress has been legislating basic ground rules for federal elections since Reconstruction,” he told reporters. With the full Democratic caucus currently voting against the package, House Speaker Johnson can only afford to lose one Republican vote. The little wiggle room has left Johnson and his leadership team scrambling to win over needed lawmakers. “I'm supportive of, you know, only citizens voting and showing ID at the polling places. But I'm not in favor federalizing elections, no,” he said. Thune said he and members of his conference will discuss the SAVE Act and the desire of some to change filibuster rules at their weekly policy lunch today, but said he's made no commitments to those House members on changes to the filibuster. Some House members said they switched their positions in favor of voting for a massive federal funding bill based on their belief Thune would do so. “So, we're going to have a conversation about that but there weren't any commitments made, no,” Thune said. GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah is advocating changing the filibuster by requiring senators to stand or talk during a filibuster and not simply block action by verbally objecting to moving forward. So, it means you're not doing other things. So, there's always an opportunity cost,” he said. Thune did promise to force a floor vote on the SAVE Act, though unless the filibuster rules are changed, it won't get the 60 votes it would need to advance because Democrats strongly oppose it. Exactly when I can't give you a hard answer on that,” he said. As Colombian President Gustavo Petro meets with President Donald Trump in the White House, get caught up on what led to him being sanctioned last year. Trump accused Petro of playing a role in the global illicit drug trade, encouraging narcotics production, and of being an “illegal drug leader,” allegations that the Colombian president has repeatedly rejected. The list was established in 1995 via an executive order from then-President Bill Clinton, with the goal of fighting money laundering from narcotics traffickers in Colombia. The SDN List targets entities and individuals who act on behalf of countries that are adversarial to the US, along with US-designated terrorists and criminals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities believe the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie was kidnapped, abducted or otherwise taken against her will, and the sheriff said Monday it's imperative she's found soon because she could die without her medication. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said there are signs at the home indicating Nancy Guthrie did not leave on her own. An Arizona sheriff said Monday that “we do in fact have a crime scene” as authorities search for the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie, who was reported missing over the weekend.

Law enforcement officers are present outside the home of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, near Tucson, Ariz., Monday, Feb. 2, 2026. TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Investigators found signs of forced entry at the Arizona home of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie's mother, a person familiar with the investigation said Tuesday, as the host asked for prayers to help bring back the 84-year-old, who is believed to have been taken against her will. She asked supporters to “raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment. “If she's alive right now, her meds are vital. It's been better than 24 hours, and the family tells us if she doesn't have those meds, it can become fatal,” Nanos said. Several of Guthrie's personal items, including her cellphone, wallet and her car, were still there after she disappeared. Police are also reviewing information from license plate cameras in the area, according to the person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the case and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Investigators do not believe at this point that the abduction was part of a robbery, home invasion or kidnapping-for-ransom plot, the person said. For a second day, “Today” opened Tuesday with Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, but Savannah Guthrie was not at the anchor's desk. Nanos said Monday that she is in Arizona. The host grew up in Tucson, graduated from the University of Arizona and previously worked as a reporter and anchor at Tucson television station KVOA. Nancy Guthrie was last seen Saturday night at her home in the Tucson area, where she lived alone and was reported missing Sunday. Someone at her church called a family member to say she was not there, leading family to search her home and then call 911, Nanos said. Nancy Guthrie has limited mobility, and officials do not believe she left on her own. The homicide team was also involved, Nanos said. On Monday morning, search crews were pulled back. “We don't see this as a search mission so much as it is a crime scene,” the sheriff said. Her brick home has a gravel driveway and a yard covered in prickly pear and saguaro cactus. The youngest of three siblings, she credits her mom with holding their family together after her father died of a heart attack at age 49, when Savannah was just 16. “When my dad died, our family just hung onto each other for dear life because it was such a shock. We were just trying to figure out how to become a family of four when we'd always been a family of five,” she said on “Today” in 2017. The host often brought her mother on “Today” as a guest. “She has met unthinkable challenges in her life with grit, without self-pity, with determination and always, always with unshakeable faith,” Savannah said on the show in 2022 on Nancy Guthrie's 80th birthday.</p>

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Immigration officers with guns drawn arrested some activists who were trailing their vehicles on Tuesday in Minneapolis, a sign that tensions have not eased since the departure last week of a high-profile commander. An activist is detained by federal agents on Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026, in Minneapolis. Federal agents lately have been conducting more targeted immigration arrests at homes and neighborhoods, rather than staging in parking lots. The convoys have been harder to find and less aggressive. Alerts in activist group chats have been more about sightings than immigration-related detainments. Several cars followed officers through south Minneapolis after there were reports of them knocking at homes. Officers stopped their vehicles and ordered activists to come out of a car at gunpoint. Activists are approached by federal agents for following agent vehicles, on Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026, in Minneapolis. A federal judge last month put limits on how officers treat motorists who are following them but not obstructing their operations. Safely following agents “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” the judge said. At a news conference, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says she is grateful for the judges order not halting the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota as a lawsuit proceeds. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who was leading an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and other big U.S. cities, left town last week, shortly after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, the second local killing of a U.S. citizen in January. Trump administration border czar Tom Homan was dispatched to Minnesota instead. He warned that protesters could face consequences if they interfere with officers.

Gabbard's office has called the complaint “baseless and politically motivated.” Warner said Tuesday that he expected to receive the complaint “today or tomorrow.” Trump and GOP leaders had pushed hard for their GOP members to fall in line despite their own private grumblings about the bill, eager to avoid a debilitating shutdown like the one that paralyzed Washington for 43 days last fall. The vote was a hard-fought victory for both Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who had to cajole the fractious GOP conference to back a deal that only temporarily funds DHS and excludes certain conservative priorities. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that President Donald Trump tapped Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to oversee election security while describing her unusual involvement in an FBI search of a Georgia elections office. She's working directly alongside the FBI director, Kash Patel,” Leavitt said. “This is a coordinated whole-of-government effort to ensure that our elections again are fair and transparent moving forward. I don't see anything wrong with the president tasking a Cabinet member to pursue an issue that most people want to see solved,” she added. Some background: After the administration gave conflicting accounts on Gabbard's involvement in the controversial search, the DNI in a letter released Monday night said she had accompanied top FBI agents at Trump's request. Their traditional role in US elections is to protect them from foreign interference. After widespread pushback over comments suggesting she will target gun owners in Washington, DC, for prosecution, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said in a video that she is focused on taking firearms “out of the hands of criminals.” Pirro found herself in hot water after saying in a Fox News interview Monday evening that “you're going to jail” if you bring a gun into DC, whether or not you have a license in another district. Even the NRA recognizes congress needs to act here. DC requires gun owners to register their firearms with the district and does not recognize concealed carry permits from other states. In the video posted on X Tuesday, Pirro said that she wanted to be “crystal clear” about her support for the Second Amendment. “However, you need to be responsible,” Pirro said, “and every responsible gun owner that I know makes sure that they understand the laws where they are going and understand whatever registration requirements there might be.” The bill funds a number of critical departments, but also creates another funding cliff for the Department of Homeland Security in two weeks. President Donald Trump was “unsurprised” by Russia's major missile and drone attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the White House said Tuesday, even after he took credit for convincing President Vladimir Putin to temporarily pause such assaults. Speaking to reporters at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said planned negotiations between Russia and Ukraine would proceed later this week in Abu Dhabi, with the US in a mediating role. “I spoke with the president about it this morning, and his reaction was, unfortunately, unsurprised,” she said when asked about the fresh round of bombardment. The overnight assault cut heat to tens of thousands of people and ended a brief reprieve agreed to by Moscow and Washington as Ukrainians grapple with plummeting winter temperatures. Trump had taken credit for arranging the pause, saying he made a personal request to Putin to stop striking Ukrainian cities amid a cold snap. But Tuesday's assault made clear the break was short-lived. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's attack was focused on energy facilities across at least six regions and involved 70 missiles and 450 attack drones. “What the president was referring to is the SAVE Act,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that Trump had spoken with GOP congressional leaders about the legislation, which would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. “It provides very commonsense measures for voting in our country, such as voter ID.” Trump, in a radio interview that aired Monday, also advocated for Republicans to take over the voting in “at least” 15 places. Leavitt said that was also tied to his desire for a voter ID law, insisting he was referring to states where he believes there's been a “high degree” of election fraud. Some House conservatives pushed to attach the SAVE Act to a government funding bill ahead of a vote on the package today. But Trump declined to support that effort over concerns about a lengthy shutdown. Leavitt said he'll instead push for a separate vote on the measure. The SAVE Act: Critics have warned that the bill threatens to restrict voting access by creating unnecessary hurdles that will make it harder to register to vote and wrongfully disenfranchise legitimate voters. It is already against the law for people who aren't US citizens to vote in federal elections, and experts say it rarely happens. “I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks, as of right now, are still scheduled,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in the White House driveway. “You need a willing partner to achieve diplomacy, and that's something that special envoy Witkoff is intent on exploring and discussing.” The new demands could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions. Leavitt said Trump was still keeping open the option of military strikes if diplomacy fails. “The president has a range of options on the table with respect to Iran as commander in chief,” she said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday expressed optimism that the government will reopen and that the president will sign Congress' funding deal later today. “We're extremely optimistic the government is going to reopen, that all Republicans are going to stick together and vote accordingly, and that bill to reopen the government will be right here at the White House, we hope in just a few short hours, to the president's desk for signature,” Leavitt said on Fox News. It follows a fierce lobbying push by President Donald Trump on Republican holdouts. A US aircraft carrier shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively approached” the ship in the Arabian Sea today, hours before two gunboats operated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached a US-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and threatened to board and seize the ship, according to a US military spokesperson. The two incidents occurred days before US and Iranian officials are due to meet Friday for diplomatic negotiations meant to avert a military clash. “The Iranian drone continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by US forces operating in international waters,” Hawkins said. The tanker was in international waters, Hawkins said. And I support that,” he told reporters on Tuesday. The former president is scheduled to appear on February 27 and the former Secretary of State to appear on February 26. “All right so we were given very limited information,” the unidentified Fulton Police officer told Peter Ellis, acting special agent in charge at the FBI's Atlanta field office after the two men exchanged a handshake. “So we have a search warrant for this like, one for the like entire location,” Ellis told the officer. “Because one way or another the records are coming with us today,” he said. Talks between the US and Iran planned for later this week hit a snag Tuesday after Tehran requested they be relocated, that regional participants be excluded, and that the discussions' scope be limited to the country's nuclear program, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The new demands could complicate efforts by Middle Eastern allies of the United States to broker a diplomatic solution to sky-high regional tensions. The talks had been set for Istanbul, with foreign ministers from Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also expected to attend. Tehran is now asking for an alternate location: Oman, the small Gulf sultanate that has previous hosted talks between the US and Iran. Already, some American officials had privately warned that Iran may be using diplomacy to play for time in preventing military action. Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday successfully quelled a conservative rebellion within his own party that threatened to block a massive funding bill, putting Congress on a path to reopening the government within hours. Johnson and his leadership team – with help from President Donald Trump — convinced all but one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, to back the procedural vote on the floor Tuesday. Trump and his team leaned hard on those rogue Republicans who had vowed to block the funding bill unless GOP leaders agreed to attach a strict voter ID bill to the package. House Oversight Chair James Comer has agreed to the dates Bill and Hillary Clinton proposed for depositions in the panel's Jeffrey Epstein probe, putting an end to the contempt of Congress proceedings that had been moving forward against them. Two sources had earlier told CNN that the Clintons agreed to appear for depositions on the panel's terms, but also suggested they wanted public hearings. Several senior Senate Democrats this morning slammed President Donald Trump's call to “nationalize” elections as an unconstitutional attempt to control the outcome of future elections. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal argued that “it's grounds for impeachment.” “Trump shouts the quiet part out loud,” Blumenthal said in a post on X. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, agreed with Blumenthal's warnings, though he did not go so far as to suggest impeachment. He wants to put his enforcers, whoever they may be, ICE or National Guard, that are loyal to him, at the polling places, to intimidate voters in the next election,” Durbin said.“What it tells us is he's very worried about the outcome of that election.” GOP Rep. Don Bacon also expressed his opposition to the idea. I'll oppose this now as well,” the congressman from Nebraska said in a post on X. Meanwhile, Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley downplayed the president's remarks, telling reporters he believed Trump was pushing for a Republican-led voter ID law known as the SAVE Act, rather than saying that the federal government should administer elections. The Constitution says that, but the due process clause, as well as other federal statutes, provide some ground rules about what you can and cannot do, and Congress has been legislating basic ground rules for federal elections since Reconstruction,” he told reporters. With the full Democratic caucus currently voting against the package, House Speaker Johnson can only afford to lose one Republican vote. The little wiggle room has left Johnson and his leadership team scrambling to win over needed lawmakers. “I'm supportive of, you know, only citizens voting and showing ID at the polling places. But I'm not in favor federalizing elections, no,” he said. Thune said he and members of his conference will discuss the SAVE Act and the desire of some to change filibuster rules at their weekly policy lunch today, but said he's made no commitments to those House members on changes to the filibuster. Some House members said they switched their positions in favor of voting for a massive federal funding bill based on their belief Thune would do so. “So, we're going to have a conversation about that but there weren't any commitments made, no,” Thune said. GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah is advocating changing the filibuster by requiring senators to stand or talk during a filibuster and not simply block action by verbally objecting to moving forward. So, there's always an opportunity cost,” he said. Thune did promise to force a floor vote on the SAVE Act, though unless the filibuster rules are changed, it won't get the 60 votes it would need to advance because Democrats strongly oppose it. Exactly when I can't give you a hard answer on that,” he said. As Colombian President Gustavo Petro meets with President Donald Trump in the White House, get caught up on what led to him being sanctioned last year. Trump accused Petro of playing a role in the global illicit drug trade, encouraging narcotics production, and of being an “illegal drug leader,” allegations that the Colombian president has repeatedly rejected. The list was established in 1995 via an executive order from then-President Bill Clinton, with the goal of fighting money laundering from narcotics traffickers in Colombia. The SDN List targets entities and individuals who act on behalf of countries that are adversarial to the US, along with US-designated terrorists and criminals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Bill Clinton, left, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton listen as Vice President Kamala Harris delivers a eulogy for U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Aug. 1, 2024, in Houston. WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton finalized an agreement with House Republicans Tuesday to testify in a House investigation into Jeffrey Epstein this month, bowing to the threat of a contempt of Congress vote against them. It will mark the first time that lawmakers have compelled a former president to testify. The arrangement comes after months of negotiating between the two sides as Republicans sought to make the Clintons a focal point in a House committee's investigation into Epstein, a convicted sex offender who killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019, and Ghislaine Maxwell, his former girlfriend. For months, the Clintons resisted subpoenas from the committee, but House Republicans — with support from a few Democrats — had advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges to a potential vote this week. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that any effort to hold them in contempt of Congress were “on pause.” They agreed to have the depositions transcribed and recorded on video, Comer said. The belligerence is likely to only grow as Republicans relish the opportunity to grill longtime political foes under oath. He has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with the late financier. Both Clintons have said they had no knowledge that Epstein was sexually abusing underage girls. The Clintons argued the subpoenas for their testimony were invalid and offered to submit sworn declarations on their limited knowledge of Epstein's crimes. But as Comer threatened to proceed with contempt of Congress charges, they began looking for an off-ramp. Both Clintons have remained highly critical of how Comer has handled the Epstein investigation and argue that he is more focused on bringing them in for testimony rather than holding the Trump administration accountable for how it has handled the release of its files on Epstein. Still, the threat of a vote on contempt charges raised the potential for Congress to use one of its most severe punishments against a former president for the first time. Historically, Congress has shown deference to former presidents. None has ever been forced to testify before lawmakers, although a few have voluntarily done so.</p>

Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume discusses President Donald Trump increasing pressure on Iran and the U.S. military presence in the Middle East on ‘Special Report.' The U.S. military shot down an unmanned Iranian drone Tuesday after it "aggressively approached a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier with unclear intent," a U.S. Central Command spokesman told Fox News. "USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) was transiting the Arabian Sea approximately 500 miles from Iran's southern coast when an Iranian Shahed-139 drone unnecessarily maneuvered toward the ship," Capt. "The Iranian drone continued to fly toward the ship despite de-escalatory measures taken by U.S. forces operating in international waters," CENTCOM also said. " An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defense and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board." (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Daniel Kimmelman) Hawkins also told Fox News on Tuesday that, "During a separate incident hours later in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) forces harassed a U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed merchant vessel lawfully transiting the international sea passage." "Guided-missile destroyer USS McFaul (DDG 74) was operating in the area and immediately responded to the scene to escort M/V Stena Imperative with defensive air support from the U.S. Air Force. An F/A-18E Super Hornet launches from the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln during routine flight operations in the Arabian Sea, in this image released by U.S. Central Command on Friday, Jan. 30, 2026. CENTCOM said the "Abraham Lincoln is deployed to support security and stability within the Middle East region." The USS Abraham Lincoln is in the Middle East after President Donald Trump said last week that, "A massive Armada is heading to Iran." The USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, is shown at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, Calif., on Aug. 11, 2025. "It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela. Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Hopefully, Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal — NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS — one that is good for all parties. Greg Norman is a reporter at Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Don Lemon arrives at the 68th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday, Feb. 1, 2026, in Los Angeles. Independent journalist Don Lemon said about a dozen federal agents came to his Los Angeles hotel to arrest him last week, even though his attorney had told authorities he would turn himself in to face federal civil rights charges over his coverage of an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church. Lemon asked to see a warrant and was told they didn't have it. The agents then summoned an FBI agent to come from outside to show Lemon the warrant on a cellphone. The Department of Justice and FBI didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Kimmel introduced Lemon, his first guest of the night, by saying he “was arrested for committing journalism.” He told reporters “I will not be silenced” after he was released in response to a judge's orders. A grand jury in Minnesota indicted Lemon, another independent journalist, Georgia Fort, and others on charges of conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshippers during the Jan. 18 protest at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor. Fort, in an interview with MS NOW's Rachel Maddow on Monday, said it was “extremely traumatic” for her family when nearly two dozen agents came to her house to arrest her. She has three daughters, and initially thought the youngest two — aged seven and eight — slept through most of it. “I did find out at some point my eight-year-old woke up but she was so terrified, she just laid in her bed and cried,” Fort said. “Now what we're seeing from them, they're afraid to be alone. They're having issues going through their normal routines. Fort said there's been a strategic attack on the press for some time, but the arrests of her and Lemon takes things to a new level. Lemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023 following a bumpy run as a morning host, has said he had no affiliation to the group that disrupted the Sunday service by entering the church. Lemon said he asked the arresting officers if they would let him make a phone call. A diamond bracelet he was wearing kept getting caught on his handcuffs, which hurt, and the agents told Lemon they would take it off. Lemon said he asked if the agent would mind taking it up to Lemon's husband in his hotel room and they agreed to do that. Otherwise, no one would have known where I was,” Lemon said. Lemon said he was kept in a holding room at the federal courthouse from midnight until 1 p.m. the following day. Kimmel himself became a symbol of a fight against censorship last year, when ABC suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for remarks made following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr pressured broadcasters to take Kimmel off the air shortly before that. ABC lifted the suspension after a public outcry, and Kimmel returned to the air with much stronger ratings than before. In Congress, Democratic senators raised concerns that Carr's actions trampled on the First Amendment. Associated Press media writer David Bauder contributed to this report.</p>

But things like that, these, these decisions that are being made, sometimes they are questionable,” she said, adding that sending White House border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis has “really brought down the temperature. Asked by CNN if Trump should consider a change in leadership at DHS, Malliotakis responded “look, that's the president's decision. I'll just say that's the president's decision, and perhaps he should be looking at all options.” Malliotakis didn't directly answer whether she has confidence in Noem, but said, “I think that a lot of people question her ability to lead this agency, particularly after what has happened.” “Now, I'm not saying she should be necessarily replaced but I think that all options need to be on the table to find the best person, if there's somebody better,” she continued. President Donald Trump called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting” in an interview with former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino that aired yesterday. Watch Tapper's take on why Trump's latest effort is about future elections, both for this year's midterms and 2028. President Donald Trump called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting” in an interview that aired Monday. CNN's Jake Tapper explains why Trump is making this push and how it could affect future elections. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday defended President Donald Trump's call for Republicans to “nationalize” elections, but suggested it's unlikely to happen. “The president is expressing his frustration about the problems we have in some of these blue states where election integrity is not always guaranteed,” he told CNN. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday argued that requiring US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to obtain a judicial warrant for apprehensions is an “unworkable proposal” – rejecting a key demand from Democrats ahead of a fight over Department of Homeland Security funding. “I'll tell you what the Democrats want to do and what we cannot do, and that is, they want to add an entirely new layer of warrant requirement,” Johnson said during a press conference on Tuesday. The House is expected to pass a spending measure that would provide short-term funding for DHS and allow for further negotiations over ICE. Democrats are pushing for reforms to ICE that include officers remove their masks, end roving patrols, tighten parameters around warrants for searches. But Johnson said Tuesday that Republicans are “never going to go along with adding an entirely new layer of judicial warrants,” a sign that reaching a deal within two weeks before DHS funding runs out will be difficult. He also argued that requiring ICE to go through the process of obtaining a judicial warrant would take “decades” and accused Democrats advocating for this provision of not wanting immigration enforcement. “The controversy has erupt where if someone is, you know, they're going to be apprehended and they run behind a closed door and lock the door. I mean, what is ICE supposed to do?” he argued. House Republicans made clear today that while they don't plan on standing in the way of advancing a package to end the partial government shutdown, lawmakers face an uphill battle to reach a bipartisan compromise to fund the Department of Homeland Security and reform immigration enforcement in two weeks. The Missouri Republican said he fears losing “leverage” against Democrats in upcoming negotiations over DHS funding, calling it “foolish” to pass a two-week bill to keep the department open while lawmakers attempt to reach a compromise. “I think in two weeks, it's we're going to be taking a lot of the Democrat demands, because we have no leverage,” he said, adding that he thinks requiring immigration agents to wear body cameras is “pretty reasonable.” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, who represents a swing state in New York, said she thinks some of Democrats' demands to reform ICE are “reasonable,” and “there is a ability here to come to an agreement where … we can protect our law enforcement, we can protect the immigrant community, and we can protect the safety of the public.” However, Malliotakis said the “biggest sticking point” is Democratic mayors and governors not cooperating with federal agents and “handing over criminals,” noting her own city's mayor, Zohran Mamdani vowing to protect undocumented immigrants against ICE raids. “If that was done, instead of, instead of having to go on the street to find these individuals, which makes it less safe for everybody involved, you'd be able to get the individuals directly from the jails,” she said. GOP leaders have indicated that targeting sanctuary city policies will be a key demand they'll make in DHS funding negotiations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized President Donald Trump's call to “nationalize the voting,” calling it “dangerous autocratic poison.” “Never in American history have we had a president so hostile to democratic traditions. Even worse, never have we had a president who breaks the norms that have made this country strong and held them together for centuries,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Schumer also criticized his Republican colleagues for their silence on the issue. “Republican senators are silent, quaking in their boots that they can never criticize Donald Trump, no matter how outrageous what he says,” Schumer said. “Republicans ought to fiercely condemn Donald Trump's vicious attacks against our democratic systems. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has arrived at the White House for his meeting with US President Donald Trump, following a turbulent year between the two countries. ET in a US Secret Service vehicle bearing the Colombian flag. It entered the White House grounds via West Executive Avenue. He asserted that both nations share the common goal of fighting drug trafficking “from an approach that prioritizes life and peace in our territories.” CNN en Español's reporters contributed to this report Follow live coverage of the meeting in Spanish here. Officials at the Colombian National Police's anti-narcotics directorate and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have told CNN they have a close working relationship that includes the exchange of intelligence and having US agents embedded with Colombian forces. In recent years, the DEA presence in Colombia has grown to become the agency's largest foreign operation, and agents say that has yielded fruit as Colombia has boosted drug seizures and arrests. DEA agents highly regard the Colombian National Police, including its specialized DIRAN anti-narcotics unit, which has DEA agents embedded for joint missions, current and former law enforcement officials told CNN. Sánchez says stopping the cooperation would be damaging to both countries. “Well, if this cooperation between our two countries did not exist, criminal organizations dedicated to drug trafficking would definitely be the ones winning. In October, Trump called Petro a “thug,” but yesterday said he was looking forward to a “good meeting” between the two. Petro became Colombia's first leftist leader after winning the country's presidential race in 2022. He won by a slim margin after two failed presidential bids in 2010 and 2018, overcoming hesitation from voters who once saw him a radical left-wing outsider. He was released from military jail in 1987, two years after being detained by police for concealing weapons. Petro said he later realized that an armed revolution was not the best strategy to win popular support. His government intends to prove to Washington that it has an effective grip on drug trafficking following the unprecedented US military operation in neighboring Venezuela to capture President Nicolás Maduro, whom the US accused of cartel ties. Petro is also aiming to have those sanctions against him overturned. CNN's Uriel Blanco, Gonzalo Zegarra, Michael Rios and Stefano Pozzebon contributed to this reporting.</p>

House Democrats are at a breaking point on whether to support a compromise funding package that would end the government shutdown — or leverage the moment to secure reforms for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). "If they're not going to make any serious reforms, there's just a sense in the House that we're not co-signing on that," Rep Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said of the spending package passed out of the Senate late last week. But Swalwell's view isn't universal among Democrats. "Yes," Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, answered simply when asked if he would vote to end the shutdown. After reaching an impasse over immigration enforcement reforms in the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., cut a deal with the White House last week to advance outstanding spending for 2026 while extending funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for two weeks. In addition to ending a four-day funding lapse for those departments, it would also give lawmakers time to negotiate over provisions for ICE. That compromise passed out of the Senate in a bipartisan 71-29 vote. In its current form, the bill does not include several key demands that Democrats have made in the wake of two fatal confrontations in Minneapolis between immigration enforcement and civilians. Among other elements, Democrats have demanded legislation to end ICE's roaming patrols, strengthen warrant requirement protections, ban masks and require visible identification for ICE agents. Without their inclusion, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., made it clear he believes the legislation falls short. "We've made a clear line in the sand. We've articulated the things that will be necessary for there to be a full-year appropriations bill connected to ICE funding," Jeffries said Monday when asked if he would support the two-week extension. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks to the media next to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Sept. 29, 2025. Even in the absence of key Democrat demands, Cuellar said he thinks the bill is consistent with his previous positions. It's the bill that we voted on with a two-week extension to Homeland [Security]," Cuellar said, referring to legislation that already passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support in January. That package included limited reforms to DHS operations — such as requiring body cameras for ICE agents and additional training on interacting with civilians. Cuellar said he is holding out hope that additional reforms can be negotiated in the two-week window. I think the dynamics have changed a little bit. There will be more wiggle room in the future." Cuellar's view is shared by other Democrats wary of a longer government shutdown — the second government funding lapse in just three months. "The House should quickly clear those bills, minimizing a lapse in funding that would shutter, at least partially, eight cabinet departments and dozens of agencies within them," DeLauro said in a press release last week. Democrats approached by Fox News Digital did not speak about how Jeffries and Schumer differ on their shutdown strategies. Rep. Jarred Moskowitz, D-Fla., did not say how he would vote but pointed out he's not surprised by the divide on an issue as charged as immigration enforcement. "I think we are at a time where we're out of sync with our Senate colleagues," Moskowitz said. "It was a deal made with Senate Dems. House Dems were not involved," Moskowitz said of the spending extension bill. Moskowitz said he understands why Democrats like Swalwell and Jeffries oppose punting negotiations on ICE. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., speaks during a press conference on Dec. 13, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Congressional Integrity Project) Moskowitz believes that as the White House begins to pull ICE out of Minnesota and requires its agents in the states to begin wearing body cameras, the pressure Democrats can exert on reforms may be diminished in two weeks as the national focus goes elsewhere. "It'll become less of a national news story, so it'll be much better to negotiate a deal for the White House at that point in time," Moskowitz said. It's unclear how many Democrats may ultimately join Cuellar and DeLauro in supporting the package. Leo Briceno is a politics reporter for the congressional team at Fox News Digital.

Noem spoke with Fox News Digital about the music awards show, saying celebrities don't realize the positive impacts operations make in their respective communities. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem spoke out after Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish and other celebrities bashed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the Grammy Awards, telling Fox News Digital that their criticism is "ill-informed." "I wish they knew what wonderful, amazing people our ICE officers are. Many of these officers live in these communities where they are doing enforcement activities," Noem told Fox News Digital during an interview at a Mississippi National Guard facility in Tupelo on Monday. "Their families live there and that's their neighbors they are protecting by getting dangerous criminals off the streets. They are going after those murderers and rapists, people that are trafficking drugs, and protecting America," Noem continued. We have reached historic lows in crime rates in this country, the lowest rate of murder and crime since we have been recording it for over 100 years," Noem also told Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two snakes were extracted in total, Ezugwu said. “She died in my hands,” said her closest friend, Paschal Nworgu. Nworgu told CNN he was by her bedside at the hospital she visited after a nearby clinic, where she'd initially sought treatment, informed her that they had no antivenom. Nworgu said that he'd arrived at the hospital, Federal Medical Center, Jabi, with Ezugwu at around noon on Saturday, two hours after receiving a WhatsApp message from Nwangene informing him that a snake had bitten her. She was only giving hand gestures,” Nworgu said. Ezugwu said that, although Nwangene received one necessary antivenom at Federal Medical Center, Jabi, another needed for her treatment was unavailable at the facility. The Federal Medical Center, Jabi has disputed that it ran out of antivenom and stood by the care its staff provided. The hospital said in a statement Sunday that staff had “acted promptly and with the utmost care” upon Nwagene's arrival, but it said she was suffering from severe neurotoxic complications. “Our medical staff provided immediate and appropriate treatment, including resuscitation efforts, intravenous fluids, intranasal oxygen, and the administration of polyvalent snake antivenom,” the statement added. However, Nwagene “experienced a sudden deterioration” just before being transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, the hospital said, adding that staff tried CPR and “other life-saving measures,” but were unable to save her. “We stand by the quality of care and dedication our team demonstrates daily. Ezugwu paid tribute to her as “an embodiment of music,” highlighting her versatility in both classical and pop genres. Nworgu, who often performed alongside her, shared that one of her biggest dreams was to sing on Broadway. Recently, Nwangene had completed French classes and left her job as an architect to focus on her music career, Nworgu said. Nwangene's death has sparked widespread outrage among Nigerians, many expressing their discontent with the country's health care system. Human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong, wrote on X: “The tragic death of Ifunanya Nwangene from snake bite is a reminder of the poor state of healthcare in Nigeria. Emergency medical care in this country is terrible. Her death isn't due to spiritual attack, it's as a result of failure of get quick care.” Last month, Nigeria's Health Minister Muhammad Ali Pate acknowledged that the country's health care system faces “systemic challenges in ensuring consistent quality of care and patient safety” and announced the formation of a national task force to address these issues. The creation of this task force came after widespread outrage over the death of renowned author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 21-month-old son at a Lagos hospital. “Snake bite is a neglected public health issue in many tropical and subtropical countries,” according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which estimates that more than 5 million people are bitten by snakes each year, resulting in about 100,000 deaths annually. “Most of these occur in Africa, Asia and Latin America,” the WHO said. It noted in a 2018 report that there had been concerns about the “low availability of safe, effective antivenom immunoglobulin products for the Sub-Saharan African region.”</p>

Investigations by Credit Suisse have uncovered hundreds of Nazi-linked accounts at the bank, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, announced Tuesday. Multiple reports provided to Grassley have identified 890 accounts linked to the Nazi regime, including wartime accounts for the German Foreign Office, a German arms manufacturing company and the German Red Cross, Grassley told reporters Monday. The new accounts are coming to light after UBS acquired Credit Suisse in a 2023 takeover. The bank then hired U.S. prosecutor Neil Barofsky to identify any Nazi-linked accounts. Grassley and representatives of UBS will dig deeper into the findings during a Senate Judiciary hearing on connections between various Swiss banks and the Nazis later Tuesday morning. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is leading a hearing on connections between Swiss banks and the Holocaust. "We approach today's topic with solemn respect," Robert Karofsky, president of UBS Americas, is expected to say at the hearing, according to a copy of his remarks obtained by NBC News. Grassley's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Credit Suiss was acquired by UBS in 2023, kicking off investigations. Tuesday's hearing comes a week after International Holocaust Remembrance Day, during which President Donald Trump's administration reflected on the genocide committed by Nazi Germany during World War II. "Today, we pay respect to the blessed memories of the millions of Jewish people, who were murdered at the hands of the Nazi Regime and its collaborators during the Holocaust— as well as the Slavs and the Roma, people with disabilities, religious leaders, persons targeted based on their sexual orientation, and political prisoners who were also targeted for systematic slaughter," Trump said in a statement. "On January 27, 1945, 81 years ago today, Allied forces liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Nazi Regime's largest concentration and death camp in World War II, where over one million people were marched to their senseless deaths," the presidential message, released by the White House, noted. President Donald Trump marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day last week. My Administration will remain a steadfast and unequivocal champion for Jewish Americans and the God-given right of every American to practice their faith freely, openly, and without fear," he asserted.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿We're about to lose our last nuclear arms control treaty with Russia. Barring a major unforeseen announcement from Washington or Moscow, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia will expire on Wednesday. It's been a long, slow death for the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which went into force in 2011 to replace the earlier post-Cold War START treaty and place limits on both countries' arsenals of deployed nuclear warheads and launchers. Originally slated to expire in 2021, it was extended for five years after an agreement between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, with just two days left before the deadline. In February 2023, Putin announced that Russia was suspending its participation in the verification measures under the treaty, but would continue to abide by its numerical limits. Now, neither side is bound by those limits, raising concerns of a return to the era of arms races. Now, the world is on the precipice of what some call a new nuclear age, one in which these weapons are returning to the center of global politics after a post-Cold War lull. Russia has routinely threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine; Trump has called for a resumption of nuclear testing in the United States; and US allies, concerned about the reliability of American security guarantees, are more openly discussing developing their own nuclear capabilities. China's rapid nuclear build-up is threatening to create a complex “three-body problem” for arms control. And the integration of new technologies like artificial intelligence into nuclear systems could lead to destabilizing new dynamics for deterrence. Still, for all his bluster, and the antipathy he showed to arms control agreements in his first term, President Donald Trump has suggested in the past that he's open to “denuclearization” talks. “When you take off nuclear restrictions, that's a big problem,” Trump told reporters in July, and he hasn't made clear what he's actually going to do once the deal expires. So, is there any hope for getting nuclear talks back on track, or are doomed to a new arms race? To get some perspective on that question, Vox spoke with Rose Gottemoeller, who, as assistant secretary of state for arms control in the Obama administration, was the chief US negotiator in the talks that led to New START. Gottemoeller later served as deputy secretary general of NATO from 2016 to 2019 and is now a lecturer at the Stanford University Freeman Spogli Institute and a fellow at the Hoover Institution. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Well, the New START Treaty limited the strategic offensive nuclear forces of the United States and Russia to 1,550 deployed warheads and 700 delivery vehicles — those are missiles and bombers that are used to deliver nuclear weapons. Those basic limits have held now for about 15 years. As of Wednesday, unless something else happens, and there's no agreement by President Trump and his administration to extend the limits of the treaty, then we will be in a situation where there will be no limits. Is there any chance of it being extended? People have been talking kind of loosely about this, but the treaty cannot be extended. But what President Putin proposed back in September was to extend the limits of the treaty for another year in order, as he said, to prepare time for further negotiations. Indeed, when I was negotiating the New START Treaty, START went out of force in December of 2009, and we — on the basis of a political handshake with Moscow — agreed to extend the limits of START for what turned out to be another year plus. So, what could actually happen now that these limits are no longer in place? Or, maybe, the United States will take some time to make that announcement. [Russian Foreign Minister Sergei] Lavrov and [Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri] Peskov have said that, as long as the United States stays within the limits of New START, Russia will stay within the limits of New START. So, the administration really doesn't need to make any announcement. President Trump has spoken repeatedly about wanting to hold talks about reducing the number of nuclear weapons with Russia, China, and other countries. But at the moment, I don't see any signs that those negotiations are being prepared. I don't see any signs out of Washington or any diplomatic activity that would suggest that there are some quiet behind the scenes talks going on. If there were actually serious energy being devoted to this, do you think that it's even realistic we could have meaningful arms control talks with the Russians right now given the war in Ukraine? “We need to be thinking together with other nuclear armed states about how to sustain nuclear stability going forward, given everything we can see coming at us in the technology race.” And the Trump administration, at least at the moment, seems to be saying that, yes, until we get Ukraine resolved, we can't really move forward on these new talks with the Russians on nuclear matters. But I keep reminding people that, in the past, we used to deconflict nuclear negotiations from anything else going on in the relationship. We've known each other and been in this business together for a long time. How does China's rapid nuclear build-up complicate this picture? An argument you sometimes hear is that we need to bring the Chinese into the discussion, because otherwise they will just keep expanding their arsenal while we limit ours. We're just not used to talking to each other about these issues, and the Chinese, in particular, have been very, very resistant to discussing in detail what their objectives are with their nuclear modernization. If they're looking for nuclear weapons and nuclear deterrence to provide them some stability in the relationship, they need to come clean on what their intentions are, because otherwise, there's always a worry about them arms racing and seeking strategic advantage. So, that's an important difference between Russia and China. I will say, I don't believe that we should try to shoehorn China into nuclear negotiations with the United States and Russia, because the numbers are still too disparate. They have, at this moment, approximately 600 total nuclear warheads. So, the numbers are still vastly different, and that's why I keep saying to people that we have no need to panic about this Chinese buildup. We've received strategic warning that they are doing something different now. So, let's take the time and make the effort to figure out what their objectives are and take control of this build-up so we don't end up with the kind of two-nuclear-peer threat that so worries Washington. That's my bottom line: Let's take a chill pill here. We've got time to work on this problem. How might new technology — whether it's hypersonic missiles or the integration of artificial intelligence into command-and-control systems — complicate future arms control negotiations or change the type of agreements we might seek going forward? I've generally looked at new technologies as an opportunity for the nuclear arms control arena, because I think it can improve the sophistication of how we've done monitoring and verification and accounting for nuclear systems. There are technologies that will help us in maintaining stable nuclear deterrence. I do worry about what the effects [of artificial intelligence] will be on first-strike stability, and that's why President Biden sat down with Xi Jinping in Lima and agreed to make sure there's always a person in the loop for nuclear command and control decision making. And then, I also worry that the very same technology that improves our ability to find and track mobile missiles could eventually, at some point, be an issue, even for our submarine-based forces. So, yeah, I think there's downsides and upsides to the technology revolution, and we need to be thinking together with other nuclear armed states about how to sustain nuclear stability going forward, given everything we can see coming at us in the technology race. I think a couple of things have happened since then. First, Putin now feels like he's got the momentum. I do hope these talks that Trump and his administration have been pushing can produce results, but Putin's in a much more confident place than he was back at the beginning of the war. The second thing I think is a really interesting phenomenon, and it's the way both Xi Jinping in Beijing and also Narendra Modi in Delhi pressed Putin back during that period in late 2022 not to use nuclear weapons. Those two men even spoke publicly to Putin in November of 2022 during a summit meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Kazakhstan; they reproved him publicly. But both of them stated that nuclear weapons should not be used in Ukraine. So, I do think that that has been effective, and it has perhaps tamped down the nuclear saber rattling among the top leadership. Looking back over the past 15 years, are there steps that could have been taken so that we didn't get to this point — so that we're not left, effectively, without any arms control between the US and Russia? People don't remember this anymore, but you may recollect President Obama was quite ambitious. New START was supposed to be the first of several nuclear arms control and reduction agreements that he wanted to negotiate in his time in office. And, you know, once Dmitry Medvedev was removed from the presidency [in 2012], and Putin stepped back into that role, there was no love lost between Obama and Putin, and Putin simply declared that he was not willing to negotiate anymore with the United States until the limits of New START were achieved in 2018. So, yeah, we could have had other agreements in place by this time if that more positive trajectory in the US-Russia relationship had continued. And it's only gotten worse over the ensuing decade-plus. This story was produced in partnership with Outrider Foundation and Journalism Funding Partners. What to know about the latest — and last?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news breaks, you need to understand what actually matters. At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. But we can't do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? William Foege helped give us a world without smallpox. We're marking his death by letting measles come back. Elementary schools and highways would have been named after him. A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. Which, perhaps, is the perfect epitaph for his life's work. It makes sense if you're only passingly familiar with smallpox. The disease was declared eradicated in the US in 1949, and Americans haven't been routinely vaccinated against it for more than 50 years. But smallpox was one of the deadliest viruses in human history, killing an estimated 300 million people in the 20th century alone. For centuries smallpox was simply a background fact of civilization, the way “flu season” is a background fact now — except with grotesquely higher stakes. The eradication of smallpox, which was formally declared on May 8, 1980, is a civilizational achievement I'd put on par with any other, all the more so because it was a collaborative global effort. Humanity took a disease that had been killing us for thousands of years, one so merciless that it single-handedly destroyed empires, and eliminated it forever. If you asked me to identify the height of what human beings can do when they work together on a single goal, I would point to this. The cruel irony, though, is that Foege's death comes at a moment when the US government is turning its back on vaccination, and standing idly by while long-conquered diseases like measles come roaring back. And it's happening in part because we've mistaken the quiet of victory — the victory won by Foege and his colleagues — for proof that there never was a war. Smallpox had been killing human beings for at least 3,000 years; the mummified head of the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses V, who died 1157 BCE, shows evidence of the distinct, bumpy rash that made smallpox so horrifyingly visible. Three in 10 people who contracted the highly contagious disease died, while survivors were often left scarred and even blinded. So terrifying was smallpox, which was caused by the variola virus, that many religions and cultures had the equivalent of a “smallpox demon,” like India's Shitala Mata. Smallpox was particularly dangerous to children, and in 17th-century England children were even not considered full members of the family until they had survived their smallpox infection. A thousand years ago, people in Asia were practicing a kind of vaccination-lite called variolation, deliberately infecting people with a mild case of the disease to guarantee immunity, though the process came with the risk of developing severe smallpox. Yet just having an incredibly effective vaccine wasn't enough to fully defeat the disease, especially in poor countries. Even as some human beings were preparing to go to the moon, others were dying of the same disease that had killed pharaohs — and few people thought that would ever change. That very same year, a previously abandoned World Health Organization effort to eradicate smallpox was revived. Scientists believed that at least 80 percent of every population had to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, but in high-density or war-torn areas like India or Nigeria, that seemed an impossible task. He was serving as a Lutheran missionary doctor when he began working for the effort in eastern Nigeria, where he and his team struggled to control outbreaks in isolated rural areas and with limited supplies of vaccine. Instead of aiming for mass vaccination, his team prioritized finding people with smallpox, isolating them, and vaccinating their contacts and nearby communities. Foege's team could stop an outbreak in its tracks by vaccinating as little as 7 percent of the population, simply by ensuring they were vaccinating the right 7 percent. There were other advances that made eradication possible, like the bifurcated needle, which made vaccination campaigns cheaper and easier to deploy, as well as the development of a heat-stable, freeze-dried vaccine that could be stored without refrigeration. And very much unlike today, the smallpox campaign saw geopolitical enemies work together. In 1977, just 10 years after the intensified program was launched, a hospital cook in Somalia named Ali Maow Maalin became the last person on Earth to naturally contract smallpox. On May 8, 1980, after enough time had passed to be sure, the World Health Assembly declared that “the world and all its peoples had won freedom from smallpox.” A virus that had haunted humanity for thousands of years was gone. He would serve as CDC director under Presidents Carter and Reagan, and he was instrumental in pushing for global campaigns around childhood immunization. At each stop he was motivated by the belief that, with enough effort, infectious diseases could be rolled back. As he once wrote: “Humanity does not have to live in a world of plagues, disastrous governments, conflict, and uncontrolled health risks. The fact of smallpox eradication remains a constant reminder that we should settle for nothing less.” But today, that “better future” seems further off than ever. As of January 29, the CDC had counted 588 measles cases already in 2026, with the vast majority linked to outbreaks that started last year; meanwhile, kindergarten measles vaccine coverage has fallen to 92.5 percent — well below the roughly 95 percent level that keeps measles from finding oxygen. But “nothing happening” is not nature; it's deliberate and difficult maintenance. A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sources said that Gabbard brokered a short call after the raid, which lasted about one minute. On the call, Trump asked a few questions and praised the agents, with one source likening it to a halftime pep talk for players, though he didn't give them any substantial direction. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche acknowledged that Gabbard had brokered the call on Monday in an appearance on Fox News, noting it with approval. “The president talks to law enforcement all week long, and so the fact that he talked with agents working hard doesn't surprise me, and actually, I love it. Blanche said he didn't have much more information, though he offered up that Gabbard was simply in the area rather than part of the investigation. Trump praised her role the day after, saying she was working to keep elections secure. “They got into the votes with a signed judge's order in Georgia, and you're going to see some interesting things happening. They've been trying to get there for a long time.” Democrats quickly cried foul over Gabbard's role, with Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) claiming it was a preamble to an assault on voting rights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) bashed Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, over her vow to arrest anyone who entered Washington, D.C., with a firearm. Massie took issue with her stance, specifically her vow to arrest anyone with a gun in the District. “The District of Columbia has been ‘shall issue' since 2017 when the requirement that you must have a ‘good reason' to carry a handgun was struck down. Non-residents can obtain a permit in DC — don't ask me how I know,” Massie said in a post on X, hinting that he owned a gun while residing in the district. The Monday comments from Pirro came as a shock to many, given the Trump administration's previous outspoken stance in favor of gun rights. I don't care if you have a license in another district and I don't care if you're a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else. You bring a gun into this district, count on going to jail and hope you get the gun back. And that makes all the difference,” Pirro said. In March 2024, she condemned the Biden administration for trying to pursue gun control laws, saying, “Criminals don't care what laws you pass.” Her recent rhetoric prior to Monday was about pursuing a crackdown on illegal firearms in Washington, which she blamed for a prior rise in homicides.</p>
