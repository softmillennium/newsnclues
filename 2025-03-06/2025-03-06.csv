 A group of UN human rights experts said Thursday that Israel is again ""weaponising starvation"" in Gaza by blocking humanitarian aid after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired. 

 A fragile ceasefire since January 19 saw an influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza, before Israel on Sunday announced it was blocking deliveries until Palestinian militant group Hamas accepted its terms for an extension of the ceasefire. 

 The group of more than 30 experts specialists in various fields who are mandated by the UN Human Rights Council but do not speak on behalf of the United Nations said the Israeli action breached international law. 

 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel would ""open the gates of hell"" in Gaza if all hostages taken in the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks were not returned. Gaza has already been devastated by the war that followed the attacks. 

 ""Apart from the cruelty of these statements on the second day of the holy month of Ramadan, these moves are patently unlawful under international law,"" the experts said. 

 ""As the occupying power, Israel is always obliged to ensure sufficient food, medical supplies and other relief services."" 

 ""Israel is once again weaponising aid. These are serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws, and war crimes and crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute,"" they added. 

 Israel stopped aid deliveries into Gaza saying they were being diverted by Hamas. 

 With significant US involvement, Hamas and Israel are arguing over how to extend the ceasefire. 

 Israel wants an extension of the first phase of the ceasefire until mid-April. It is demanding the return of hostages, the total demilitarisation of Gaza and the departure of Hamas before the second phase of the ceasefire accord starts. 

 Hamas has demanded that the second phase, which should see the negotiation of a permanent ceasefire, be started and that the group should remain in the territory it has run since 2007.

 France introduced new regulations Thursday that will require major pornography sites to check the ages of visitors or risk being blocked. 

 France introduced rules in January that required all French porn websites and those based outside the European Union to introduce a mechanism to check the age of users. 

 This was extended with a decree published Thursday that widens the measures to companies based in the European Union, meaning Cyprus-based PornHub and YouPorn as well as Hungary-based Jacquie et Michel. 

 France's culture ministry said the move will ""at last enable us to block minors from accessing the most-visited porngraphic websites in France"", calling it ""a major advance in the protection of our children and adolescents."" 

 Successive governments have battled for years to find ways to stop young people viewing online pornography while balancing the right to privacy of adult users. 

 Age verification can be done with a credit card or by sending an identity document, but websites are also required to offer at least one ""double blind"" option for users to prove their age without revealing their identity. 

 This entails the user uploading an identity document to a service provider, which then sends confirmation they are old enough to visit the site to the porn provider without revealing the user's identity. 

 Aylo, the parent company of Pornhub, has said it will comply with the law but has warned that the rules would likely prove ""ineffective"" and ""dangerous"" for users' security and privacy. 

 It argues that under-age internet users could be sent to other less regulated and more extreme areas of the internet. 

 A 2023 report by French senators entitled ""Hell Behind the Scenes"" concluded that there was ""massive, ordinary and toxic"" viewing of porn by children, as well as routinely violent content. 

 The report found that two thirds of children aged 15 or less had seen pornographic content.

 The armed wing of Palestinian militant group Hamas said Thursday it remained committed to its fragile ceasefire with Israel, even after the first phase drew to a close at the weekend. 

 ""Despite all the enemy's attempts at evasion, lies and deception... we preferred and still prefer to adhere to the agreement in order to spare the blood of our people,"" Abu Obaida, spokesman for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said in a video statement. 

 The first phase of the fragile truce, which largely halted more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza, drew to a close at the weekend after six weeks of relative calm that included exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. 

 While Israel has said it wants to extend the first phase until mid-April, Hamas has insisted that the second phase go ahead as planned. 

 Israel has ramped up its rhetoric and halted the flow of goods and supplies into Gaza. 

 On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump warned the people of Gaza that they would be ""DEAD"" unless all the remaining hostages were released. 

 Hamas has said Trump's comments will encourage Israel to ignore the terms of the ceasefire. 

 Abu Obaida warned against any escalation. 

 ""We warn the families of the that until today we have proof of life for those who remain alive among the prisoners,"" the spokesman said. 

 ""Any escalation of aggression against our people will likely lead to the death of some enemy prisoners, as has happened in many cases in the past."" 

 Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas's October 2023 attack which triggered the war, 58 remain in captivity, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. 

 The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, most of them civilians, while Israel's retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 48,446 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the two sides. 

 Earlier on Thursday, Israel's military said that ""several suspects were identified planting an explosive device in the ground"" near soldiers operating in northern Gaza, adding that a military aircraft struck them ""in order to remove the threat.""

The US is ""destroying"" the established world order, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK has claimed.

Valerii Zaluzhnyi said the White House had ""questioned the unity of the Western world"" and was ""taking more and more steps towards"" Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The comments come as the US puts pressure on Ukraine to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, and after a public clash between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump.

Zelensky has since said he is ""ready to work"" under Trump's ""strong leadership"", an apparent cooling in tensions welcomed by Trump - and which comes after the US paused military aid to Kyiv.

But Mr Zaluzhnyi's remarks at a conference at Chatham House in London on Thursday suggest there remains discontent over the US's actions.

He told an audience: ""We see that it is not only Russia and the axis of evil trying to destroy the world order, but the US is actually destroying it completely"".

The Ukrainian envoy added that talks between the US and Russia - the latter of which was ""headed by a war criminal"" in President Vladimir Putin - showed the White House was making ""steps towards the Kremlin regime, fully realising that in this case Europe could be a new target for Russia"".

Mr Zaluzhnyi, who took over as Kyiv's ambassador to London in 2024 following three years as commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, also suggested that Nato could cease to exist as a result of Washington's change in posture.

While Zelensky has expressed a wish to bring the war in Ukraine to an end swiftly, Kyiv has voiced concerns about the Trump administration's handling of talks and the concessions to Moscow that may be made without firm security guarantees for Ukraine.

Trump vowed during the US election campaign to bring the war to an end quickly, and preliminary US-Russian talks were held in Saudi Arabia last month - without European or Ukrainian representatives present.

The US's decision to halt its military assistance to Ukraine and intelligence sharing has been cast by Trump administration officials as a means of getting Kyiv to co-operate with the US-led peace talks. 

Any corresponding pressure the US has been putting on Moscow to make concessions has not been made public.

Zaluzhnyi said the pause in intelligence sharing, as well as an earlier decision to oppose a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine, were ""a huge challenge for the entire world"".

His comments come as Politico reports that members of Trump's team held discussions with some of Zelensky's political opponents, after Trump allies suggested the Ukrainian president should stand aside as his term expired in May.

Citing unnamed sources in the US and Ukraine, it says talks were held with opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and senior members of Petro Poroshenko's party, who preceded Zelensky as president.

Independent opinion polls in Ukraine suggest Zaluzhnyi has the most public support with at least 70%, Zelensky has 57% support, and Poroshenko about 20%. Tymoshenko and Poroshenko both have their own red lines and share a pro-European stance.

Responding to the report, Tymoshenko said her team was talking with ""all allies who can help ensure a just peace as soon as possible"", while noting elections cannot be held under Ukraine's constitution while it is under martial law.

Poroshenko wrote in a lengthy statement that his party worked ""publicly and transparently"" with the US, and that meetings have focused on supporting Ukraine's war effort.

While criticising Zelensky's government over its political decisions and communications with the US, he too stressed that elections could only take place after a ceasefire was signed.

While the Politico article suggested the Trump administration may be seeking an alternative to Zelensky, these meetings appear to be long-standing and predate both the war and the recent straining of ties with the US.

However the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.

Green and fellow Democrats began singing after the House voted to censure the Texas congressman over his Trump speech disruption.

The Texas congressman was ejected from the House chamber earlier this week during Trump's address to the nation.

Three people narrowly escaped a falling tree that crashed onto a sidewalk in Brooklyn, New York.

The countries, largely from Europe and the Commonwealth, would not all send troops but are offering support.

Timothy Cho, a two-time defector from North Korea, has revealed the difficulties citizens go through in the secretive nation in order to purchase simple consumer goods such as TVs. Mr Cho, an escapee from North Korea who survived being tortured by authorities after a failed attempt to flee the country before finally settling in the UK, recently spoke to LADbible about his life in the hermit kingdom, which is currently ruled by Kim Jong-un. He shed light on the bizarre and rigid media control in the country and revealed how something as simple as owning a television can be particularly difficult in North Korea. 

According to Mr Cho, buying a television in North Korea comes with a complimentary visit from a government official who makes sure you are not able to access any of the non-state broadcasts. ""If you buy a TV in North Korea, the government come to your house and take all antennas out and leave only one antenna,"" he told LADbible as he was asked about censorship in the country. 

""What is it about? Kim family... programmes, documentaries, songs. All 24/7,"" he said, adding, ""If you watch TV... it's all about Kim family propaganda.""

In the interview, Mr Cho also revealed some other unusual regulations in the country. He said that even something as innocent as a haircut has become political. Children as young as school age are expected to have their hair cut in either ""one or two or three"" different regulation hairstyles. If anyone sporting a hairstyle even a couple of centimeters longer than allowed can find themselves in trouble, Mr Cho said. 

""If you have something different... then your parents are in trouble. They're being summoned (to) come to the police station and write a statement,"" he explained.

Further, Mr Cho said that the first ruler, Kim Il-sung, is revered as the ""eternal leader"" who never truly dies. His son, Kim Jong-il, is hailed as the ""Son of God"". ""Every national holiday, you have to go to the Kim family statue and bow to it. That is worship,"" Mr Cho said. 

Mr Cho's account is particularly crucial as not many North Koreans have successfully been able to flee the regime. It is estimated that at least 30,000 North Korean citizens have escaped the country since the 1950s, with successful escapees settling anywhere in Seoul, China, Europe or America. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The complex will provide recreational opportunities to all students, faculty and staff in addition to hosting ceremonies and other public and private events for the Northeastern and neighboring Boston communities.

Northeastern University is moving forward with plans to build a state-of-the-art, multi-purpose athletics and recreation complex on the site of Matthews Arena in Boston.

University leaders describe the new complex as an investment in the future that will provide recreational opportunities to all students, faculty and staff in addition to hosting ceremonies and other public and private events for the Northeastern and neighboring Boston communities.

The new multi-purpose complex will include a modern Division 1 athletics arena and training facilities that will elevate Northeastern’s varsity athletic programs, especially in the nationally recognized sports of basketball and ice hockey.

“This is a place where memories will be made,” says Ken Henderson, chancellor and senior vice president for learning at Northeastern. “This will be a place where we hold convocation, where we hold graduations, where we hold events for recreation, club sports and varsity sports. It will also be a place where students are coming together in small groups and large crowds.

“It will be transformational,” Henderson says.

The 310,000-square-foot complex will occupy the entire two-acre footprint of Matthews Arena, including areas currently used as surface parking lots.

It will include an arena that will seat 4,050 people for ice hockey and 5,300 for basketball, providing excellent sightlines for fans as well as for television broadcasts of Northeastern competitions. It will be Northeastern’s largest indoor gathering space, also enabling thousands of people to attend academic ceremonies and other non-athletic events.

The most profound improvement of the new multi-story complex is its commitment to serving a wide variety of university and community interests simultaneously, with an emphasis on student recreation.

Its multi-purpose nature will create myriad opportunities that cannot be matched by Matthews Arena, Henderson says.

“We love Matthews Arena, but it is a single-use space. It’s an arena where you can do one thing at a time,” Henderson says. “The new complex will have multiple events and activities going on at the same time. You could be having a hockey game at the same time as you’re having a club soccer game on the floor above — and perhaps a varsity basketball practice is being held, while other students are lifting weights and doing cardiovascular training at an individual level.”

Students will welcome greater access to recreational facilities, says Ella Freedman, a second-year undergraduate studying music industry and communication studies.

“I do think students — especially freshmen and new people coming in — will be excited about it,” Freedman says. “Everyone wants more space to work out. So that is a huge benefit for students and something a lot of people will look forward to. Having enough space for students to feel encouraged to have a healthy lifestyle is really important.”

The investment in a new complex will be worthwhile, says Emma Sullivan, who will be graduating with a degree in journalism and English in May.

“I won’t be a student by the time the new complex opens, but I do think it will be a really great opportunity for the next generations of Northeastern students,” Sullivan says. “Getting the opportunity to grow in that space is going to be really cool.”

Jim Madigan, a former ice hockey star and men’s coach at Northeastern who now serves as the university’s athletic director, envisions the new complex thrusting the Husky varsity programs to a higher competitive level.

“For our varsity sports, this building signals to our peers and our competitors that Northeastern represents excellence,” Madigan says. “It is going to be a game-changer for our programs to recruit the best student-athletes to Northeastern. It signals to them that we’re serious about the development and success of our student-athletes and it signals to our coaches that this is a place where we can win national championships and league championships, where we have the modern-day amenities to compete against any institution in the country.”

The men’s and women’s varsity basketball programs will each have a practice court, which will be a boon to recruiting, according to Madigan. There will be improved training facilities and office spaces for varsity athletes and coaches. An example of the new building’s versatility will be the presence of indoor rowing tanks for the men’s and women’s varsity teams.

For spectators, the arena will offer a “first-rate fan experience” with high-end concessions and multiple entry and exit points. Fans will be seated near the action with a dedicated section behind one of the hockey goals for the DogHouse, providing the Huskies with an impassioned advantage for home games.

“The building is going to offer food and entertainment and excitement and enjoyment,” Madigan says. “This is a complex that will be bringing people together. It’s going to create a sense of community, a sense of belonging throughout the university.”

The multipurpose athletic complex is the next step in an extended series of infrastructure investments on Northeastern’s Boston campus that have included the developments of International Village, East Village, the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex and EXP.

Since its 1979 purchase by Northeastern, Matthews Arena has served as a community venue for high school graduations and other events. That access will grow when the new complex is opened, says John Tobin, Northeastern’s vice president for city and community engagement.

“This new complex will allow us to increase our offerings with our neighbors and with our great partners in the City of Boston,” Tobin says. “It’s going to be more than just a building. It will serve as a vital part of Boston’s civic community from concerts to blood drives to Boston Public School ice hockey games. It will bring people together in ways that matter.”

Matthews Arena was originally constructed in 1910 and rebuilt in 1918 after a devastating fire. At that time it was known as Boston Arena, and over the years it would serve as a home to the Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics in addition to a wide variety of sporting, cultural and community events.

It was renamed by Northeastern in 1982 in honor of George Matthews, who would rise to chairman of the Board of Trustees, and his wife, Hope. 

Northeastern has invested millions of dollars in renovations of Matthews Arena over the years. The replacement of its historic features predating Northeastern’s ownership makes Matthews Arena ineligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, according to a 2023 evaluation conducted by Epsilon Associates.

The new complex, designed by the architectural firm Perkins&Will, is pursuing net-zero carbon certification and the deconstruction of the existing arena will capture reclaimed materials. Suffolk Construction is the contractor for the project, which will reuse rainwater for ice making, irrigation, and flushing, among other green initiatives.

During construction, the men’s and women’s basketball programs will move their games and practices to the Cabot Physical Education Center. Northeastern is making arrangements with local facilities to host the men’s and women’s hockey practices and games.

The project is awaiting final approvals from the city and state, which will determine the timelines for deconstruction and construction.

British Defence Secretary John Healey and his US counterpart Pete Hegseth are holding talks in Washington. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders met in Brussels, where he thanked Europe ""for staying with us"" during a turbulent week with the US.

Thursday 6 March 2025 19:42, UK

EU leaders have approved a statement in support of Ukraine without the backing of Hungary, an official has said.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has advocated for the bloc to support talks between the US and Russia.

Our Europe correspondent Siobhan Robbins said Orban's reluctance was well known heading into the meeting.

He had written an open letter outlining he couldn't back vows to continue support for Ukraine for as long as it takes.

In any case, Robbins said there has been a ""sea change"" across the continent over defence spending, with a ""renewed focus"" since Donald Trump came into power for a second time.

""It has become really apparent that they believe there is a new threat, that there is a new era,"" she added.

Money from frozen Russian assets held in Europe must be ""unfrozen"", a Ukrainian MP has just told us.

Speaking to our chief presenter Mark Austin, Lesia Vasylenko said it is a ""just and fair way to tackle the aggressor"".

European leaders are looking at how to utilise some £232bn of assets frozen by the G7 after Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron said last week the assets could be used as leverage in negotiations with Russia to end the war.

Some have also argued they could be dedicated to the reconstruction of Ukraine.

But Vasylenko told us: ""Before we start rebuilding Ukraine, we must actually preserve Ukraine as it is as an independent country.""

She also urged the UK to take a lead.

""It's a matter of political will and political will that needs to come from the UK - the UK can set the example for the rest of Europe and certainly Brussels will follow,"" she added.

We're now hearing from the US defence secretary, who is meeting with his UK counterpart John Healey.

Asked if Donald Trump's decision to halt military aid to Ukraine is permanent, Pete Hegseth says: ""As the president has pointed out, it is a pause. Exactly what he said from the beginning. Pause - pending a true commitment to a path to peace.""

He adds Trump is ""paying a very keen eye"" to what Kyiv is ""saying and doing about committing to that peace process"".

""And we're very encouraged by the signs we're seeing,"" he adds.

""Ultimately, he [Trump] will make the determination.""

Moscow has already had much to say about comments made by Emmanuel Macron yesterday.

The French president suggested starting talks about using France's nuclear deterrent to protect Europe from Russian threats - comments blasted this morning as ""confrontational"" by Kremlin mouthpiece Dmitry Peskov.

Vladimir Putin also appeared to take aim at Macron today, saying there are still people ""who want to go back to the times of Napoleon, forgetting how it ended"".

Now Russia's foreign ministry has said his speech contained ""notes of nuclear blackmail"" and reflected Paris's ambition to ""become the nuclear patron of all of Europe"".

The ministry also warned Macron's statement ""will be taken into account by Russia in its defence planning"". 

Some remarks to bring you now from Donald Trump's special envoy.

Steve Witkoff, whose brief is officially for the Middle East but has been involved in negotiations with Russia, has just said a meeting with Ukraine is in the works.

Hailing Volodymyr Zelenskyy's letter to Trump - sent after their disastrous meeting in the White House last week - as a ""positive first step"", he continued: ""We are now in discussions to coordinate a meeting with the Ukrainians in Riyadh or even potentially Jeddah.""

""The city is moving around a little bit, but it will be Saudi Arabia,"" he added.

Washington is trying to agree a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire for Ukraine, he said.

Vladimir Putin says ""some people"" seem to have forgotten what happened to 19th century French emperor Napoleon, in comments seemingly directed towards Emmanuel Macron.

Yesterday, the French president called Russia a threat to Europe and raised the idea of putting
other European countries under France's nuclear umbrella in a televised address. 

Speaking this afternoon, Putin said: ""There are still people who want to go back to the times of Napoleon, forgetting how it ended."" 

Napoleon marched his French army across Russia and into Moscow in 1812 but was then forced into retreat with massive loss of life.

Senior Trump
administration officials will travel to Saudi Arabia to meet
with Ukrainian officials next week, according to reports.

The meeting will be held on Wednesday, Axios said, citing two unnamed sources.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio and others depart for Riyadh on Tuesday for the meeting, which will include top Zelenskyy aide Andriy Yermak, a Fox News reporter posted on X.

Earlier we brought you remarks from the Russian ambassador to the UK in an interview with Sky News' The World With Yalda Hakim.

Andrei Kelin said Russia wanted ""quick peace"" in Ukraine and the UK was at the ""head of those resisting"" it.

He ruled out NATO peacekeepers and said Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia should be recognised as Russian.

You can now watch the full interview below...

Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed an upcoming meeting among military officials from countries ""willing to put in greater efforts to ensure reliable security in the context of ending this war"".

The meeting will take place on Tuesday, he said, after the pair talked on the sidelines of the European Council meeting in Brussels.

""I thanked Emmanuel for his clear and principled stance in support of Ukraine and the need for new, more substantial steps to protect our entire Europe - our peoples, our institutions, and our European way of life,"" said Zelenskyy.

""We have an absolutely clear shared vision that real and lasting peace is possible through cooperation between Ukraine, all of Europe, and the United States. The war must end as soon as possible.""

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has outlined his vision for how he thinks peace can be achieved in Ukraine.

The wartime leader says a truce including no attacks on energy and civilian infrastructure and on military operations in the Black Sea would be a good start.

""Everyone must ensure that Russia, the sole source of this war, accepts the need to end it. 

""This can be proved by two forms of silence: no attacks on energy and other civilian infrastructure – a truce for missiles, bombs, long-range drones; no military operations in the Black Sea.""

He then says the release of prisoners ""could serve as a means of establishing basic trust"" which could then serve as a ""prologue"" to a ""full and fair settlement"".

This, he adds, would lead ""to a comprehensive agreement on security guarantees and the end of the war"".

""Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing those steps,"" he says.

Zelenskyy adds that Ukrainian and American teams ""have resumed work"" and he hopes that next week the two nations will have a ""meaningful meeting"".

'Europe must rearm'

Addressing today's summit of EU leaders in Brussels, Zelenskyy says he welcomes the European Commission’s efforts to rearm Europe.

""The ReArm Europe Plan is the right initiative,"" he says.

""The defence funds under this European Plan should strengthen all parts of Europe, and I call for a significant part to be allocated to arms production in Ukraine – our industrial capabilities are the fastest and most relevant to the current security threats.""

A rainbow forms over the Port of Tacoma in Tacoma, Washington, US, on Tuesday, March 4.

(CNN) — President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a nearly one-month tariff delay on all products from Mexico that are covered by the USMCA free trade treaty, a significant walkback of the administration’s signature economic plan that has rattled markets, businesses and consumers.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also said Thursday that Trump will likely announce later in the day a one-month delay on all Canadian tariffs. But negotiations were ongoing and it remained unclear whether a deal would ultimately be accomplished, a senior Canadian government source told CNN.

“After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday, after a phone conversation with the Mexican president. He said the tariffs would be delayed until April 2. The USMCA is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, negotiated by Trump during his first term, that makes the three North American countries a free trade zone.

“I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum. Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl,” Trump added. “Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!”

Sheinbaum, in a post on X, thanked US President Donald Trump for a “respectful” discussion about the tariffs he imposed.

In an interview with CNBC earlier Thursday, Lutnick said tariffs on all treaty-compliant products from Canada, most of which were hit with a 25% tariff Tuesday, will probably be paused. Lutnick said they will go into effect on April 2 unless Mexico and Canada show significant progress in fighting what the Trump administration has called an epidemic of fentanyl crossing the border to the United States.

But a senior Canada government source said that although negotiations with the Trump administration are ongoing and they continue to have discussions, “there is no clarity on whether or not the tariffs will be lifted for Canada.”

Trump has frequently praised Sheinbaum, but he has sharply criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom he accused of trying to capitalize politically on the tariff angst Canadians have felt. It remains unclear, however, what – if anything – that could mean for a pause on Canadian tariffs. It was notable that Trump announced a reprieve for Mexico but not Canada.

“Believe it or not, despite the terrible job he’s done for Canada, I think that Justin Trudeau is using the Tariff problem, which he has largely caused, in order to run again for Prime Minister,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. “So much fun to watch!”

Trudeau has been equally and publicly critical of Trump, and he said in a press conference Thursday that he expects Canada and the US to be in a trade war for the foreseeable future.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Thursday that Canada and the United States should renegotiate the USMCA instead of continuing the trade war between the two countries.

“Let’s just drop these tariffs. Let’s renegotiate the USMCA deal that he created,” Ford told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “It hasn’t changed since he was in office, and he said it was the greatest deal ever.”

Stocks fell sharply to start the day Thursday and remained lower after Trump failed – so far – to announce a reprieve for Canada. The Dow was down about 500 points, or 1.1%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was 2.2% lower.

The market is in the red during Trump’s presidency in part because of the uncertainty the administration’s trade policy has caused. The Nasdaq has fallen 6.4% since Trump took office, and the S&P 500 is down more than 3%. Businesses have paused hiring, consumer confidence has plunged and investors have shifted out of stocks and into safe havens like government bonds.

Trump in his joint address to Congress Tuesday night acknowledged that tariffs are unpopular and could cause some pain, particularly by raising prices on an already inflation-weary American public. In one of his more vulnerable moments during the speech, Trump pleaded for patience, asking farmers who could be hurt by retaliatory tariffs to “bear with me” and said “there will be a little disturbance.”

(CNN) — In the Faroe Islands, wild, unpredictable weather — fierce winds and rain, and thick fog that settles like a curtain — can sometimes make travel by car or ferry problematic. No wonder the Faroese love their tunnels.

They’ve built 17 of them on land and four subsea — including the world’s only subsea tunnel with a roundabout that’s underwater.

The network makes for easier navigation of the self-governing island nation within the Kingdom of Denmark.

“Though we are 18 islands, we often joke that (because of the tunnels) we defy the fact that we are islands,” says Súsanna Sørensen, marketing manager of Visit Faroe Islands. Located in the North Atlantic halfway between Iceland and Scotland, the volcanic islands’ unspoiled scenery wows visitors.

The two latest subsea tunnels are statement makers, too.

“These are our Eiffel Tower or Big Ben,” says Teitur Samuelsen, CEO of Eystur-og Sandoyartunlar, the company operating the tunnels, “with people, especially tourists, driving through them just to see the art.”

Art? Yes, indeed. A stunning marriage of art and engineering.

Every day, more than 6,000 vehicles travel through the nearly seven-mile (11-kilometer) subsea tunnel connecting Streymoy, the largest of the Faroe Islands and home to Tórshavn (one of the world’s smallest capitals), with Eysturoy, the archipelago’s next biggest island.

In addition to its stunning natural landscapes, Eysturoy is home to the G! Festival, an outstanding local and international musical event held each July in the waterfront village of Syðrugøta.

Construction of the Eysturoy Tunnel took about four years, opening in December 2020.

These subsea tunnels are created by using the drill and blast method: drilling holes in the basalt — a strong, igneous rock — and then packing the holes with dynamite.

At its lowest point, the tunnel is about 614 feet (187 meters) below sea level. And though having the North Atlantic over your head might provoke anxiety, you can feel confident in its construction, says Samuelsen.

“The tunnels are designed by the world‘s leading engineers and geologists, so safety with regards to the Atlantic above is not an issue,” he says.

Actually, the drive is kind of magical, with the highlight being a sculptural roundabout with shifting colors that is so striking, some compare it to the Aurora borealis or jellyfish glowing in the sunlight.

“The roundabout — nicknamed ‘the jellyfish’ — is certainly a tourist attraction,” says Sørensen. Many take several turns around the roundabout to soak up the mesmerizing scene.

Revered Faroese artist Tróndur Patursson was commissioned to create this vibrant installation. But why spend time and money putting art in subsea tunnels?

“We have a lot of good art in the Faroes, and we’d like to support our artists. In addition, it breaks up the monotony in a long, dark tunnel, so it’s good for driving safety,” says Samuelsen.

When this tunnel was created, a natural central basalt column was left standing for the roundabout where the tunnel branches off toward Strendur and Rókin, located on either side of a fjord on Eysturoy.

The central column, radiating clouds of color, is ringed at its base by a striking steel sculpture. Drivers gaze at a steel ring of silhouettes, life-size people holding hands around the pillar and looking inward at the ever-changing lights.

Patursson has said his intent was to represent how the Faroese, despite living in a rugged environment, are resilient, united in their accomplishments by working together. But for many, the circle of interlinked figures is evocative of the traditional Faroese chain dance that you’ll observe if you visit the Faroes for Ólavsøka, National Day, on July 29.

Beyond the visuals, the tunnel is also saturated with auditory art.

Musician Jens L. Thomsen composed the ethereal soundscape that you can listen to by tuning into FM97 when driving through.

The experience was created by “recording the sounds of the construction as well as the silence in the tunnel,” says Thomsen. Instead of using conventional instruments, “this technique allowed me to find the voice of the tunnel,” adds Thomsen.

The Eysturoy Tunnel isn’t the only dazzling undersea experience.

Since December 2023, Streymoy and the wee island of Sandoy have been connected by the latest subsea tunnel, the Sandoy Tunnel. About 1,000 vehicles a day navigate the approximately six-and-a-half-mile stretch that at its nadir is 508 feet (155 meters) below the North Atlantic.

You’ll find the visual and auditory art enthralling here as well. Along the rough basalt walls, almost a dozen glowing images reference some of the characters in Faroese folklore, such as a bishop wielding a battle ax, an old witch and a seal woman.

This is the creation of Edward Fuglø, a prominent Faroese artist, who put a contemporary take on ancient cave paintings. He also depicts birds as an homage to the self-taught, 19th-century bird painter Díðrikur á Skarvanesi, the first known visual artist in the Faroes.

Sunleif Rasmussen, a renowned Faroese composer, created the acoustic landscape.

“I had a dream of the melody,” says Rasmussen. He relied on some of the sounds of the tunnel, including water dripping during the construction, as well as music by the lead singer of the pop group Snowflakes to produce this inventive electroacoustic work.

This creates a surreal experience for those drivers tuning into FM100 while navigating this tunnel to Sandoy, where white, sandy beaches, tall sand dunes — the only ones in this archipelago — and an expansive lake that’s perfect for kayaking await.

“With all the well-developed tunnel infrastructure, it’s easy for our guests to move around the country,” says Sørensen.

With the roundabout tunnel, the driving time from the capital city Tórshavn to the island of Eysturoy was cut from about 60 minutes to about 15 minutes. It’s also easier to visit other islands.

“You can now drive from Tórshavn to Klaksvik, the second largest city (located on Borðoy), in just 45 minutes versus 75 minutes,” adds Sørensen.

The Sandoy Tunnel has been especially life-changing.

“More and more people are now moving to Sandoy from Tórshavn. In one village where 145 people live, 10 apartments are under construction. This is a lot for us,” says resident Barbara av Skardi, who would never have considered moving to Sandoy if it wasn’t for the tunnel.

“During winter, the ferry sometimes could be canceled for days” because of gusty winds and unpredictable currents, she says.

New businesses are opening, and others are seeing an uptick in visitors.

“Because of the tunnel, my wife, Barbara, and I both moved back to Sandoy and opened Cafe Retro,” says business co-owner Dávur Jacobsen.

And according to Ólavur Jøkladal, director of the Sandur Art Museum, “The number of visitors has more than doubled since the tunnel opened.”

These inventive undersea creations blend art and technology and mark a new era of connectedness for these remote islands.

Valerii Zaluzhnyi says Washington's recent actions in relation to Moscow could lead to the collapse of NATO and that Europe could become Vladimir Putin's next target.

Thursday 6 March 2025 14:47, UK

The United States is ""finally destroying"" the international rules-based order by trying to meet Russia ""halfway"", Ukraine's ambassador to the UK has warned.

Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Washington's recent actions in relation to Moscow could lead to the collapse of NATO - with Europe becoming Russian President Vladimir Putin's next target.

""The failure to qualify actions of Russia as an aggression is a huge challenge for the entire world and Europe, in particular,"" he told a conference at the Chatham House think tank.

""We see that it is not just the axis of evil and Russia trying to revise the world order, but the US is finally destroying this order.""

Mr Zaluzhnyi, who took over as Kyiv's ambassador to London in 2024 following three years as commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, also warned that the White House had ""questioned the unity of the whole Western world"" - suggesting NATO could cease to exist as a result.

It comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy scrambles to repair relations with US President Donald Trump following a dramatic row between the two men in the Oval Office last week.

A trade dispute between Canada and the US has escalated, with several Canadian provinces pulling American-made alcohol from store shelves. The move is a direct response to the Trump administration's imposition of 25% tariffs on Canadian goods. Lawson Whiting, CEO of Brown-Forman, the company behind Jack Daniel's, has denounced the Canadian retaliation, calling it ""worse than tariffs"" and ""disproportionate"" to the US levies.

""I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves,"" Whiting said.

The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), one of the world's largest alcohol buyers, removed US-made drinks from its shelves on Tuesday. Ontario Premier Doug Ford revealed that the LCBO sells nearly $1 billion worth of US alcohol annually, emphasising that all these products are now off the shelves. The LCBO's exclusive wholesaler status in Ontario means that other retailers, bars, and restaurants in the province can no longer restock US products.

Canada has retaliated against the US tariffs with its own 25% levies on American goods, including beer, spirits, and wine. Some provinces, such as Ontario and Nova Scotia, have taken additional measures. The trade tensions have sparked a nationalist sentiment among Canadians, with some opting to buy local products instead of US-made goods.

Whiting, acknowledged that Canada accounts for only 1% of the company's total sales, making the impact of the trade dispute manageable. However, the company is also monitoring developments in Mexico, which accounted for 7% of its sales in 2024 and has also been affected by US tariffs.

The trade dispute has drawn strong reactions from Canadian leaders. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticised the US tariffs, calling them ""a very dumb thing to do."" He also accused President Trump of seeking to undermine the Canadian economy. Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly has expressed concern over Trump's remarks about making Canada the 51st US state, taking them ""very seriously"". ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

An envoy of President Donald Trump said Thursday that Ukraine has itself to blame for the US suspension of war aid and compared the shock move to hitting a stubborn farm animal with a piece of wood.

Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general named by Trump as special envoy on Russia and Ukraine, said President Volodymyr Zelensky had ample opportunity to sign a US mineral rights sharing deal touted as key to a still-vague post-war security plan.

""Very candidly, they brought it on themselves -- the Ukrainians,"" Kellogg said at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Cutting aid -- vital to Ukraine's efforts to defend against the three-year Russian invasion -- was meant to be a short-sharp shock, he said.

""I think the best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,"" he said.

""You got their attention, and it's very significant, obviously, because of the support that we give,"" he said.

Kellogg said that the pause should be temporary until Zelensky signs the deal, although he cautioned that Trump alone would make the decision.

""The protocol is -- you sign a document and once you sign a document that you want to go forward, that you're serious about it, then I think you can move forward"" on aid, he said.

Zelensky flew to Washington last week to sign an agreement demanded by Trump that in part would compensate the United States for billions of dollars in weapons sent since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

The two leaders' meeting dramatically unraveled as Zelensky questioned how to believe any Russian promises. Trump and Vice President JD Vance responded by angrily accusing him of ingratitude.

Kellogg insisted that the Trump administration was also pressuring Russia to make a deal including through enforcement of sanctions on ships selling oil.

""It's not so much more options,"" he said of Trump's approach to pressuring Russia. ""It's the enforcement of the options.""

Over 300 people have been nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, organisers said on Wednesday, with politicians saying they had put US President Donald Trump forward for the award.

In line with Nobel statutes, the identity of the candidates is kept confidential for 50 years.

The 338 overall nominations comprise 244 individuals and 94 organisations, the Norwegian Nobel Institute said.

That was a significant increase from the previous year's 286 nominations but shy of the record 376 nominations registered in 2016.

Although the prize committee is always tight-lipped about the nominees, those eligible to nominate -- including former laureates, lawmakers and cabinet ministers from any country in the world, and some university professors -- are free to reveal the name of the person or organisation they have proposed.

On Monday, US Congressman Darrell Issa declared in a post on X that he too would nominate Trump for the prestigious prize, adding: ""No-one deserves it more.""

Issa's office was later cited by US media as saying that the nomination was motivated by Trump's approach to the Middle East.

Issa's nomination would be submitted after the submission deadline but Ukrainian parliamentarian Oleksandr Merezhko also nominated Trump back in November in a move to grab the then president-elect's attention, according to Ukrainian media.

Trump has been proposed as a candidate in previous years, too but a nomination this year would be particularly eye-catching.

He has sparked controversy by opening talks with Moscow about its war in Ukraine and rattled European allies with changes to US foreign policy.

He has also proposed taking over the Gaza Strip and displacing its 2.4 million Palestinian inhabitants, an idea that has drawn widespread condemnation around the world.

In January, thousands of people signed a UK petition calling for Frenchwoman Gisele Pelicot to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

She won praise for her open, public stance during the trial of her ex-husband, who was convicted of letting strangers rape her while she was drugged.

Last year, the Nobel Peace Prize went to Japan's atomic bomb survivors' group Nihon Hidankyo for its efforts to ban nuclear weapons.

As of March 2023, nearly 1.34 lakh Indian children were expected to age out.

Thousands of Indians in the United States, who migrated as minors under the H-4 visa, now face an uncertain future as they approach the age of 21. Under current immigration laws in the US, they will no longer qualify as dependents of their H1-B visa-holder parents. Until now, they had two years to transition to another visa status after 'ageing out,' but recent shifts in immigration policy have thrown their future into doubt.

Many are now exploring other options, including immigrating to countries like Canada or the UK, which have more flexible policies. The massive backlog in the US employment-based green card system disproportionately affects Indian immigrants. 

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recently announced the registration period for H-1B visas for fiscal year 2026. The process opens on March 7 and runs through March 24. The H-1B visa, a non-immigrant visa, allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialised occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.

The H-1B cap remains 65,000 visas per year, with an additional 20,000 for applicants with US master's degrees. The USCIS has introduced a beneficiary-centric selection process to reduce fraud and ensure fair selection. The new registration fee is $215.

According to a Times of India report, as of March 2023, nearly 1.34 lakh Indian children were expected to age out of dependent visa status before their families secured green cards. The backlog in the US immigration system means many will face long waits for permanent residency, with some applications projected to take anywhere between 12 to 100 years.

A recent ruling from a Texas court blocking work permits for new applicants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has worsened the situation. DACA provides temporary, renewable two-year protection from deportation for undocumented youth, including those who lose dependent status after turning 21. Without this provision, many Indian youth now fear an uncertain future.

US Senator Bernie Sanders, a leading progressive, had criticised the H-1B program earlier this year, arguing that it primarily benefits corporations by bringing in lower-paid foreign workers instead of hiring Americans.

""The main function of the H-1B program is not to hire 'the best and the brightest' but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with hundreds of thousands of lower-paid guest workers from abroad who are often treated as indentured servants,"" Mr Sanders said. 

Mr Sanders has proposed an amendment to the Laken Riley Act, aiming to double H-1B visa fees to generate $370 million annually, funding nearly 20,000 scholarships for American students in STEM fields. He has also proposed to increase wages for H-1B workers to at least the median local wage, preventing companies from undercutting American salaries.

Mr Sanders also took aim at billionaires like Tesla owner Elon Musk and Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for their support of the H-1B program.

""Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, and other multi-billionaires claim the H-1B program is vital due to a shortage of highly skilled workers. In my view, they are dead wrong,"" he said. 

Citing Economic Policy Institute data, he said that between 2022 and 2023, the top 30 H-1B employers laid off 85,000 American workers while hiring over 34,000 guest workers.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Columbia University has launched a crackdown on students critical of Israel, with its newly formed Office of Institutional Equity initiating disciplinary action against several students. 

Among them is senior Maryam Alwan, who was accused of harassment after writing an op-ed in the student newspaper calling for divestment from Israel.

The disciplinary office has issued notices to dozens of students in recent weeks for activities such as sharing social media posts supporting Palestinians and participating in unauthorised protests.

Some students are under investigation for actions outside campus, including posting stickers criticising university trustees and co-hosting an art exhibition on a past campus occupation.

Alwan was informed that her article, which called for severing academic ties with Israel, could be considered “unwelcome conduct” based on religion, national origin, or military service. 

She described the situation as “dystopian” and said it made her hesitant to speak on the issue again. The university warned that possible penalties range from a warning to expulsion.

The new disciplinary committee has drawn criticism from students, faculty, and free speech advocates, who argue that Columbia is yielding to external pressure, including threats from former US President Donald Trump to cut funding to universities and deport student protesters.

On Monday, federal agencies announced they were considering cutting $51 million in contracts to Columbia and reviewing billions in additional grants due to alleged “inaction” against antisemitic harassment. 

However, Columbia responded by saying that it does not tolerate calls for violence or terror on campus. Meanwhile, House Republicans have launched their own review of the university’s disciplinary process, demanding records related to nearly a dozen incidents.

The committee operates in secrecy, requiring students to sign non-disclosure agreements before accessing case details. Some students have reported being falsely accused of attending protests or posting social media content they had no involvement with. Others say they were pressured to disclose the names of students involved in pro-Palestinian activism.

Jewish students have also received disciplinary notices for participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, while others have accused the administration of allowing an antisemitic atmosphere on campus.

The disciplinary measures have sparked renewed protests. Students have occupied buildings at Barnard College, Columbia’s affiliate, following the expulsion of two students accused of disrupting an Israeli history class. 

Several protesters were arrested after an hours-long standoff with police on Wednesday night.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday showed no signs of backing down from his tough stance against the tariff war initiated by US President Donald Trump, as he said Canada will continue its trade onslaught against the country for the ""foreseeable future"".

A day after what he described as a colorful call with Trump, Justin Trudeau said his country will not back down from the trade war started by the United States.

He, however, said Canada would continue to engage with senior Trump administration officials about tariffs Washington says it will impose on Canadian imports.

""I can confirm that we will continue to be in a trade war that was launched by the United States for the foreseeable future,"" he told reporters in Ottawa.

""We will not be backing down from our response tariffs until such a time as the unjustified American tariffs on Canadian goods are lifted,"" he added.

Trudeau and Trump held a 50-minute call on Wednesday.

""It was a colorful call. It was also a very substantive call,"" said Trudeau, adding that the two sides were in talks but had nothing to announce yet.

""We are ... trying to make sure that these tariffs don't overly harm, certainly in the short term, certain sectors.""

Earlier this month, the Trump administration placed tariffs on Canada. The Canadian government retaliated, imposing 25 percent of tax on C$30 billion worth of US imports.

Canada has threatened that it would impose tariffs on C$125 billion of U.S. imports.

Trump will exempt automakers from tariffs on Canada and Mexico for one month as long as they comply with existing free trade rules, the White House said on Wednesday.

""Any carve outs that support any workers in Canada, even if it's just one industry or another, are going to be a good thing,"" said Trudeau.

Ever since Donald Trump became the President of the United States for the second time, his administration has been working on implementing reciprocal tariffs on several countries.

Mexico, China and Canada have already levied retaliatory tariffs on the United States, sparking fears of a global trade war, which have upended stock markets across the world, including India.

 LONDON, - Dutch wholesale gas prices rose on Thursday morning amid a colder weather forecast and a chance for a rebound following two sessions of declines. 

 The benchmark front-month contract at the Dutch TTF hub was up 0.28 at 41.28 euros per megawatt hour , or $13.07/mmBtu, by 0855 GMT, according to LSEG data. 

 The British day ahead contract rose by 1.51 pence to 101 pence/therm. 

 Latest weather forecast predicts colder temperatures next week below normal, with demand for heating during the working days next week expected to rise by 178 gigawatt hour per day to 3590 GHW/d, data compiled by LSEG showed. 

 ""With the latest temperature forecasts for the weeks ahead also looking below seasonal normal, this may also push gas storage levels lower before the end of the heating season and the restart of this year's refilling,"" consultancy Auxilione said in a morning note. 

 EU gas storage sites have depleted faster this winter because of colder and less windy weather and are now about 37.32% full, data from Gas Infrastructure Europe showed. 

 ""A -4.5% drop on Tuesday and -5% decline yesterday suggest a potential upward correction today,"" LSEG analyst Oleh Skrynyk said. 

 The European Commission proposed on Wednesday to retain the EU's gas storage requirements and targets for two more years but it said the targets in earlier months are ""indicative"" - which, in EU legislation, typically means not binding. 

 The requirement to meet interim filling targets has stoked prices over the past few months. 

 The narrowing spread between European gas prices at the Dutch TTF hub and the Asian benchmark Japan Korea Market is helping with the price rise this morning, Energy Scan analysts said in a morning note. 

 ""Given the low level of gas stocks, Europe cannot afford to let LNG cargoes leave for Asia,"" LSEG analysts added. 

 In the European carbon market, the benchmark contract inched down 0.22 euro to 68.58 euros per metric ton.

The man now all but certain to become Germany’s next chancellor may not be anybody’s first choice to share a krug of Oktoberfest lager with. Forget the back-slapping pol ready to banter about the Bundesliga; Friedrich Merz is a former corporate lawyer who wrote a book urging voters to “Dare for More Capitalism”—in 2008. German voters hardly flocked to the beanpole-shaped fellow, who first chased the leadership of the centre-right two decades ago, only to deliver for it the second-worst result in its history last month. But do not tell Europeans this. From Paris to Warsaw, Brussels and beyond, the impending arrival of a new man at the top of German politics is being met with giddy excitement. A continent in crisis on just about every front is in dire need of a reboot—and wants to believe a new Merz-mentum will bring it about. Can the new-chancellor-on-the-block live up to the hype?

The early signs are unexpectedly promising. The first step towards Mr Merz being effective on the European stage is for him to forge a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats at home, a task expected to take several more weeks. But the agreement announced on March 4th was startling in its ambition. In a stunning reversal of fiscal austerity long espoused by the right—not least by Mr Merz himself—the putative coalition agreed to spend several hundreds of billions of euros on both defence and infrastructure. Once a conservative article of faith, the “debt brake” that has acted as a straitjacket on German fiscal policy by limiting deficits is in effect to be binned when it comes to defence. The long-overdue splurge to come should help shake off an enduring recession. It also marks an end to the penny-pinching that left Germany unable to durably boost defence spending to levels needed to fend off a revanchist Russia unopposed by Donald Trump’s America.

In part thanks to that agreement, Mr Merz will be the star-in-absentia of an emergency European Union summit in Brussels on March 6th, called to discuss the situation in Ukraine. (Olaf Scholz, the outgoing chancellor, will represent Germany, while Mr Merz is to attend a sidelines confab of his centre-right political family ahead of the actual summit.) The hopeful prediction is that Mr Merz will help improve the parlous state of the Franco-German relationship at the heart of the EU. For years the bloc’s two biggest countries have been at odds, due largely to a frosty rapport between their respective leaders. Mr Scholz, and to some extent Angela Merkel before him, all but refused to engage with Emmanuel Macron, the French president who endlessly fizzes with ideas of how the continent can be built into a Europe-puissance, generally at Germany’s expense. Mr Merz, an Atlanticist visibly shocked by America’s shabby treatment of Europe, looks readier to collaborate with his French counterpart.

The two men make an odd couple, separated by 22 years in age and more than that many centimetres in height. Yet they have much in common. Both like to hint at vast intellectual hinterlands with public displays of admiration for impenetrable philosophers. Both worked in high finance before landing top political jobs. Both rightly worry that, should they mess up, hard-right populists may succeed them in office. Both think of politics in national and European terms. Mr Macron stands just as proudly for the EU’s anthem as he does for La Marseillaise; Mr Merz started his career as a member of the European Parliament in the age of Jacques Delors (Mr Scholz, in contrast, seemed to think of the EU as little more than a trading club). Both seem keen to include Poland as a necessary third partner in the Franco-German alliance, and both think Europe is over-regulated. They share a sense of gloom about the state of their home continent: Mr Macron warned last year that “Europe might die”; Mr Merz fretted on election night that it was “five minutes to midnight”.

What might this mean for Europe? Those who expect a burst of Euro-federalism are likely to be disappointed. If anything, Mr Merz’s arrival will mark the end of the vacuum that gave the EU’s central institutions, notably the European Commission, an unusual amount of influence. The incoming chancellor’s vision of Europe is one where national leaders come together to make decisions, not outsource them to Brussels. A re-think of how the EU works may follow. Mr Merz was a protégé of Wolfgang Schäuble, a flinty finance minister who argued that Germany and France should forge ahead when others in Europe lacked the willingness to do so, resulting in “concentric circles” of EU integration. Expect more “coalitions of the willing” spearheaded by France and Germany—perhaps including Britain, too, on defence matters.

Merz-i beaucoup!

The improved vibes may, of course, dissipate after a brief honeymoon. Europe will still have to contend with German coalition politics, which have muddied its influence in Brussels. Mr Merz has never held executive office before; Mr Macron will be gone by 2027, and no longer fully controls the government. And for all the ideological alignment on Europe’s place in the world, some fundamental disagreements remain. Germany is committed to free trade, which France merely tolerates. France would like some of Europe’s defence needs to be paid for by an EU fund jointly borrowed by its 27 countries, a model used for the first (and only) time to fund the economic stimulus enacted in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. That remains verboten in Germany.

Nevertheless the mood in EU circles is cheerier than the challenges posed by American abandonment might suggest. Future Franco-German spats are inevitable. They might even help. When Mr Merz’s vision does not align with Mr Macron’s, as will undoubtedly happen, the two will clash. It is out of the sparks that compromises will be forged, and progress achieved. And that is exactly what Europe needs.

 By Emma Farge 

 GENEVA -Switzerland has cancelled a conference on the application of the Geneva Conventions to the occupied Palestinian territories for want of participants, its Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed on Thursday, after some countries expressed dissatisfaction. 

 The country had invited 196 parties to the conventions to participate in the March 7 conference in Geneva on the situation of civilians living in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, but then told them the gathering had been cancelled, four diplomatic sources told Reuters earlier. 

 ""In the absence of a consensus between the High Contracting Parties, , as depositary State, decided not to convene the meeting,"" Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Nicolas Bideau said on X. 

 The conference was set to address the Fourth Geneva Convention, part of a series of international treaties agreed in 1949 after World War Two, which defines humanitarian protections for civilians living in areas of armed conflict or occupation. 

 The cancellation amounted to a diplomatic blow for neutral Switzerland, which prides itself on conflict mediation and frequently hosts summits and peace talks. 

 The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Ibrahim Khraishi, told Reuters earlier that his delegation did not plan to attend the event, criticising a draft declaration circulated among participants. 

 ""We want the international community to take concrete measures and this fell short of expectations,"" he told Reuters, saying such measures could include economic or diplomatic steps against Israel. ""What we want is for the Geneva Conventions to be implemented."" 

 A member of The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation said that the group had also planned to miss the event, saying the document ""did not reflect the gravity of the situation"". 

 Israel, whose war with Palestinian militant group Hamas has devastated Gaza, and which has been expanding settlements in the West Bank, stirring fears of annexation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

 It also criticised the Swiss conference, calling it ""part of the legal warfare against Israel"". 

 Britain felt that, along with many other states, it could not fully support a proposed declaration as a precondition for attending the conference, according to a statement from its diplomatic mission. 

 Diplomats from other Western states that back Israel also privately expressed concerns about the meeting, although at least some European countries were planning to attend.

Intuitive Machines, a private firm from the United States, said on Thursday that its robotic Athena lander landed on the moon's surface, but its status and health remained unclear.

This is the company's second attempt to land a spacecraft on the moon's surface. The company's first attempt was unsuccessful, as the instrument landed sideways.

The six-legged lander descended over a flat-topped mountain named Mons Mouton, about 160 km from the moon's south pole. It carries 11 payloads and scientific instruments.

The Athena lander took nearly an hour to descend on the moon's surface. It dropped out of the lunar orbit as planned, with an ice drill, a drone and two rovers.

“It looks like we’re down. We are working to evaluate exactly what our orientation is on the surface,” said mission director and co-founder Tim Crain.

The mission control crew said the lander was powered on after landing, but its engines were shut down. It remains unclear whether the mission managed to land the instrument upright or on its side like the last attempt.

NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program aims to nurture the development of low-budget private spacecraft that can land on the lunar surface before the US sends astronauts around 2027. Intuitive Machines' latest mission is part of this program. Firefly, Astrobotic Technology and a handful of other companies are also part of this mission.

Five countries—the then Soviet Union, the US, China, India, and Japan—have successfully demonstrated soft landings on the moon's surface so far. India's Chandraayan-3 landed near the moon's south pole in 2023.

A cargo truck near the port in Ensenada, Mexico. Mexican officials say that U.S. trade negotiators sometimes don’t seem to know what President Trump wants. With only hours to go until President Trump’s pledged tariffs were set to hit America’s neighbors, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tried Monday to arrange a call with his U.S. counterpart to negotiate. Trump didn’t take the call, a Canadian government official said.

 It wasn’t the first time Trump had diplomatically ghosted the leaders of Canada or Mexico during weeks of talks to avert a North American trade war. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that she also requested a call with Trump, but didn’t get one.  Officials from both countries were shuttling to Washington to plead their case, looking to thwart Trump’s threatened 25% tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico, which he said hadn’t done enough to curb fentanyl trafficking. Mexican and Canadian emissaries said they sometimes had hopes the talks were making progress and that Trump’s aides would be able to present him with enough commitments to grant reprieves to two of the largest U.S. trading partners. But first thing Tuesday, Trump forged ahead, placing 25% tariffs on most goods from Mexico and Canada and making clear the fatal flaw in the negotiating process: Only Trump speaks for Trump, and the president wanted to move forward. The dynamic has frustrated negotiators, who are struggling to make their case to a mercurial president through a phalanx of intermediaries who at times seem to their counterparts as unsure what Trump wants. The challenge now for Canada and Mexico is how to engage Trump more directly to help dig the continent out of a trade fight that poses risks for all three economies. Trudeau responded Tuesday by placing tariffs on the U.S., and he questioned whether further negotiations would make any difference, accusing Trump of acting in “bad faith.” The two leaders eventually spoke Wednesday morning, an exchange Trump said ended in a “somewhat” friendly manner. A person familiar with the matter said the call grew heated and included profanity. Sheinbaum, who hadn’t spoken to Trump as of Wednesday morning, plans to announce retaliatory measures against the U.S. on Sunday at the large Zocalo square in front of the ornate National Palace in Mexico City. There were two overriding motivations inside the Trump administration to push ahead with the tariffs, instead of delaying them again. While Trump continues to be legitimately concerned about fentanyl deaths, said people with knowledge of the discussions, his team also felt they needed to impose the duties to hammer home to trading partners that he is serious about his tariff threats. Some administration officials also see the duties as a way to reset the trading relationship with the continental neighbors before renegotiating the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the people added. A White House spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Cabinet ministers, senior government officials and leaders of Canada’s provinces have met with Trump officials such as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, national security adviser Michael Waltz and border czar Tom Homan. They sought to highlight new measures Canada had taken to boost border security and to share U.S. statistics showing that less than 1% of the fentanyl seized by U.S. border agents came from Canada. Near the end of January, Canadian officials met several times with Homan and touted a new, $1 billion initiative to strengthen border security. The Canadians shared videos of new helicopters and drones Canada had bought to monitor the border. Then Homan went on TV days later and said he hadn’t yet brought the information to Trump, irking the Canadians. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been in the middle of tariff discussions with Mexico, Canada and affected industries. Doug Ford, the leader of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province and home to its auto sector, traveled to Washington several times, most recently in February as part of a contingent of provincial leaders who met top Trump aides including James Blair, a deputy chief of staff. Everyone he met seemed in the dark about Trump’s plans, Ford said. “He wakes up and the goal posts change,” Ford said of Trump. The confusion on how to avoid tariffs has extended to major North American industries in recent days. On a call with U.S. automakers last week, Lutnick floated the idea of the companies moving plants in Canada and Mexico back to the U.S., say people with knowledge of the conversation. The comment was made, however, without an indication that any commitments to American manufacturing would win a reprieve from tariffs—either the ones imposed Tuesday or additional 25% auto tariffs scheduled for April 2. The automakers left confused about the ultimate goal of the tariffs or negotiating targets to avoid them, some of the people said. On Wednesday, the White House announced that cars that were compliant with he U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement would be given a 30-day reprieve from tariffs.

The Mexican leader alternated between an interpreter and speaking English to make an emphatic point on trade, drugs and migration in ways that caught Trump’s attention without escalating into a disagreement, according to people familiar with the conversation. Sheinbaum was jubilant that morning after the call. Later that day, Trump said he had a great talk with Mexico. “President Sheinbaum is a woman I like very much,” he told reporters. On Friday, before Trump’s tariffs went into effect, Sheinbaum said she hoped to have another telephone call with Trump over the weekend. It didn’t happen. Senior Mexican officials nevertheless thought they could make a deal with Trump on trade and migration because of Mexico’s extensive experience on both. Mexico has free trade deals with more than 50 countries, and the government’s efforts resulted in a sharp drop in illegal migrant crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexico worked to show that it was taking Trump’s threats seriously. Sheinbaum’s government stepped up enforcement efforts, detaining hundreds of people suspected of having ties with organized crime and seizing large quantities of illegal narcotics, including fentanyl. On Thursday, Mexico transferred 29 imprisoned drug gang bosses to the U.S. After Trump’s tariffs went into effect, Sheinbaum criticized Trump, calling his justification for duties on Mexican goods “offensive, defamatory and groundless.” But her move not to announce retaliatory measures reflects her playbook to avoid escalation and to offer Trump a potential off ramp. Mexico’s Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard and Lutnick met last week, talks Mexican officials deemed as fruitless because the U.S. didn’t appear to know what it wanted, said one person close to the discussions. One concession floated by Mexican officials involved China, a common trade rival. Mexico offered to match the U.S. on China tariffs, but the proposal was dismissed by Trump administration officials, said another person familiar with the discussions. Canadian officials have complained that the fentanyl issue is a red herring that the U.S. is using to extract concessions. Sen. Bill Hagerty (R., Tenn.), Trump’s first-term ambassador to Japan and trade confidant, said he had spoken to Trump about the fentanyl problem for years, including recently.

President Donald Trump reached an estimated 36.6 million television viewers for his address to Congress on Tuesday night, the Nielsen company said.

That beat the 32.2 million people who watched former President Joe Biden's final State of the Union address last year, but was smaller than any of Trump's audiences for the annual address during his first term, Nielsen said.

Trump's first speech to Congress as president, in 2017, was seen by 47.7 million people. Television viewing in general has decreased since then. Nielsen measured viewing on 15 different television networks, including those whose feed was carried on streaming services.

Fox News Channel, the most popular network for Trump fans, dominated viewing, reaching 10.7 million people. ABC had 6.3 million, CBS had 4 million, NBC had 3.9 million, Fox broadcast had 2.7 million and both CNN and MSNBC had 1.9 million, Nielsen said.

Nielsen said 71% of Trump's television viewers were 55 and older.

Ukraine said on Wednesday it planned to hold new talks with the United States after Washington suspended its intelligence sharing, delivering a fresh blow to Kyiv as it battles Russia's invasion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been scrambling to contain the fallout from his explosive meeting with Donald Trump last week, in which the US leader berated him in front of international media and kicked him out of the White House.

""Today, Ukrainian and American teams began working on an upcoming meeting. We're seeing forward momentum,"" Zelensky said in a late-Wednesday address, without saying when or where new talks would take place.

Zelensky also said he would join EU leaders for a Brussels summit on Thursday.

Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron said European military forces could be sent to Ukraine if a peace deal is signed to ensure that Russia does not invade its neighbour again.

The United States said earlier on Wednesday it had ""paused"" intelligence sharing with Ukraine, two days after announcing it was also suspending military aid.



The moves have cemented fears in Kyiv and Europe that Ukraine could be forced to accept a peace settlement on terms favourable to Moscow or risk losing US support entirely.

""We all want a safe future for our people. Not a temporary ceasefire, but an end to the war once and for all. With our coordinated efforts and US leadership, this is entirely achievable,"" Zelensky wrote Wednesday on social media following a call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

A day earlier, he said he was ""ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer"", and that he wanted to ""make things right"" with Trump.

'Generally positive'

In an address to US Congress on Tuesday, Trump read aloud from a letter he said he had received from Zelensky in which the Ukrainian leader said he was ready for peace talks.

Trump has made ending the war one of his top foreign policy priorities, though has yet to outline his plan for a deal both sides could endorse.

Zelensky wants security guarantees from the United States to deter Russia from invading again in the future.

Moscow, meanwhile, has refused to rule out giving up any of the land it has captured in its three-year military campaign, and has been buoyed by the suspension of US military aid.

The Kremlin welcomed news of the Ukrainian leader's letter to Trump.

""This approach is generally positive,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in answer to a question from AFP.

However, the Kremlin has repeatedly thrown doubt on whether it would hold talks with Zelensky.

On Wednesday, Peskov cited a decree passed by Zelensky that rules out direct negotiations with Putin.

The Ukrainian president has since said on multiple occasions he would be willing to meet Putin -- but only after Kyiv and its Western allies agree on a common negotiating position.

Moscow has also accused Zelensky of not being a legitimate leader, citing the expiration of his five-year mandate following his 2019 election as president.

Under Ukrainian martial law, elections are banned during wartime. Zelensky's key European backers have supported the suspension of any vote amid Russia's full-scale offensive.

Trump has falsely claimed the Ukrainian leader is widely unpopular at home and called on him to hold elections.

Intelligence pause

Outgoing German Chancellor Scholz on Wednesday gave his backing to Zelensky's calls for a truce in the sky and at sea as a first step towards ending the fighting.

""The Chancellor welcomed the Ukrainian president's willingness to start negotiations as soon as possible. Both agreed on the importance of the American president's leadership,"" Scholz's office said in a statement.

Macron is mulling a joint visit to Washington alongside Zelensky and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to present a united European front to Trump, the French government said Wednesday.

Macron, in a televised address, said European troops could be deployed to Ukraine once a peace treaty is signed.

""They won't go to fight today, they won't go to fight on the front line, but they would be there once a peace deal is signed, to guarantee it is fully respected,"" he said.

Macron added that chiefs of staff of European militaries would meet in Paris next week to discuss how to support Ukraine after a peace deal.

Trump is pushing for Europe to do more for Ukraine's defence.

CIA director John Ratcliffe said on Wednesday the United States had ""paused"" intelligence sharing with Ukraine after the dramatic breakdown in relations between Kyiv and the White House.

The Ukrainian presidency declined to comment.

On the battlefield, Russia's forces said they had captured another small village in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region.

The gains come as AFP analysis of US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) data showed Moscow's advance had slowed in February after a series of accelerating territorial gains throughout the winter.

 In a barren, yellow-and-grey moonscape, heavy machinery grinds away at a titanium mine in the heart of Ukraine. 

 Despite tensions between Ukraine and the United States, hopes are high that the two countries can strike a minerals deal that would bring much-needed investment. 

 ""Ukraine is very rich in mineral resources and if we do not extract them, Ukraine will simply lose out on revenues that it could have obtained,"" said Dmytro Golik, head of the mine operator. 

 Located in the Zhytomyr region in the western part of central Ukraine, the mine contains ilmenite, a titanium-iron oxide mineral which is widely used for pigments. 

 US President Donald Trump wants a share in revenues from Ukraine's mineral wealth as compensation for the military and financial aid Washington has poured into Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion more than three years ago. 

 Ukraine, which has around five percent of global mineral resources, is the 11th biggest titanium producer in the world, according to World Mining Data. 

 Its mineral reserves could contain around 185 million tonnes of titanium, including as much as 65 million tonnes in the Zhytomyr region alone, Golik said.

 A Ukraine-US deal on minerals was due to have been signed at the White House last week, but the event was called off after a spectacular televised clash between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 

 Even before the meltdown in Washington, negotiations on the document were fraught. 

 Zelensky rejected several versions, pointing to the risk of plunging ""10 generations of Ukrainians"" into debt. 

 Kyiv and Washington finally agreed on a framework agreement for the creation of a joint fund that would handle part of the revenues from Ukrainian mineral extraction. 

 In the last few days, Ukrainian and US officials have signalled a readiness to sign the agreement soon, but no date has been fixed and terms could change again. 

 Golik declined to speculate on what the deal could contain and does not know if his mine, which covers 400 hectares and employs 350 people, would be part of it. 

 But he is adamant that the sector ""really needs investment"" since Ukrainian companies are not putting money into it. 

 ""Who would these investors be? I think our employees, our people, are less interested in that than in having stable jobs.""

 Golik said a ""strong foreign investor"" would be ""a kind of additional protection for the country"" and additional tax revenues would boost the army. 

 ""It would not be just Ukraine's responsibility, it would become the responsibility of Europe or the whole world,"" he said. 

 While his mine is not directly affected by Russian strikes, its functioning has been hit by regular power cuts following Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy sector. 

 He said he hopes investors could be interested not only in exporting ilmenite but in producing the pigments inside Ukraine. 

 These could then be ""easily sold in Europe and elsewhere in the world,"" Golik said. 

 Not everyone views Washington favourable given the current political context. 

 Trump has engineered a stunning rapprochement with Russian President Vladimir Putin and this week suspended all military assistance to Ukraine. 

 US financial demands have also been seen as predatory by some commentators in Ukraine a country ravaged by war. 

 Sergii, the operator of one of the huge excavators at the mine, said he was following the news with ""concern"". 

 ""Natural resources are the property of the people,"" said Sergii, who has worked at the mine for 35 years. 

 They ""must belong to Ukraine,"" he said.

 Japan's top court said Thursday it had finalised the acquittal of two former executives from the operator of the Fukushima nuclear plant charged with professional negligence over the 2011 meltdown. 

 The decision concludes the only criminal trial to arise from the plant's 2011 tsunami-triggered accident, the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. 

 Ichiro Takekuro and Sakae Muto, formerly vice presidents of Tokyo Electric Power Company , had been accused of liability for the deaths of more than 40 hospitalised patients, who had to be evacuated following the nuclear disaster. 

 Former chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata, who died last year, had also faced the same charges. 

 The men had faced up to five years in prison if convicted. 

 But the Tokyo District Court ruled in 2019 that the men could not have predicted the scale of the tsunami that hit the plant. 

 That verdict was upheld by the Tokyo High Court in 2023, but an appeal was then filed. 

 The Supreme Court on Wednesday ""dismissed the prosecutors' appeals regarding Takekuro and Muto"", a top court spokesman told AFP. 

 ""Katsumata's public prosecution was dismissed in November"" after his death, he added. 

 In March 2011, a massive tsunami swamped the Fukushima Daiichi plant on Japan's northeastern coast after an undersea 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the country's strongest in recorded history. 

 The tsunami left 18,500 people dead or missing. 

 But no one was recorded as having been directly killed by the nuclear accident, which forced evacuations and left parts of the surrounding area uninhabitable. 

 Despite the non-guilty criminal court verdict, in a July 2022 verdict in a separate civil case, the same three men and another were ordered to pay a whopping 13.3 trillion yen for failing to prevent the disaster. 

 Lawyers have said the enormous compensation sum was believed to be the largest amount ever awarded in a civil lawsuit in Japan although they admit that is symbolic, as it is well beyond the defendants' capacity to pay.

 European Union leaders are holding emergency talks on Thursday on ways to quickly increase their military budgets after the Trump administration signaled that Europe must take care of its own security and also suspended assistance to Ukraine. 

 In just over a month, President Donald Trump has overturned old certainties about U.S. reliability as a security partner, as he embraces Russia and withdraws American support for Ukraine. 

 On Monday, Trump ordered a pause to U.S. military supplies to Ukraine as he sought to press President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia, bringing fresh urgency to the EU summit in Brussels. 

 Here's the latest:  Limited room to increase spending  

 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a plan to loosen budget rules so countries that are willing can spend much more on defense. Her proposal is underpinned by 150 billion euros worth of loans to buy priority military equipment. 

 Most of the increased defense spending would have to come from national budgets at a time when many countries are already overburdened with debt. 

 France is struggling to reduce an excessive annual budget deficit of 5% of GDP. Five other countries using the euro currency have debt levels over 100% of GDP: Belgium, Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. Europe’s largest economy, Germany, has more room to borrow, with a debt level of 62% of GDP.  France steps in to provide military intelligence to Ukraine  

 France is providing military intelligence to Ukraine after Washington announced it was freezing the sharing of information with Kyiv. 

 French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said, “Our intelligence is sovereign. We have intelligence that we allow Ukraine to benefit from.” 

 He added that following the U.S. decision to suspend all military aid to Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron asked him to “accelerate the various French aid packages” to make up for the lack of American assistance.  Russian ballistic missile kills 4 in Zelenskyy's hometown  

 In Ukraine, a Russian ballistic missile killed four people staying at a hotel in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown during the night. 

 Zelenskyy said a humanitarian organization’s volunteers had moved into the hotel in Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine, just before the strike, including Ukrainian, American and British nationals. He didn’t say whether those people were among the 31 injured. 

 Russia fired 112 Shahed and decoy drones, as well as two ballistic Iskander missiles, at Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian air force said.  Flurry of early morning meetings in Brussels  

 Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor of Germany, conferred in Brussels with summit chairman Antonio Costa over breakfast on how to fortify Europe’s defenses on a short deadline. Merz only days ago pushed plans to loosen the nation’s rules on running up debt to allow for higher defense spending. 

 At the same time, the 27-nation bloc was waking up to the news that French President Emmanuel Macron would confer with EU leaders about the possibility of using France’s nuclear deterrent to protect the continent from Russian threats. 

 The bloc will “take decisive steps forward,” Macron told the French nation Wednesday evening. “Member states will be able to increase their military spending” and “massive joint funding will be provided to buy and produce some of the most innovative munitions, tanks, weapons and equipment in Europe,” he said.

 Hundreds of Chinese nationals freed from Myanmar online scam centres flew home through Thailand on Thursday, as the kingdom said it aimed to repatriate 1,500 such workers a week. 

 Thailand, Myanmar and China have been making efforts in recent weeks to clear out illegal cyberscam compounds on the Thai-Myanmar border where thousands of foreigners mostly Chinese nationals have been working. 

 Under pressure from key ally Beijing, Myanmar has cracked down on some of the compounds, freeing around 7,000 workers from more than two dozen countries. 

 Around 600 Chinese nationals were returned from Myanmar through Thailand two weeks ago, and last week the three countries held talks in Bangkok to arrange further transferrals. 

 Thai media broadcast footage on Thursday of coaches bringing hundreds of Chinese workers from Myanmar and offloading them on to planes destined for China at Mae Sot airport. 

 Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura told reporters that ""another group of Chinese nationals"" were repatriated on Thursday, without saying how many. 

 He added that Thailand plans to repatriate 1,500 people per week, or 300 each weekday, with ""regular repatriations of Chinese nationals every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday."" 

 Mondays and Tuesdays would see other foreign nationals including Africans repatriated, he said, with the ministry coordinating with foreign embassies to help with ""immediate"" repatriations. 

 The remaining freed workers have been languishing for weeks in sometimes squalid conditions in holding camps near the Thai border while officials organise their repatriation. 

 Many workers say they were lured or tricked into taking the work defrauding strangers online with investment, romance and gambling scams and suffered beatings and abuse. 

 A Rwandan scam centre worker who asked to remain anonymous told AFP on Wednesday that he had been trafficked into one of the compounds where he was tortured and had his money taken from him. 

 ""It's a big challenge. If I get home I will have a big challenge also,"" he said. 

 Unsanitary conditions at the overcrowded makeshift encampments have raised concerns about possible disease outbreaks. 

 ""There are sick people... they need be repatriated onto the Thai side as early as possible,"" Nikorndej said.

 Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC's plan to invest $100 billion in the United States was a ""historic moment"" for Taiwan-US ties, the island's President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday. 

 TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker, announced the plan this week after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on overseas-made chips. 

 It will take the total amount TSMC has pledged to invest in the United States to $165 billion, which the company said was the ""largest single foreign direct investment in US history"". 

 This was a ""historic moment for Taiwan-US relations"", Lai said in a joint news conference with TSMC chairman and chief executive C.C. Wei at the Presidential Office. 

 It comes after Trump's accusations that Taiwan stole the US chip industry and his threats to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent, as well as Taipei's promises to invest more in the United States. 

 TSMC has long faced demands to move more of its production away from Taiwan, with fears that supplies of the critical technology could be disrupted in any conflict with Beijing. 

 Trump recently ratcheted up the pressure on TSMC and other chip manufacturers by publicly mulling the introduction of 25 percent, or higher, tariffs on all chips made outside the United States. 

 Speaking Thursday, Lai said the government was not pressured by Washington ""during TSMC's US investment process"". 

 Wei said TSMC's expansion was driven by growing demand from US clients and it would not affect the company's investments in Taiwan. 

 TSMC planned to build 11 new production lines in Taiwan this year to meet demand, Wei said, adding ""our production capacity is not enough"". 

 ""Each time TSMC makes a strategic move, TSMC becomes stronger and more competitive"", Lai said. 

 ""At the same time, it also provides Taiwanese enterprises with opportunities for international cooperation and contributes to Taiwan's greater strength."" 

 Taiwan is a global powerhouse in semiconductor manufacturing, with more than half of the world's chips and nearly all of the high-end ones made there. 

 The concentration of chip manufacturing in Taiwan has long been seen as a ""silicon shield"" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China and an incentive for the United States to defend it. 

 China has upped military pressure on Taiwan in recent years to press its claim of sovereignty over the self-ruled island, where TSMC has its headquarters and the bulk of its fabrication plants.

 New Delhi, Ongoing geopolitical challenges like wars, trade disputes and technology conflicts are weakening the trust among countries and making climate action more difficult, Brazil's Environment and Climate Minister Marina Silva said on Thursday. 

 Silva, who was in India to attend TERI's World Sustainable Development Summit, told journalists that while multilateralism is struggling to fully address global challenges, it remains the only viable path forward. 

 She also acknowledged that the US decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement ""does influence to a certain extent"" the goals Brazil has set for this year's UN climate conference in Belem. 

 ""We do have a very challenging confluence of multiple factors that are worrisome for climate action in general. This increasingly-complex geopolitical context wars in different regions or countries, trade disputes, tariffs and technology disputes may all impact climate progress. They may drain resources and also hamper confidence and trust among parties. So we have a triple negative effect,"" she said. 

 The minister warned that short-term trade protectionism may bring temporary gains but, in the long run, leads to inflation, economic instability and food insecurity. 

 She stressed that two major global challenges health and climate change cannot be solved without international cooperation. 

 There is growing scepticism about multilateral efforts, particularly in climate negotiations, following the disappointing outcome at COP29 in Baku, the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and Argentina signalling its intention to do the same. 

 ""Baku represented a disappointment.... This climate of disappointment after the COP was due to developed countries not fulfilling their commitments, which leads, on one hand, to a loss of credibility and a deficit of implementation. This is now even more difficult to handle because it also results in a deficit of confidence,"" Silva said in response to a question from PTI. 

 Developed countries, historically responsible for most of the greenhouse-gas emissions driving climate change, were required to deliver a new and ambitious financial package to support climate action in the developing world at the UN climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan last year. 

 However, they offered a paltry USD 300 billion by 2035, a mere fraction of the at least USD 1.3 trillion needed annually from 2025, leaving many developing countries deeply disappointed. 

 Silva said multilateralism is not being able to ""fully handle"" global challenges. However, ""there is no effective solution outside multilateralism . Multilateralism is the only way forward,"" she said, stressing that Brazil remains committed to strengthening it. 

 Calling for reforms in the UN system for global governance, Silva said changes are needed to make it more effective and adaptable. ""Our reality is not static. We need swifter processes and swifter structures to deal with climate change."" 

 Asked whether the US decision to leave the Paris Agreement would affect COP30, Silva said, ""We cannot be denialists to not acknowledge that."" 

 She said the United States, being the world's second-largest GHG emitter and a major economic and technological power, ""does influence"" Brazil's COP30 goals ""to some extent"". 

 However, she stressed that this would not deter Brazil's climate efforts. ""On the contrary, we will strengthen climate action and fight inequality while pushing for stronger means of implementation.""

A Russian missile struck a hotel in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih late on Wednesday, killing four people and injuring 32, and rescuers were still searching on Thursday morning for anyone trapped in the rubble, officials said.

A group of humanitarian organization volunteers from Ukraine, the U.S. and Britain had checked into the hotel just before the strike but survived after taking shelter quickly, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.

Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskiy's home town, has been a frequent target since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.

""Unfortunately, four people were killed in the attack,"" the president wrote on Telegram. ""We must not pause in putting pressure on Russia to stop this war and terror against life.""

Ukraine's Emergency Services said 19 people had been rescued from the site of the hotel.

They posted pictures of crews making their way through the rubble outside the floodlit five-storey building and clambering up and down ladders.

Other pictures posted by the regional governor showed the hotel on Thursday no longer in flames but with its top floor destroyed and the rest of the building wrecked. He said two children were among the wounded.

Separately, Ukraine's military said Russian forces in total had launched two ballistic missiles - including the one that struck Kryvyi Rih - and 112 drones at Ukraine overnight.

In the northeastern city of Sumy, Russian drones struck a postal depot and started a large fire, killing one person and burning down the facility along with more than 2,500 parcels.

Photos and videos posted by Nova Poshta, the depot's owner, showed the ruined shell of a warehouse strewn with rubble and charred packages.

Some drones struck energy infrastructure in the southern region of Odesa, injuring two people, its governor said.

DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said the Odesa region attack had damaged its fifth facility in two weeks.

""Russia continues its energy terror of Odesa region,"" DTEK said on Telegram.

Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said about 10,000 households in the Odesa region were currently without power, and that work was being conducted round the clock to restore the supply.

Moscow has waged a rolling campaign of strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities throughout the war, causing frequent blackouts across the country.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is considering a major change to the U.S.’ participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to three current and former senior U.S. officials and one congressional official. 

Trump has discussed with aides the possibility of calibrating America’s NATO engagement in a way that favors members of the alliance that spend a set percentage of their gross domestic product on defense, the officials said.

As part of the potential policy shift, the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked if the country doesn’t meet the defense spending threshold, the officials said. If Trump does make that change, it would mark a significant shift from a core tenet of the alliance known as Article 5, which says that an attack on any NATO country is an attack on all of them. 

The president is similarly considering a policy change in which the U.S. may choose to prioritize military exercises with NATO members that are spending the set percentage of their GDPs on defense, the officials said. His administration has already signaled to America’s European allies that the U.S. could reduce its military presence in Europe, and one option now under consideration is to reposition some U.S. troops in the region so they are focused in or around NATO countries that have scaled their defense spending to meet the specific percentage of their GDPs, the officials said.  

Asked about Trump considering making these changes to how the U.S. engages with NATO, a National Security Council official said in a written statement, “President Trump is committed to NATO and Article V.”

Sen. Chris Coons, of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Defense and a senior senator on the Foreign Relations panel, said Trump’s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, “gave very reassuring answers” on the administration’s commitment to NATO and Article 5.

Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO countries for not meeting the current NATO member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defense. He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts an added burden on the U.S.

NATO countries agreed more than a decade ago to set the spending goal for each of them at 2% of GDP. But Trump has pushed to increase that percentage. Most recently he said NATO members should spend 5% of their GDP on defense, though the U.S. does not currently do that.

“NATO has to pay more,” Trump said in January after taking office. “It’s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.”

According to NATO’s most recent statistics, last year 23 NATO members’ defense spending exceeded 2% of their GDP. Five of those nations — Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland and the U.S. — spent more than 3% on defense. Poland had the highest percentage, dedicating 4.12% of its GDP to defense.

The potential shift in how the U.S. participates in NATO comes as Trump is pushing European allies to do more to aid Ukraine in its war with Russia and to play a major role in maintaining peace in the country if a deal to end the war is reached.

“I was contacted by several European ambassadors concerned about rumors that Trump might make some negative announcement about NATO,” Coons told NBC News in an interview on Wednesday. Trump didn’t announce anything at his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, but Coons said, “If you’re not given pause by everything about President Trump’s statements and actions on foreign policy, you’re not paying attention.”

Trump threatened to withdraw the U.S. from NATO during his first term and has questioned the merits of Article 5 for the U.S. The article was designed to protect European nations from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It has been triggered just once, after the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.

Ukraine has sought NATO membership, but the Trump administration has said that would not be part of any negotiated peace deal.

CIA staffing numbers are classified so it's unclear how many will be impacted.

As President Donald Trump's administration continues its sweeping overhaul of the federal government, a federal appeals court is temporarily allowing the president to remove the head of a watchdog agency, overturning a lower court’s decision from this weekend.

Fallout continues from Trump's historic tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, along with increased duties on goods from China. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Wednesday a one-month exemption for some automakers on the tariffs from Canada and Mexico.

President Donald Trump said in a new post on his social media platform Thursday that a combination of DOGE and heads of federal agencies will take a ""scalpel"" approach when it comes to federal cuts rather than using a ""hatchet.""

Trump shared that he, his cabinet secretaries and Elon Musk had a meeting Thursday.





""We're going to have these meetings every two weeks until that aspect of this very necessary job is done. The relationships between everybody in that room are extraordinary,"" he said.

-ABC News' Hannah Demissie

A federal judge denied a request Thursday to expedite a case challenging the legality of the Department of Government Efficiency after President Donald Trump's address to Congress inserted confusion about who exactly is running the cost-cutting group.

""Plaintiffs have not explained, with clarity, the nature of any emergency here that would require the Court to compel Defendants to respond more rapidly than the default rules provide for,"" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb wrote in an order.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said teams from the U.S. and Ukraine will hopefully meet next week.

“The Ukrainian and American teams have renewed their work, and we hope next week we will have a substantive meeting,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X.

Andrii Yermak, the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, will go to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to meet with U.S. officials to discuss possible peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on Tuesday, a source in Zelenskyy’s office told ABC News.

Ukraine’s Minister of Defense, Foreign Affairs and military representatives may also attend the meeting, the source said.

It is unclear if anything will be signed at the meeting, but the source confirmed that the meeting will be about the peace talks.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her call with President Donald Trump was ""very respectful"" in a press conference Thursday after the phone call.

At first, Trump said he wasn't going to change or delay the tariffs, but after she showed him how fentanyl crossing into the United States has decreased from January to February and how the additional 10,000 Mexican troops at the US-Mexico border is helping, as well as noted that Mexico sent back 29 people the U.S. wanted for various crimes, he changed his mind, Sheinbaum said.





""He didn't know this chart until we sent it to him,"" Sheinbaum said.

Sheinbaum repeatedly said it is her job to stand up for the people of Mexico.

She also said Mexico needs to develop its own production and manufacturing more so it isn't relying on the U.S. as much.

Some U.S. allies are considering scaling back the intelligence they share with Washington in response to the Trump administration’s conciliatory approach to Russia, four sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told NBC News.

The allies are weighing the move because of concerns about safeguarding foreign assets whose identities could inadvertently be revealed, said the sources, who included a foreign official.

Every intelligence agency treats its commitments to foreign agents as sacrosanct, pledging to keep agents safe and shield their identities. Anything that jeopardized that obligation would violate that trust, former officials said, and that could lead some spy services to hold back on some information sharing with Washington.

The allies, including Israel, Saudi Arabia and members of the so-called Five Eyes spy alliance of English-speaking democracies, are examining how to possibly revise current protocols for sharing intelligence to take the Trump administration’s warming relations with Russia into account, the sources said

“Those discussions are already happening,” said a source with direct knowledge of the discussions.

No decision or action has been taken, however, the sources said.

The review is part of a wider examination of the spectrum of relations with Washington among many U.S. allies, including diplomacy, trade and military cooperation, as well as intelligence matters, the sources said. 

Though the extent of a U.S. policy change toward Russia remains unclear, allies are weighing the possible implications of what could be a historic shift, a Western official said.

Asked about allies’ possibly limiting what they share with the United States, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council said President Donald Trump is “clear-eyed” about America’s adversaries.

“The U.S. has unrivaled intelligence capabilities which is exactly why intelligence sharing initiatives such as the Five Eyes exist,” spokesman Brian Hughes said in an email. 

“President Trump is clear-eyed on all threats our adversaries pose to our national security and he will work with any ally or partner who understands the dangerous world inherited after the disastrous Biden years,"" he added. ""On Biden’s watch, we had the war in Ukraine, the surrender in Afghanistan, and the slaughter of the innocents on October 7th.” 

Administration officials and some Republican lawmakers have defended Trump’s handling of Russia as a tactic designed to bring Moscow to the negotiating table and clinch a peace deal that would end a destabilizing war in Europe. But distrust of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a veteran KGB officer, remains high among U.S. allies. 

Publicly, longtime U.S. allies downplayed the issue. The United Kingdom, the most important U.S. intelligence partner, said it had no plans to reduce intelligence cooperation with the United States.

“The U.S. is the UK’s closest ally and we will continue to cooperate closely on defence, intelligence and security matters,” a British government spokesperson said in an email. “Any suggestion otherwise is totally untrue.” 

The Canada Security Intelligence Service said in a statement that it has strong relationships with numerous U.S. agencies that are “long-standing and resilient.”

It added, “Canada deeply values its partnership with the United States, and we believe that it is in the strategic interest of both countries to continue our strong national security cooperation.”

An Israeli official also praised its alliance with the U.S., saying ""Cooperation between Israel and the United States on every level, including the sharing of crucial intelligence data, is as strong and solid as ever.""

Officials from New Zealand, Australia and Saudi Arabia did not respond to requests for comment. 

Some officials in allied countries, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters, played down the idea that  Trump’s policies on Russia would disrupt information sharing that dates back decades. They noted that intelligence can be shared in ways that protect sources and methods.

But some former U.S. intelligence officers say they are concerned that the Trump administration may opt to scale back intelligence collection aimed at Russia, as the U.S. may no longer see Russia as a top threat. 

The administration, for example, has indicated it may place a higher priority on efforts to counter drug cartels from Mexico and other countries in the region. Already, the Defense Department has deployed more resources to the southern border, including a team of analysts. And the CIA has launched drone surveillance flights over Mexico as part of that effort. 

Trump’s decision this week to pause intelligence assistance to Ukraine, along with military aid, has reinforced concerns among  allies. The intelligence cooperation with Kyiv — which has developed since Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 — has benefited both Washington and Kyiv, former officials say, with Ukraine providing valuable insights about Russia.

In weighing whether to dial back some intelligence sharing, the Five Eyes allies — the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand — and other U.S. partners would have to take into account risks to their own national security if cooperation with Washington were reduced. 

But recent moves by the Trump administration regarding cybersecurity have also fueled concerns about the administration’s engagement with Moscow. 

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last month ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive cyber operations and information operations against Russia, NBC News has reported. It is unclear how long the order will last. 

And in a speech at a U.N. working group on cybersecurity last month, a senior State Department official, Liesyl Franz, made no mention of Russia as a top cyber threat and cited only China and Iran. 

For years, including during Trump’s first term, Republican and Democratic administrations have described Russia as one of the most sophisticated and dangerous threats to American cybersecurity. 

With Trump and his deputies echoing some of Russia’s talking points about the Ukraine war and indicating they hope to expand U.S. relations with Moscow, former intelligence officials say the administration may even share some sensitive information with Moscow.

Several former U.S. intelligence officers said they and their colleagues still in government are deeply concerned about the possible implications of the administration’s shift toward Russia, in which Moscow may no longer be treated as an adversary.

“People are very worried,” a former intelligence official said.

The Five Eyes alliance is arguably the most formidable espionage alliance in the world. The intelligence cooperation among its members is deeply embedded, dating to the 1940s, and officials have credited it with helping counter the Soviets during the Cold War and foiling terrorist plots in recent decades. 

The sharing of satellite imagery and eavesdropping intelligence among alliance members is extensive, highly integrated and “nearly automatic,” a former intelligence official said. 

Unwinding the technical side of the alliance’s cooperation would be complicated and difficult, former officials said. A likelier scenario could have allied governments withholding some intelligence from human sources or analyses that could cause friction with the White House, several former intelligence officials said.

Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a member of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said he was deeply concerned by the Trump administration’s “rapid pivot towards the Kremlin” and media reports that U.S. Cyber Command was pulling back on cyber operations against Russia. 

“Russia is an adversary and, as always, looking for opportunities to sow discord and make trouble for Americans and for the government, so any stand-down or pullback of our operations could be catastrophic,” Crow said in an interview.

The administration’s actions on cybersecurity have fueled speculation that Washington and Moscow may have come to an informal understanding to pull back from aggressive digital operations to reduce tensions and open the way for more diplomacy. 

It is possible that the Trump administration and Russia have agreed to “a cyber détente,” said Emily Harding, a former intelligence official. But Harding and other former intelligence officials warned that in past, attempts by the United States to forge limited cooperation with Russia, the Kremlin has proved to be an unreliable partner. 

“That sounds good in theory,” said Harding, director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. “I think the next question is whether you think Russia would actually stick to it.”  

A major hitch to any cyber détente with Moscow is Russia’s status as a hub of cybercriminals who target Americans. Russia does not extradite its citizens, and it has largely refused to work with U.S. law enforcement agencies when they identify hackers attacking American businesses, hospitals and government networks.

Of particular concern is ransomware, in which hackers, often Russian-speaking criminal gangs, deploy malicious software to lock up computer networks and demand payment. 

Known attacks on the U.S. public sector frequently tied to Russia have steadily increased each year through 2024, according to a survey conducted by the cybersecurity company Emsisoft. 

The cybersecurity insurer Coalition found in a report published in October that ransomware attacks around the globe cost companies  $353,000 on average last year. In some instances, ransomware gangs have alluded to ties to Russian intelligence. 

Philip Reiner, CEO of the Institute for Security and Technology, a San Francisco think tank that focuses on cybersecurity policy, told NBC News that any new agreement with Russia needs to persuade the Kremlin to rein in its cybercriminals who target Americans, as they rarely face legal repercussions in Russia.

“Any engagement the Trump administration has to normalize relations around cyber has got to take into account the economic terrorism that Russia engages in via ransomware gangs,” Reiner said. “That has to be a factor in any overall negotiation.”

Previous U.S. presidents from both parties have tried to “reset” relations with Russia and explored sharing intelligence about common threats with Moscow. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, President George W. Bush asked U.S. spy agencies to pursue possible collaboration with Russia on terrorism threats. But the effort “went nowhere fast,” a former intelligence official said. 

The Russians were not interested in sharing sensitive information about terrorist groups, according to former officials. 

In an op-ed in 2020 in The Washington Post, former CIA officer John Sipher and other former colleagues recounted how attempts to increase cooperation with Moscow’s spy services repeatedly failed. 

“Inside the CIA, we often joked that, to Putin, win-win means I beat you twice,” they wrote. “Good intentions from the U.S. side have proved time and again to have been futile in improving relations.”

Trump during his address to Congress said that Canada and Mexico ‘have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before.’

Fact Check: Trump’s Fentanyl Claims

As part of the 'Border Operation', a convoy of the Mexican National Guard installs a checkpoint on Juarez Avenue to check vehicles seeking to cross the border, Feb. 7, 2025, in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

President Donald Trump has justified his new tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China as a way to hold the countries accountable for fentanyl in the U.S. that he says stems from them.

Trump during his address to Congress on Tuesday night said that Canada and Mexico “have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before.”

“Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada,” Trump said. “But we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people, destroying families. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.”

Trump last month delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico after they agreed to help stem the flow of fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid, over the borders into the U.S. He said this week that the countries haven’t done enough and went forward with a 25% tariff on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada and doubled the existing 10% tariff on imports from China.

But Trump on Thursday flip-flopped again, placing another one-month pause on the tariff on most goods from Mexico.

“We are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl,” Trump said in his post announcing the change.

Cecelia Smith-SchoenwalderJan. 31, 2025



The tariffs were a promise Trump made after he was elected president. He pledged to “sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders. This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”

Drug overdose deaths in the U.S., however, are down dramatically since 2023, decreasing nearly 24%, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Here is a look at the fentanyl situation in the U.S. and abroad:

“The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive,” Trump said in January. “The fentanyl coming through Mexico is massive.”

Trump is right that fentanyl comes across the border from Mexico in significant amounts, but he’s wrong to put Canada in that pairing as an equal player.

In fiscal 2024, 43 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the northern border, according to Customs and Border Protection data.

More than 21,000 pounds were seized at the southern border during the same time period.

Of course, even small amounts of the drug can be lethal.

China’s part in the issue is more complicated. Beijing maintains that it does not allow the drug to be made within its borders.

As recently as the last decade, large amounts of fentanyl were being sent from China to the U.S. via the Postal Service, with the Treasury Department calling it the “most common distribution method.” The two countries reached an agreement in 2019 after which U.S. officials acknowledged significant improvement from China on identifying and helping prevent shipments through the mail. Yet cooperation on stemming narcotics trafficking has stalled when political relations between the two countries are strained.



According to the Council on Foreign Relations, “Chinese companies are widely known to make precursor chemicals, many of which have legitimate reasons to produce controlled substances, principally in the medical sector.”

“However, these precursors are often purchased by transnational criminal organizations in Mexico to synthesize fentanyl,” the council said in a post.

It should be noted that the vast majority – more than 86% – of individuals sentenced for fentanyl trafficking in fiscal 2023 were U.S. citizens, according to government data.

All three countries took issue with Trump’s decision, saying they have taken steps to address the issue.

""While less than 1% of the fentanyl intercepted at the U.S. border comes from Canada, we have worked relentlessly to address this scourge,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement, pointing to $1.3 billion worth of security measures along the border.

He called the move “unjustified” and responded with a 25% tariff on $155 billion worth of American goods.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country, too, would retaliate with 25% tariffs on U.S. goods.

""There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,” she said, adding that Mexico has increased law enforcement pressure on drug cartels.

China also said it stepped up its efforts to work with the U.S. on the issue.

Steven Ross JohnsonJan. 28, 2025



China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian accused the Trump administration of using ""the fentanyl issue as a pretext"" to threaten China. Beijing announced tariffs on a variety of U.S. agricultural imports.

""If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end,"" China's U.S. embassy posted on social media.

Drug overdoses in the U.S. peaked in 2022 and 2023, causing more than 111,000 fatalities per year – most of which were driven by fentanyl.

But the U.S. has since seen a continued steep decline in overdose deaths.

“Annual fentanyl-related deaths remain in the scores of thousands but are trending downward for the first time in years,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

FILE - In this June 24, 2016 file photo the logo of German industrial conglomerate Siemens is pictured prior to the opening ceremony at the new headquarters in Munich, Germany.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Siemens plans to invest $285 million in manufacturing in the United States, the tech company said Thursday, including two new facilities in California and Texas.

The U.S. is the largest market for the company. The recent investments in the Siemens' U.S. manufacturing footprint and the planned acquisition of Altair, a Michigan-based software company, mark more than $10 billion in investment in the U.S.

“We believe in the innovation and strength of America’s industry. That’s why Siemens has invested over $90 billion in the country in the last 20 years. This year’s investment will bring this number to over $100 billion,"" Roland Busch, president and CEO of Siemens AG, said in a statement. “We are bringing more jobs, more technology and a boost to America’s AI capabilities.”

Siemens’ announcement comes as chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it plans to invest an additional $100 billion in the U.S., on top of $65 billion in investments the company had previously said it would make. That investment will be for three more chip manufacturing plants, along with two packaging facilities, in Arizona.

Siemens said it plans to open two manufacturing facilities for electrical products in Fort Worth, Texas, and Pomona, Calif. The company said it expects its latest investment to create more than 900 skilled manufacturing jobs, with the equipment produced in those factories supporting the U.S. commercial, industrial and construction sectors. The move will also allow the company to power AI data centers.

Hong Kong Democrat Jimmy Lai Finishes Testifying in National Security Trial

By Jessie Pang and James Pomfret

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy advocate Jimmy Lai finished testifying in court on Thursday in a landmark national security trial where he stands accused of colluding with foreign forces and sedition.

Thursday marked day 144 of the trial against Lai and his 52nd day in the witness box, after which he thanked the judges and waved to his supporters.

Lai, 77, founder of the Apple Daily newspaper that was forced to close after a police raid and asset freeze in June 2021, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces, and a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious material.

Lai, whose health is fragile according to his family, faces a possible life sentence under a China-imposed national security law. Some countries, including the U.S. and Britain, have called for his immediate release alleging the trial is political.

Lai's plight has become a friction point between the U.S. and China, with Donald Trump saying he would ""one hundred percent"" get Lai out of the country.

Over weeks of testimony, Lai spoke candidly on topics including his defence of free speech and the media, while rejecting allegations by the prosecution that he had lobbied the U.S. to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China.

He also remained defiant in the face of intense cross-examination. In one exchange he called himself a ""political prisoner"" only for one judge, Esther Toh, to reject that and say Lai was in court to face a criminal charge. Lai said he had the right to disagree.

Before concluding his cross-examination, prosecutor Anthony Chau read out the three charges, alleged conspiracies and co-conspirators, and asked Lai if he agreed with them.

""Of course I disagree. Totally rubbish,"" Lai said.

Lai added that he did not even know one of the alleged co-conspirators, Andy Li.

Lai has been held in solitary confinement for more than 1,500 days since December 2020.

Former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, speaking in Hong Kong in January, called on Beijing to end Lai's ordeal.

""There's probably no more compelling gesture in the short term, to send a message of goodwill to the people of the United States or the free world, than if China were to take steps to free Jimmy Lai,"" Pence said at a closed door investor conference, a recording of which was reviewed by Reuters.

Hong Kong authorities say Lai's trial is fair and the national security law has brought stability after mass pro-democracy protests in 2019.

No firm date has been set for a verdict, but a judge recently indicated it could come in October.

The Canadian and Mexican architects of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement say Donald Trump’s trade war has crossed a line that essentially wipes out the continental trade pact, as experts suggest the president’s actions are meant to rattle America’s closest neighbours ahead of a mandatory review.

Canada’s chief negotiator, Steve Verheul, and Mexico’s chief negotiator, Ken Smith Ramos, said the devastating duties essentially suspend the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement.

“With 25 per cent tariffs, it blows a complete hole in the trade agreement,” Verheul said Wednesday.

“It makes it virtually worthless to us. In fact, it leaves Canada and Mexico in a far worse position than any other country in the world practically.”

Trump followed through Tuesday on his threat to impose sweeping economy-wide tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with a lower 10 per cent levy on Canadian energy.

Ottawa responded with retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion in American goods the same day. Another $125 billion in Canadian tariffs are set to come into effect 21 days later.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government would announce duties on targeted products and other measures Sunday. She said “there is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations.”

Trump pushed ahead with the levies on Canada using the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, a national security statute that gives him authority to control economic transactions, after he declared an emergency on fentanyl at the northern border.

But U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data shows only a small volume of fentanyl crosses illegally into the United States from Canada. It reports just 13.6 grams of fentanyl seized by northern Border Patrol staff in January.

Verheul repeated Wednesday that the excuse of fentanyl to impose tariffs is unjustified in the case of Canada. He said “absolutely none of this is necessary.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said what Trump “wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.” Trudeau said Canada will file claims against the levies with the World Trade Organization and through the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Free Trade Agreement.

Verheul and Ramos were key figures when CUSMA was negotiated under the first Trump administration to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump described it at the time as the “best agreement we’ve ever made.”

Verheul and Ramos have partnered with Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican and the former chairman of the House of Representatives committee on ways and means, to form the Coalition for North American Trade, along with a global law firm.

The goal is to join forces to share the economic and security benefits of the agreement — which they say has become more important and increasingly challenging under the tariff sabre-rattling of the Trump administration.

Trump’s duties against Canada and Mexico caused a tumultuous week on Wall Street — the first test of the president’s expanding tariff plan.

Trump also ordered 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States on March 12, which the White House has confirmed would stack on top of the other duties imposed on Canada.

Trump signed an executive order to implement “reciprocal tariffs” starting April 2. Other tariff targets include automobiles, copper, lumber and agricultural products.

Trump on Wednesday granted a one-month exemption for any vehicles coming through CUSMA after the Big Three automakers — Stellantis, Ford and General Motors — had a conversation with the president.

Ramos said when tariffs stack on top of each other, it’s hard to justify prioritizing trade with America — tariffs at 50 per cent are the same as 5,000 per cent.

“It doesn’t make sense anymore,” he said.

Mexico is acting on the president’s border concerns, looking to build a long-term plan, but Ramos said it must be separate from trade if there are to be good-faith conversations about a trade pact.

The CUSMA review scheduled for 2026 could have one of three outcomes. The three partner nations could submit recommendations for changes, tweak the agreement and sign up for another 16-year term, or one of the countries could also pull out of the agreement entirely. The third possible outcome would see the Trump administration, or another country, withhold renewal, pushing the issue back for 12 months. That would likely prolong market uncertainty.

The agreement’s architects say the ideal situation is that they tweak the agreement — although that seems unlikely considering the current geopolitical environment.

“Canadians think the U.S. is no longer a reliable trading partner,” Verheul said at the Washington launch of the coalition.

Brady said the future of the U.S. relationship with Mexico and Canada is no longer clear. Both countries remain America’s largest customers, the Republican said, and the agreement helped solidify that relationship.

“Leaving this agreement or allowing it to expire will have a very damaging impact on millions of American workers and families,” Brady said.

Last year was a record year for park visitation

America’s national parks just had their busiest year ever—right as the National Park Service (NPS) struggles with major staffing cuts. In 2024, a record-breaking 332 million visitors explored the country’s national treasures, from towering peaks to serene coastlines. That’s nearly a million more than the previous high in 2016 and 2% more than in 2023.

With 28 parks setting individual visitation records, the numbers paint a clear picture: people are craving the great outdoors more than ever. Places like Capitol Reef in Utah, Dry Tortugas in Florida and Kenai Fjords in Alaska saw unprecedented crowds. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is once again the most popular park, with a staggering 12.1 million visitors, followed by Zion, the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Park.

RECOMMENDED: The best national parks to visit in the U.S.

The news comes as the parks prepare to deal with drastic cuts. The Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal workforce led to a nearly 10% cut in NPS employees, with about 1,000 workers laid off just before Valentine’s Day. That means fewer rangers, fewer maintenance crews and fewer people to manage the influx of visitors.

Advocates warn that the effects are already showing, as some parks have cut hours, limited programs and seen longer wait times at entrances. Keeping parks clean, safe and well-maintained with fewer hands on deck will be a challenge as summer approaches. Without enough staff to support the parks, fears that the visitor experience—and the parks themselves—may start to suffer are growing. If you’re planning a trip, be prepared for crowds, longer lines and possibly fewer services, so bring a little more patience with you when you go.

Been there, done that? Think again, my friend.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Jack Daniel's maker says Canada taking bottles off shelves 'worse than tariffs',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0422zzpw8o,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 12:33:13 GMT","

Canadian provinces pulling US alcohol off store shelves in response to Trump trade policy is ""worse than tariffs"", the boss of Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman has said.

Several Canadian provinces, including Ontario, which is by far the most populated, took action this week in retaliation for US tariffs on Canadian goods.

The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), one of the largest buyers of alcohol in the world, removed US-made alcoholic drinks from its shelves on Tuesday.

Brown-Forman boss Lawson Whiting said the Canadian response was ""disproportionate"" to the 25% levies on Canadian goods imposed by the Trump administration.

""I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves,"" Mr Whiting said.

In response to the tariffs, Canada has retaliated with 25% levies on goods imported from the US, including beer, spirits, and wine.

Some provinces also took action themselves, including Ontario and Nova Scotia.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the LCBO sells nearly $1bn of US alcohol per year. ""As of today, every single one of these products is off the shelves,"" Mr Ford said on Tuesday.

The LCBO is the exclusive wholesaler in Ontario, which means other retailers, bars and restaurants in the province will no longer be able to restock US products, Mr Ford said.

Nevertheless, Mr Whiting said Canada makes up only 1% of Brown-Forman's total sales, so the firm can withstand the hit.

Canadians are being advised by the LCBO to buy products made in Canada. Some Canadians have been turning to local goods anyway in response to the Trump tariffs.

Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, criticised the US tariffs on Tuesday, saying imposing them was ""a very dumb thing to do"".

He also accused the US president of planning ""a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us"".

Trump has made a number of remarks about making Canada the 51st state of his country, which Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has said she takes ""very seriously"".

Washington has also placed 25% tariffs on Mexico, although Trump has said he will temporarily spare carmakers in both Canada and Mexico from the taxes.

Trump has accused both Canada and Mexico of failing to do enough to stem the flow of the fentanyl opioid into the US, an argument that has been rejected by both countries.

Mr Whiting said Brown-Forman was going to see what happens in Mexico, which accounted for 7% of its sales in 2024.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Marc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois is getting ready to introduce a fancy ergonomic chair designed to reduce customers’ back pain and boost their productivity. He figures the most expensive one will sell for more than $1,000. But he can’t settle on a price, and he is reluctantly reducing the shipment he’s bringing to the United States from China.

There’s a reason for his caution: President Donald Trump’s ever-changing, on-again, off-again tariff war with America’s three biggest trading partners – Mexico, Canada and China.

The latest reversal came Thursday. Two days after imposing 25% taxes — tariffs — on all imports from Canada and Mexico and threatening to detonate more than $1.3 billion in annual U.S. trade in North America, Trump announced on his Truth Social media platform that he was suspending most of the levies on Mexico for a month. This was an expansion of his Wednesday announcement when he exempted auto imports from both countries for 30 days, and it also comes after a previous monthlong tariff reprieve for Canada and Mexico right before they were to take effect Feb. 4. 

Rosenberg and his ergonomic furniture, meanwhile, are contending with a 20% tariff on imports from China – which Trump on Tuesday raised from 10% -- but he’s not sure where the tariff will actually land. 

“The misdirection is making it very tough to plan for the year,’’ he said.




Tariffs cause economic pain in part because they’re a tax paid by importers that often gets passed along to consumers, adding to inflationary pressure. They also draw retaliation from trading partners, which can hurt all economies involved.

But import taxes can cause economic damage in another way: by complicating the decisions businesses have to make, including which suppliers to use, where to locate factories, what prices to charge. And that uncertainty can cause them to delay or cancel investments that help drive economic growth.

“It creates an enormous amount of uncertainty for multinational companies that sell products worldwide, that import from the rest of the world, that run these complex supply chains through multiple countries,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University. “The uncertainty is going to be very unsettling for businesses and ... it will hurt business investment.’'

During Trump’s first-term trade battles, U.S. business investment weakened late in 2019, convincing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three times in second half of the year to provide some offsetting economic stimulus.

Trump 2.0 is even more unnerving to business. The first Trump administration imposed tariffs on specific targets — steel and aluminum and most goods from China — after lengthy investigations.

This time, Trump has invoked his power to declare a national emergency — ostensibly over the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants across U.S. borders — to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China with the stroke of a pen. And he’s expanded his targets. Next month, for example, he intends to impose “reciprocal tariffs’’ on countries that charge higher import taxes than America does.

“Just the threat of those tariff increases and potential retaliations are putting a brake on — on investment, on consumption decisions, on employment, hiring, all the rest of it,’’ European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said after the ECB cut interest rates Thursday to support Europe’s struggling economy.

His tariffs on Canada and Mexico effectively blow up a 2020 North American trade deal he negotiated himself five years ago. “Past trade agreements simply don’t mean much if the president can unilaterally violate them and impose tariffs with no checks at all,” said Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College.

Adding to the uncertainty: It’s unclear what Trump is trying to achieve by plastering tariffs on American trading partners. Sometimes he cites border security. Sometimes he emphasizes the revenue that tariffs can generate for the Treasury — money that can help finance his proposed tax cuts. Sometimes he points to America’s big trade deficits with most other countries. 

Since the goals are cloudy, it’s hard to see what it will take to make Trump’s tariffs go away.

Not only that, but he’s imposed the tariffs erratically, creating even more confusion. For instance, his administration had to reverse itself last month after ending a customs loophole – the “de minimis” exemption -- allowing duty-free entry into the United States of packages from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800. Turned out, the U.S. postal service needed more time to figure out how to collect the duties.

Businesses are baffled. “I’ve talked to multiple companies that are saying, ‘We’re not moving forward with any investment. We need this to be settled,’” said trade lawyer Gregory Husisian at the law firm Foley & Lardner. At least in Trump’s first term “they knew what the ground rules were. Now they don’t know if we’re playing Monopoly or tic-tac-toe.’’

Respondents to the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing survey, out Monday, voiced complaints about the tariff uncertainty. “There is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so it’s harder to project how they will affect business,” a transportation equipment company said. A chemicals firm griped: “The tariff environment regarding products from Mexico and Canada has created uncertainty and volatility among our customers.’’

“Right now, the tariffs are putting everybody off balance because of their unpredictability and uncertainty,” said John Gulliver, president of the New England-Canada Business Council.

Taylor Samuels, the owner of Las Almas Rotas, a bar and restaurant in Dallas, depends on Mexico for much of the alcohol he offers.

The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, including the potential impact on the price of raw materials like steel and lumber, are forcing him to review his plans to build a new restaurant. 

“That construction budget is now under review and may likely be delayed ... as I recalculate costs that have already been budgeted,” he said.

Similarly, Sandya Dandamudi of GI Stone, a stone supplier in Chicago, said builders are having to rethink their plans. 

“Developers of commercial projects like high-rises and hotels budget two years in advance, so they don’t account for new tariffs,” she said. “Those budgets will be blown.’’

Dandamudi said that companies will either succeed in passing the tariffs along to their customers or they will be forced to cancel projects.

“The tariffs will be devastating for small businesses like ours,” she said. “Going forward, we won’t be able to sign any new contracts unless clients address the tariffs.”

Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, that sells Canadian whisky and other specialty spirits, said her plans for the future have been put on hold due to the tariffs. Her original plan for 2025 was to almost double her inventory and the selection she offered. 

“For now, we have no plans of adding more shelving or space for new items, we will stick to the footprint we have,” she said. “This will delay the growth of our business, making us a bit stagnant.’’

Macy’s delivered another quarter of mixed results on Thursday as investors wait and see how quickly CEO Tony Spring can pull off a turnaround of the business with yet another activist investor looking to take the chain private.

Across the business, which includes the Macy’s banner, Bloomingdale’s and Blue Mercury, comparable sales during the all-important holiday quarter were down 1.1%. But comparable sales across its owned and licensed businesses, plus its online marketplace, were up 0.2%, which is the highest the metric has been since the first quarter of 2022. 

Plus, the so-called First 50 locations — the stores that Macy’s is devoting more resources to as part of its turnaround plan — saw comparable sales up 0.8%, marking the fourth quarter in a row the metric has been positive.

The two bright spots in an otherwise worse-than-expected set of results suggest Macy’s turnaround is showing some signs of life — it just might not be working fast enough.

For fiscal 2025, Macy’s is expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 to $2.25 and sales of between $21 billion and $21.4 billion, lower than Wall Street expectations of $2.31 per share and $21.8 billion, according to LSEG.

Macy’s shares fell slightly in early trading.

Here’s how the department store performed during its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 1 was $342 million, or $1.21 per share, compared with a loss of $128 million, or a loss of 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items including impairments and settlement and restructuring charges, Macy’s reported earnings of $507 million, or $1.80 per share. 

Sales dropped to $7.77 billion, down about 4% from $8.12 billion a year earlier. Like other retailers, Macy’s benefited from an extra selling week in the year-ago period, which has skewed comparisons. 

For the current quarter, Macy’s is expecting adjusted earnings per share of between 12 cents and 15 cents and sales of between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, far below estimates of 28 cents and $4.71 billion, according to LSEG.

On a call with analysts, chief operating officer and chief financial officer Adrian Mitchell said the company is taking a “prudent” approach to guidance given the fluid nature of the turnaround plan, cautious consumer spending and uncertainties created by recent tariff increases between the U.S. and major trade partners.

“If we weren’t in the environment that were operating in, I would be even more bullish on our potential,” CEO Spring said during a call with analysts. “But I think prudency is important at this point in time.”

Macy’s mixed results come just over a year into Spring’s tenure as the legacy department store’s chief executive and his three-year strategy to turn the business around. While Bloomingdale’s and Blue Mercury saw another quarter of positive comparable sales, growing 4.8% and 6.2%, respectively, Macy’s namesake banner continues to be the company’s laggard with comps down 1.9%. 

To address long-standing issues at the legacy banner, Spring has implemented an aggressive store closure plan that includes shuttering 150 doors and a strategy to fix its better-performing locations. As Macy’s and other department stores have shrunk over the years, it’s faced criticism for neglecting its stores, not having enough staff and falling behind on the retail essentials that are necessary to win in any environment. 

Spring has started to address those issues by investing in 50 locations and providing better staffing, merchandising and visual presentation of the company’s varied assortment.

So far, the plan appears to be working. When Macy’s added more staffing to the shoes and handbag departments at 100 test locations, those stores outperformed shops that didn’t have those investments, Spring said Thursday.

Storewide, the first 50 locations have continued to outperform the bulk of the chain, and in February, the company added an additional 75 stores to the program, bringing the total number of “reimagined” locations to 125.

“Performance of both the first 50 and the 100 test stores illustrate that when we invest in the customer experience, we can grow sales,” said Spring. “Now we must scale these changes in order to achieve our long-term goals.”

In fiscal 2024, comparable sales across Macy’s business were still down by 0.9%, but that’s an improvement of 5.1 percentage points compared to fiscal 2023. In the fourth quarter, comparable sales at the Macy’s nameplate also saw a decline of 0.9%, up 3.8 percentage points from the prior year.

Still, investors shouldn’t expect a return to growth this year. The company is projecting comparable sales for the owned stores it’s keeping open, plus its licensed businesses and online marketplace, to be down 2% to flat in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year.

Reimagined stores now make up 36% of the 350 Macy’s locations that the business plans to keep open after it finishes closing underperforming locations. It will take time — and capital — to extend its strategy to the bulk of the chain. Spring has given the company two more years to pull it off, but whether investors have the patience to see the strategy play out — and whether macroeconomic conditions will slow it down — remains to be seen. 

In December, activist investor Barington Capital revealed it has a position in Macy’s and wants the company to cut spending, explore selling its luxury brands and take a hard look at its real estate portfolio. It’s the fourth activist push at the department store in the last decade.

Like the activists that had come right before it, Arkhouse and Brigade, many suspect that Barington is mainly after Macy’s lucrative real estate portfolio and is more interested in juicing it for profit than doing the work necessary to revitalize the chain. Still, Macy’s must act in the interest of shareholders and if it’s not doing enough to return value quickly an activist could eventually win out.

Macy’s on Thursday announced its intent to resume share buybacks under its remaining $1.4 billion share repurchase authorization, “market conditions pending.” 

“Building on our momentum, we continue to elevate the customer experience, deliver operational excellence and make prudent capital investments,” said Mitchell. “We remain committed to generating healthy free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and predictable quarterly dividends.”

Banijay Entertainment CEO Marco Bassetti touts the firm's ""strength and market-leading position in what has been commonly recognized as a challenging market environment.""


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


European TV production giant Banijay (Peaky Blinders, Black Mirror, MasterChef, Survivor) recorded a slight decline in full-year 2024 revenue for both its content production and content distribution businesses on a constant currency basis, Amsterdam stock exchange-listed parent company Banijay Group disclosed on Thursday. 


	The producer’s corporate parent disclosed that Paris-headquartered Banijay‘s annual production revenue dropped 2.8 percent on a constant currency and also a reported basis to 2.6 billion euro ($2.8 billion). Content distribution revenue was down 1.5 percent assuming constant currencies, or up 0.4 percent on a reported basis, at 397 million euro ($429 million).

	However, when including live experiences division Banijay Live, which focuses on the production of institutional ceremonies and live events in the sports, luxury and fashion industries, revenue for the combined content and live experiences division rose 0.5 percent on a constant currency basis and 0.8 percent on a reported basis to 3.3 billion euro ($3.6 billion). Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew 6.6 percent to €528 million ($571 million) when assuming constant exchange rates.


	Banijay Entertainment is led by CEO Marco Bassetti. “2024 saw Banijay Entertainment, inclusive of Banijay Live, continue to demonstrate its strength and market-leading position in what has been commonly recognized as a challenging market environment,” he said. “The combined business illustrated resilient [revenue], while ramping up its bottom line. A scaled content powerhouse, the last 12-months saw the business rise to be the largest European scripted studio — alongside its long-standing position as a leader in non-scripted (250-plus launches in ’24) — increasing activities in non-English-language and acting as a key partner for streamers (80 non-scripted and scripted launches in ’24), delivering award-winning, high-ranking shows across the board.”


	Bassetti added: “Broadening the offering with the likes of Caryn Mandabach Productions, we continued to strategically diversify the portfolio.”


	Banijay Entertainment touted such new commissions as Carême on Apple TV+, Return to Las Sabinas on Disney+ and Your Fault (Culpa Tuya) on Prime Video. “Many series attracted large audiences, including Like Water for Chocolate, which ranked first among Spanish-language content on HBO Max and remained in the top 10 most-watched programs in 35 countries during the month following its release,” the company said. “Iconic brands continued to enjoy great success, with a second season of SAS Rogue Heroes commissioned by BBC, with season one already sold to 180 territories globally; a second season of Marie-Antoinette by Canal+/BBC, with season one already sold to 149 territories globally. The group is also working on a Peaky Blinders film adaptation on Netflix.”

	











	Looking at the current year for its content production and distribution division plus live experiences, Banijay forecast revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percentage range. It also said that it was “focused on gaining further market share with streamers, leveraging its traveling formats, bolstering its distribution (of) scripted titles and expanding monetization efforts through an all-new content hub supported by cloud infrastructure and AI technologies.”


	And the company predicted: “Given the improved financial situation of the global streamers and the stability of broadcasters, we expect the return of growth in 2025 for the market.”


	Concluded Bassetti: “As we start accelerating through 2025, our goal remains simple — maintain our lead and be the number 1 partner for clients, the number 1 home for creatives and the number 1 powerhouse for IP, live events and experiences.”

Only 3% of Businesses Accurately Spot Financial Red Flags When Assessing Customer Risk, Reveals Creditsafe Study


ALLENTOWN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--2024 was a milestone year for corporate bankruptcies, with well-known brands like Express, Joann, Red Lobster and TGI Friday’s filing for bankruptcy. The reality is that several factors contributed to the downfall of these companies, including declining sales, high debt loads, increasing costs and cash flow issues. The reality is that erratic payment practices are often highly indicative of cash flow issues and financial distress. But the ‘Cost of Late Payments’ study released by Creditsafe reveals that few businesses know how to spot the red flags or identify which risk patterns are indicative of cash flow issues.



The good news is that 86% of the respondents believe frequent or increasing late payments from customers over a 12-month period has a moderate to high impact on the likelihood that a customer will go out of business or file for bankruptcy. This suggests that businesses are becoming more aware of the correlation between payment behaviors and bankruptcy risk. But there is one major problem. Only 3% of businesses are accurately spotting the real signs of trouble when analyzing the payment behaviors of their customers – despite historical data showing that sudden shifts in payment behavior often precede bankruptcy.



Key findings from the report include:



Steve Carpenter, Chief Operating Officer for North America at Creditsafe, says, “Our study’s findings highlight the need to educate – or re-educate – finance teams on how they can properly identify red flags when assessing the financial health of their customers. It’s not just about why it’s important to regularly review and analyze the historical trade payment data of customers. While that’s very important, it’s also necessary to provide helpful tips and training so finance teams can accurately identify problematic patterns that are indicative of cash flow issues and an increased likelihood of late payments over time. Otherwise, businesses will continue to miss and misread clear red flags – costing them dearly in terms of the amount of time it takes to chase unpaid invoices and the negative impact it has on the bottom line.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Trump announces pause on tariffs for some Mexican goods,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/stocks-tumble-tariff-fallout-roils-markets/story?id=119508907,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 15:22:30 GMT","

The move expanded a carve-out issued for automakers a day earlier.

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a one-month delay of tariffs on some products from Mexico.

The temporary exemption will lift tariffs for all Mexican goods compliant with United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement.

The announcement came after a conversation between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said.

""Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

Minutes later, Sheinbaum reciprocated in similar fashion.

""We had an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results, within the framework of respect for our sovereignties,"" Sheinbaum said in a post on X.

Trump made the announcement soon after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a one-month delay of tariffs on Mexico and Canada would likely apply to all products compliant with the USMCA.

Trump negotiated the USMCA during his first term, signing the agreement with Canada and Mexico in 2018.

""That which is part of President Trump’s deal with Canada and Mexico [is] likely to get an exemption from these tariffs,"" Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday morning.

Despite the effort to ease some tariffs, stocks dropped on Thursday as fallout from the policy continued to roil markets.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 400 points, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 2%.

The selloff erased some of the market gains delivered a day earlier after President Donald Trump gave U.S. automakers a one-month reprieve from the tariffs. Duties on a host of other goods remained in place, however.

The U.S. earlier this week slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China. The fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China last month.

The one-month delay in auto tariffs triggered a rally for shares of U.S. carmakers on Wednesday, but the largest companies in the sector turned down in early trading on Thursday.

Shares of Ford dropped 1.5%, while General Motors fell nearly 3%. Stellantis -- the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep -- saw its stock price fall 2%.

Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Elon Musk, tumbled 4.5% on Thursday.

The tariffs are expected to pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada.

The American Automotive Policy Council, or AAPC, a trade group that represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, praised the one-month tariff exemption.

""American Automakers Ford, GM and Stellantis applaud President Trump for recognizing that vehicles and parts that meet the high US and regional USMCA content requirements should be exempt from these tariffs,"" AAPC President Matt Blunt told ABC News in a statement.

Much like all the upheaval shaking the world, the huge swings rocking Wall Street may feel far from normal

You May Want to Jump off Wall Street's Wild Ride, but Remember: This Is What the Market Does

NEW YORK (AP) — Much like all the upheaval shaking the world, the huge swings rocking Wall Street may feel far from normal. But, for investing at least, all this is typical.

Sharp moves for the U.S. stock market, like its recent 6% drop in just a couple of weeks, happen regularly. Stomaching them is the price investors have to pay for the bigger returns that stocks can offer over other investments in the long term. 

This time doesn't look much different, experts say. Here's a glimpse at what's behind the market's wild moves and what experts are advising investors young and old to consider: 



  THE MARKET IS BAD, RIGHT?
 

It has certainly struggled. The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, has been dropping since setting an all-time high last month, largely because of worries about President Donald Trump's tariffs and signals that the U.S. economy is running less powerfully than economists expected. 

Any kind of uncertainty around the economy will give Wall Street pause. These tariffs have had a particularly jostling effect because no one knows how long Trump will go through with them. When worries are high, stocks sink sharply. When Wall Street goes back to thinking Trump is using tariffs as just a negotiating tactic, stocks have bounced back, such as on Wednesday. 



  STOCKS DO THIS OFTEN?
 

Yes. The S&P 500 has regularly seen declines bigger than this recent one, of 10% or more, every year or so. Often, experts view them as a culling of optimism that can otherwise run overboard, driving stock prices too high. 

Before this recent stumble, many critics were already saying the U.S. stock market was too expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits. They also pointed to how only a handful of companies was driving so much of the market's returns. A group of just seven Big Tech companies accounted for more than half of the S&P 500's total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 



  SHOULD I SELL AND GET OUT? 
 

Anytime an investor sees they’re losing money, it feels bad. This recent run feels particularly unnerving because of how incredibly calm the market had previously been. The S&P 500 is coming off a second straight year where it shot up by more than 20%, the first time that's happened since baggy pants were last in style before the millennium. 

Selling may offer some feeling of relief. But it also locks in losses and prevents the chance of making the money back over time. Historically, the S&P 500 has come back from every one of its downturns to eventually make investors whole again. That includes after the Great Depression, the dot-com bust and the 2020 COVID crash. 

Some recoveries take longer than others, but experts often recommend not putting money into stocks that you can't afford to lose for several years, up to 10. 

“Data has shown, historically, that no one can time the market,” said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of WalletHub. “No one can consistently figure out the best time to buy and sell.”

Put another way: “Keep on keeping on,” suggests Chris Fasciano, vice president, investment management and research, and chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.



  SHOULD I CHANGE ANYTHING WITH MY INVESTMENTS?
 

Even as the overall U.S. stock market has dropped, some corners outside the Magnificent Seven have done much better, Fasciano said. So have stocks outside the United States.

It could all be a reminder that investors often do best when they have a mixed set of investments rather than going all-in on just a few. And investors may no longer be as diversified as they thought after years of sheer dominance by the Magnificent Seven over the U.S. stock market and by Wall Street over global markets. 

“Now’s the time to revisit some of the old tried-and-true of portfolio construction, like diversification,” Fasciano said. 



  I JUST STARTED INVESTING IN STOCKS. WHAT SHOULD I DO?
 

The proliferation of online trading platforms and the ease of smartphones has helped create a new generation of investors who may not be used to such volatility. 

But the good news is younger investors often have the gift of time. With decades to go until retirement, they can afford to ride the waves and let their stock portfolios hopefully recover before compounding and eventually growing even bigger. 

“We would advise younger investors to not worry about this at all,” said Phil Battin, CEO of Ambassador Wealth Management. ""It’s just background noise. If you have 30 to 50 years until you need the money, the economy has survived world wars, oil embargoes, presidential assassinations, Y2K, and a global pandemic. It will survive the Trump tariffs as well.”



  WHAT ABOUT CRYPTO?
 

This is a little trickier. “In theory, part of the appeal of crypto is that it’s supposed to be a hedge investment that isn’t correlated with the stock market or the fiat-currency economy,” said Sam Taube, lead investing writer for NerdWallet. 

But in reality, at least recently, crypto has often gone down in price when stocks have gone down, instead of offering that hoped-for protection during Wall Street's sell-offs. ""So, young investors may need to rethink the idea that crypto’s value is completely independent of the stock market and broader economy,” Taube said.



  WHAT IF I'M NEAR RETIREMENT?
 

Older investors have less time than younger ones to allow their investments to bounce back. But even in retirement, some people will need their investments to last 30 years or more, said Niladri “Neel” Mukherjee, chief investment officer of TIAA Wealth Management.

People who have already retired may want to cut back on spending and withdrawals after sharp market downturns, because bigger withdrawals will remove more potential compounding ability in the future. But even retirees, at least in the early part of retirement, should still be invested in stocks to prepare for the possibility of decades of spending ahead. 

“You may want to slow that down and pick that back up once the market recovers,” Mukherjee said, “but it all comes down to having that conversation with your adviser and your portfolio manager.”



  HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST?
 

No one knows, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Carolyn McCall spoke about the U.K. TV giant's business trends and outlook, including the advertising market, streaming, and AI, after its full-year 2024 earnings report.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	U.K. TV giant ITV continues to focus on growing a successful production business, CEO Carolyn McCall said during an earnings call with reporters on Thursday after posting record full-year earnings for its ITV Studios production unit as she declined to comment on market chatter about a possible merger for the division.


	“We’ve got a really high-quality business. We already have scale, and we’re very diversified,” she said. “There’s been a lot of speculation, but I think you’d expect that speculation. There’s (also) speculation about Banijay and Fremantle, and there’s speculation about all studios businesses. We won’t comment on any speculation. All we would say is that we will continue to build the business as it has been built. We’ve grown even since 2018 by about 35 percent.”

	Deals have been part of that growth. “We bought really good labels. We’ve backed fantastic talent … and it’s really paying off as a strategy,” McCall said. “So, really no comment on anything to do with the speculation, but that you can see how well the business has done.”

	In Thursday’s earnings update, McCall said that “ITV Studios has delivered record profits this year, despite the one-off impact of the writers and actors strike and a softer demand from free-to-air broadcasters, which reflects the strength, scale, diversification and creativity of ITV Studios production companies across the world.” In its earnings report, however, the company also didn’t address potential deals that it has explored for ITV Studios after recent reports of a possible merger with RedBird IMI’s All3Media.


	Asked about industry consolidation, McCall said the consensus, whether in the U.S., the U.K. or Europe, is that there will be more. “We are holding our own,” she added.


	Questioned about having TV networks and production labels under the same corporate roof, McCall said on Thursday’s call: “There are definite merits to being integrated. There’s no question. You talk to any label in our ITV Studios family, and they all really, really value the fact that they can break shows on ITV and they become famous very quickly with their shows once they go onto our channels. That’s an absolutely big thing for us in retaining and recruiting talent and attracting people who (are) really high-caliber.”

	











	That said, “every board everywhere has to keep all options open, and our board is no different to that,” the ITV CEO said. “We review everything, and we review it regularly.”


	McCall in the update though touted the diversification of ITV’s business. “We are becoming a more resilient business with content production and digital now accounting for close to two-thirds of our revenue,” she said. “Our ongoing transformation ensures we are an adaptable and agile company, well positioned to deliver good profitable growth, strong cash generation and attractive returns to shareholders.”


	Streaming growth with a focus on profitability and sustainability has also been in ITV’s focus. Its streamer ITVX saw digital viewing rise 12 percent in 2024, with digital advertising revenue growing 15 percent. In its earnings update, ITV highlighted its “attractive returns,” without providing details, and adding that “by the end of 2025, we will have recouped the cumulative investment in ITVX, much earlier than anticipated.”


	Discussing streaming upside, McCall said her team’s focus is on “profitable growth” instead of buying subscriber gains or having “unrealistic” sub growth targets. “It’s highly profitable,” she concluded about ITVX Premium, saying the subscriber tier has more than 1 million users. But ITV’s business approach is to focuses on advertising-supported streaming, with its ad-free premium tier only being promoted in a very targeted way.


	Asked about the outlook for the ad market, McCall said: “We would all love an answer. … No one knows precisely. I think we have a stable outlook.” She then touted that “26 percent of our revenue today is digital advertising, and it was 9 percent in 2018, so you can see we’ve already made quite a shift to diversify” because free-to-air TV is “somewhat linked to GDP.” So the economy is “not a big risk in the way it might have been in the past.”

	











	The call also featured questions about YouTube and TikTok. “We have some very clear red lines at ITV about how we will partner,” McCall said. “You will notice that we are not partnering with TikTok in the same way as YouTube or any other social video channel. The reason for that is that until we did this commercial agreement with YouTube last year, they wouldn’t share data and wouldn’t let us sell your own inventory. Both of those things are absolutely critical for us. … We got those things from YouTube.”


	About the benefits, she said: “The viewers on YouTube are not viewers on ITV. They are very complementary – much younger, much more male.”


	Discussing AI, McCall cited such benefits as “automation, efficiency, or co-piloting,” adding that “also we have to make sure we constantly keep in touch with viewers’ needs” and responding to them.


	On Thursday’s call, McCall was joined by ITV CFO Chris Kennedy, Julian Bellamy, managing director, ITV Studios, and Kevin Lygo, managing director, media and entertainment.


	Lygo was asked about ITV’s second year airing the Oscars. He said that the same weekend also featured the Brit Awards and sports content, adding to excitement around the Oscars. “It just makes us alive,” Lygo concluded.

	Matthews is planning to hire more than 100 journalists including field producers, correspondents, photographers and more.

As previously announced, MSNBC hired Politico’s Eugene Daniels as a senior Washington correspondent and co-host of The Weekend and The Washington Post’s Jackie Alemany, who will be a correspondent and a co-host of The Weekend.


	Matthews also previously served as the director of programming for CNN Productions, where he was in charge of the documentary series CNN Presents and CNN’s Special Investigations Unit. He also worked as vp and news director at WNYW-TV and WWOR-TV in New York City, WTXF-TV in Philadelphia and WFXT-TV in Boston, and as executive producer for investigative reporting at WNYW-TV in New York and KNXV-TV in Phoenix.

TrackMan and the Confederation of Professional Golf have announced the continuation of their partnership, strengthening a shared commitment to world-class education and innovation in golf, both on, and off, the course. 

Under this renewed collaboration, TrackMan and CPG will work to identify opportunities to link professionals to off-course activity and the non-traditional golfer that is becoming more and more prevalent around the world. 

This off-course movement needs to be a key part of professionals’ and coaches’ business mix, and TrackMan’s various means for coaching and playing away from the traditional methods can provide hugely valuable and exciting opportunities for PGAs and their Members to maximise. 

TrackMan will also work closely with the CPG Learning Institute to deliver webinars, workshops, and new educational content, empowering golf professionals to harness the latest technological advancements.

In addition, TrackMan University certifications will be integrated into individual learning records, allowing graduates to showcase their achievements on the CPG’s new digital membership card. This streamlined system recognises and celebrates ongoing professional development, underscoring the crucial role of technology-driven training in modern golf coaching and performance.

“TrackMan’s dedication to delivering cutting-edge coaching tools aligns perfectly with our focus on providing tangible value and education for our Member Countries,” said CPG CEO, Ian Randell. “Together, we are ensuring that golf professionals remain at the forefront of the sport’s evolving needs with great opportunities to learn, earn and play their part in developing and future-proofing the sport.”

TrackMan’s partnership with the CPG has already laid a solid foundation for innovative education and tournament opportunities, plus has resulted in multiple national collaborative agreements with the likes of the PGA of Belgium and the PGA of Holland. Building on this success, the extended collaboration will further enhance international learning events, help golf coaches refine their skills, and ensure golf professionals can better serve players who are engaging with new and different forms of the sport on a TrackMan Range or in the simulator bay.

“Continuing our work with the CPG is a natural progression,” commented Mike Malone, VP Sales EMEA at TrackMan. “Through the TrackMan University certification and the CPG Learning Institute platform, we’re providing accessible, technology-powered development opportunities to educate golf professionals, whilst being able to emphasise the new opportunities that come from TrackMan system usage on the range, in the teaching bay, or at the simulator venue.”

As Trump cracks down on diversity and inclusion policies, studios are at a crossroads with some observers questioning how effective the benchmarks were to begin with.



		By Winston Cho, Alex Weprin 

	March 6, 2025	




	If Hollywood’s answer to Donald Trump’s first months at the White House in 2017 was resistance, the 2025 edition so far appears more muted and a tad indifferent. 


	The Academy Awards eight years ago celebrated diversity as Trump implemented his “America First” vision for the country that thrusted actors and other talent onto the frontlines of the culture wars. Warren Beatty invoked politics in his presentation of the best picture nominees, observing that those movies, of which Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight emerged as the winner, “show us the increasing diversity in our community, and our respect for diversity and freedom all over the world.”

	This time around, Trump and politics were almost entirely absent from the Oscars. The carefully-curated presentation stayed in line with other awards ceremonies keeping Washington at arm’s length from Hollywood, even as the administration cracks down on diversity initiatives hailed not too long ago as representing a much-needed step forward in getting films and TV series to more accurately reflect audiences worldwide. Trump’s campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies has rattled companies across the industry.

	In its latest filing to regulators, Disney scrubbed references to its “Reimagine Tomorrow” initiative, which launched in 2021 with the purpose of amplifying underrepresented voices, and other employee development programs. And on March 3, Walt Disney Animation Studios officially pulled the plug on its Tiana princess series after doing the same for a transgender storyline in the Pixar original animated series Win or Lose, which will introduce an openly Christian character — a first for the studio in almost 20 years. 


	Disney is not alone in retreating from DEI efforts. Amazon Studios quietly rolled back division-wide policies aimed at boosting diversity on its TV shows and films, including one that aspired to cast at least one Black, Latino, Indigenous, Middle Eastern or Asian character for speaking roles. This was followed by Paramount eliminating staffing goals tied to race, ethnicity and gender, and Warner Bros. Discovery announcing that it was opening up its talent pipeline programs to all applicants, among other decisions that include dropping the “D” and “E” in DEI. Some companies, like Apple Studios under its parent, maintain DEI but not in a potentially illegal fashion that involves hiring quotas or targets, which can be viewed as a form of discrimination. Still, adjustments are being contemplated. 

	











	If you’re a minority, these programs are one of the few possible pathways to a career in Hollywood. Showrunner Brigitte Muñoz-Liebowitz (Gordita Chronicles) emphasizes the role that then-NBC’s Writers on the Verge, which was created in 2005 to prepare scribes from diverse backgrounds for careers in TV, had on her emergence in the industry. “It’s like winning the lottery — there’s not many spots, but they can help you get your foot in the door when you have no access otherwise.”


	“I always recommend these programs to writers as a tool to break in,” says Muñoz-Liebowitz, who met Gordita Chronicles creator Claudia Forestieri, an alumna of the ABC Disney and HBOAccess writing programs, through the initiative. 


	It’s unclear how these changes will impact the makeup of Hollywood. Diversity programs that require companies to hire applicants from certain racial or ethnic groups have been legally tenuous for years, but especially since the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in a 2023 ruling that implicated race-conscious DEI initiatives in the private sector. There’s a reason why several of these policies no longer explicitly mention race, often using read-between-the-lines placeholders like “underrepresented” or “underserved” or “unique perspectives.” The studios’ responses to Trump’s war on DEI could either mean that they genuinely no longer intend to advance diversity, or it could just mean that they will continue to operate in the same way they have been but behind closed doors after making splashy announcements that DEI is dead.

	











	“These companies are still dedicated to the work, but quietly and not as loud,” says Karen Horne, former WBD senior vp of DEI, who’s the architect of several talent pipeline programs in the industry.


	One example: There are no plans to eliminate or change the Sundance Institute’s storied artist program for directors from historically excluded backgrounds, according to a person familiar with the situation. Under the initiative, filmmakers receive a $25,000 unrestricted grant, courtesy of Sundance and the Walt Disney Studios’ new Project Advancement and Completion Fund. Inaugural grantee Sean Wang was a recipient in 2023 for Dìdi, an Asian American coming-of-age story set in his Fremont, California, hometown.


	Paramount also will continue to host several programs that could be billed as DEI, according to a person familiar with the situation. These initiatives, some of which seek applicants from “diverse backgrounds” but also accept straight white men, include the ViewFinder Emerging Directors Program and Supplier Diversity Program. 


	But depending on whom you ask, DEI failed to lay out a path toward transforming Hollywood the way studios said it would after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, when protests against police brutality cornered leading entertainment companies to declare their support for diversity. The reckoning, it turned out, was short-lived. Over a 10-day stretch in 2023, four high-level DEI executives were ousted from their C-suite perches. 

	











	It’s unclear whether most Americans will even miss DEI. A YouGov poll earlier this year found 45 percent favored ending DEI in school and government, with 40 percent opposed. In the private sector, the issue likely isn’t with the intent of these programs; It’s how they were constructed. Notice how several companies use the term “goal” or “target” and not “requirement” in the discussion tying staffing to diversity (hint: reverse discrimination).


	The ability of these initiatives to withstand scrutiny (see “underrepresented” versus mentioning a specific race) made them, at best, well-intentioned but generic, and, at worst, toothless. Another example: The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2020 implemented inclusion standards requiring movies to meet specific levels of diversity, but they are so easy to meet that virtually every title ever nominated for best picture in recent decades would have been eligible. 


	The Black Lives Matter movement that rippled across Hollywood also coincided with the boom times, when studios were all too happy to throw money at showrunners in bids to grow their streaming platforms with original content. But amid industry contraction as Wall Street prioritizes profits, shows thought of as only targeting niche audiences have swiftly been axed. Now, studios are “looking for content that appeals to a wider, more general audience,” says an industry dealmaker. “A lot of people are starting to wonder why Hollywood doesn’t resonate with the rest of America.” 

	











	There’s also the perception that the DEI push may have corrupted the intended goal of implementing fair hiring practices. Since 2022, America First Legal Foundation, a conservative group founded by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, has brought federal complaints against major companies, including Starbucks, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock, arguing that corporate diversity and hiring practices run afoul of civil rights laws. Last year, it targeted allegedly discriminatory hiring quotas at Disney, specifically a provision requiring that at least half of producer and writing staff come from underrepresented group. The group reps Brian Beneker, a script coordinator for SEAL Team, in a lawsuit against CBS Studios and its parent Paramount over alleged discrimination against straight white men. He alleged that he was repeatedly denied a staff writer job after the implementation of an “illegal policy of race and sex balancing” that promoted the hiring of “less qualified applicants who were members of more preferred groups,” namely those who identify as minorities, LGBTQ or women.


	And many large companies — including media, entertainment and technology firms — are beginning to warn investors about the changing landscape.


	The corporate law firm White & Case sent an alert to its public clients in January advising them of possible changes they should consider making ahead of their annual meetings. Citing the Trump administration’s policy objectives, it advised that “companies should carefully consider their HCM [human capital management] disclosures, including on DEI programs, initiatives and any DEI metrics, in order to ensure their disclosure is updated and aligned with their companies’ current priorities and policies.” 

	











	Indeed, many companies now are doing just that.


	“There has been an increase in proposed or enacted ‘anti-ESG’ or ‘anti-DEI’ legislation, regulation, policies, enforcement priorities, directives, initiatives and legal opinions,” Paramount wrote in its latest 10-k annual report. “Conflicting regulations and requirements, and a lack of harmonization of legal and regulatory environments across the jurisdictions in which we operate, may create enhanced compliance risks and costs.” 


	Warner Bros. Discovery similarly warned of the evolving landscape in its own annual report, and the company quietly ended its quarterly “DEI Digest,” which highlighted company initiatives on DEI matters. 


	According to a March 4 report from ISS-Corporate, companies across the board are deemphasizing DEI in their proxies and annual reports. 


	“DEI-related considerations will play a smaller role relative to recent years,” ISS-Corporate writes. “These considerations include the disclosure of diversity information in proxy statements, the use of diversity metrics in executive pay, and board diversity.” 


	Perhaps no company epitomizes the fractured state of diversity rules than Pinterest, which warned shareholders in its annual report released Feb. 6: “If efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion are perceived as insufficient or overdone, we may not be able to attract and retain talent, we may be subject to investigations, litigation and other proceedings and our brand and reputation and stock price may be harmed,” the company wrote. 

	











	That is the conundrum of the current environment: Too little DEI is a risk, but so is too much DEI.  


	As Trump continues to crack down on DEI, it will be up to individual companies to gauge their tolerance for civil lawsuits and government investigations. There are no easy decisions. If the situations playing out within Paramount Global and Comcast, both of which have been targeted by government agencies, is any indication, they may opt to continue folding.


	“Unless you’re a company that is federally funded, they can’t make you do anything to stop,” Horne says. “But you have to be aware that this is a vindictive administration.”

La Cala Resort has unveiled a series of renovations and new experiences that further enhance the world-class facilities at the luxury golf and lifestyle destination located on Spain’s Costa del Sol. 

The resort, which is owned by FBD Hotels & Resorts, undertook an extensive renovation project over the winter, transforming half of its 107 rooms with a modern and stylish redesign. Guests will now enjoy more spacious rooms equipped with modern furnishings and a décor that reflects the essence of Andalusian heritage. 

Each room features balconies or terraces, air conditioning, twin or double beds, and USB sockets for charging devices. Golfers will particularly appreciate the golf bag racks in the newly designed walk-in closets.

“We’re delighted to announce that the first part of our room renovations is complete, and we are now ready to welcome guests to experience both the comfort of our updated rooms and the fantastic facilities we offer,” said Sean Corte-Real, General Manager of La Cala Resort. “With everything in place, it’s the perfect time to escape to the Costa del Sol, where guests can enjoy our three championship golf courses, which have been extensively improved over the last five years.”

Guests can now play a few holes in the Sports Lounge, located in the clubhouse, and experience the thrill of playing at famous courses like Pebble Beach or preparing for their next day’s game on the La Cala courses.

In addition to its new rooms and golf experiences, La Cala Resort continues to deliver exceptional dining options. The newly renovated La Terraza restaurant now features a large terrace area offering stunning views of the pool, a private dining area and a new buffet section for breakfast. La Terraza will serve a new Tapas & Mediterranean inspired menu to guests in the evening. 

A second addition to the dining lineup is the new Steakhouse restaurant, which has been crafted for salad and steak lovers alike. While its main feature will be steaks cooked on charcoal, the menu will also feature a selection of succulent salads based on seasonal ingredients. All this is accompanied by carefully selected beers, IPAs, and vermouths that are perfect for every taste.

				Growing the Game 

Golf Ireland and The R&A continued the countdown to Royal Portrush’s hosting of The 153rd Open later this year with the launch of ‘The Road to The Open’, an initiative designed to harness the legacy of the championship’s return to Northern Ireland.

Gordon Lyons, Northern Ireland Minister for Communities, was joined by Golf Ireland CEO Mark Kennelly, representatives from The R&A, Royal Portrush’s Championship Committee, and local schoolchildren who participated in a taster golf session.

This initiative is an integral part of Golf Ireland’s Major Events Legacy Programme, which looks to capitalise on the international spotlight when major events, like The Open and the upcoming Ryder Cup, are hosted on the island of Ireland.

As part of ‘The Road to The Open’, Golf Ireland will introduce golf taster sessions to 75 schools across Ulster, while rolling out “Unleash Your Drive”, a new six-week primary school programme in 20 schools. To ensure the sustainability of “Unleash your Drive”, the programme also includes a commitment to training 40 teachers to incorporate golf activities into the school day. The annual programme, which was developed by the Golf Foundation and The R&A, will be managed and delivered across the island by Golf Ireland staff.

Andy Leigh, Unleash Your Drive manager at The Golf Foundation, said: “We are thrilled to launch Unleash Your Drive in Ireland alongside the ‘The Road To The Open’ project and we are looking forward to seeing many children being exposed to golf going on to play more as a result of the programme in schools and subsequent opportunities that follow.

“With The Open arriving in a few months, it’s brilliant to be working so closely together to maximise our reach. The Unleash Your Drive in Schools programme perfectly complements the Golf Ireland strategy by introducing more children and young people to the sport of golf. 

“Schools get adapted equipment, training and lesson plans to teach the programme’s nine mental toughness tools and help children to navigate setbacks, challenges, and adversity, which has a direct positive impact on their overall wellbeing. 

“The impact of these tools can be measured through a self-assessment, indicating that the mental toughness tools are being learned and understood during golf lessons at school and can be applied as life skills in everyday situations.” 

Golf Ireland and The R&A will also take the iconic Claret Jug on a tour of clubs and communities across the island, in the lead-up to the event. Each stop will give members an opportunity to see the most famous trophy in golf, to build on the excitement around The Open. Clubs are encouraged to make the most of the visit by hosting their own unique events, bringing members together for a memorable experience celebrating one of golf’s greatest traditions.

On the club side, Golf Ireland will launch GolfNines throughout Ulster and connect the established GolfSixes format to The Open, with girls attending Girls Festivals and Girls’ golf programmes invited to watch The Open live. At the community level, a new team of golf instructors will be equipped to bring the excitement of The Open to local initiatives, offering both ‘Chip & Chat’ groups and those involved in Golf4All activities the chance to attend the tournament.

Activities will begin shortly, with an emphasis on community-based events and school engagement in the Causeway Coast and Glens region. This follows on from Golf Ireland’s commitment to reach over 500 schools, train 1,000 new coaches and volunteers, and introduce 200,000 participants to golf over a five-year period.

“We are committed to building upon the excitement generated by The Open’s return to Royal Portrush, to strengthen grassroots golf on the island,” said Golf Ireland CEO, Mark Kennelly. “From schools to the general public, this will enable more people to play the sport and enjoy its benefits. Our goal is to make golf an option for everyone, whether they’re playing for the first time or returning to the game after many years.

“This initiative is a testament to the collaboration and support we’ve received from both governments. By creating these pathways into the sport, across schools, communities, and local clubs, we hope to leave a lasting legacy that goes beyond The Open.”

As the organisers of The Open, The R&A plays a vital role in developing the sport globally and see Northern Ireland as a focal point for future development, especially with the renewed interest created by The Open.

“The Open is one of the world’s major sporting events followed by millions of fans each year and the excitement being generated by the Championship’s return to Royal Portrush this summer will hopefully inspire people of all ages to try golf and take up the sport through the opportunities being provided through ‘The Road to The Open’ initiative,”  said Kevin Barker, Director of Golf Development at The R&A.

“While the staging of The Open will provide a significant economic impact to Northern Ireland, we also want to ensure that a lasting legacy is provided to local communities in the form of the many social and health and wellbeing benefits that playing golf can offer.”

Hosting The Open is a massive undertaking for Royal Portrush while on the back of Shane Lowry’s memorable win in 2019, the Championship Committee is looking to ensure the Championship’s legacy benefits the entire region.

Ian Kerr, chairman of the Open Championship committee at Royal Portrush said the club was delighted to embrace this new Golf Ireland initiative.

“We already invest heavily in the development of junior golf. Gary McNeill, his assistant head professional Charlene Reid as well as Alan Dunbar, head of golf operations, head up a number of coaching schemes.  Up to 30 cadets can be found on the practice range every Saturday morning, and there are regular visits to neighbouring primary schools in our efforts to encourage children to take up the game,” said Kerr. “One local pupil had his first lesson in the immediate aftermath of the Open at Royal Portrush in 2019, and within four years was playing off scratch. That is why initiatives like this one are so important.”

La Cala Resort has unveiled a series of renovations and new experiences that further enhance the world-class facilities at the luxury golf and lifestyle destination located on Spain's Costa del Sol.

Founder and CEO of American Majority Ned Ryun discusses President Donald Trump placing a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’

The recent announcement by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to pour another $100 billion into the United States will have a direct impact on Arizona, but the debate on the future of the semiconductor industry persists after President Donald Trump's address on Tuesday night.

Rep. Abe Hamadeh, R-Ariz., said that Trump’s influence played a critical role in the company building on their existing investment in the Grand Canyon State, as the announcement happened at the White House earlier this week.

""He knows how to make deals and having foreign companies come in the United States. That's the best of all worlds because they're abandoning the policies over there to come to United States to benefit from our lower regulation, our less taxes,"" the congressman, whose district houses the TSMC facility, said in an interview with Fox News Digital on Monday, prior to Trump's speech.

TRUMP CALLS FOR END TO CHIPS ACT IN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS

""It’s gonna be great. And for my constituents, again, we're pushing hard to make sure that they focus on hiring Americans and veterans,"" he added. Hamadeh's staff met with TSMC last month, according to a news release.

The announcement comes as the president calls for the repeal of the CHIPS and Science Act, a bill that provided direct financial incentives to grow the semiconductor industry supply chain.

""Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn’t mean a thing. They take our money and they don’t spend it,"" Trump said on Tuesday night.

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM TRUMP'S ADDRESS TO JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS

The debate about the semiconductor industry's success with the act largely centers around whether companies are coming to the U.S. because of a preferable business environment or because of grant and loan deals.

The legislation, which passed with some bipartisan support in 2022, came under direct scrutiny last year as Intel had major layoffs despite being cleared for $8.5 billion in federal funding.

""The CHIPS Act is what helped get TSMC to the US and Arizona. And it brought their $100 billion announcement that came earlier this week—at the White House. Getting rid of the CHIPS Act would hurt the entire American microchip industry, including suppliers, American companies, and more,"" Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., posted to X on Tuesday night, as the repeal effort was mentioned in Trump’s Joint Address to Congress.

""Plus, it unravels the years of bipartisan work it took to bring these investments to Arizona. We can't let politics get in the way of that,"" the senator added.

When it comes to TSMC in particular, the effort to woo the large chip producer was well underway during the first Trump administration – before the act became law under former President Joe Biden, but the company did enter preliminary agreements for financial incentives under the program.

""It was actually President Trump, Ric Grinnell, Wilbur Ross, that brought [TSMC] into the United States,"" Hamadeh said.

The freshman Republican lawmaker added that the president’s tariff policies, which include Mexico and Canada, will help boost American manufacturing.

""I think tariffs is excellent, because you're already seeing the results of it so quickly. These companies, they understand they could hire Americans, they could manufacture in America. Right now, there's just an incentive for them not to,"" he said. ""And now what President Trump has removed that incentive by a lot, by imposing these tariffs. So clearly his policies are working.""

The bulk of the semiconductor industry rests in Taiwan, which has raised national security concerns given the high tensions between China and the U.S. Chips play a critical role in operating everyday technology, including consumer electronics like phones and computers.

The British production outfit is the latest addition to Mediawan's growing empire, which also includes Brad Pitt's Plan B and German mini-major Leonine. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	European production-distribution group Mediawan has acquired a majority stake in British-Australian production company See-Saw Films, the Oscar-winning studio behind The King’s Speech and The Power of the Dog and such TV series as AppleTV+’s Slow Horses and Netflix’s Heartstopper. 


	Founded in 2008 by Iain Canning and Emile Sherman, See-Saw Films is one of the most prestigious outfits on the market, with an awards track record that includes 5 Oscars,  awards track record, including 5 Oscars, 13 Emmys, and 15 BAFTAs.




	The deal continues Mediawan’s buying spree, which has seen the French outfit do a series of headline-making deals, including taking majority ownership of Brad Pitt’s Plan B in 2022, partnering with LeBron James’ The SpringHill Company last September, and purchasing German mini-major Leonine. Mediawan already has a major presence in the U.K. market with a portfolio that includes production groups Drama Republic, Misfits Entertainment, and animation outfit Wildseed Studios. But See-Saw is the company’s first British operation with a major profile in feature films.

	In a statement, Mediawan said the acquisition reinforced the company’s continued global expansion, and its ambition “to cultivate rich and diverse talent and premium productions across all genres and formats. By strengthening its international presence, Mediawan will continue to create powerful stories, build iconic content and establish renowned franchises for all audiences worldwide.”


	Canning and Sherman will stay on as joint CEOs of See-Saw, working with joint managing directors Helen Gregory and Simon Gillis, and Australian head of TV and film Liz Watts. 


	Similar to the Plan B deal, the See-Saw buyout is a cash-and-shares agreement which will see Canning and Sherman become shareholders in See-Saw’s new French parent. Financial details were not disclosed. 


	“We are delighted to welcome See-Saw Films to the Mediawan family,” said Pierre-Antoine Capton, Co-founder and CEO of The Mediawan Group and Elisabeth d’Arvieu, CEO of Mediawan Pictures, in a joint statement. “Under Iain and Emile’s leadership, See-Saw has become one of the most prestigious, innovative, and critically acclaimed production companies. Through this new partnership, Mediawan reinforces its commitment to bringing together the finest talent behind exceptional and impactful content while providing an even more compelling platform for top creative talent worldwide.”

	











	“As we celebrate See-Saw’s 18th year, we are thrilled to be entering into this partnership with Mediawan, the extraordinary global powerhouse that Pierre-Antoine and his team have created,” Canning and Sherman added. “This union reflects a shared vision for growth, creative excellence and independence. It will enable us to take our ambitions to new heights and provide us with greater resources for our team and the exceptional talent we work with, as we continue to bring bold, impactful stories to global audiences.”


	Mediawan was launched in 2015 by producer Capton with tech billionaire Xavier Niel and financier Matthieu Pigasse. The company now encompasses more than 80 production labels worldwide.


	See-Saw Films was advised on the transaction by media specialists ACF Investment Bank, which had been engaged in November 2024 to explore investment or sale opportunities.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Wisconsin BBB scam alert; fake 'going out of business' sale,https://www.fox6now.com/news/wisconsin-bbb-scam-alert-fake-going-out-business-sale,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:02:45 GMT","



MILWAUKEE - Wisconsin Better Business Bureau (BBB) says with the news that retailer JOANN Fabrics declared bankruptcy and announced the closure of all physical store locations, scammers are wasting no time setting up fake going out of business and liquidation websites.

What we know:

A news release from BBB says you see an online ad on social media for a JOANN ""going-out-of-business"" sale. You click on the ad, which takes you to a website that looks quite identical to the real JOANN website with the company’s real logo and images. There, you see that their merchandise is extremely discounted to 80-90% off. The products being sold are products that you are familiar with purchasing at JOANN, so the sale seems legitimate. As you start to add items to your cart, you may also be offered an additional promotional discount that brings prices down even more.

If you look more closely, you will notice that the website’s URL is not for the real JOANN website. Instead, you’re on a fake website created by a scammer who is trying to steal your personal or financial information.

Always confirm the website’s URL. Scammers love to build fake websites that look like the real thing. These fake websites can be very convincing, so take extra steps to confirm what website you are on. Often, the URL is either off by only a letter or two or it may add extra words that still look convincing. JOANN’s official website is joann.com.

Instead of clicking on ad links, go directly to the official website. In addition to fake websites, scammers can create fake social media ads. Instead of clicking on ads for extremely discounted products, go to your web browser and visit the store’s official website on your own.

Be wary of deals that sound too good to be true. These liquidation scams play on people’s desire to get a good deal. Even for a liquidation sale, if the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Verify the source and the deal before making a purchase online.

Use your credit card for online purchases. Credit cards offer additional fraud protection that debit cards don’t. If you accidentally purchase something from a fake website, your credit card company may allow you to contest the charge and get your money back.

Be careful with what information is being asked of you. If you’re checking out when shopping online and are suddenly asked for additional personal information like your Social Security number, take that as a red flag for a scam.

What you can do:

If you've been the victim of an online shopping scam, share your experience at BBB Scam Tracker. Your report helps protect other consumers from falling victim to similar scams.

			9.52am 6th March 2025	 -
				Sponsorship & Events 

Callaway Golf has announced a new equipment partnership with Jon Rahm and his LIV Golf team, Legion XIII.

Rahm initially joined Callaway in 2021 and has earned both of his major championship wins – the 2021 US Open and The Masters at Augusta in 2023 – while playing their equipment.

For the 2025 season, the current setup in Rahm’s bag includes the all-new Callaway Elyte Triple Diamond driver, Callaway Apex TCB irons, the Callaway Chrome Tour X ball, and an Odyssey Ai-One putter.





“We are happy to partner with a world-class athlete in Jon Rahm, and his Legion XIII team,” said Chip Brewer, President and CEO of Topgolf Callaway Golf Brands. “We’re committed to being an equipment leader wherever top players are competing. Now the time is right to cement our relationship with Jon and his team – utilising his exceptional talent and stature within the game to help engage and excite fans around the globe.”

“I’m so happy to enhance this incredible relationship with Callaway and also extend it with Legion XIII,” Rahm said. “I’ve played the best golf of my career with their equipment over the past four years, and they continue to set the bar higher with every new product line. I know this partnership will have a tremendously positive impact for me and my teammates.”

The terms of the deal and what it means in terms of team branding have not been revealed. Rahm has been playing LIV events this year with the Callaway logo on the front on his hat, although last year his hat featured the pink Legion XIII logo. Rahm’s teammate for the last year, Caleb Surratt, also plays Callaway, as does Tom McKibbin, who joined Legion XIII at the start of this season. The fourth team member, Tyrrell Hatton, is a Ping player, although he has been wearing at Legion III branded cap.

La Cala Resort has unveiled a series of renovations and new experiences that further enhance the world-class facilities at the luxury golf and lifestyle destination located on Spain's Costa del Sol. 

Terre Blanche Hotel Spa Golf Resort has announced a three-year partnership with Lacoste that will see the globally renowned sports fashion brand become the Provence-based resort's official apparel partner.

TrackMan and the Confederation of Professional Golf have announced the continuation of their partnership, strengthening a shared commitment to world-class education and innovation in golf, both on, and off, the course.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Here's the whopping amount of stock Palantir CEO Alex Karp has dumped,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-the-whopping-amount-of-stock-palantir-ceo-alex-karp-has-dumped-142212250.html,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 14:22:12 GMT","

If outspoken Palantir (PLTR) co-founder and CEO Alex Karp is uber-bullish about his secretive software company, he isn't showing it in his trades.

Karp has dumped $45 million worth of stock in the past two weeks after unloading about $2 billion in 2024, new research from Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reveals. Karp has sold 21% of his overall stake in Palantir.

The latest sale barrage comes after Karp recently adopted a 10b5-1 trading plan for the maximum sale of 9.975 million shares of Class A common stock. The trading arrangement will last until Sept. 12, 2025.

A plan of this kind allows insiders of public companies to set up a schedule to sell their shares over a period of time.

Other Palantir insiders have also been aggressively selling stock, according to Yahoo Finance data.

The flurry of sales has sent a negative signal to the retail investor community that has long propped up the momentum stock.

Shares have crashed 30% from their 52-week closing high on Feb. 18.

""Among the top retail-traded stocks, Palantir could be the most vulnerable to a loss of retail momentum. If I were to pick a single name that could be most at risk of an unwind, PLTR would be it,"" Vanda Research senior vice president Marco Iachini said.

The Palantir sell-off also reflects several factors.

The Department of Defense is reportedly eyeing an 8% annual cut in spending for the next five years. This is a potential blow to Palantir, which relies heavily on government contracts. The stock's surge up to its mid-February record highs had been driven, in part, by expectations that the Trump administration would ramp up defense spending.

""As Palantir has heavy exposure to US government spending/budgets there have been recent Street concerns that this spending backdrop will be a headwind to this tech stalwarts' growth profile in 2025 and beyond,"" said Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.

Palantir further raised fresh red flags in its annual report.

The company's headcount grew by just 5% in 2024 after declining 3% in 2023. Over the past two years, the company has added only 98 employees, Jefferies' Thill estimates.

Second, the company's chief accounting officer, Heather Planishek, stepped down on Feb. 24. The company's CFO, David Glazer, has assumed her responsibilities on an interim basis.

And third, Palantir continues to overly rely on its biggest customers for business — its top three customers accounted for 17% of revenue in 2024.

""Our concerns about the runway for growth and product differentiation remain,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote in a client note. ""We continue to see the risk-reward skewing unfavorable with shares trading at a premium multiple.""

Propper Daley will transition to the BPI brand immediately, and its team of 25 will integrate into BPI's U.S. organizational structure. Propper Daley’s entertainment philanthropy practice will continue to operate.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Greg Propper‘s Propper Daley has been acquired by strategic communications and public affairs firm Bully Pulpit International. 


	Propper Daley will transition to the BPI brand immediately, and 25 staffers will integrate into BPI’s U.S. organizational structure. Propper Daley’s noted entertainment philanthropy practice, however, will continue to operate as Propper Daley BPI, and the division joins recent acquisitions BOLDT BPI, Message House BPI, and Seven Hills BPI as part of the umbrella group. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

	Propper Daley — a culture-first social impact agency that collaborates with brands, philanthropies, advocacy organizations and individuals to drive change — has roots in Los Angeles and Miami, leading BPI to expand in those key markets. BPI’s transatlantic team includes over 350 communications, creative, measurement and media professionals across six countries and 14 offices.


	“An effective campaign combines the best of communications and marketing with the power of influence, partnerships, and creators of culture, which is exactly what Propper Daley brings to the table. We’re thrilled to welcome them to the team,” said BPI president Andrew Bleeker in a statement.

	Propper, president of the firm, which was founded in 2012, added: “Creating real change in today’s complex world requires blending strategic rigor with creative and cultural influence, the right brain with the left. Yet, the solutions often remain too siloed. With BPI, we’re excited to be able to offer an approach that combines all of those pieces into seamless, measurable offerings that reflect how change actually happens.”


	In interviews, Propper and Bleeker said the deal makes sense for both sides, especially at this moment in time amid dramatic shifts in culture, politics, media, modern public affairs and beyond. BPI’s specialties, which include in-house measurement, creative and paid media, will enable Propper Daley to scale its strategy and programs while BPI’s work will be enhanced by Propper Daley’s culture-driven strategies, partnerships and network of bold-faced names, influencers and change agents.

	











	Propper Daley’s select client list has included Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton’s The Clinton Foundation, the Call of Duty Endowment, Viacom, the Shawn Mendes Foundation, Everytown for Gun Safety, Planned Parenthood, Conservation Lands Foundation, Interscope, Camila Cabello, Cardi B, Chrissy Teigen, Biden for President, John Legend, SoulCycle, The Walt Disney Company, Youth Villages, Bradley Cooper, Babylist, Steven Tyler’s Janie’s Fund and many more.


	“Our space is very similar to Greg’s, from a different lens,” Bleeker explained, noting that his firm hails from the trenches of politics and public policy. “We’ve known of Greg and his team for a long time and gotten to collaboration here and there. We love what they’re doing and we want them to have tools to do more. We’re also eager to bring their skill set and cultural influence to our clients.”


	Bleeker added that the acquisition will help Bully Pulpit offer clients a streamlined team and integrated campaigns. “Clients don’t want to manage eight different agencies in order to run an effective campaign. … This will allow us to move with speed. We’re trying to build a one-stop campaign team.”


	And a team that’s built with experts across all the fields that matter, from politics and policy to culture and influence. “There’s one thing that’s super clear and that is change. Traditional politics is broken. The traditional media ecosystem is broken. We won’t get anywhere with relying on the same tactics. Everyone is coming to that conclusion from different vantage points, and the solution is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater but to combine the best of traditional marketing, campaigns and communications strategies with where the culture is going.”

	











	Propper agreed. “Culture is changing so fast,” he said. “Culture, by definition, is the lever that shifts attitudes and behaviors most effectively. Whether it’s a foundation or a brand, you can have the best strategy in the world and put out the best press releases, and put on great programs and events, but if you can’t sift attitudes or behaviors, things don’t stick.”


	Propper said his staff has been “heads down doing the work” for 13 years, and given what’s happening in the world, their work can continue to meet the moment, “but it’s hard to fully scale when you’re a small agency. We want to do more.” The acquisition by BPI gives them that chance, and it proved to be the perfect match of a partner. “We talked to other folks in the past,” he said. “They feel like we are doing something that they don’t currently do that can be additive to their work. We can continue to serve our clients in the way that we do and sprinkle our work into theirs while leveraging their expertise and tools for our clients. It’s a chance to combine their superpowers and offer that in a really integrated way.”


	One thing that won’t change? Propper Daley’s invite-only A Day of Unreasonable Conversation will stay on the schedule as an annual gathering of thought leaders and entertainment industry insiders.

Swedish Pantry owners Josh and Brittany Hoogerhyde hand out eggs to representatives of local businesses while Todd Beauchamp of Michigan Broadband Services (MBS) passes out business cards. The event — and the eggs — were funded by MBS.

ESCANABA — On Wednesday, downtown businesses were invited to attend a breakfast at Swedish Pantry. The get-together was sponsored by Michigan Broadband Services (MBS) and organized in coordination with the Downtown Development Authority (DDA).

The event served to introduce neighbors in the Escanaba DDA district – which includes both sides of Ludington Street from Lincoln Road to the waterfront — to one another and particularly to the new owners of the Swedish Pantry, Josh and Brittany Hoogerhyde.

“There’s no meeting,” said MBS sales rep Todd Beauchamp to the table of 12 after greeting people as they arrived. The broadband company footed the bill, “just so people can have a nice breakfast. …We just want everyone to know who everybody is, because downtown has a lot of resources that are collected,” Beauchamp said.

Before serving Swedish pancakes to the guests, Josh and Brittany met and thanked the attendees.

“It’s really great to … have a chance to meet all of our neighbors,” Josh said. “We’re planning on carrying on the tradition that’s been in this town for almost 50 years. We’re gonna continue the same food and great service and neat atmosphere … It’s kind of unique and whimsical, and people seem to enjoy it. We’re looking forward to hopefully creating meaningful relationships with you guys.”

They’re likely to have more opportunities to do so; this social breakfast was the first of a series of events that MBS and the DDA would like to organize once a month as part of a program called “Welcome to the Downtown.”

MBS serves a number of clients in downtown Escanaba and is aiming to make connections with other potential customers, both commercial and residential. 

An additional feature of Wednesday’s breakfast was the distribution of cartons of eggs. Each guest was given a dozen eggs, and one carton contained a “golden” egg – it was brown – that earned the recipient a prize. Kim Rabitoy from Escanaba Radio Group found the special egg, which led her to walking away with a $50 gift certificate to Swedish Pantry.

etc.venues Monument - 24 March, 2025

Marina Bay Sands Singapore, 16 - 17 April, 2025

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has today cleared American Express Global Business Travel's $570 million acquisition of CWT, however the merger stills faces a regulatory hurdle in the US following an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ).

News • analysis • podcasts • reports

I accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.

A statement issued by the CMA said: ""The group has concluded that CWT is a significantly weaker competitor
 than in the past and is likely to continue to weaken in the future and 
that there are other suppliers who will offer customers an alternative 
to the merged business.""

It continued: ""The group is therefore satisfied that the merger is not expected to 
result in a substantial lessening of competition in the global market 
for the supply of business travel agency services and has cleared the 
deal.""

Martin Coleman, chair of the independent panel of experts conducting this investigation, said: ""Having reviewed all the evidence thoroughly over
 the course of our investigation we have concluded, given the weaker 
position CWT plays in the corporate travel market and the alternatives 
available, that this deal should be allowed to proceed.In a summary of its final report released on Thursday (6 March), the CMA cited CWT’s “continuing financial difficulties” and that “its financial position is unlikely to improve and it potentially faces a trajectory of continuing to lose more business than it will gain"".It continued: ""Our bidding analysis has confirmed that BCD and GBT are the two strongest competitors in the market, by far, and both are substantially stronger than CWT.” BTN Europe also examined CWT's weakening position following the protracted inquiries.

In addition to “strong competition” from BCD, the CMA said Amex GBT and CWT ""currently face a material competitive constraint from FCM and face an increasing constraint from CTM and Navan as they continue to grow"".Amex GBT welcomed the CMA decision. In a statement on Thursday the TMC's chief legal officer and global head of M&A, Eric J. Bock, said the development “further reinforces our belief that the lawsuit initiated by the US Department of Justice is fundamentally flawed, taking a narrow and outdated view of competition, and disregarding the emergence of numerous significant competitors in business travel.

“We stand by the benefits of combining with CWT and are confident in the merits of our legal position. We are prepared to prove this in court if required,” he said.The planned deal was first revealed in March last year, with the CMA announcing an investigation into the acquisition in June. In the summer, it identified competition concerns and said the merger could lead to customers paying higher prices, before escalating its investigation.



Amex GBT and CWT challenged the CMA's findings throughout its investigation, proposed remedies to allay its concerns, and criticised its processes and the ""backward-looking"" nature of its approach.

In January, the US DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger of the two TMCs, with a trial confirmed for September. In February, the UK's CMA issued an updated interim report in which it reversed its initial proposal to block the deal, pointing to CWT's weakening position and an assessment of extensive TMC bidding data and business wins.• See also: Making headlines – the Amex GBT-CWT mega-mergerThe timeline of American Express Global Business Travel’s proposed acquisition of CWT, as reported by BTN Europe

CEDARBURG — Ozaukee County’s Lasata community-based residential facility project has received more approvals from the city of Cedarburg, taking it a step closer to possibly breaking ground in May.

The Cedarburg Plan Commission approved a conditional use permit in January with conditions, one of which included returning to the commission for approval of a revised architectural design.

Commissioner Adam Voltz, who is also one of the architectural representatives on the commission, said the original design with a flat roof and a certain window pattern didn’t feel compatible with the rest of the surrounding buildings.

""I think what you see now is much more fitting for the context,"" he said.

The proposed CBRF would house 21 residents and include residential and services spaces, according to a memo from Dimension IV Madison Design Group. The new building will be located adjacent to the existing residential care apartment complex building at Lasata and connected with a passageway.

Most of the 21 units will accommodate a single individual, but there will also be a limited number that can accommodate couples.

The county’s intent behind building the approximately 16,000-square-foot community-based residential facility has been to provide a full continuum of care to the seniors living on the Lasata Campus. Services offered in a CBRF include room and board, supervision and support services.

The Lasata Campus currently includes the Lasata Heights apartments, Lasata Crossing assisted living facility and the Lasata Care Center skilled care nursing facility.

			3.21pm 6th March 2025	 -
				Property 

Mill Ride Golf Club in Berkshire, which was forfeited by a jailed Azerbaijan banker’s wife following a six-year fraud investigation by the UK government, has been put up for sale for a guide price of £4.25 million.

Zamira Hajiyeva agreed to give up the Ascot-based club and a Knightsbridge home which has been valued at £14.75 million, after a National Crime Agency fraud investigation resulted in the UK’s first unexplained wealth order. A trustee was appointed by the High Court to sell the assets last autumn, with both properties coming on to the market in recent days. 

Mrs Hajiyeva’s husband, Jahangir, was the chairman of the state-controlled International Bank of Azerbaijan from 2001 to 2015 and is serving a 16-year jail sentence for fraud and embezzlement.

The NCA said last year it believed the golf course and house were obtained as a direct result of ‘large-scale fraud and embezzlement, false accounting and money laundering’. It said it had found ‘no reasonable explanation’ for the source of funds used to buy both properties.

An NCA spokesperson said 70% of the proceeds from the sale of the golf club and the London property will be kept by the government, with the remaining 30% returned to Mrs Hajiyeva.

Mill Ride GC, which first opened in 1990 and boasts a 6,821-yard, 18-hole championship course designed by Donald Steel, has continued to operate normally throughout the investigation. 

Details regarding the sale of the club, which is being handled by Savills, can be found here. 

La Cala Resort has unveiled a series of renovations and new experiences that further enhance the world-class facilities at the luxury golf and lifestyle destination located on Spain's Costa del Sol.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Donald Trump’s tariffs are unlikely to endure — here’s why,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/donald-trump-tariffs-impact-india-9871731/,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 08:56:30 GMT","

The US imposed 25 per cent tariffs on both Canada and Mexico on Tuesday, as well as an additional 10 per cent tariff on China. Beijing was slapped with an initial 10 per cent tariff last month, while both Canada and Mexico were able to successfully negotiate for a one-month delay. But if economic logic is to prevail, the Trump administration will have to roll back at least some of these tariffs. Just a question of time. Here’s why:

The structural issues with the American economy

The US economy relies heavily on trade, and that’s part of its structural construct in the post World War-II era. This is because the American economy consumes more goods than it produces domestically. As a result, its imports are almost always higher than its exports, resulting in a trade deficit where it imports more than it exports.

Why is that so? When a country consumes more goods than it produces domestically at full employment, it needs to source the additional goods from other countries through imports. And that is resulting in a high trade deficit – the gap between what it buys from other countries and what sells to them.

This trade deficit is a point of contention for Trump, which he’s used as the trigger for the imposition of tariffs on countries around the world. But what this simplistic assumption glosses over is the fact that till the time America consumes more than it produces, it will have a deficit with a lot of countries. This is also triggered by the fact that the labour costs in America are high, and so it does not merit economic logic for US workers to be producing this efficiently in the country, like say garments or consumer durables. So, other countries that have relative efficiencies in these sectors, primarily due to labour or raw material advantages, are more effective at producing these goods and shipping them to the US.

The evolving labour productivity issue, and a shift of comparative advantage to developing nations explain the loss in manufacturing jobs in the US, and tariffs are unlikely to fix that fundamental issue. Plus, the role of the US dollar as an international reserve currency — another enduring post-war reality — has actually helped America finance domestic consumption of imported goods. The US, in that aspect, has a comparative advantage that no other countries have. And other nations would also be well within their rights in looking at this currency advantage enjoyed by the US as a discriminatory trend, just as Trump eyes the trade deficit as a discrimination “suffered” by the US. Also, the pretext used by Trump — fentanyl inflows — is also specious, especially when it comes to Canada, given that America’s northern neighbour accounts for less than 2 per cent of all fentanyl inflows into the US.

Mostly personal, not much economic logic here

For a man who is generally fickle with his views, tariffs are an issue where Trump’s been uncharacteristically consistent. In 1987, long before he voiced any intention to run for public office, Trump took out a full-page newspaper ad warning that Japan was “taking advantage” of the US, while pointing to the massive trade deficit between the two countries. Like most things with Trump, this was essentially a personal issue, which likely stemmed from the fact that the real estate developer had, just a few days prior to these ads, lost out on a bid for a grand piano in New York to the representative of a Japanese trading house. His views on tariffs have endured through these years, even though there is very little economic logic to the imposition of large-scale tariffs by a country like America.

Mis-selling tariffs

Trump has consistently insisted that tariffs are paid for by foreign countries. This hardsell, has resonated within his base, but is blatantly false. It is, in fact, US importers — American companies or representatives of foreign companies in the US — that end up paying tariffs when these goods come in, and this money goes to the American Treasury. These companies, in turn, generally pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher retail prices. That is one reason why tariffs fell out of favour as global trade grew after World War II and economists maintain that consumers end up footing the tariffs bill. Yes, tariffs can impact foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad, but there is collateral damage on both sides.

For instance, Canada and Mexico have announced retaliatory tariffs against American imports. That would matter to Washington, since Canada is its single biggest market, bigger than the European Union, the UK and China put together.

The European Union has also hit back against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing US products, from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. China has imposed tariffs on American goods, including soybeans and pork to dent Trump’s agri support base.

A study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, the University of Zurich and the World Bank concluded that Trump’s tariffs in his last term neither raised or lowered US employment. Despite Trump’s 2018 taxes on imported steel, for instance, the number of jobs at American steel plants was barely impacted. On the other hand, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on US goods had “negative employment impacts,’’ especially for farmers, the study found. These retaliatory tariffs were only partly offset by government aid that Trump was forced to dole out to farmers, partly funded by the incremental revenues raised by the tariffs.

The auto, agri blowback

US tariffs, and the retaliatory duties that they’ve triggered, would upend two crucial segments of Trump’s voter base. Auto workers and farmers.

Over the last quarter of a century, the American cars industry has worked with policymakers to create an integrated supply chain with Canada and Mexico. Some parts of a car sold in the US are made in Canada, others in Mexico, and quite a lot are made in the US. A typical pickup truck made by the big three US auto majors – GM, Ford and Chrysler – moves back and forth across borders because of this integrated supply chain – sometimes up to seven times across the three borders. Now, with higher tariffs, each time an auto part moves, it will get tariffed. The price for an F-150 pickup truck, according to industry estimates, could go up from $10,000-$12,000 for a car that retails at around $45,000-$70,000. So, now, while the North American car industry will be at a disadvantage, those who benefit could include the German car industry, the Korean car industry or the Japanese car industry, because those cars come into America tariff free, at least till now.

What’s even more contradictory is the fact that it was Trump who replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement trade deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico with the new USMCA deal during his first term in 2018-19. Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Canada and Mexico now flagrantly violate his own USMCA, and highlight his disregard for negotiated trade agreements. Why should any other country get into a tariff deal with Washington when the US president himself does not adhere to a deal he himself signed. That’s a question being asked across many capitals, including New Delhi.

Also, China and the EU have been targeting American farm goods with higher tariffs, in surgical fashion. That would be particularly discomforting for Washington, going forward.

Broader macroeconomic impact

The radical economic outlook presented by Donald Trump prior to the elections includes plans to impose a 20 per cent tariff on all imports and more than 200 per cent duty on cars; a proposal to deport millions of irregular immigrants; and to extend tax cuts at a time when the US budget deficit is at record high. Trump, however, realises that he came to power on account of unrest among a section of American consumers about high inflation and their standard of living not having gone up as per expectations. His tariff war could only fuel this fire. In quantum terms, a 10-20 per cent tariff is really high for a country that has a weighted average tariff of only about 2.2 per cent.

Higher tariffs and a trade war would most certainly lead to higher inflation in the US. This, combined with runaway deficits and a possible dilution of institutional autonomy could lead to foreigners beginning to rethink whether they should lend unlimited money to the US Treasury — which has been a given thus far — analysts say. Such a shift could mark a possible watershed moment — of the scale, perhaps, of the decision in early 2022 to freeze Russian foreign assets, which forced central banks around the world, including RBI, to buy physical gold rather than derivatives or exchange-traded funds that track the yellow metal’s price. The US Federal Reserve’s decision to continue its rate-cut cycle depended strongly on the result of the presidential election — and experts believe that the full scale of the cycle may now be at risk. While Trump’s promised tax cuts and tariff barriers could end up stimulating the American economy, at least in the short term, analysts predict they could eventually stoke inflation — and likely force the Fed to end its rate-cutting cycle sooner.

That could have implications for the monetary easing plans of other countries, including India.

	High-resolution images offer a glimpse at what might lie within the gas giant’s most fiery moon

Jupiter’s moon Io, seen here in a photo from the Galileo spacecraft, is the most volcanically active body in the solar system.

By Katherine Kornei

4 hours ago

Jupiter’s moon Io, the most volcanically active body in the solar system, is littered with hundreds of erupting volcanoes. High-resolution images now reveal several dozen lava lakes, researchers report in the February Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. These lakes are far larger than their analogs on Earth, and their structure sheds light on how magma moves beneath the surface of Io. 

Io’s volcanism — probably present over the moon’s entire 4.6-billion-year existence — was discovered when the Voyager spacecraft flew by in 1979. The volcanic activity is caused by the intense gravitational pulls of Jupiter and nearby moons, which deform Io by tens of meters. “This squeezing is heating the body,” says Alessandro Mura, a planetary scientist at Italy’s National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome.

Using infrared images from NASA’s Juno spacecraft, which has orbited Jupiter since 2016, Mura’s team pinpointed more than 40 lava lakes ranging in diameter from about 10 to 100 kilometers. That’s much larger than the lava lakes found on Earth, which tend to measure tens to hundreds of meters across.  

Volcanic activity and lava flows are known to be more extreme on other worlds, says Einat Lev, a volcanologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., who was not involved in the research. “A lot of planetary flows are much bigger” than Earth’s, she says.

Previous studies have reported lava lakes on Io but with only limited detail, Mura and colleagues note. The researchers found that most of the newly analyzed lava lakes are hottest at their perimeters. This suggests that these lakes are largely capped by a cooler crust of solidified lava.

That idea makes sense given the conditions on Io, says Alfred McEwen, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who was not involved in the research. “It’s very, very cold. A crust starts forming immediately.”

Molten lava remains exposed at the lake edges probably because of how the lakes interact with their surroundings, Mura and his colleagues propose. Io’s lava lakes sit within caldera-like features with steep or even vertical walls, so as a lake fills or drains, its outer crust scrapes against those walls, breaking up the crust there and exposing fresh lava.

The findings also shed light on how magma moves beneath Io’s surface and feeds these lakes. None of the analyzed lakes had a hot spot in the middle, Mura notes, suggesting that magma doesn’t simply upwell at a lake’s center. 

He and his team hope to understand whether multiple lava lakes are fed by a common magma reservoir. In that case, different lakes might change in size in lockstep. Such observations could help reveal details about the plumbing that powers Io’s volcanism, Mura says. “These can be a glimpse beneath the surface of Io.”

	Owners of high-risk dogs should be careful about how they manage their pet’s food

Labradors with a higher genetic risk for obesity are more likely to seek out food, a new study finds.

University of Cambridge

By Alex Viveros

13 minutes ago

Labrador retriever owners are likely familiar with how persistent their dogs can be in their quest for food, whether begging under the dinner table or stealing a snack left unattended. It’s no surprise, then, that Labs are among the most overweight dog breeds, along with golden retrievers, cocker spaniels and beagles.

Scientists have now identified multiple genes associated with obesity in Labradors, according to a March 6 study in Science.

The researchers had previously found that a form of a gene called POMC made Labs more prone to overeating. But “we could tell from our studies that the POMC mutation wasn’t the whole story,” says Eleanor Raffan, a veterinary surgeon and geneticist at the University of Cambridge.

In the new study, Raffan and her colleagues examined DNA samples from 241 British Labrador retrievers. The researchers also collected information including the dogs’ body fat mass, how much dogs begged for food, and how strictly their owners regulated their diet.

The researchers uncovered five genes potentially associated with obesity in the dogs. The strongest effect came from a gene called DENND1B — Labradors with a certain variant of this gene had around 8 percent more body fat than dogs without it. DENND1B, which affects how the brain’s responds to food, was also associated with higher body mass indexes in humans.

Knowing which genes were associated with obesity allowed Raffan and her colleagues to develop a risk scoring system, which helped calculate whether individual Labradors were at higher or lower risk of obesity based on their genetic profile.

“You can rank all of the individuals in the population based on whether they inherited a bunch of obesity-prone genes, or maybe they didn’t inherit many at all,” says Adam Boyko, a canine geneticist at Cornell University who was not involved with the study.

With this information, the researchers could see how high-risk and low-risk Labradors differed when it came to their relationships with food. Labradors at a high risk for obesity, for example, were more likely to beg and to be more driven toward finding food. And for Labradors that were more genetically predisposed to obesity, owners who were stricter about regulating their pets’ diet made all the difference.

“If you’re a high-risk dog and your owner is really strict with the management, you can be a perfectly healthy body weight,” Raffan says. “But if they’re pretty relaxed about the management, those are the dogs who get overweight.” She added that dogs with a lower genetic risk tended to stay at a fairly healthy weight, regardless of how their owner fed them.

So do you need a genetic test to determine whether your Labrador may be at risk for obesity? Probably not, says Raffan. If a dog seems like it would tip the scales if given the chance to plan its own diet, that could be a hint that their genes may be behind its drive for food. Trying to ration food for dogs that pack on the pounds could be a safe bet — though it’s often easier said than done. “To be disciplined about your dog’s food intake, it sounds straightforward, but it’s actually quite a tough job if you’ve got one of these massively food-motivated pets,” Raffan says.

	Deforestation higher up on mountains will leave these Mesoamerican forests nowhere to retreat

Mist swallows the treetops in a cloud forest in the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico. Bromeliads, mosses and other epiphytes cover the tree trunks, greatly increasing the surface area of the canopy, thereby allowing it to collect vast amounts of water from tiny fog droplets.

Cloud forests are strange and ghostly places — akin to coral reefs hidden high on tropical mountains. Stunted trees loom in the mist, gnarled trunks and branches crusted in moss, lichens, orchids, ferns, bromeliads and even climbing cactus vines. Arboreal frogs and salamanders spawn in fog-fed bromeliad pools, and spider monkeys pause to sip drinks.

But these enigmatic forests are being squeezed by warming and deforestation.

Hundreds of tree and plant species that make up Mesoamerican cloud forests are being chased uphill by rising temperatures, at an average rate of 1.8 to 2.7 meters per year, researchers report in the March 7 Science. From 1979 to 2010, these forests retreated 84 meters uphill. At the same time, cattle grazing and deforestation higher on the mountains is pushing the forests downward 6.3 meters per year — squishing these ecosystems into ever narrower bands of territory.

The results are “alarming,” says Emily Hollenbeck, a tropical ecologist with the Costa Rica–based Monteverde Conservation League who was not part of the study. “These species are running out of space, and they’re running out of time.”

While cloud forests cover just 0.4 percent of Earth’s land, they harbor 15 percent of its bird, mammal, amphibian and tree fern species. Wander into one on a foggy day, and you may find that you’ve walked into a miniature rain shower: Tiny fog droplets condense onto the leaves above and drip to the ground, providing plants with extra water to supplement the rain they receive.

What’s more, “they produce water for a lot of communities,” says Santiago Ramírez-Barahona, an evolutionary biologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City.

Ramírez-Barahona was long curious about how global warming would affect these forests. During his childhood in the 1980s and 1990s, he often visited his father’s coffee plantation in Coatepec, Mexico. He saw banks of cool fog descend each day on the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains, a major cloud forest site 15 kilometers west. When he returned in 2015, he was shocked to see that the clouds didn’t come down as far as they used to.

Rising temperatures and falling humidity were causing the base of the daily cloud layer to rise by a meter or two per year.

Starting in 2019, Ramírez-Barahona and colleagues tried to find out whether the forests were also migrating uphill, chasing these clouds. They analyzed old records from dozens of biologists who had visited cloud forests from Mexico to Cost Rica and collected plant samples for museums. They mapped the elevations where species were collected and spent five years writing and refining computer code to analyze the data, encompassing 362,000 plant samples and 1,021 species.

At least 380 of those species are retreating uphill from the lower reaches of their ranges, the team found. This included everything from sweetgum trees to tree ferns, climbing cacti and parasitic mistletoe. But encroaching pasturelands at the upper ends of their ranges prevented these plants from migrating into higher, cooler, wetter zones, says Ramírez-Barahona. “They are just hitting a ceiling, because there’s no forest remaining up there.”

The loss of these forests could reduce the water supply for farmers who live lower down, says Sybil Gotsch, a forest ecophysiologist who studies cloud forests at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. This kind of forest functions like “a sponge” with extra soil, moss and plants piled high in the trees — and thick layers of leaves and twigs on the ground. “The cloud forest is a giant three-dimensional structure that slows down and stores water,” she says, releasing it into streams even during the dry season, when rain is not falling — but fog is still present.

A 2017 study found that when Mexican cloud forests were cleared for pastures, the stream flow during dry seasons decreased by up to 50 percent, because the pastures weren’t absorbing fog or storing as much water.

Kenneth Feeley, a tropical forest ecologist at the University of Miami in Florida, who helped with statistical analyses on the new study, predicts that shrinkage of cloud forests will threaten many of the plants inhabiting them. “These species tend to have very small ranges, which means that they have very small population sizes,” he says. “They are inherently at risk for extinction.”

	Blue Ghost was the first private lunar lander to not crash or fall over

The Athena lander, built by Texas company Intuitive Machines, orbits the moon ahead of its attempt to land on March 6.

This is a developing story and will be updated as we learn more.

This year’s hot destination is the moon. Two landers built by private companies have just touched down on the moon within a week of each other. One landed softly and safely — a first for any private spacecraft — while the other’s status remains unknown.

“The path to the stars is no longer limited to nations alone,” said Jesus Charles, director of spacecraft operations at Texas-based Firefly Aerospace, after the company’s Blue Ghost lander touched down on March 2. “Blue Ghost’s successful landing proves commercial industry has a critical role in humanity’s journey beyond Earth.”

After a long journey in space — having launched on January 15 — Blue Ghost landed in a volcanic plain on the nearside of the moon called Mare Crisium at 3:34 a.m. EST. It is the first privately built lander to touch down on the moon without crashing or tipping over.

Quick on Blue Ghost’s heels, a robotic lander named Athena, built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, attempted to land on March 6 after only eight days in space. Athena targeted a flat-topped mountain near the moon’s south pole called Mons Mouton, which is believed to be older than the surrounding terrain.

Currently, the lander’s status is unknown. It appears to have touched down, its solar panels are generating power and engineers are able to communicate with the craft. But its orientation and full status have yet to be determined.

In February 2024, Intuitive Machines’ first lander, Odysseus, broke a leg upon landing and fell on its side. A lander called Peregrine from the Pittsburgh-based company Astrobotic launched in January 2024 but never made it to the moon. And a lander called Beresheet from an Israeli nonprofit called SpaceIL crashed into the moon in 2019.

Both Blue Ghost and Athena are part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program, a public-private partnership started in 2018. As part of that program, NASA contracted private companies to send suites of science experiments and technology demonstrations to the moon.

Many of these experiments are designed to pave the way for future human missions. Blue Ghost carries an instrument to measure the stickiness of lunar dust, which can damage equipment and threaten astronauts’ health, as well as a prototype dust shield. The lander’s instruments will also test lunar drilling technology, a new method for soil sample collection, computers that are hardened against harmful space radiation and a GPS-like system for the moon.

NASA and Firefly chose Mare Crisium for Blue Ghost’s landing site due to low levels of magnetic activity compared to other parts of the moon. Earth’s magnetic field is driven by an internal molten core and covers the whole planet. But the moon lacks a molten core, leading to variations in its magnetic field from place to place. Some of Blue Ghost’s instruments will take magnetic field measurements, so the team selected a spot where the moon’s own magnetism would not interfere.

Intuitive Machines’ Athena carried a NASA drill and spectrometer to hunt for water ice, which previous missions have shown is abundant at the south pole. It also brought two rovers and a hopping robot named Grace, after the pioneering computer scientist Grace Hopper, which aims to take data from inside on of the south pole’s permanently shadowed craters. The company is also working with Nokia to test a 4G cellular network on the moon between the hopper and the main spacecraft.

If all goes well, both spacecraft will observe a total eclipse on March 14. While viewers on Earth will witness a lunar eclipse, as the planet’s shadow passes over the moon, the landers will see a solar eclipse from another world as Earth blocks the sun.

Blue Ghost also plans to capture images of the lunar sunset on March 16 and collect data on a horizon glow caused by levitating lunar dust, first observed by the Apollo 17 astronauts. The lander will operate throughout a lunar day, or about two weeks on Earth, until it gets too dark and cold on the moon for it to continue working.

The CLPS companies regard each other as “competimates,” a mashup of “competitor” and “teammate,” says Firefly engineer Kevin Scholtes. “We’re in this pool together, and there’s a very real quality of, all ships rise with the tide,” he says. “Ultimately, we want each other to be successful.”

This is just the beginning of a parade of private lunar landers. Thirteen American companies are part of the CLPS program, with moon missions planned through 2028. Another lander, called Resilience from Japanese company ispace, launched with Blue Ghost in January but won’t land until May. And a commercial company in China called STAR.VISION plans to launch two small lunar exploration robots with the country’s Chang’e-8 mission in 2028 — the first time China’s national space agency will work with a private company.

By Monicah Otieno, PhD.

 

In the west of Kenya, near the shores of Lake Victoria, where I come from, a tuberculosis outbreak is no different from one that takes place anywhere else in the world. A few dozen people get sick, health workers attempt to locate and test everyone with a bad cough and other symptoms.

A concerted effort is made to make sure that patients take their medications for the entire duration of treatment, at least six months, to help stem the creation of drug-resistant infections.

The problem is that Western Kenya has a high burden of HIV infections, which makes the communities more vulnerable to TB infections. People living with HIV are more than 14 times more likely to fall ill with TB disease than people without HIV.

Other locations — like the communities on the Uganda shores of Lake Victoria, Copperbelt Province in Zambia, Eastern Cape Province in South Africa, or Enugu State in Nigeria — have this vulnerability.

Of the 30 countries that the World Health Organization identified as having a high burden of TB and HIV co-infections, 22 are located in sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa, India, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Kenya tragically have the most co-infections globally.

HIV is not like TB. While TB treatment takes six long months, this is a curable disease. HIV, on the other hand, cannot be cured. It can, however, be kept in check through medicine that suppresses the infection.

The virus attacks the immune system, allowing other diseases like TB, kept in check by the immune system, to strengthen. In fact, TB is the leading cause of death for people living with HIV infections.

This is where partnerships with foreign donors can make a difference, with resources for programs that have located people living with HIV and then provided them with proper medicines.

These programs help keep infections in check, preventing HIV from spreading and preventing other infections like TB from becoming more widespread. Similar programs help locate people with TB and provide them with medicines throughout the six months of treatment.

The trend right now is to disrupt these partnerships and cut foreign aid, unraveling the safety net that addresses HIV and TB. This places regions like Western Kenya at extreme risk from two contagious diseases that do not respect national borders. If they are not contained in even one location, we run the risk of the contagion spreading.

There are so many ways that this situation can be improved, in sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the Global South. We need new medicines for TB, to shorten the treatment time and make it easier for patients to take the drugs. We need medicines that can cure HIV instead of just keeping the infections in check.

We also need vaccines to prevent both of these infections. The only available TB vaccine, BCG, dates back to 1921. It protects babies and young children against severe forms of TB, but it offers inadequate protection for adolescents and adults against the most common form of the disease. There is no vaccine to prevent HIV, although new prevention methods have been identified and are in need of development and distribution.

This is my work as a scientist, helping to develop solutions for infectious diseases that are barely held in check, if at all — even as the systems that address these diseases have just lost significant funding.

There is no disagreement that foreign aid makes a difference; more resources are needed, not less. An estimated US$22 billion is required annually for TB diagnostic, treatment and prevention services by 2027. Yet only US$5.7 billion was available in 2023. More resources are needed, from governments in both the Global South and Global North.

Global funding for neglected disease basic research and product development has declined by more than 20% since it peaked in 2018. As of 2023, high-income countries provided 59% of all funding; those numbers are now expected to drop further this year.

It would be great to see low- and middle-income countries generating more research that tackles diseases like TB and HIV, and we are on the path to doing so, but we are still unfortunately at the beginning stages of this journey.

Today, progress against these diseases stands at the edge of a precipice as governments face impossible decisions on where to channel diminishing resources.

The funding for all of this work does not turn on like a switch if foreign aid from high-income countries is suddenly discontinued. We have already lost so much ground during the COVID-19 pandemic. An estimated 700,00 TB deaths stemmed from the disruptions caused by the pandemic.

Less than half of all people infected with drug-resistant TB received treatment in 2023. And now we risk losing the ground that we have made up since COVID.

It is important that the Global South and Global North continue to work together, finding solutions to these diseases that keep too many parts of society vulnerable. The world will always be connected. Solutions to these diseases benefit us all.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Siemens plans to invest $285 million in manufacturing in the United States, the tech company said Thursday, including two new facilities in California and Texas.

The U.S. is the largest market for the company. The recent investments in the Siemens' U.S. manufacturing footprint and the planned acquisition of Altair, a Michigan-based software company, mark more than $10 billion in investment in the U.S.

“We believe in the innovation and strength of America’s industry. That’s why Siemens has invested over $90 billion in the country in the last 20 years. This year’s investment will bring this number to over $100 billion,"" Roland Busch, president and CEO of Siemens AG, said in a statement. “We are bringing more jobs, more technology and a boost to America’s AI capabilities.”

Siemens’ announcement comes as chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it plans to invest an additional $100 billion in the U.S., on top of $65 billion in investments the company had previously said it would make. That investment will be for three more chip manufacturing plants, along with two packaging facilities, in Arizona.

Siemens said it plans to open two manufacturing facilities for electrical products in Fort Worth, Texas, and Pomona, Calif. The company said it expects its latest investment to create more than 900 skilled manufacturing jobs, with the equipment produced in those factories supporting the U.S. commercial, industrial and construction sectors. The move will also allow the company to power AI data centers.

ST. JOHN'S, N.L. — The outgoing premier of Newfoundland and Labrador says he’s drawing on the province’s history as he urges Canadians not to underestimate U.S. President Donald Trump’s “imperialist” ambitions.

In a recent interview, Andrew Furey was clear: he says Trump is launching an attack on Canada by sowing economic chaos to create instability. And he warned that economic pressure can be just as effective as tanks and gunfire at eroding a nation’s independence and sovereignty.

“In Newfoundland and Labrador, we know that all too well,” the premier said. “It was the economic forces, not the military forces, that caused us to lose our independence and choose to join Canada.”

Trump has kept Canadians frustrated and bewildered for months, threatening punishing tariffs on Canadian goods and then changing his plan at the last minute. As of Thursday, he had imposed 25 per cent tariffs on most Canadian goods, but paused the duties on the auto sector for a month. Energy flowing from Canada to the U.S. was subject to 10 per cent duties.

Meanwhile, Trump regularly calls the Canadian prime minister ""Governor Justin Trudeau,"" and has threatened to use ""economic force"" to make Canada the 51st state.

“He has shown by his threats that he has an expansive agenda, a territorial agenda, and that feeds an imperialist approach,” Furey said.

Jeff Webb, a history professor at Memorial University, agrees that dire economic circumstances influenced Newfoundlanders when they voted to become a Canadian province in 1949. But they didn't do it under force, he said in a recent interview.

Newfoundland was a self-governing dominion of the British Empire until 1933, when Canada and Britain stepped in to help bail the region out of financial hardship. The Great Depression hit Newfoundland hard, and the dominion had accrued a large debt sending soldiers to fight in the First World War.

As a condition of the bailout, Newfoundland gave up self-governance, and instead agreed to be ruled by a commission appointed by the British government, according to Memorial University's Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage website.

By the 1940s, Britain and Canada thought it would be best for Newfoundland to join Canada, but they didn't force it, Webb said. When 52 per cent of Newfoundlanders voted in 1949 to join Canada rather than return to self-government, many hoped Confederation would bring financial stability and help them avoid the destitution that plagued the region under its own government, he said.

“We didn't get arm-twisted into this,” Webb said about Newfoundland’s Confederation with Canada. “It’s incredibly different from what we’re getting now. And what we’re getting now is crazy, nonsensical bullying.”

""Part of the craziness of this is that there are no sensible parallels,"" he said of Trump's behaviour toward his northern neighbour.

Historian Sean Cadigan noted that some of Newfoundland's hardship before it joined Canada were a result of the Trump-like tariffs it imposed on foreign manufacturers. It was already costly to make things in Newfoundland — an island in the North Atlantic Ocean — and the taxes just made everything expensive, he said. The cost of living became unbearable, particularly in rural Newfoundland.

""The lessons that I've learned from protectionism, is that it just hurts a lot of people, especially rural people,"" the Memorial University professor said. ""Tariffs create tremendous social and economic divisions. They create winners and losers, and the stress among the losers can be terrible.""

The United States under Trump is absolutely ""acting in an imperial manner,"" said Blayne Haggart, an associate political science professor at Brock University. And he agrees with Furey: Canada needs to take it seriously.

""I think we're taking the threat of the tariffs seriously,"" Haggart said in an interview. ""But what comes next? … I don't know yet if Canadians, and particularly our political leaders, fully understand what it means to chart a separate course from the United States.""

That will involve costly measures such as strengthening the Canadian military, relying less on the United States for regulatory approvals for drugs and manufacturing, and even strengthening weather forecasting systems as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency fires workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

But instead of having a government digging into those discussions, Canada has an outgoing prime minister and an upcoming federal election, Haggart said.

""I'm 52 years old. This is the worst crisis that Canada has faced in my lifetime,"" he said. ""It's been disappointing to me that the federal leadership vacuum was allowed to persist for so long … I understand the reasons for it but it's still incredibly concerning.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=technology+news,GE HealthCare Announces New Genesis Cloud Suite,https://www.itnonline.com/content/ge-healthcare-announces-new-genesis-cloud-suite,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:06:50 GMT","



GE HealthCare advances its cloud strategy by unveiling the Genesis portfolio to improve speed of digital innovation adoption.

March 4, 2025 — At HIMSS 2025 in Las Vegas, GE HealthCare announced Genesis solutions — a new portfolio of cloud enterprise imaging software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. Four features will be offered when commercially released — edge, storage, vendor neutral archive and data migration.[i] These cloud solutions are designed to enhance healthcare organizations’ efficiency and precision, streamline workflows, and optimize the use of capital and IT resources. 

The growing volume and complexity of patient cases are putting increasing pressure on hospitals’ IT systems, driving the need for healthcare organizations to accelerate their digital transformation efforts through rapidly evolving technologies and operational infrastructure.[ii] However, budget constraints and staffing shortages make managing this quickly growing body of data challenging.[iii] Distributed care networks require quicker adaptability and scalable solutions to transform patient care through accessible, sharable and secure imaging data. The complexity and cost of acquiring and deploying new on-premises infrastructure and software, coupled with limited IT and financial resources, impedes hospitals’ ability to quickly scale and adapt their technological infrastructure to meet their rapidly changing needs. These challenges highlight the need for more flexible and cost-effective solutions, such as cloud-based technologies, to meet the demands of modern healthcare. 

The Genesis portfolio will help hospitals and health systems streamline workflows, and support radiologists and caregivers in delivering precise and timely patient care. In addition, Genesis solutions are designed to help drive efficiency, facilitate interoperability through centralized patient data storage and access, and improve user experiences for both IT and clinical teams. The product strategy for cloud and hybrid deployment models help reduce infrastructure investments and operational costs, while accelerating the adoption of technology innovations. GE HealthCare has designed Genesis solutions to provide high levels of security for sensitive healthcare data – offering multiple features to assist with promoting high levels of business continuity under adverse conditions. 

“We are committed to delivering enterprise imaging solutions with our cloud-first strategy. Clinicians and caregivers want the latest tools to most effectively do their jobs, but organizations often lack the financial and IT resources required to access and implement them,” said Scott Miller, CEO of Enterprise Imaging Solutions, GE HealthCare. “With the launch of the Genesis portfolio, we will be providing cloud-enabled solutions that can help transform patient care through accessible, sharable, and secure imaging data while simultaneously improving clinical and operational efficiencies.” 

Genesis solutions will include four key features:

All solutions will be deployed on the Amazon Web Services (AWS), architected to be the most secure cloud computing environment available today. AWS has been GE HealthCare’s global strategic cloud provider for close to a decade. The unveiling of the Genesis portfolio supports GE HealthCare’s plans to more than triple its offerings of cloud-enabled products by 2028 and creates momentum on its goals of delivering on digital transformation.

Greensea IQ expanded its EverClean operations with a new service center in Miami, Florida. 

The new facility, located in Hialeah, Florida, will house both office and workshop space. The Miami location will accommodate an expanded EverClean support team dedicated to servicing customers in the region. With Miami serving as a global hub for cruise operations, the expansion furthers Greensea IQ's ability to provide ship operators with an efficient and environmentally responsible hull maintenance solution.

“As the cruise industry continues to prioritize operational efficiency and sustainability, EverClean is becoming an essential service for maintaining optimal hull performance,” said John Dunn, Chief Operating Officer of Greensea IQ. “Expanding into Miami allows us to provide direct, on-the-ground support to our growing customer base while also establishing a key foothold for further expansion into the Caribbean.”

With more than 250 service deployments in 2024, EverClean is the only proven commercially available proactive in-water hull cleaning service, ensuring vessels maintain peak performance while preventing biofouling from advancing to a harmful stage. By maintaining a clean hull, EverClean reduces fuel consumption, lowers emissions, and mitigates environmental risks associated with invasive species transfer for its customers.

“We are excited to bring EverClean’s proven benefits to more ship operators in Miami, Everglades and beyond,” said Rob Howard, Chief Growth Officer at Greensea IQ. “This expansion reinforces our commitment to our customers in South Florida by providing the additional resources needed to achieve the current and future economic and environmental goals of our customers.”

Animation shows traditional counter-drone technology vs. Epirus' Leonidas system that can take out entire swarms of drones at once.

A new high-powered microwave system that can knock swarms of drones out of the sky at once is going to ""touch every aspect of warfare,"" according to Epirus founder, Joe Lonsdale. 

""It’s kind of like a Star Trek shield,"" Lonsdale, founder of Epirus and a co-founder of fast-rising defense technology company Palantir, explained of its Leonidas counter-drone system. ""It’s able to turn them off from very far away."" 

""This is going to touch every aspect of warfare over the next decade,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""We can knock down some pretty advanced drones."" 

Defense tech startup Epirus secured another $250 million in a Series D funding round, which was announced Wednesday, bringing its total venture funding to over $550 million.

Epirus’ Leonidas system is a ground-based, directed energy weapon that fires off an electromagnetic pulse to disable swarms of drones, or it can neutralize precision targets. The company aims to help the military shift away from a ""1 to 1 mindset to a ‘1 to many’ way of thinking for short-range defense,"" according to CEO Andy Lowery. 

Drone swarms have been a key frontline tactic in the Russia-Ukraine war because most defense systems are designed to take out one unmanned vehicle at a time. Additionally, in the Middle East, the U.S. has been using multimillion-dollar missiles to shoot down Houthi drones that are built for around $2,000 or less. 

""Swarms of drones is where war is going, and currently you have swarms of drones that are very expensive and very difficult to stop,"" said Lonsdale. ""It's not just drones, they're all sorts of different types of uses for this,"" he added, predicting that one day the technology might be deployed to freeze up planes in the sky and protect satellites. The technology has already been successful in Defense Department tests on boat motors and other electronics, according to the company.  

""This is just it's just going to touch every aspect of warfare in the next decade.""

Rep. Rob Wittman, vice chair of the House Armed Services Committee, warned that the U.S. needs to ""run to play catchup"" with its adversaries in the counter-UAS space. 

""We are not doing what we need to do,"" he told Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the National Security Innovation Base Summit in Washington, D.C. ""We have failed miserably at counter-UAS. We do okay in CENTCOM [Central Command], but … in places like Langley Air Force Base, we are not where we need to be."" 

Dozens of drones hovered over Langley for over two weeks in 2023, and lawmakers say they still have not been provided with an explanation. 

COUNTER-DRUG SEA DRONES UTILIZED BY NAVY AS TRUMP RAMPS UP MILITARY RESOURCES AT THE BORDER

Epirus won a $66 million contract in 2023 to supply its Leonidas to the U.S. Army, and the technology is believed to be  in the testing phase by Central Command, which oversees the Middle East, according to comments that Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George made to Congress last year. 

The rapid rise of unmanned aerial vehicles in war has prompted a defensive race to develop systems to counter them, like high-energy lasers and high-power microwaves. 

""We have a lot of people who are, you know, coming into the [Defense Department]wanting to embrace new technologies,"" said Lonsdale. ""They’re really excited about this."" 

The defense entrepreneur suggested there is ""tons of waste"" in the Pentagon that could be repurposed for new technologies.

""There’s a ton of cronyism. We're seeing tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars you could pull out, depending [on] how aggressive you want to be. And these should be put into cutting-edge technologies that actually deter enemies.""

Epirus was valued at $1.35 billion when it raised $200 million in Series C funding, but the company did not disclose its valuation for this round.

Virtu Financial's launch of Virtu Technology Solutions (VTS) represents a strategic commercialization of its proprietary technology that has potential revenue implications. The company is essentially packaging its internal trading infrastructure and execution capabilities as a formal product offering for sell-side broker-dealers.

This move leverages Virtu's existing technological assets with minimal incremental investment, potentially creating a new revenue stream by monetizing infrastructure already developed for internal use. The scale is noteworthy - connectivity to over 60 global markets, operations across more than 235 venues, and management of over 10,000 broker FIX connections.

What's particularly meaningful is how this aligns with industry trends toward increased technology outsourcing among smaller and mid-sized broker-dealers seeking to reduce fixed costs. By offering modular, scalable solutions, Virtu positions itself to capture market share in the broker technology space while leveraging its existing competitive advantages.

However, the announcement lacks specific revenue projections or pricing structures, making it difficult to quantify the financial impact. While potentially significant long-term, VTS likely represents an incremental addition to Virtu's diverse business model rather than a transformative change. The company is essentially following the industry playbook of transforming internal capabilities into sellable products, similar to how exchanges have monetized their technology platforms.

NEW YORK, March  06, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Virtu Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIRT) a leading provider of global, multi-asset financial services that delivers liquidity and innovative, transparent products across the entire investment cycle to the global markets, announces the public launch of Virtu Technology Solutions (VTS), a comprehensive product suite that repackages Virtu Execution Services’ (VES) capabilities for distribution to sell-side broker-dealers worldwide.

Virtu Execution Services (VES) has long provided execution and workflow solutions to buy-side and sell-side clients, offering a robust suit of technology-driven services that support seamless and integrated market access, trade execution and analytics. These solutions, built to optimize Virtu’s own trading infrastructure, have been leveraged by a range of institutional clients to enhance their operational efficiency and market connectivity.

With the introduction of VTS, Virtu is now formalizing and expanding the availability of these capabilities specifically for sell-side brokers, providing them with access to the same technology and infrastructure that powers Virtu’s own broker-dealer operations. This initiative reflects Virtu’s commitment to delivering scalable, modular and multi-asset solutions tailored to the infrastructure needs of broker-dealers.

NASA tested c-FIRST over fire-hit areas in Pacific Palisades and Altadena

Wildfires in California during January caused widespread destruction, affecting communities and ecosystems. To improve wildfire monitoring and response, NASA deployed a new scientific instrument capable of capturing high-resolution thermal infrared images. The Compact Fire Infrared Radiance Spectral Tracker (c-FIRST) was tested aboard NASA's B200 King Air aircraft over fire-hit areas in Pacific Palisades and Altadena. The instrument, developed for satellite-based missions, was assessed for its ability to provide real-time data on active and smoldering fires. Scientists aim to use this technology to enhance understanding of wildfire behavior and improve mitigation strategies.

According to reports, the c-FIRST instrument was developed and is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), with support from NASA's Earth Science Technology Office. The compact design allows it to be deployed on airborne platforms, simulating satellite missions while providing near-instantaneous observations. The system captures a wide range of fire characteristics, including temperature variations across large areas. Unlike previous infrared imaging systems, c-FIRST can detect extremely high temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (550 degrees Celsius) with improved clarity.

In a statement, Sarath Gunapala, principal investigator for c-FIRST at NASA JPL, noted that current fire observation instruments do not fully capture fire attributes across the Earth system. He explained that limitations in past imaging technologies have resulted in gaps in data concerning wildfire frequency, size, and intensity.

As per sources, c-FIRST is expected to provide critical insights for firefighting agencies by identifying smoldering fires that could reignite under changing wind conditions. In a report, Gunapala stated that the instrument's ability to distinguish such fires in near real-time could support more effective wildfire management efforts.

KC Sujan, operations engineer for the B200 King Air, told that the aircraft's flight characteristics made it ideal for testing the instrument. With further evaluation, c-FIRST is expected to be integrated into future satellite missions, potentially improving global wildfire monitoring capabilities.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will set up a government-backed fund in the near future that will mobilize 1 trillion yuan ($138.01 billion) from social capital to support technology startups, Zheng Shanjie, the head of China's state planner, said on Thursday.

The ""national venture capital guidance fund"" - an investment vehicle set up as public-private partnership - would focus on ""hard technology"", Zheng told a news conference, referring to areas such as semiconductors and renewable energy.

The fund, will maintain long-term investment cycles, increasing tolerance for risk, and invest in technology enterprises through market-based approaches, the director of the National Development and Reform Commission said.

Zheng and other officials spoke to the media a day after Premier Li Qiang told lawmakers Beijing aimed to keep the tariff-hit economy growing at a roughly 5% rate this year.

China said on Wednesday it would boost support for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models and the development of venture capital investment, in a bid to foster more technology breakthroughs and become more self-reliant.

The fund will focus on cutting-edge fields such as AI, quantum technology, and hydrogen energy storage and will invest in seed-stage and start-up companies through market-oriented methods, state media CCTV reported on Thursday.

The Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba Group surged more than 8% on Thursday following the release of a new reasoning model that the company said was on par with global hit DeepSeek’s R1.

Qwen, the e-commerce leader’s artificial intelligence unit, said on X that its QwQ-32B, with 32 billion parameters, can achieve performance comparable to DeepSeek’s R1 model, which boasts 671 billion parameters.

The announcement came a day after the Chinese government pledged increased support for industries including artificial intelligence, humanoid robots and 6G telecom, as AI models see increasing adoption by government agencies and smaller companies in China.

Alibaba said the new model is accessible via its chatbot service, Qwen Chat, for which users can choose various Qwen models including Qwen2.5-Max, the most powerful language model in the Qwen series.

The firm said the QwQ-32B demonstrated capabilities in mathematical reasoning, coding and general problem-solving in benchmark tests, performing close to top models such as OpenAI’s o1 mini and DeepSeek’s R1.

DeepSeek has emerged as the new poster child of China’s AI prowess, rivaling top models from OpenAI for a fraction of its costs with less powerful computing.

Analysts said initiatives laid out by the government will expand usage of AI in China.

“China is rapidly building an application-driven AI ecosystem that isn’t just about research — it’s about immediate, tangible economic impact,” said Sun Wei, principal AI analyst at research company Counterpoint.

Alibaba’s shares surged 8% to HK$140.5 a share.

Samsung on (Wednesday, March 5, 2025) announced the availability of Galaxy AI features on more Galaxy devices through the One UI 7 beta program. The beta program will be available for Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 in India from March 6. The official update of the One UI 7 will be available within April.

It will be rolled out to more devices within the month including Galaxy S23 series, Tab S10 series and A55, the company said. Users can apply to join the beta program via Samsung Members.

“Integrating leading AI agents with multimodal capabilities into every touch point of the interface, One UI 7 marks a significant leap forward in creating a new kind of mobile experience where every interaction feels more intuitive than ever before,” said Samsung.

One UI 7 brings updates to Galaxy AI features including advanced writing assist tools. Integrated into AI OS, they will allow texts that can be selected without needing to switch between applications.

The Upgraded call features with One UI 7 for call transcripts to support 20 languages. When call recording is enabled, recorded calls will automatically be transcribed for reference later on.

The One UI 7’s AI features come with a significant new look, based on a new notification system that streamlines communication with easy access from the device’s lock screen. It includes Now Bar, which highlights relevant activities across various features like Interpreter, Music, Recording, Stopwatch and more. It will be supported on upcoming Galaxy S series devices.

A redesigned camera UX will allow more intuitive control over advanced settings. Camera buttons, controls and modes have been reorganised to make it easier to find the features for a clearer preview of the picture or the video.

For Pro and Pro video modes, the manual settings layout has also been simplified. A new zoom control is available when you’re recording in Pro video mode, allowing you to control the zoom speed.

The official One UI 7 release will commence with upcoming Galaxy S series devices, featuring additional AI capabilities including enhanced on-device AI functions, starting from the first quarter of 2025. The update will gradually roll out to other Galaxy devices.

Hexaware Technologies rose 2.37% to Rs 819.75 after the company announced a new collaboration with the San Francisco Unicorns, a team in Major League Cricket.


As part of the association, Hexaware will be recognized as the San Francisco Unicorns' official partner. In addition to featuring Hexaware branding on the team's helmets and caps, the company will also receive a perimeter signage display.



Hexaware is a global technology and business process services company. It reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 857.50 crore and sales of Rs 8,820 crore for the nine months ended on 30 September 2024. 



Hexaware Technologies made a debut on the stock exchanges on 19 February 2025, with its shares listing at Rs 731, a 3.25% premium to the issue price of Rs 708. The company's initial public offering (IPO), which closed on February 14th, was subscribed 2.66 times. The IPO was priced within a band of Rs 674 to Rs 708 per share.



Hexaware was delisted from stock exchanges in November 2020. In 2021, Carlyle acquired it from ETQ (earlier Baring Private Equity Asia) for around $3 billion through an investment holding company CA Magnum Holdings. 



Currently, CA Magnum Holdings has 74.71% stake in the IT company.

David Yaffe-Bellany covers the cryptocurrency industry.

On the night of Feb. 21, Ben Zhou, the chief executive of the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, logged on to his computer to approve what appeared to be a routine transaction. His company was moving a large amount of Ether, a popular digital currency, from one account to another.

Thirty minutes later, Mr. Zhou got a call from Bybit’s chief financial officer. In a trembling voice, the executive told Mr. Zhou that their system had been hacked.

“All of the Ethereum is gone,” he said.

When Mr. Zhou approved the transaction, he had inadvertently handed control of an account to hackers backed by the North Korean government, according to the F.B.I. They stole $1.5 billion in cryptocurrencies, the largest heist in the industry’s history.

To pull off the astonishing breach, the hackers exploited a simple flaw in Bybit’s security: its reliance on a free software product. They penetrated Bybit by manipulating a publicly available system that the exchange used to safeguard hundreds of millions of dollars in customer deposits. For years, Bybit had relied on the storage software, developed by a technology provider called Safe, even as other security firms sold more specialized tools for businesses.

The hack sent crypto markets into a free fall and undermined confidence in the industry at a crucial time. Under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, industry executives are lobbying for new U.S. laws and regulations that would make it easier for people to pour their savings into digital currencies. On Friday, the White House is scheduled to host a “crypto summit” with President Trump and top industry officials.

Crypto security experts said they were troubled by what the heist revealed about Bybit’s safety protocols. The losses were “completely preventable,” one security firm wrote in an analysis of the breach, arguing that it “should not have happened.”

Bitcoin rose above $92,000 in Asian morning hours Thursday, with majors jumping as much as 5%, as traders await the first-ever White House Crypto Summit scheduled for Mar.7 for cues on future positioning.

BTC rose to $92,700 before profit-taking saw it decline to $90,800 in European morning hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) surged as much as 10% to lead gains among majors, with Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL and ether (ETH) rising 6%. XRP and BNB Chain’s bnb showed muted gains with a 2.5% jump, underperforming a 3.5% rise in the CoinDesk 20 (CD20).

Thursday’s price action helped buoy bulls after crypto markets roller-coasted this week as President Donald Trump revealed plans for a strategic reserve of tokens, including XRP, ADA and ETH, on Sunday, sending the market higher by 12%.

But that euphoria was doused as traders awaited concrete plans and a fresh round of U.S. tariffs went into play, with broader markets retracting on Tuesday. There has been a steady ascend in crypto markets, in line with a CoinDesk analysis, as watchers expect clear plans to emerge at Saturday’s summit.

“Investors view this as an asymmetric event with high stakes,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in Wednesday broadcast message, referring to the summit. “Will it serve as the unexpected catalyst that sends prices soaring, or will it expose crypto’s fragility and trigger a deeper sell-off?”

“Lens out. Corporate bond spreads are widening, with high-yield spreads now sitting at 290 bps above Treasuries, while the investment-grade vs. high-yield spread stands at 200 bps. While this isn't signaling panic, it's a trend worth monitoring closely,” QCP cautioned.

FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich noted that bitcoin's share of the crypto market exceeds 60%, which is typical in periods of fear, while ether’s share has dropped to a five-year low of 9% — a troubling sign for altcoin investors as any inflows are bound for BTC.

“Bitcoin continues to flirt with the 200-day MA, popping out on Tuesday shortly after touching that level below $83,000. Wednesday morning's market dynamics reflect cautious attempts to form a bottom,” Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email.

“A return to the area above the 50-day at $97,000 is a marker of bullish success,” he added.

 The Texas Senate passed a bill on March 6 to create a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency strategic reserve. 

The Texas Senate passed the Bitcoin (BTC) strategic reserve bill SB-21 in a 25-5 vote on March 6, after deliberating the merits of the legislation on the Senate floor.

Texas State Senator Charles Schwertner argued for the bill, saying that it would help the US state shore up its balance sheet with a valuable, scarce asset.

Lawmakers also assuaged fears that Bitcoin was a direct competitor to the US dollar as a global reserve currency, adding that it was much more similar to gold.

The Texas strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation was introduced by State Senator Charles Schwertner in January 2025 as a Bitcoin-only bill that omitted the acquisition of other digital assets.

However, in February 2025, the bill was refiled to include other digital assets following US President Donald Trump’s Jan. 23 executive order directing a commission to study the feasibility of a “digital asset stockpile.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cryptocurrency+news,Musk calls social security a ‘Ponzi scheme’. The real con is what Trump’s peddling,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/06/elon-musk-social-security-cryptocurrency,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 16:56:00 GMT","

Social security is a highly efficient safety net. But the president’s crypto plans and job cuts leave Americans holding the bag

Elon Musk said on Joe Rogan’s show last week that social security is “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”.

Rubbish. In a Ponzi scheme, a con artist lures investors into a fake investment project, pockets the cash, and then gets new “investors” to funnel cash to the older ones – until new recruits slow down and the whole thing collapses. Suckers are left holding worthless bags.

Social security is not a Ponzi scheme. It’s an exceptionally efficient part of the American social safety net – the opposite of a Ponzi scheme. Which is why the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose cutting it.

Social security is a “pay as you go” program. Current workers, via the payroll tax, fund payouts for retirees and disabled people. In 2024, about one in five US residents received social security.

I used to be a trustee of the social security trust fund. I know social security.

As the social security administration explains: “In 2025, when you work, about 85 cents of every social security tax dollar you pay goes to a trust fund. This fund pays monthly benefits to current retirees and their families and to surviving spouses and children of workers who have died. About 15 cents goes to a trust fund that pays benefits to people with disabilities and their families.”

The only reason social security is running out of money is that its trustees never anticipated America’s current degree of income inequality – with so much of the nation’s income in the hands of relatively few people (such as Musk).

The way to fix this is to lift the cap on income subject to social security payroll taxes, which is now $176,100.

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg fulfilled their 2025 social security payroll tax obligations a few minutes past midnight on 1 January. Most Americans keep paying payroll taxes all year.

You want a real Ponzi scheme? Look at the crypto investments Musk and Trump have hyped.

Trump’s new cryptocurrency, $Trump, soared and then crashed – exactly like a Ponzi scheme. It generated enormous profits for insiders and a cumulative $2bn in losses for more than 800,000 other investors.

Trump claims ignorance. “I don’t know if it benefited” me, he said. “I don’t know much about it.” (The Trump family and its business partners earned nearly $100m in trading fees alone on the coin.)

Musk has been promoting Dogecoin since 2019. Its value surged over 70% in the days following Trump’s announcement of the launch of Musk’s so-called 
 “department of government efficiency” (Doge). Since then, it’s dropped like a rock. A classic Ponzi scheme.

With Trump now in office, crypto is emerging from a four-year federal crackdown on crypto fraud, market manipulation and other scams following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX in 2022, one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in recent memory.

On Friday, Trump is holding a “crypto summit” at which he’ll promote the idea of a federal crypto reserve that will give crypto schemes a temporary boost by increasing demand for them.

But why should American taxpayers foot the bill for a crypto reserve? The most obvious winner will be Trump, whose own crypto venture carries millions of dollars in tokens that are to be included in the reserve. Other winners will be crypto executives, many of whom donated extensively to Trump’s re-election effort.

One example: Ripple – whose XRP token is one of the five that Trump said would be included – donated $45m to an industry-wide Pac that sought to help elect Trump and other Republicans.

In fact, most of Trump’s crypto schemes are just ways to curry his favor by paying him off.

Consider Justin Sun, a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur whom the Securities and Exchange Commission charged with securities fraud in March 2023.

After Trump was elected in 2024, Sun bought $30m worth of Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) crypto tokens, putting $18m directly into the president’s pockets. Since then, he has invested another $45m in WLF. Altogether, Sun’s investments have netted Trump more than $50m.

Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission just dropped its prosecution of Sun.

The SEC also dropped its case against the crypto trading platform Coinbase after the platform donated $75m to a political action committee associated with Trump and $1m to his inauguration.

To top it off, the SEC just ruled that “memecoins” aren’t securities, meaning that Trump’s novelty crypto tokens won’t be subject to any regulatory oversight. An open invitation to other Trump Ponzi schemes.

Trump and Musk are peddling a much bigger Ponzi scheme.

They’re promising huge “savings” from destroying the federal government (including wrecking programs like social security and Medicaid) – savings that will go to the US’s wealthy and big corporations in the form of tax cuts.

The social security administration recently announced it will consolidate the current 10 regional offices it maintains into four, and cut at least 7,000 jobs from an agency already at a 50-year staffing low.

The Republican budget recently pushed through the House cuts over $880bn most likely out of Medicaid.

Who will be left holding the bag? Most Americans.

Zoom out and you’ll see the entire Trump 2 regime is a giant Ponzi scheme – promising to “Make America Great Again” by raising tariffs, deporting over 11 million people, taking a wrecking ball to the federal government, pulverizing democracy and joining Putin and other global dictators.

Trump is the con artist behind this giant Ponzi scheme. He lured voters into his fake Maga project, pocketed some of the cash and rewarded his billionaires backers with more and will leave most Americans with a corrupt and decimated society.

Key Points

Which of these popular cryptocurrencies is a better buy right now?

Bitcoin (BTC -1.36%) and XRP (XRP 3.39%) are very different types of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, which has a market cap of $1.7 trillion, is the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. XRP, which has a market cap of $125 billion, is the native token of Ripple's blockchain-powered payment platform.

Bitcoin is mined through the energy-intensive proof-of-work proof-of-work mechanism, and nearly 20 million of its maximum supply of 21 million tokens have already been mined. Every four years,  a ""halving"" takes place, reducing by 50% the amount of new Bitcoin that miners get for each block on the blockchain they validate. Based on the code that underlays the crypto, the last Bitcoin token will be mined in 2140. However, its finite supply makes it more comparable to gold and other commodities.

Image source: Getty Images.

By contrast, XRP's entire supply of 100 billion tokens was pre-mined before it launched in 2013. Only 58 billion of those tokens are in circulation today; the rest are locked up across Ripple's escrow accounts. It periodically releases some of those tokens to stabilize its liquidity and supply. XRP can't be mined anymore, and Ripple's blockchain can't be used to develop decentralized applications in the same way as proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum (ETH -1.01%) and Solana (SOL -1.73%). Those limitations to its scarcity and utility make it harder to value than Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies.

Over the past 12 months, Bitcoin's price rose about 40% as XRP's price surged nearly 270%. Let's see why XRP outperformed Bitcoin by such a wide margin -- and consider which one is the better cryptocurrency to buy right now.

When Ripple initially launched XRP in 2013, it hoped the token would be adopted for financial transactions on its payment platform. However, Ripple's customers largely used its blockchain to process fiat currency transactions instead of trying out XRP.

In late 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) filed charges against Ripple, alleging that its $1.3 billion offering of XRP tokens had constituted an illegal sale of unregistered securities. That lawsuit caused Ripple to lose several customers and led to the XRP token being delisted from the top crypto exchanges. Grayscale Investments also shut down its XRP Trust in 2021. All of those problems, along with rising interest rates, drove investors away from XRP.

But last August, the SEC lawsuit finally ended with a lighter-than-expected fine for Ripple. The SEC began appealing that ruling, but those appeals could be dropped as President Trump's appointees relax the government's oversight of the crypto market.

Meanwhile, XRP was relisted by the major crypto exchanges, Grayscale relaunched its XRP Trust as a closed-end fund (CEF) for accredited investors, and several asset management firms have submitted applications to the SEC for permission to launch XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). All of those developments -- along with Trump's election victory, hopes for lower interest rates, and the broader rotation back toward cryptocurrencies -- helped drive XRP's price higher.

But over the past month, XRP has pulled back about 30% as Trump's threats of tariffs and mass deportations sparked fears of rising inflation and elevated interest rates. The high-risk category of cryptocurrency investments is still quite sensitive to macroeconomic twists and turns. This may change in the long run, making solid inflation hedges out of robust crypto names, but that's not how it works in early 2025. So if the Fed sees inflation rising and pauses its interest rate cuts -- or starts hiking rates again -- a new crypto winter could begin.

Bitcoin's price surged in 2024 as its first spot price ETFs were approved, it went through its latest halving, and institutional investors accumulated more tokens. It was also driven higher by Trump's pro-crypto campaign promises and the expectation that interest rates would come down.

However, Bitcoin's price has pulled back by nearly 20% over the past month on the same fears of tariffs, inflation, and higher rates that chilled the rest of the crypto market. All of those challenges have largely overshadowed Trump's plans to build a ""strategic Bitcoin reserve"" through big government purchases of the cryptocurrency over the next few years. The surge that many coins saw on Sunday after Trump made another social media announcement about plans for a national crypto reserve had largely evaporated by Monday afternoon.

So as long as the macro outlook stays murky, many investors will steer clear of cryptocurrencies and other speculative investments. Elevated interest rates could also keep more cash stashed away in safe-haven investments like CDs and U.S. Treasuries, or other high-yielding investments.

But over the long term, Bitcoin's price could stabilize and recover at a faster rate than XPR and other smaller cryptocurrencies. Its scarcity makes it easier to value, inflation-wracked countries could follow El Salvador and the Central African Republic's lead and attempt to adopt it as a national currency. Institutional investors could continue to accumulate it as an experimental hedge against inflation and the potential devaluations of fiat currencies.

XRP might generate some bigger near-term gains through its volatile swings this year, but I don't think there are enough catalysts to keep it ahead of Bitcoin over the next few years. The rate at which new XRP becomes available won't decline like the rate at which new Bitcoin is mined, and the XRP blockchain can only be natively used for financial transactions -- in contrast to the Ethereum blockchain, which is designed to facilitate the development of decentralized finance apps.

The approval of new XRP ETFs might stabilize its price, but the soaring coin could also suffer a steeper pullback than Bitcoin if a new crypto winter starts. So for now, I'd rather stick with Bitcoin as my main cryptocurrency play instead of chasing XRP's wild swings.

Bitcoin’s price will surge to $1 million in the not too distant future. 

That’s one of the predictions made ahead of President Donald Trump’s first crypto summit. 

The Friday meet-up will see industry leaders congregate at the White House to evangelise the benefits of digital assets to Trump and Crypto Czar David Sacks.

It comes on the back of a rollercoaster few days — driven in part by economic fears, tariff threats, and a record hack — that saw Bitcoin plunge 12% to trade below $80,000. 

Bitcoin’s price has recovered slightly in the lead-up to the summit. It now trades above $91,000.

Here’s what will drive the price of Bitcoin next according to Arthur Hayes and six other experts.

Trump’s policies will devalue the dollar and send the price of Bitcoin to $250,000 at the end of 2025 — and to $1 million at the end of the president’s term. 

Hayes, crypto influencer and chief investment officer at Maelstrom, made those predictions in a blog this week, as well as in a January interview with DL News.

“I’m painting a very rosy future picture for Bitcoin even though the markets are currently in the shitter,” Hayes said in his post.

First, however, he said Bitcoin’s price will likely drop as low as $70,000 in the short term as the value of the dollar tanks. 

When that happens, Hayes predicted that investors will flee to the digital asset to protect the value of their money, thus pumping the price.

“Let politicians do politician things, stay in your lane, and buy Bitcoin,” Hayes said. 

Trump’s Sunday missive about his planned national crypto reserve paved the way for Bitcoin’s to hit $500,000. 

That’s according to Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research.

He argued that the announcement signalled that the White House has put its thumb on the scales in favour of digital assets.

“Markets can now edge higher,” he said, arguing that Standard Chartered’s previous prediction that Bitcoin will hit $500,000 at the end of Trump’s term is still very much in play.

Traders have piled into bullish bets that Bitcoin’s price will hit $120,000 by the end of March. 

On Tuesday, options data from Deribit showed that more than two-thirds of traders on the platform had placed bets the top cryptocurrency will surge by the contracts’ March 28 expiry. 

A similar trend is seen on Derive, where analysts are seeing “strong demand for high-leverage calls” despite the market turmoil, said Sean Dawson, head of research at the options trading protocol.

“This indicates that traders are seeking upside exposure in the wake of the large price fluctuations,” Dawson wrote in a Tuesday blog.

Trump’s plan to establish a national crypto reserve buoyed Bitcoin’s price this week, but traders should look to other factors. 

That’s according to crypto payment company Bitpace’s Chief Revenue Officer Meryem Habibi.

She told DL News this week that crypto exchange-traded funds’ investment flows and any policies coming out of Washington will likely affect sentiment. 

Habibi also said to look at the economy for clues.

“Broader macroeconomic factors such as interest rate expectations, inflation data, and financial market conditions will also play a role in shaping investor sentiment,” Habibi said. 

Trump’s plans to create a national crypto stockpile will push the asset’s price past $200,000 over the next 12 to 18 months.

That’s according to three analysts from Bernstein. On Monday, the research firm told investors: “We are in a new era.”

 Bitcoin and the altcoins selected for the US crypto strategic reserve could stay range-bound in the short term, barring a blockbuster announcement on March 7. 

The cryptocurrency community keenly awaits the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on March 7, which is expected to provide more details on the planned crypto reserve announced by US President Donald Trump on March 2. 

Although the initial announcement included Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), several critics slammed the idea of adding centralized altcoins alongside Bitcoin in the reserve. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified in an interview with The Pavlovic Today that Bitcoin is likely to have a special status in the nation’s crypto reserve.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said in a March 5 market note that the US crypto reserve “will be nearly entirely Bitcoin, and it will be larger than people think.” He added that similar announcements in other countries will likely follow a US crypto reserve.

The cryptocurrencies proposed to be included in the crypto reserve surged after the announcement but then gave back a large part of their gains. Their weekly charts have been analyzed to avoid the near-term noise. That will help in understanding the levels at which a trending move begins.

Bitcoin price rebounded from its recent sell-off, and a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to close below the 20-week exponential moving average ($90,664). This shows that the bulls are active at lower levels.

The bulls will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the psychological barrier at $100,000. If they manage to do that, it will clear the path for a retest of the all-time high at $109,588. The sellers will try to defend the $109,588 level, but if the bulls prevail, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $138,000.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to hold above $100,000, it will suggest that the bears are trying to form a lower high. The pair could then descend to the 50-week simple moving average ($75,543).

Ether has formed a large range between $2,111 and $4,094. The price slipped below $2,000 recently, but the long tail on the candlestick shows buying at lower levels.

ETH/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

A weak rebound off the $2,111 level suggests that demand is drying up. That increases the risk of a breakdown below $2,111. If that happens, it will indicate that the ETH/USDT pair may have topped out in the near term. The pair may start a downtrend to $1,500 and then to $1,075.

Buyers will have to push and sustain the price above the moving averages to signal that the range-bound action remains intact. The pair may then climb to the top of the range at $4,094. This is a critical overhead resistance for the bears to defend because a break above it could clear the path for a rally to $4,868 and eventually to the target objective of $6,077.

XRP has been consolidating in an uptrend. After a vertical rally, the price generally takes a breather before starting the next trending move.

XRP/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The XRP/USDT pair has been oscillating between $2 and $3 for several weeks, indicating a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. Sellers are defending the overhead resistance while the bulls are buying near the support. The longer the price remains inside the range, the stronger the eventual breakout from it.

A break and close above $3 will be the first indication that the range has resolved in favor of the bulls. That opens the doors for a possible rally to $4 and then $5. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below $2, it will indicate that the pair has topped out in the medium term. That heightens the risk of a fall to $1.50.

Solana made a new all-time high on Jan. 19, but that proved to be a bull trap. The price has since been in a firm correction, indicating selling by traders.

SOL/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The bulls are expected to fiercely defend the $120 to $110 support zone. If they succeed, it will suggest that $110 is the new floor. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will sell on rallies to the 20-week EMA ($190). If the price turns down from the 20-week EMA, the pair may drop to $110 and swing between these two levels for a few weeks. A break and close below $110 could sink the pair to $80.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-week EMA. There is resistance at $205, but it is likely to be crossed. If that happens, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $260, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. Buyers will have to achieve a strong close above $260 to signal the start of a new uptrend. 

Cardano has been pinned below the $1.25 level since early 2022, but a minor positive is that the bulls are trying to make a comeback. 

ADA/USDT weekly chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

If buyers drive the price above $1.25, the ADA/USDT pair could pick up momentum. Usually, when the price breaks out of a large basing formation, it leads to strong uptrends. The pair may face minor resistance at $1.64, but it is likely to be crossed. The pair could then climb to $2.38.

Alternatively, if the price stays below $1.25, select short-term traders who may have bought at lower levels could be tempted to book profits. That could pull the price to the 50-week SMA ($0.59), which is a necessary support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 50-week SMA with strength, the bulls will try to push the pair toward $1.25. The pair may then remain range-bound between the 50-week SMA and $1.25 for a while.

World Liberty Financial is expanding its token holdings.

The Trump-backed DeFi project will “explore product development opportunities” with layer 1 blockchain Sui, and “plans to include Sui assets in ‘Macro Strategy,’” the project’s token stockpile. 

That’s according to the Sui Foundation, which outlined the plans in a Thursday blog post. 

Sui’s native token, which has a market value of over $9 billion, jumped as much as 18% on the announcement.

The Sui deal is the latest in a growing list of crypto projects cosying up to World Liberty Financial, which has raised $300 million through sales of its WLFI token to investors since October. 

The news comes as World Liberty Financial buys up $20 million worth of so-called Wrapped Bitcoin, Ether, and Move tokens days before crypto executives are set to visit the White House to discuss policy.

The Sui blockchain uses the Move programming language, and is often pinned as a faster, more scalable competitor to Solana. Sui has $1.5 billion worth of crypto locked in its DeFi protocols, per DefiLlama data.

The crypto tokens World Liberty Financial buys often benefit from a surge in investor interest. 

When World Liberty bought $2 million worth of the Move blockchain’s token in January, it soared some 23%. 

World Liberty Financial isn’t owned by President Donald Trump, but he promotes it and benefits from its success. 

Trump and his sons Donald Jr, Eric, and Barron receive a split of the proceeds from the project’s WLFI token sales and future revenue, along with the project’s founders and collaborators, which include longtime Trump ally Steven Witkoff. 

World Liberty Financial has been stockpiling crypto for months. 

At first, it wasn’t initially clear why, but last month, onlookers received some clarity when the project announced it had been building what it called a “strategic token reserve,” called Macro Strategy. 

The reserve is intended to mitigate market volatility, foster growth, and build trust, the project said in an X post. 

However, there may be more going on with the token reserve than the project lets on. 

A February investigation by Blockworks found that World Liberty Financial had courted crypto teams for token swap deals.

Representatives for World Liberty Financial approached crypto teams with the offer to sell them at least $10 million worth of its WLFI token with a 10% fee. If accepted, World Liberty Financial then purchased the same amount of the buyer’s crypto token, sources told Blockworks.

Two crypto project founders also told DL News they had been offered similar deals.

The Sui Foundation did not respond to a DL News request for comment. 

World Liberty Financial’s token reserve includes Wrapped Bitcoin and Ether, as well as Tron’s TRX token, Ethena’s ENA token, and Ondo Finance’s ONDO token, along with several others.

Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has introduced a proposal aimed at significantly lowering the tax rate on crypto gains from the current maximum of 55% to 20%.

This proposal seeks to classify cryptocurrencies as a new asset class under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, thereby aligning the tax treatment of crypto with that of traditional securities.

Currently, Japan categorizes crypto gains as miscellaneous income, subjecting investors to a steep tax burden. The proposed regulatory reform would transition the classification from the Payment Services Act to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, designating cryptocurrencies as “financial products.”

This change could pave the way for a potential spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Japan, which has been a topic of interest among industry stakeholders.

Akihisa Shiozaki, a member of Japan's House of Representatives and leader of the LDP’s Web3 working group, noted that the initiative aims to foster market development and enhance investor protection. The LDP is inviting public feedback on the proposal until March 31, after which it will be submitted to the Financial Services Agency (FSA).

In December, the Japanese government approved a revision to its tax regime, allowing corporations to avoid taxation on unrealized crypto gains if they hold the assets for the long term. The FSA is also expected to outline further directions for crypto regulation by June.

Industry leaders have expressed optimism regarding the proposal, viewing it as a positive step towards creating a more favorable environment for crypto investments.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}"

FXStreet




The global crypto market capitalization increased by 6.2% in the last 24 hours as traders took on bullish positions ahead of the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on Friday. Rather than double-down on BTC, sector-wide price trends show that investors are leaning towards altcoins. 





Top 10 Crypto assets performance | March 6 

United States (US) President Donald Trump’s decision to include four altcoins in the crypto strategic reserve has sparked expectations of more altcoin-friendly policy fallouts from the White House Crypto Summit. 

Notably, tokens like Chainlink (LINK), Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA), which have developed close links to the Trump administration in recent months, are witnessing considerable gains at press time on Thursday. 

Crypto AI tokens also scored substantial gains, with top assets like Near Protocol (NEAR) and Render Network (RNDR) posting 9% rallies apiece, outperforming the market average.

Bitcoin price pulled back below $89,900 on Thursday, down 2% from the 24-hour peak of $92,800.

With market sentiment dominantly bullish, investors are strategically leaning towards altcoins with high growth potential. 

Bitcoin ETFs posted another $38 million outflows on Wednesday.

This marks the third consecutive day of outflow this week, which evidently contributed to Bitcoin price retracement. 



Chainlink price action 

Given Chainlink’s recent partnership with Trump’s DeFi platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and global payments giant SWIFT, investors anticipate further integration for TradFi and DeFi during the White House Crypto Summit could spark more gains.

The New York State Assembly has introduced a new bill, targeting cryptocurrency-related fraud, including ""rug pulls,"" private key theft and undisclosed token interests. 

The bill, sponsored by Clyde Vanel, establishes new categories within the state’s penal code to address virtual token fraud, illegal rug pulls and fraudulent failures to disclose financial interests in tokens, aiming to bolster protections for investors in the growing digital asset market.

The bill comes amid increasing reports of crypto scams, with provisions that could impose penalties of up to $25 million for corporations and prison terms of up to 20 years for individuals found guilty of such offenses. 

Brazilian fintech company Méliuz announced that its board of directors has approved a new treasury strategy, allowing the allocation of up to 10% of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. 

The company has already purchased 45.72 Bitcoin for approximately $4.1 million, marking it as the first publicly-listed firm in Brazil to incorporate the cryptocurrency into its corporate reserves, according to a securities filing and reports from local news outlets.

The move reflects Méliuz’s aim to maximize long-term shareholder value through Bitcoin investments, joining a global trend of traditional finance companies adopting cryptocurrency strategies. 

The company specified that it will continue to monitor and analyze the strategy, including the potential for Bitcoin to become a primary strategic asset in its treasury, while acknowledging risks associated with market volatility and regulatory challenges.

Emirates NBD, Dubai’s largest bank, announced on Thursday a partnership with digital asset platform Aquanow to introduce cryptocurrency trading services through its digital banking arm, Liv X. 

The collaboration allows customers to buy, sell, and trade major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, via the Liv X app, marking a significant step in integrating digital assets into the UAE’s financial sector, according to a statement from the bank and reports from financial news outlets.

The initiative aligns with Dubai’s broader strategy to position itself as a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation, leveraging Aquanow’s infrastructure, which is licensed by the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).

Bitcoin extends recovery and trades above $92,000 on Thursday after rallying 5% in the last two days. A Glassnode report highlights that Bitcoin’s market reaction hinges on the $92,000, a key level for momentum, while $71,000 serves as critical support if BTC declines.

Chainlink extends its gains by more than 4% on Thursday, trading around $17.22 after rallying nearly 13% in the last two days. On-chain data suggest a rally ahead as LINK's long-to-short ratio reaches its highest monthly level and its funding rates are positive. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price extends its decline and trades below $80,000 at the time of writing on Friday, falling over 15% so far this week. This price correction wiped $660 billion of market capitalization from the overall crypto market and saw $3.68 billion in total liquidations this week.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged over 5% on Thursday, soaring past $91,000 after dipping below $82,000 just two days ago. The sharp rally comes as investors brace for the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on Friday, where the US government is expected to unveil new cryptocurrency policy initiatives.

US president Donald Trump and key administration officials are set to meet with cryptocurrency industry leaders to discuss the future of digital assets and potential regulatory frameworks. Confirmed attendees include Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong, Chainlink (LINK-USD) co-founder Sergey Nazarov, and Strategy (MSTR) co-founder Michael Saylor, among others.

US secretary of commerce Howard William Lutnick disclosed that Trump is set to unveil measures regarding the long-debated US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which could mark a shift in how the US government approaches digital assets.

The proposed reserve would see the US government acquiring approximately 200,000 bitcoin (BTC-USD) annually over a five-year period, eventually accumulating 1 million BTC.

Advocates argue that such a reserve could strengthen national financial security and provide a hedge against economic volatility, much like traditional commodity reserves such as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

However, skeptics warn that large-scale government involvement in bitcoin could disrupt market dynamics and raise regulatory concerns.

Last Sunday evening, Trump unveiled plans for a broader US Crypto Reserve, extending beyond bitcoin to include other digital assets like XRP (XRP-USD), Cardano (ADA-GBP), and Solana (SOL-USD).

Crypto investors have rushed to position themselves ahead of potential government intervention.

However, some analysts have suggested that experienced traders are taking a more cautious approach ahead of the event. ""This Friday marks a historic milestone — the first-ever White House Crypto Summit,"" QCP Capital analysts said in a report. ""However, without any concrete executive orders, funding commitments, or congressional backing in place, many in the market remain in wait-and-see mode.""

 Brazilian fintech unicorn Meliuz has reportedly purchased Bitcoin worth millions of dollars as part of its new treasury strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value. 

Brazilian fintech unicorn Meliuz said on March 6 that it has begun purchasing Bitcoin as part of a new treasury management strategy, joining a growing trend of traditional finance companies holding cryptocurrency assets.

Meliuz, which provides cashback and financial technology services, announced its entry into the cryptocurrency market with its board of directors approving the accumulation of up to 10% of the company’s cash in Bitcoin (BTC), local news agency Visno Invest reported.

According to the report, Meliuz has already completed its first Bitcoin acquisition, purchasing 45.72 Bitcoin for about $4.1 million at an average price of $90,296 per BTC.

The report said that with its Bitcoin treasury strategy, Meliuz is seeking long-term returns on the asset.

According to Visno, Meliuz also announced the creation of the Bitcoin Strategic Committee, which will conduct analysis to expand the strategy and be responsible for purchasing operations and related guidelines.

Additionally, the executive board will reportedly conduct a detailed analysis on whether to expand the Bitcoin strategy, including the possibility of adopting Bitcoin as the main strategic asset of the company’s treasury.

“The company’s management believes that the treasury strategy focused on the Bitcoin reserve has significant potential for maximizing value for the company and its shareholders,” Meliuz reportedly said.

The news on Meliuz’s Bitcoin strategy comes shortly after it announced changes to its board of directors on March 3, with Guilherme Bandeira — a major local Bitcoin advocate — joining the board.

“Together with the entire company team, led by founder and chairman Israel Salmen, we will ensure that Meliuz takes full advantage of the pioneering role of adopting the best monetary technology that has ever existed in the history of humanity,” Bandeira wrote in his Substack blog.

“After all, if Bitcoin is an excellent alternative to the US dollar, it is an even better alternative to the Brazilian real,” Bandeira noted.

The Bitcoin strategy adoption by Meliuz marks another milestone in the growing acceptance of BTC as a crucial investment tool in the global TradFi, following the lead of firms Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japanese Metaplanet.

While acknowledging the promises of Bitcoin accumulation, Meliuz does not ignore potential risks arising from such investments.

According to a local report by the financial data platform InfoMoney, Meliuz admits that Bitcoin investment is associated with risks like volatility and potential regulatory challenges.

Addressing these issues will also be subject to monitoring and analysis by the Bitcoin Strategic Committee, the report notes.

The news comes shortly after Brazil’s central bank finished a public consultation on the proposal to ban stablecoin transfers to self-custodial wallets on Feb. 28, 2025.

According to Chainalysis, Brazil was the second-largest market globally in terms of stablecoin transactions in 2024, with the country’s stablecoin transaction volumes accounting for 60% of its crypto market.

 Solana trading volumes briefly topped the entire Ethereum ecosystem’s in February. 

Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes still rival those of the entire Ethereum ecosystem despite a steep dropoff in memecoin trading activity, asset manager VanEck said. 

In February, Solana’s share of total onchain DEX volume topped 43%, briefly surpassing the combined DEX volume of Ethereum and its layer-2 scaling networks, according to a March 5 report by VanEck. 

They declined to around 30% in March, slightly below the Ethereum ecosystem’s roughly 40% share, the data shows. 

“Despite the Memecoin Meltdown, Solana DEX volumes are still holding their own — roughly matching the entire ETH ecosystem (L1 + L2s),” Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of research, said in a post on the X platform.

Related: Solana shorts spike amid memecoin scandals

Activity on the Solana network declined in February after a series of memecoin-related scandals soured sentiment among retail traders. 

‘[T]he impact was severe, with stablecoin transfers — the backbone of on-chain trading — plummeting (-80%) from January levels,” VanEck said. 

On Feb. 14, Libra, a memecoin seemingly endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei, erased some $4.4 billion in market capitalization within hours of launching. 

Since January, traders have lost approximately $2 billion across 800,000 wallets on Official Trump (TRUMP), US President Donald Trump’s official memecoin. 

Memecoin trading, largely tied to the popular Pump.fun platform, comprises roughly 80% of the Solana blockchain network’s revenues, according to the report. 

New token launches on Pump.fun are down more than 80% since January. Memecoins bootstrap liquidity on Pump.fun before graduating to Raydium, Solana’s most popular DEX. 

As of March 6, Raydium has more than $1.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama.

“Solana has been the standout performer in the current crypto market cycle, with its token price rising (+191%), on-chain revenues (excluding MEV) surging (+700%), and stablecoin supply increasing (+291%) in 2024,” VanEck said. 

“One of the biggest drivers of Solana’s growth has been memecoin trading,” VanEck added, noting that Pump.fun generated more than $577 million in fees in just over a year.

        Share    

Bitcoin price wavered on Thursday as investors embraced a risk-off sentiment amid the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and its top trading partners.

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $90,000, up 15% from its lowest level this month, while American stock indices like the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 dropped by over 1%.

BTC has two key catalysts that may push its price to $100,000 in the next few days. First, Donald Trump will host the first-ever crypto summit in Washington. This summit will feature top industry leaders, including Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, and Tether’s Paolo Ardoino.

The most notable outcome of the summit will be the launch of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by Donald Trump. Such a reserve could help boost Bitcoin’s price due to the size of the government’s balance sheet.

One option would be to transform the Bitcoin the government holds into reserves. It currently holds 198,109 coins worth over $17.9 billion. Another option would be to push the Cynthia Lummis bill which proposes that the government buy and hold 200,000 coins annually for five years, a move that would lead to substantial demand.

David Sacks, the AI and crypto czar, made the case for these reserves, noting that the U.S. government had sold 195,000 coins in the last decade. It raised $366 million from these sales, significantly lower than their current value of $17 billion.

Over the past decade, the federal government sold approximately 195,000 bitcoin for proceeds of $366 million. If the government had held the bitcoin, it would be worth over $17 billion today. That’s how much it has cost American taxpayers not to have a long-term strategy.

Another potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s price on Friday will be the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data. This report will provide more insight into the state of the American economy at a time when it is facing substantial headwinds.

Wall Street analysts expect the NFP report to show that the economy added 159,000 jobs in February, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.0%. There is a possibility that the jobs report will fall short of expectations due to Elon Musk’s job cuts. An ADP report released on Wednesday showed that the private sector added just 77,000 jobs in February.

A weak NFP report would be bullish for Bitcoin’s price as it could increase the likelihood of the Fed delivering more rate cuts.

The weekly chart shows that Bitcoin’s price is showing signs of bottoming out after plunging to a low of $78,100 last week. It has remained above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since Aug. 5.

Bitcoin has also formed two hammer patterns. A hammer candlestick comprises a long lower shadow and a small body and is one of the most bullish reversal patterns. It also remains above the 50-day moving average.

Therefore, Bitcoin’s price is likely to continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $100,000. This view will become invalid if it drops below the support at $80,000.

 Bitcoin ETFs continue limiting BTC’s recovery as institutional investors have pulled back, “reacting to macroeconomic uncertainties,” such as Trump’s trade tariffs. 

Bitcoin’s recent rally above the key psychological threshold of $90,000 proved short-lived, with analysts pointing to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and a significant reduction in institutional investments in cryptocurrency markets.

Bitcoin (BTC) staged a near 10% recovery to above $95,000 on March 2 before forming a double-top chart pattern around $94,200 on the daily chart, a setup that indicates an imminent price decline.

Bitcoin bottomed at around $81,400 the following day and has since been struggling to remain above the $90,000 mark, TradingView data shows.

Multiple factors are contributing to the Bitcoin slump, including US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.

The analyst told Cointelegraph:

The US spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing their fourth consecutive week of net negative outflows after recording over $2.6 billion worth of cumulative net outflows during the last week of February, Sosovalue data shows.

Beyond ETF inflows, macroeconomic factors are also pressuring Bitcoin’s price action, Lee said, adding:

Still, analysts remained optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory for late 2025, with price predictions ranging from $160,000 to above $180,000.

Related: Rising Bitcoin activity hints at market bottom, potential reversal

Some of the concerns related to a potential global trade war may be alleviated with next week’s announcements, according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo.

The implementation of US tariffs has “weighed in” on crypto markets after going into effect, leading to declines in digital assets and traditional equities, the analyst said, adding:

Trade policy uncertainty will likely “keep sentiment guarded” while the increased likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts may “suggest a potential turnaround” for crypto markets, added the analyst.

Meanwhile, the wider crypto market is still recovering from the $1.4 billion Bybit hack on Feb. 21, marking the largest hack in crypto history.

 A liquidity crisis occurs when an organization lacks sufficient liquid assets, such as cash or assets readily convertible to cash, to meet its short-term financial obligations.Major hacks in the cryptocurrency exchange sector can trigger liquidity crises in several ways. The immediate depletion of assets, especially from compromised hot wallets, can severely impact an exchange’s ability to process withdrawals and maintain normal operations. Beyond the direct financial loss, panic-driven user withdrawals can escalate a crisis. Once news of a hack spreads, customers may rush to withdraw their assets, fearing further losses. This sudden spike in withdrawal requests puts immense pressure on an exchange’s remaining liquid reserves, making it even harder to maintain solvency. Additionally, the broader market confidence in the exchange can deteriorate, leading to a decline in trading activity, reduced investor interest and further capital flight. Without quick and strategic intervention, such liquidity shocks can spiral into insolvency, forcing the exchange to suspend operations or seek external financial assistance.

 When a hack is detected, exchanges must act swiftly to contain the damage and protect user funds. The first steps include:Freezing asset movements: Exchanges suspend withdrawals and deposits to prevent further losses. In 2019, Binance halted all transactions for a week to conduct a security review, while KuCoin immediately froze funds and transferred assets from compromised wallets.Transparent communication: Quick and clear messaging helps maintain user trust and prevent panic. In a 2025 Bybit hack, the CEO addressed the community within 30 minutes and held a livestream within an hour. Binance, during its 2019 hack, tweeted “Funds are #SAFU” to reassure users.Industry coordination: Competitor exchanges help by blacklisting hacker addresses, making it harder for stolen funds to be moved or laundered. This was seen in Bybit’s 2025 hack when major platforms blocked suspicious transactions.Security investigations: Exchanges mobilize internal forensics teams to identify the breach, whether it’s a hot wallet compromise, leaked API keys or a smart contract exploit. Logs are analyzed, vulnerabilities patched and affected systems secured.Ensuring user confidence: While technical details aren’t always immediately disclosed, exchanges assure users that a thorough security check is underway.​Did you know? The first 24 hours after discovering a cyberattack are often called the “golden hours.” Actions taken during this critical period can significantly impact the extent of damage and the success of recovery.

​Did you know? The first 24 hours after discovering a cyberattack are often called the “golden hours.” Actions taken during this critical period can significantly impact the extent of damage and the success of recovery.

 Once the immediate threat is neutralized, exchanges focus on identifying the breach and securing assets. This phase involves determining exactly what happened, how the attack was executed and the extent of the financial loss.Identifying the causeA forensic investigation is launched to uncover the technical root of the hack. The 2016 Bitfinex breach was traced to a multisignature wallet vulnerability, while Bybit’s 2025 cold wallet exploit revealed new attack vectors in multisig security. Exchanges analyze logs and system activity to pinpoint weaknesses, whether from leaked private keys, software bugs or exploited smart contracts.Quantifying financial impactExchanges must quickly calculate how much was stolen and which assets were affected.

 As briefly explored earlier, hacks often lead to an immediate liquidity crisis for an exchange. Customers who hear about a breach may rush to withdraw funds when the exchange has a sudden hole in its balance sheet. Managing solvency and liquidity is a critical step. Insurance and emergency reserves Well-prepared exchanges tap into insurance funds or emergency reserves set aside for such events. Binance provides a textbook example: After $40 million in Bitcoin was stolen in its 2019 hack, Binance announced it would use its reserves to cover the incident in full, assuring that “no user funds will be affected.”​Binance’s Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) — an insurance pool funded by trading fees — absorbed the loss and users were fully reimbursed. This proactive planning kept Binance solvent and preserved user confidence. Not all exchanges have large insurance funds, so other liquidity strategies come into play. Corporate capital, loans and investorsOne approach is to use corporate capital or seek emergency financing. For instance, in response to the Bybit hack, the exchange demonstrated a commitment to transparency and customer protection. It initiated efforts to trace the stolen funds, with reports indicating that 77% of the stolen assets remain traceable on the blockchain.Bybit's approach to managing the aftermath of the hack mirrors strategies employed by other exchanges facing security challenges. For example, after a $530 million hack in 2018, Japan’s Coincheck famously used its own capital to reimburse customers to the tune of 46.3 billion yen (about $422 million)​. This was a massive outlay, but it prevented a loss of customer funds and helped Coincheck avoid bankruptcy. In South Korea, Bithumb’s $30 million hack in 2018 was similarly met with a promise to “pay back victims using its own reserves,” which experts praised as the right move​. In cases where internal funds aren’t enough, exchanges have turned to external loans or investors to shore up liquidity. A notable case was Liquid Global’s hack in 2021. The Japanese exchange lost around $90 million, raising fears of insolvency. To respond, Liquid secured a $120 million loan from FTX a week later​. This emergency credit provided the liquidity to cover user withdrawals and stabilize operations (FTX went on to acquire Liquid later). Such industry partnerships can act as a backstop in crises, with a bigger exchange or investor acting as a lender of last resort to prevent a domino effect in the market.Suspension of activity Exchanges may also temporarily suspend certain services to manage liquidity. It’s common to keep trading open (to avoid wider market panic) but pause withdrawals until a recovery plan is set. This was seen in the Binance case, where trading continued during the week withdrawals were frozen​. Bybit’s 2025 hack response was unusual in that it kept withdrawals and services running uninterrupted​, which was possible only because Bybit could immediately guarantee 1:1 reserves for all customers​. In most scenarios, some freeze is necessary to prevent a “run on the bank” scenario while the exchange evaluates its financial standing.Assurances Finally, communication plays a big role in liquidity management. Exchange executives must convince users and stakeholders that the platform remains solvent. This often involves publishing proof of reserves or making public statements of assurance. Bybit’s leadership, for instance, emphasized that “all client assets are backed one-to-one” despite the $1.5 billion theft​, effectively saying they could absorb the hit. Similarly, Bitfinex in 2016 chose to “generalize” losses across users, implementing a 36% haircut on all accounts but crucially accompanying that with BFX tokens as IOUs to compensate users over time. That difficult decision kept Bitfinex afloat when a total immediate payout was impossible. Within eight months, Bitfinex had redeemed all the tokens at full value​, demonstrating a full recovery and restoration of liquidity.

 After stabilizing operations and finances, attention turns to recovering the stolen assets and compensating affected users. Technically, cryptocurrency theft doesn’t always mean the funds are gone forever. The open ledger of blockchain can help track and sometimes reclaim assets. Exchanges often collaborate with blockchain analytics firms and law enforcement to trace stolen funds. In many instances, the hacker’s addresses are flagged within hours. For example, within 18 minutes of Bybit confirming its hack, investigators had identified the hacker’s wallet and were tracking movements​. Similarly, KuCoin quickly published the wallet addresses the thief used​, enabling a global effort to monitor and freeze the funds.Cooperation with other industry players is vital in fund recovery. Because hackers typically try to launder funds through other exchanges or swap services, exchanges worldwide form a defensive alliance. As mentioned, major platforms may blacklist addresses linked to hacks, effectively freezing the stolen assets in place if the hacker attempts to cash out on a compliant exchange​. In the KuCoin 2020 hack (~$285 million stolen), this collaboration paid off: Tether blacklisted about $22 million USDT belonging to the hacker, and numerous crypto projects like Ocean Protocol, Aave and others either disabled or upgraded their contracts to render the thief’s tokens unusable​. Through these collective actions, an estimated 84% of KuCoin’s stolen funds were eventually recovered​. KuCoin’s insurance fund covered the remaining gap, so users were fully compensated​. In some extraordinary cases, negotiation with the attackers can lead to fund returns. Crypto history has seen “white hat” hackers who return money for a bounty or even outright negotiations where a portion is returned to avoid prosecution. The Poly Network hack of 2021 is a striking example (though it was a DeFi platform, not a centralized exchange): A hacker exploited $610 million due to a code flaw, then communicated with Poly Network and returned nearly all funds after being offered a reward and a security adviser position​.While exchanges typically involve law enforcement rather than pay ransoms, they have also offered bug bounties for information leading to recovery. For instance, Bitfinex offered rewards to hackers or informants after its 2016 hack. Years later, the US DOJ seized a significant portion (94,000 BTC) of the Bitfinex stolen funds in 2022​, which are now pending return through legal processes. User compensation is the flip side of fund recovery. If users lose assets, how and when will they be made whole? The ideal scenario is immediate full reimbursement, as done by Binance, Coincheck, Upbit, Bithumb, KuCoin and others discussed earlier.In cases where not all funds can be recovered or instantly repaid, exchanges have innovated, like when Bitfinex issued BFX tokens (essentially debt tokens) to customers equal to their loss, which were tradable and later redeemable.Did you know? Mt. Gox, unfortunately, exemplified the worst case: it went into bankruptcy, and users have waited years for partial refunds through legal bankruptcy proceedings. (Mt. Gox’s trustee is still distributing the recovered coins as of  Feb.2025, illustrating the slow path of legal compensation.)

 Major hacks invariably draw the attention of regulators and law enforcement, adding another dimension to crisis response. Exchanges must navigate legal obligations to report hacks and often solicit help from authorities to investigate. In many jurisdictions, a hack triggers an automatic review by financial regulators. For example, following the $530 million Coincheck hack in Japan, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) immediately issued an administrative order requiring Coincheck to improve operations and protect clients​. The FSA even raided Coincheck’s offices a week later to ensure evidence was preserved and that the exchange was taking proper steps​. This level of direct regulatory action underscores how serious such incidents are viewed in regulated markets.Working with regulators can also help an exchange in crisis. Officials may allow an exchange to continue operating under supervision if they believe the team is acting in good faith to resolve the issue (Coincheck was allowed to keep running while it formulated a compensation plan under FSA oversight​). However, if negligence is suspected, regulators can suspend licenses or even force operations to halt to protect consumers. In South Korea, after incidents like the Bithumb hack, government agencies like KISA (Korea Internet and Security Agency) got involved to investigate security lapses​. Exchanges are generally expected to report breaches promptly under cybersecurity and financial regulations, and failure to do so can result in penalties.Law enforcement plays an important role, especially for international hacks. Exchanges often coordinate with police, cybercrime units, and agencies like the FBI or Interpol. Bybit’s 2025 hack, for example, saw the exchange collaborating with regulators and law enforcement to address the hack, setting an example of public-private partnership in cyber investigations​. Such cooperation can facilitate freezing assets across borders and increase the chances of catching the perpetrators. It also helps exchanges demonstrate compliance and due diligence, which may be critical for maintaining their operating licenses.High-profile hacks often become catalysts for regulatory change. After the Mt. Gox collapse in 2014, Japan was among the first countries to introduce a licensing regime for crypto exchanges. By 2017, exchanges in Japan had to register with the FSA and meet minimum standards for security, asset segregation and audits​. The Coincheck hack then prompted the FSA to tighten those rules further (and led to the formation of a self-regulatory body to oversee exchanges)​. Regulators in other countries also pay attention: A massive hack might lead to new guidance on how much of an exchange’s funds must be kept in cold storage, requirements for proof-of-reserves or mandatory insurance coverage.In the US, while there isn’t a federal exchange license yet, a hack affecting US customers could invite SEC or CFTC scrutiny, and certainly, state regulators would ask questions if the exchange was under their jurisdiction.

The Coincheck hack then prompted the FSA to tighten those rules further (and led to the formation of a self-regulatory body to oversee exchanges)​. 

Regulators in other countries also pay attention: A massive hack might lead to new guidance on how much of an exchange’s funds must be kept in cold storage, requirements for proof-of-reserves or mandatory insurance coverage.

In the US, while there isn’t a federal exchange license yet, a hack affecting US customers could invite SEC or CFTC scrutiny, and certainly, state regulators would ask questions if the exchange was under their jurisdiction.

 Surviving a hack forces exchanges to overhaul security, improve risk management and adopt best practices to prevent future breaches. Key improvements include:Cold storage and multisig wallets: Exchanges now store most funds in cold wallets with multisignature access, reducing reliance on vulnerable hot wallets. After its hack, Coincheck adopted a stricter cold-wallet-plus-multisig system.Infrastructure upgrades: Exchanges like KuCoin, after its 2020 breach, upgraded firewalls, intrusion detection and key management protocols to enhance security.Stronger internal security controls: The Binance 2019 hack exposed weaknesses in API keys and 2FA, prompting the industry to adopt hardware security keys, AI-powered fraud detection and stricter withdrawal monitoring. Many exchanges now require dual authorization for large transactions.Crisis response improvements: Exchanges now operate Security Operations Centers (SOCs) for 24/7 monitoring and conduct regular security audits. Bug bounty programs have become standard, incentivizing ethical hackers to find vulnerabilities before attackers do.Industry-wide resilience: Lessons from major hacks have led to proof-of-reserves (PoR) audits, stricter KYC/AML policies and inter-exchange blacklists to prevent stolen funds from being laundered. Binance’s SAFU fund set a precedent for user protection reserves.Stronger regulatory frameworks: Hacks like Mt. Gox and Coincheck led Japan and other countries to enforce exchange licensing laws, security compliance checks and transaction monitoring.While hacks remain a threat, past incidents have driven major improvements in crisis management and user protection, strengthening trust in the crypto ecosystem.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom invited Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on the Democrat's newly-launched 'This is Gavin Newsom' podcast.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom found common ground with Turning Point USA founder and conservative activist Charlie Kirk when the liberal governor – who has been rumored to be eyeing a 2028 presidential run – agreed that biological men in women's sports is ""deeply unfair.""

""The young man who's about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports, that shouldn't happen,"" Kirk said on Newsom's debut episode on his new podcast, ""This is Gavin Newsom,"" on Thursday. ""You, as the governor, should step out and say no. Would you do something like that? Would you say no men in female sports?""

""Well, I think it's an issue of fairness,"" Newsom replied. ""I completely agree with you on that. It's deeply unfair.""

Kirk further pressed Newsom on whether he would condemn the recent victory of a transgender track athlete with a more than 40-foot jump at Jurupa Valley High School in Southern California. Newsom didn't directly address the win, but said ""it's a fairness issue.""

""So that's easy to call out the unfairness of that,"" Newsom, the Democratic Party's torchbearer, said. ""There's also a humility and a grace… these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.""

""So both things I can hold in my hand,"" the governor continued. ""How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think you know is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue?""

Transgender athletes in California have long been protected prior to Newsom's administration under AB 1266, also known as the School Success and Opportunity Act. The law was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, in August 2013. 

However, Senate Bill 132, also known as the Transgender Respect, Agency and Dignity Act, allows inmates to request cells and searches that align with their gender identity, which Newsom signed in September 2020.

Newsom agreed that trans issues are something his party is ""getting crushed on,"" which Kirk said he should express ""compassion"" about while calling out cases like the recent incident in Jurupa Valley High School as ""not fair."" The portion of the conversation came up after Kirk told Newsom to ""get better ideas"" if Democrats want to make a comeback among the younger generation. 

The student, AB Hernandez, won an invitational meet on Feb. 22, booting out a female runner-up who had jumped just over 32 feet in their competition category. Hernandez also took first place in two other events at the meet. 

The wins come as all Senate Democrats voted against a bill that would ban transgender women from women's sports nationwide last month. The bill failed to meet the 60-vote threshold needed in the upper chamber, with lawmakers voting along party lines 51-45.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled, ""Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"" in February, which said transgender athletes in women sports is ""demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls."" The order requires institutions receiving federal funding to abide by Title IX and follow the definitions of biological sex.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, used the inaugural episode of his new podcast to break from progressives by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls to compete in female sports.

Newsom made his declaration in an extended conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old who built the influential Turning Point USA organization that helped President Donald Trump increase his support last fall among the youngest generation of voters. Kirk, like Trump, has been a vocal opponent of allowing transgender women and girls to participate. 

“I think it’s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness — it’s deeply unfair,” Newsom told Kirk on “This is Gavin Newsom.”

“I am not wrestling with the fairness issue,” continued Newsom, who played varsity baseball as a college student. “I totally agree with you. … I revere sports. So, the issue of fairness is completely legit.”

The governor’s comments are the latest in Democrats’ efforts to reconcile a 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House and gave Republicans control of both chambers of Congress. Among the disagreements since November is how much cultural issues – as opposed to economic policy and other matters – explain the party’s losses.

Overall, polling suggests that allowing transgender female athletes to play on women’s teams isn’t broadly popular. Even most Democrats — around 7 in 10 — oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women’s sports, according to a January New York Times/Ipsos poll. A 2023 Gallup poll also found that Democrats were divided on whether transgender people should be able to play on sports teams that match their current gender identity.




Newsom, who has long positioned himself as a social progressive, drew sharp rebukes from LGBTQ advocates.

“Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,” said California Assemblyman Chris Ward and state Sen. Carolina Menjivar, who lead the state’s LGBTQ legislative caucus. “We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks.”

Tony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, said he was “disappointed and angered” by Newsom’s statements and that they “added to the heartbreak and fear” the transgender community feels under the Trump administration.

“Right now, transgender youth, their families, their doctors, and their teachers are facing unprecedented attacks from extremist politicians who want to eviscerate their civil rights and erase them from public life,” Hoang said. “They need leaders who will unequivocally fight for them.”

California law, enacted before Newsom became governor, requires schools in the state to allow transgender athletes to play on school sports teams consistent with their gender identity.

Beyond questions about athletics, there is less public support for broader restrictions on transgender rights and issues like medical care for transgender people, particularly among Democrats.

According to AP VoteCast, 55% of voters in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far, while about 2 in 10 said it’s been about right and a similar share said it hasn’t gone far enough. Voters were also slightly more likely to oppose than favor laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors who identify as transgender.

But Republicans have nonetheless sought to capitalize on the cultural touchstone that sports represent in America. 

Trump regularly hammered Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom’s fellow Californian, for supporting LGBTQ+ rights. Trump promised at his rallies to get “transgender insanity the hell out of our schools” and “keep men out of women’s sports.” His campaign also spent tens of millions of dollars on television and digital ads with the searing summation: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”

“Boy, did I see how you guys were able to weaponize it,” Newsom told Kirk, before yielding to Kirk’s protest and saying instead that the ads were an effective “highlight” during the campaign.

Since taking office, Trump has threatened to withhold federal money from schools that allow transgender athletes to compete in women’s’ or girls’ events. He declared victory on the issue recently when the NCAA, which governs collegiate athletics in the U.S., changed its policy to restrict women’s sporting events to those athletes who were assigned the female gender at birth. Previously, the NCAA had a sport-by-sport policy determined by the respective sports’ national or international governing bodies. 

Ward and Menjivar, the California lawmakers, said playing on a team consistent with one’s gender hasn’t been a problem “until Donald Trump began obsessing about it.”

Kirk, not Newsom, brought up the overall issue during their hour-plus conversation, which focused in part on how Democrats can rebuild a broader coalition of voters. Kirk pressed Newsom on whether he would speak out in opposition to transgender women athletes in competition.

The governor attempted to mitigate his comments, saying the discussion is about more than competitive advantage.

“There’s also a humility and a grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well,” Newsom said. “So, both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think is inherent in you but not always expressed on the issue and at the same time deal with the unfairness.”

Still, Newsom’s approach marks a different political tack than he took on same-sex marriage more than two decades ago. As San Francisco mayor in 2004, Newsom drew national attention for the first time by directing the city clerk to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses. 

The move prompted legal action that led to a 2008 ruling from the California Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage in the nation’s largest state. That decision came seven years before the U.S. Supreme Court established same-sex marriage as a national right. —

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

After missing two games due to right shoulder soreness, Ja Morant returned to the Memphis Grizzlies' lineup on Wednesday against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Asked how it was being back on the floor, Morant responded with one word: ""Terrible.""

Why?

""'Cause it was,"" Morant told reporters following the 120-103 loss, via Matt Infield of Action News 5. ""I should have been out, but I was out there, so, regardless of out, in, there's going to be something said.""

Leading up to the game, Morant was listed as questionable due to a right deltoid contusion. During the second quarter, he appeared frustrated on back-to-back possessions in which he attacked the basket, took contact and didn't get a foul call. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins erupted after the second one, earning a technical foul.

Asked about taking contact to the shoulder, Morant said, ""I think I just said I probably wouldn't have played, but I did. You can put your own answer. Regardless of what I say, it's going to get summarized anyway on a little part. So I'll let y'all put whatever y'all want out there for that.""

When a reporter prefaced a question by saying it wasn't the first time he'd played through the injury, Morant interrupted: ""I know. I've played like this all season, honestly. But it is what it is."" Asked if he felt he'd have to play through it for the rest of the season, Morant said, ""I don't know.""

Morant scored 24 points on 8-for-22 shooting (2-for-9 from 3-point range), with three rebounds, six assists, one steal and five turnovers against the Thunder, and the Grizzlies were outscored by 21 points in his 32 minutes. In his last seven games, Morant has shot 52 for 140 (37.1%) from the field and 6 for 46 (13%) from deep. It has been an inefficient season for Morant individually, and the shoulder issue could be playing a role in that, but Jenkins doesn't want him turning down open looks.

""I want him to work through this,"" Jenkins told reporters. ""There's no excuses. I mean, he's getting great looks. The way that the ball's moving, and he's in a wide-open close-out situation with a packed paint, I trust him to shoot it. I mean, he's struggling. We have other guys that are struggling, too. It's not just on him. So I think the ball movement's there, [as is] the intent on the shots we're trying to create, and they're not falling. We just gotta keep putting in the work. And [regardless of] what anyone's dealing with, we just gotta keep focusing on just taking those shots with confidence.""

Jenkins also said that the Thunder are ""absolutely"" the most connected defensive team Memphis has played against, and ""they threw a lot at him, with [high] pickup points and throwing multiple bodies and shifts at him."" He said that the Grizzlies handled their pressure ""decently"" and needed to respond to these situations with ""collective creation,"" but ""we just didn't make the shots when the ball got kicked out."" As a team, Memphis shot 6 for 23 (26.1%) on catch-and-shoot 3s against Oklahoma City (and Morant himself shot 1 for 4).

On Feb. 11, the Grizzlies had won 11 of 13 games and were second in the Western Conference. Since then, they've lost seven of nine and have fallen to fourth in the West. In a vacuum, though, this isn't necessarily concerning -- everybody loses to the Thunder, and the three losses that preceded this one were decided by a total of five points.

What's concerning is that, from Feb. 12 to now, Memphis has allowed 121.9 points per 100 possessions in non-garbage-time minutes, the league's fourth-worst mark in that stretch (they'd allowed 111.1 per 100, the league's sixth-best mark, before that), according to Cleaning The Glass. And they're banged up: All-NBA and Defensive Player of the Year candidate Jaren Jackson Jr. suffered a Grade 2 ankle sprain on Monday, and forward Santi Aldama, who really ties the room together, has missed the last two games with right calf soreness. Reserve forward John Konchar sat out against OKC due to right knee soreness, and newly signed big man Marvin Bagley III logged 15 minutes off the bench.

All of this is to say that this is a particularly inconvenient time for Morant to be limited by an injury. It's also, as the Memphis Commercial Appeal's Damichael Cole pointed out, the second time Morant has mentioned after a game that he had decided to play hurt. After being listed as questionable with left high soreness going into Memphis' home opener against the Orlando Magic in October, he suited up. He told reporters (via Action News 5) that ""Grizz Twitter"" had talked him into playing.

The good news for the Grizzlies is that the schedule is about to get easier: Their next four games are against the severely shorthanded Dallas Mavericks, then the New Orleans Pelicans, Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz. And it wasn't all shoulder-related doom and gloom for Morant after Wednesday's loss -- he also told reporters, via Bluff City Media, that the Grizzlies had to ""stay strong"" despite the recent losses, as it's a ""long season"" and there are more games to play.

""Hopefully, we just lock in, get guys back healthy and just go back to playing our basketball,"" Morant said. ""That's pretty much it. I mean, we done been through a whole season together, ups and downs, hard practices, traveling on the road, fatigue, everything, but we always seem to respond. So it's no different from here.""

In an exclusive interview with Sky Sports News, Jose Mourinho reflects on the racism accusations made against him by Galatasaray, explains why they were incorrect and looks ahead to Fenerbahce's Europa League path; Warning: This article contains language some may find offensive

Jose Mourinho has spoken for the first time, exclusively to Sky Sports News, about the racism allegation made against him.

Despite the furore, he says he felt calm and relaxed throughout because he feels the allegation, made by Galatasaray after the Istanbul derby with his Fenerbahce side, backfired.

""They were not clever in the way they attacked me, because they didn't know my past,"" he says.

""They didn't know my connections with Africa, with African people and African players and African charities.

""So instead of going against me, I think it boomeranged and went against them.

""Everyone knows who I am as a person. Everybody knows my bad qualities, but that is not one of my bad qualities. Exactly the opposite!

""The most important thing is I know who I am, and the attack accusing racism was a bad choice.""

On the accusation, he says: ""I just felt: how could they go so low?""

Mourinho, in the press conference after the 0-0 draw last Monday, accused the Galatasaray bench of ""jumping like monkeys"" to try and get his 19-year-old central defender Yusuf Akcicek sent off early in the game.

He was referring to head coach Okan Buruk.

I ask whether, in hindsight, Mourinho regrets the words he used. Was the choice of words clumsy?

Mourinho paused for a moment and thought. Then he shook his head, because he found Buruk's touchline antics hard to take.

""I cannot drop to his level,"" he says.

""Sometimes I do, and I ask myself, 'Why did you do it Jose? Why did you drop to that level?'""

He thinks a bit more. Then adds: ""It was just sad.""

He is grateful for the support he has had from people he knows, and people he does not.

""Probably even from people who don't like me the support was there,"" he says.

""I thank the people who didn't have a problem to speak [out], especially my boys, my former players. They were a very important voice.""

He means of course Chelsea title winners Didier Drogba and Michael Essien, who went onto social media to support their former manager.

As a result some Galatasaray fans took to the streets to burn Drogba shirts. He played 53 times for the club.

On the subject of shirts, Mourinho has a view on why his four-match ban was reduced, so quickly, to two matches.

Social media played its part.

""On the day my [four-match] ban was decided it comes to public eyes that the chief of the disciplinary committee is celebrating among friends with a Galatasaray shirt on,"" he says.

""Only here you can understand the dimension of it.""

Sky Sports News has contacted the Turkish Football Federation for comment.

So Mourinho's domestic ban is served. He can return to the domestic dugout.

He was always going to be in the technical area in Europe.

If Fenerbahce progress from the Europa League last 16 by beating Rangers, it could turn into a Jose Mourinho revenge tour.

Roma in the quarter-finals, maybe. Manchester United in the semi-finals, maybe. Spurs in the final, maybe.

Mourinho, though, is not thinking that way.

""In my mind I never feel about revenge. I never have that feeling because when I leave a club, I prefer to remember my good times at the club,"" he adds.

One of those clubs is Manchester United of course.

So what does Mourinho make of the goings on at Old Trafford?

On Ruben Amorim, who he helped tutor as a young coach, he says they have not spoken since he took the United job, apart from Christmas greetings.

But he is not enjoying watching him struggle.

""He's a good kid. Always very respectful to me. We had a good relationship for a few years. He knows I wish him well.""

And on Sir Jim Ratcliffe, and those job losses?

""To be honest I don't know much about what's happening,"" he says.

""I know Sir Jim Ratcliffe. I'm not saying we are big friends but we have a good relationship. I know him well. He invited me to his house a couple of times. I see him as a good person and a great businessman.

""Of course, I feel for some of the people that I know [losing their jobs], but hopefully it goes in the right direction.""

Did they get it right?

The brackets are set for the state high school basketball tournaments. Did the NMAA “process” get it right, as far as Valencia County teams are concerned? Yes.

Los Lunas girls probably could have been a slot higher, but Albuquerque High put a wrench into that over the past two weeks.

Valencia’s boys were the last team out in 4A, and didn’t do quite enough to get in. Belen was on the bubble, but a couple of solid late season victories carried the day.

State wrestling tournament

The state high school wrestling tournament may be overlooked as a real spectacle, and I mean that in a positive way. It has pageantry, athleticism, drama, tears of joy, tears of despair, passion and sportsmanship among the combatants. It can be difficult to cover as a journalist because of everything going on, but the state meet has it all.

R.I.P. Popeye Doyle

Two great giants of their craft chitchatted and chuckled as a small crowd moved closer to catch a word or two. This was in 1993, at the opening of the Jack Nicklaus-designed Las Campanas golf course near Santa Fe. The Golden Bear seemed surprised as Gene Hackman strolled up to say hi.

I was covering the event for an Albuquerque television station and got to witness Nicklaus, in my mind the greatest golfer ever, and Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner, share a moment together. What a treat.

This encounter once again came to mind last week after hearing the news of the death of Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, at their home in Santa Fe. Godspeed to both.

The Stinker Bowl

The Kansas City Chiefs performance in Super Bowl LIX brought back memories of my Minnesota Vikings’ four dud appearances in the big game about 50 years ago.

How could a team that was so good during the regular season suddenly be so bad, so flat? What happened to Patrick “Miracle” Mahomes? Did Andy “Fumblerooski” Reid make any impactful adjustments?

It was all very befuddling. Still, give credit to the Eagles for outplaying and outcoaching the Chiefs.

Brady, Brady, Brady

A lot has been made of Tom Brady as the FOX Sports color analyst. To me, he is OK, just not Super Bowl caliber at this point in his broadcasting career. Brady is a decent talker, but not particularly perceptive when it comes to analyzing the nuts and bolts of a game. Fans want more insight.

It wasn’t his fault, but did we need the repeated reminders, both verbally and graphically, that Brady is the GOAT? It was eye-rolling.

Bronco Redux

Athlon Sports ranked the hires of all 27 new major college football coaches, placing Utah State’s Bronco Mendenhall second overall with an A+ grade, ahead of some guy named Bill Belichick.

No surprise, although it was interesting that Athlon called Mendenhall’s 2024 season “a successful one-year stop at New Mexico.” I guess a 5-7 season at UNM qualifies as “successful.”

The magazine graded the hiring of New Mexico’s Jason Eck from Idaho as a B+, 14th on their list. That’s hopeful.

Logo etiquette

Is it tacky, not cool, to wear shirts or jackets that carry the logo of a former employer? Just asking for a friend.

Richard Pitino

The University of New Mexico men’s basketball team is in the midst of a really good season. Much credit goes to coach Richard Pitino, who makes quality adjustments, knows when to call time out and remains calm, even when things appear to be falling apart.

The one time things did fall apart was the loss to New Mexico State. The Aggies start the week with a 16-13 record, which is pretty good considering the turmoil the program has gone through.

NBA All-Star game

Would anyone really care if the NBA All-Star game and surrounding festivities went away? Obviously, many of the players don’t seem to care.

How about we scrap the whole thing, give the players a few days off and shorten the season by about a week?

Live from New York!

One can’t overestimate the significance that “Saturday Night Live” had on my generation. Right, Boomer?

While it could be hit or miss, SNL was just so different, so impactful, so irreverent.

In honor of the show’s 50th anniversary, I present my SNL Mount Rushmore: Dan Akroyd and Gilda Radner from the early days, Chris Farley, who was living in a van down by the river, and Will Ferrell, who needed more cowbell.

A long list of runners-up includes Eddie Murphy, Kate McKinnon, Dana Carvey, Kristen Wig, Tina Fey and John Belushi. Who’s on your SNL Mount Rushmore?

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Batting Around: Do you like the ABS challenge system? Is it better or worse than fully automated umpires?,https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/batting-around-do-you-like-the-abs-challenge-system-is-it-better-or-worse-than-fully-automated-umpires/,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 14:45:11 GMT","

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

Throughout the offseason, the CBS Sports MLB  experts will bring you a  weekly Batting Around roundtable breaking  down pretty much anything.  The latest news, a historical question,  thoughts about the future of  baseball, all sorts of stuff. Last week we picked our own walk-up music. This week we're going to tackle the automated strike zone challenge system.

Dayn Perry: I do like it, but I see it as a half-measure on the way  to full ABS, which is what I really want. The human eye is simply  incapable of judging borderline pitches with contemporary velocity and  movement profiles with anything approaching acceptable levels of  accuracy. This goes even for the highly trained eyes of major-league  umpires. The human element is for players on the field, not the fair  adjudication of the game. The challenge system is far better than the  alternative of 100% human calls, but it's still not making full and  proper use of the technology. I guess my one hope is that the ABS  challenge system helps ""re-train"" umps on what a ball/strike on the edge  is and that leads to some improvement, but full ABS is a much better  path toward getting a fair and accurate strike zone in place. 

Matt Snyder: I love this system and would much rather do it this way  than a full-on automated balls/strikes system. I realize that so many  people believe the home-plate umpires are bad, but they are actually  incredibly adept, generally speaking, at getting the balls and strikes  right for the most part. There will be missed calls, obviously, given  the level of difficulty in doing that job, and this system creates an  avenue to fix any egregious misses that could change the game. I also  like that this system is so streamlined. The dugout isn't involved at  all and there's hardly any delay. It's just an immediate decision from  the batter, catcher or pitcher and then it takes about five extra  seconds. It's outstanding.

R.J. Anderson: I like the challenge system. I think it's a fine compromise between the  two extremes. I'm not fond of the fully automated zone, so I see this as  a way to get the most egregious misses correct without abandoning how  the game is and has been throughout history. I do worry about potential  unintended consequences; for example, the equivalent to when instant  replay introduced those annoying ""came off the bag for a trivial amount  of time"" calls. The limited number of challenges might suppress that  becoming a widespread issue, but it is something to keep in mind if/when  MLB institutes the challenge system for regular and postseason play.  

Mike Axisa: I've softened up over the years. I used to be a hardcore robo-umps guy. After seeing full ABS in action in the minors, and seeing just how different the shape of the ABS zone is compared to human umpires, I'm off the train. It's tighter along the edges, which led to more walks in every minor league it was used, and who wants more walks? The challenge system is a good compromise. It's a way to correct the most egregious mistakes, and it does it quickly. MLB's umpires are very good -- they're the best in the world at what they do -- and they're getting better too. The data shows they miss fewer calls with each passing year. The challenge system is a good compromise between full human umps and full ABS. I'm a fan.

A recent study from the Ohio State University shows many Americans have faced some sort of sport-related mistreatment, even if they never played in organized sports.

The study, published in the International Journal of the Sociology of Leisure, survey data on 3,849 adults who participated in the National Sports and Society Survey, which was sponsored by Ohio State’ Sports and Society Initiative. They answered questions online between the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019.

The study shows nearly 40% of adults in America said they’ve face sport-related mistreatment, ranging from psychological and emotional to physical and sexual. Many of them reported experiencing mistreatment of more than one kind.

“Many people talk about how they hated middle school or high school because of recess or gym class and the abuse or shame they felt playing sports in that environment,” said Chris Knoester, co-author of the study and professor of sociology at The Ohio State University. “It just speaks to the pervasiveness of sport-related mistreatment in our society that we document in this research.”

Survey respondents have to answer the question, “have you ever been mistreated in your sports interactions?” Nearly 40% respondent yes, but they weren’t asked in what context they were mistreated. Researchers say the fact that many of them said they haven’t played in organized sports suggests the mistreatment could have happened during school recess, gym classes, among peers or even while watching sports.

The most common form of mistreatment was psychological or emotional, which was cited by 64% of those who said they were mistreated. One-quarter of those reporting mistreatment said it was physical in nature and 10% said it was sexual.

“The amount of mistreatment people report is remarkable. It really stands in contrast to the myth that sports are all good and wholesome and positive for those who play,” Knoester said.

However, the most common reason people say they were mistreated was because of the their weight, which was cited by 52% of respondents.

“Physical education classes and recess put your bodies on display in ways that don’t happen too commonly otherwise,” he noted. “And obviously weight is something that people observe and classmates or people in public may be quick to mistreat or ridicule others if their weight doesn’t conform to cultural expectations.”

Additionally, students who succeeded in academics and wasn’t involved athletically reported more mistreatment. More competitive settings also seemed to conjure more mistreatment.

Among the respondents, men and white people were more likely to face sports-related mistreatment. Knoester said this may be because previous studies have shown that Black people reported positive environments in sports, and that for men, the culture of masculinity may contribute to the mistreatment. Knoester said this includes ridicule, fighting, hazing and other forms of mistreatment that are more common for men than they are for women.

Knoester said the results could underestimate how much sports-related mistreatment occurs.

“These were adults remembering events from their childhood, so there may be a problem with recall,” he said. “And Americans are generally positive about sports, so they may not be inclined to report bad things that happened to them in that context.”

Overall, Knoester hopes the study brings awareness to the issue.

“Sports-related interactions aren’t always positive.  I think it is important to better understand how frequently negative interactions occur and what we can do as a society to improve the culture of sports, otherwise there is not a means in place for betterment,” he said.","{'href': 'https://spectrumnews1.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News 1'}"

Manchester United host Arsenal on Sunday in what is always a monster clash in the Premier League calendar.

MORE — Man United v Arsenal preview, prediction, how to watch info

But with United in the bottom half of the table, expectations levels will be low amongst the home faithful at Old Trafford as Ruben Amorim continues to struggle to implement his ideas and injuries have hit the Red Devils hard. With their season hinging on the UEFA Europa League and their last 16 ties against Real Sociedad coming up either side of this game against Arsenal, will Amorim rotate? He really doesn't have that many options off the bench due to injuries.

Arsenal aren't really in the title race anymore after a damaging week saw them cough up five points and Liverpool accelerated away from them. Still, Mikel Arteta's side are coming off the back of a huge 7-1 win at PSV in the UEFA Champions League in midweek and that will give them some extra confidence in attack.

Below is a look at the Manchester United vs Arsenal predicted lineups along with the latest team news.

——- Onana ——-

—- De Ligt —- Maguire —- Yoro —-

—— Mazraoui —- Ugarte —- Fernandes —- Dalot ——

—— Zirkzee —— Garnacho ——

——- Hojlund ——-

If you look at the injury list below, you can see United don't have many options. The only real decision to make is whether Lindelof starts ahead of Yoro at center back, while De Ligt and Maguire will both start as the latter is battling a back issue. In midfield Ugarte has also been struggling with a knock and if he isn't good to go Casemiro will start and Bruno Fernandes will likely start in a deeper role. The wing-backs will be Mazraoui on the right and Dalot on the left with Dorgu suspended, while Zirkzee and Garnacho are likely to get the nod underneath out-of-form Hojlund up top. Young striker Chido Odi will likely come off the bench against his former club Arsenal. United's best hope in this game is to sit back, soak up pressure and hope they can catch Arsenal on the counter or play long balls to Garnacho and Hojlund to chase after.

OUT: Jonny Evans (lower back), Toby Collyer (knock), Mason Mount (thigh), Luke Shaw (foot), Lisandro Martinez (torn ACL - MORE), Altay Bayindir (undisclosed), Patrick Dorgu (suspension), Kobbie Mainoo (undisclosed), Amad Diallo (ankle - out for season) | QUESTIONABLE: Harry Maguire (lower back), Manuel Ugarte (small issue)

——- Raya ——-

—- Timber —- Saliba —- Gabriel —- Lewis-Skelly —-

—— Odegaard —— Partey —— Rice ——

—— Nwaneri —— Merino —— Trossard ——

Arteta has the luxury of knowing Arsenal are basically already in the Champions League quarterfinals given their thumping win at PSV in midweek, so he will go with his full-strength side and aim to control the tempo in midfield. Calafiori could start over Lewis-Skelly at left back as the youngster had to be hooked in the first half at PSV after picking up a yellow card and he should have been shown a second. We could see Jorginho start instead of Partey in midfield but more likely is that Arteta will go with Odegaard, Partey and Rice from the start and that trio have been so good in recent weeks. Speaking of impressive, that moves us nicely on to Nwaneri. The teenager has been sensational and put in another fantastic display in midweek as he's so dangerous in the final third. Trossard has been excellent on the other wing too, while Mikel Merino continues to pop up with goals as an emergency striker. Another option up top is Riccardo Calafiori who came on and finished well against PSV and he could start in attack and Merino could move back to midfield. This Arsenal side has been forced to show off its impressive versatility and it's giving Arteta plenty of ways to rotate with Tierney, Zinchenko, Sterling and White all back in the rotation and able to step in if needed too. Arsenal will hope to score early and keep the pressure on United as they'll plan for their entire midfield and attack to move up the pitch seamlessly just like they did in midweek.

OUT: Kai Havertz (hamstring - MORE), Gabriel Jesus (torn ACL - out for season), Bukayo Saka (hamstring - MORE), Takehiro Tomiyasu (knee), Gabriel Martinelli (hamstring)","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

To the players who called her “Coach B,” Beulah Osueke was more than just a coach.



Some looked at her as a parent. Others, as an older sister. Sometimes she was their financier. Often she was their disciplinarian.



Osueke, 35, was whoever the girls basketball players at West Catholic Prep, a high school in Philadelphia, needed her to be — an experience that opened her eyes to their world of hardships.



Coaching helped her understand “the magnitude of injustice and how it manifests so early,” Osueke said, “and how it thwarts people’s — particularly Black people’s — opportunity to reach whatever dreams they had.”



Throughout her eight-year tenure, Osueke built the West Catholic Lady Burrs into a championship-winning program, securing six district titles and winning the school’s first basketball state title in 2021. But teaching teenage Black girls their worth and how to respond to discrimination is what she considers her biggest victory.

Osueke’s outreach shows how sports can be a grassroots tool for empowerment and teaching life lessons, said Ketra Armstrong, sport management professor and director of the Center for Race and Ethnicity in Sport at the University of Michigan. 



That’s more important now than ever, Armstrong said, as President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging executive orders dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs put in place to create equal opportunities for marginalized groups — leaving the future of education, sports and job opportunities in America uncertain.














“We can’t rely on the systems because many of the systems, they’re being cut,” Armstrong said. “Meaning the resources are being removed. But, you know, we have what we need to win.”



“We need a revolution of Beulahs. We need community activists in every corner,” she said. “That’s what it’s going to take.”

When Osueke got the coaching job at West Catholic in 2013, she began creating a culture of structure and discipline, which she immediately noticed was lacking.



“Initially I’m like, ‘Oh, these kids have bad attitudes, I’ve got to break them,’” said Osueke, who grew up in a middle-class Black family in the Houston suburbs. “But when I started building relationships with them ... I empathized with them.”



Osueke, who has a masters degree in clinical psychology, saw her own preconceived notions as a sign of a larger problem for Black students, who often face disproportionately harsher discipline in school.



“I think a lot of people that work with inner city kids, Black kids, don’t give them the luxury of being seen as human,” Osueke said.



A former high school and college hoops standout, Osueke’s coaching was shaped by feeling she didn’t have an advocate when she faced hardships in college.



“It felt extremely necessary for me to create a comprehensive program,” Osueke said, “an environment that not only communicated to my young girls their worth, but also showed them their potential because I realized that they were navigating a lot of barriers and challenges in their personal lives that would not allow them to optimize their performance on the court.”

She began with the basics: arrive at practice on time, follow the dress code, behave at home and in the classroom. She held fundraisers and designed team shirts to sell to go toward some of the girls’ athletic fees.



After going 0-18 her first season, West Catholic won five games the next. Stars blossomed under Osueke’s guidance.



Tamiah Robinson, a senior guard at the University of Louisiana who played at West Catholic from 2017-2020, credits Osueke with teaching her accountability. Whether making sure she completed seemingly insignificant tasks like chores, Robinson said Osueke helped her grow up “in ways that I never knew I needed.”



“It went a long way without me even realizing it,” Robinson said, “that as a young woman, as a Black woman, I need to handle what I need to handle first. And basketball comes second.”



That’s what University of Michigan’s Armstrong called “using the power of sport” to uplift.



Osueke “allowed her girls to take the lessons that they learned to be winners in basketball, to be winners in the game of life,” Armstrong said.











In 2016, one of Osueke’s star athletes, 18-year-old Akyra Murray, was the youngest of 49 people killed in the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, crushing both coach and team.



Osueke brought in a psychologist to help her players navigate their feelings. 



Some were frightened. Some were angry — one player broke a window in the school’s gym when the team came together to discuss what happened. 



One 15-year-old student felt numb. She had experienced 10 deaths in the previous three months.



It was more tragedy than Osueke could imagine suffering at that age, and it gave her a new perspective on what some of her players were living through.



“Just because I shared a gender identity and a racial identity with these girls, I did not know their whole world,” Osueke said.



She became more determined to help her players see what they could accomplish. That included routine mental health checks and providing for them in ways she could, including buying groceries for a player who didn’t have food at home.



The team’s most successful years came after Osueke put together all those pieces.



They won 11 straight games in 2020 enroute to a Philadelphia Catholic League championship. Osueke was named the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association Class 3A coach of the year. Their Class 3A state crown in 2021 was the school’s first state title ever, girls or boys.

Osueke advocated for her players when they weren’t supported at school. She also fought for them to be refereed fairly when it seemed they faced biased officials on the court.



Osueke estimated her team averaged 10 to 15 more foul calls than their white counterparts, and they did not get those same calls when their opponents clawed, pinched and otherwise fouled them. 



Osueke told her players to never argue with officials. She created practice drills in which she played the role of a referee who “thinks that the better-resourced girls or legacy teams should win.”



If anyone complained in practice, she made them run or do pushups, hoping the approach would help them far beyond basketball.



“We learned in practice how to go through those things,” said Daja Hosendorf, who played for Osueke from 2016-2019. “She talked to us so that we could correlate how those things in the games, how it correlates to how our life would be.”



Hosendorf, now studying at Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine in the Caribbean island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, uses that principle in her field.



“When I come across people that don’t see me as an equal,” she said, “I learned how to move past it.”

Osueke quit coaching full time in 2021 to make a broader community impact, though she still trains players when she has time.



She’s the Philadelphia-based executive director of New Voices for Reproductive Justice and is working on a project to help girls basketball coaches understand how race, class and other factors can impact student-athletes.



Advocacy continues to be among her biggest goals.



“Sports is such a prevalent presence. It’s a universal infrastructure,” Osueke said. “So we need to be utilizing it not just to score points or get money or get fame, but to pass along and plant seeds in the next generation of leaders.”

James Harden put up his first 50-point night with the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday and moved closer to Kobe Bryant in the NBA record books.

During the Clippers' 123-115 win over the Detroit Pistons at Inuit Dome, Harden recorded his 24th career 50-point game, putting him within one of Bryant for third-most in NBA history. As the 35-year-old guard posted 50 for the first time since December 2019, former President Barack Obama was in attendance with Clippers owner Steve Ballmer.

“Probably the reason why I played so well,"" Harden said afterward.

[Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for the 2025 MLB season]

Harden is averaging 22.1 points per game this season and has recorded four 40-point games this season. But scoring 50 is a mark that has eluded him since he did so 12 times during the calendar year of 2019, which included reaching 60 points three times.

As Harden closes in on Bryant, he still remains seven 50-point games away from Michael Jordan (31) and 94 from the record holder Wilt Chamberlain (118).

Harden's 50-point game was the eighth in Clippers' franchise history and first since January 2018 when Lou Williams did so against the Golden State Warriors. Harden is also part of a group of Clippers players that includes Williams, Bob McAdoo and World B. Free who have posted at least four 40-point games in a season.

He is also the second-oldest NBA player ever to score 50 points on zero days' rest after putting up 21 points against the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.

""To see him come out and score 50 on a back-to-back, at the age of 35, just says a lot about him,"" said Clippers coach Tyronn Lue. ""And competing every night and playing 38 minutes again on the back-to-back. But we needed every bit of it.""

Despite the historic night for Harden, he couldn't get a photo with Obama after the game.

Some good news for the conerback-needy Indianapolis Colts is that this year's free agent class at that position appears to have the most depth.

In a free agency preview article over at ESPN, one of the questions asked was, which position group is the deepest in 2025? And the answer was cornerback.

""There are a few strong options, but cornerback stands out. There are several good, every-down starters in their prime,"" wrote Mike Clay. ""Teams had three or more corners on the field 65% of the time last season, so this deep pool of corners will generate plenty of interest.""

As Clay notes, the free-agent cornerback position is led by DJ Reed, Carlton Davis, Byron Murphy, Paulson Adebo, Charvarius Ward, Kendall Fuller, and Asante Samuel Jr. A few veteran options include Darius Slay and Stephon Gilmore.

This, of course, is one of the biggest positional needs that GM Chris Ballard has to address this offseason. For the second year in a row, Ballard had to answer questions at his end-of-season press conference about the play of the secondary.

""We've got to get better,"" said Ballard about the cornerback and safety positions.

The Colts' pass defense finished the 2024 season ranked in the bottom third of the NFL in completion rate, passer rating, yards per pass attempt allowed, and pass deflections.

The addition of Lou Anarumo and his defensive scheme, which helped produce some productive defensive backfields in Cincinnati, can help with some of the heavy lifting when it comes to improved play. However, also a key part of that equation is Ballard making some additions as well.

From a salary cap standpoint, the Colts rank 18th in terms of spending power with over $34 million in available cap space.

The Los Angeles Chargers announced Wednesday night that they have released five-time Pro Bowl pass rusher Joey Bosa.

Bosa, 29, has played his entire nine-season career with the Chargers after they selected him with the No. 3 pick in the 2016 NFL Draft out of Ohio State. He was the league's Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2016 after tallying 10.5 sacks and made his first Pro Bowl in his second season.

He was a Pro Bowler for the fifth time in 2024 despite posting a career low in sacks (five) for a season in which he played at least six games.

Bosa was scheduled to play on the second season of a two-year, $40.36 million contract that was a restructure of a five-year, $135 million contract extension that he signed in 2020. He was due a $12.36 million roster bonus on March 12. By releasing Bosa, the Chargers save $25.36 million against the 2025 salary cap.

Injuries limited Bosa to a total of 14 games combined in the 2022 and 2023 seasons, and he hasn't a posted double-digit sack tally since recording 10.5 in 2021. But he remains a force when healthy and could be a coveted option for a team willing to take on his health risks and seeking to upgrade its pass rush.

The release of Bosa marks the end of a Chargers era. Bosa was drafted by the Chargers when they still resided in San Diego and leaves the team with 72 career sacks, the second most in franchise history behind Leslie O'Neal (105.5).","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Stephanie White

Stephanie White had been waiting for the moment when women’s basketball would change. 

She’s spent three decades at the top of the sport — first as an All-American at Seeger High School in rural Indiana, and then, less than an hour away, as the best player on the championship-winning 1999 Purdue Boilermakers. She was drafted to the Women’s National Basketball Association team the Charlotte Sting (now defunct), and soon returned to the Hoosier State to join the Indiana Fever for its inaugural pro season in 2000. The “W,” as she calls it, has come a long way since then.

“ The league has blown up,” White tells the Scene from Nashville. “ For a long time in the WNBA, we had not had the college fan follow their player to the WNBA and be as invested in their team as they were in college.  The momentum has all come together in a way that those of us who have been here since the beginning felt like it should and knew that it eventually would. I feel like, for women’s basketball and women’s sports, it’s been self-sabotage by the [TV] networks because of preconceived notions that people don’t care about it. It’s not true that people don’t care about it, and you can see that in the viewership.”

A recent WNBA bid anchored by big Tennessee name like former Gov. Bill Haslam, WNBA legend Candace Parker and country stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw made headlines recently. (The league passed on Nashville in favor of Cleveland — for the time being.) Athletes Unlimited, a WNBA-alternative women’s basketball pro league, schose the city for its four-week run, which ended March 2. 

Like many pro athletes, White began building experience as a coach as her playing days wound down. Job security can often boil down to wins and losses. Phone calls, offers and contracts fly around as soon as, or even before, a team reaches the off-season, as owners and athletic directors angle for next year’s success. After a few years with the Fever, White came to Vanderbilt in 2016 to lead the women’s basketball program. She sees Tennessee firmly as basketball country.

“ You think about Pat Summitt’s legacy and how much the Lady Vols generated interest in this area,” says White, “what Shea [Ralph] is doing at Vanderbilt, where there’s a renewed interest around the program. You have Louisville not too far away with Jeff Walz — just great basketball communities. Way back in the day, there was an [American Basketball League] team here in Nashville. Fan support for women’s basketball in this area is tremendous.”

Her reasons for making a home here reflect the geographic and cultural equation calculated by many residents. She has lots of family within a few hours’ drive, including an aunt in Nashville. Nashville’s size and popularity bring amenities like trendy restaurants and live entertainment — including lots of music and sports — while maintaining the feeling of a familiar community.

“Our kids are 13, 12 and 11-year-old twins,” says White. “The biggest thing for us is having that stability for them. We like it here, we like our community, and we know the city. I grew up in a small town, so you get that community feel, with access to all of the things that major cities can give you. We love going to new restaurants, going to see the Preds and Nashville SC. My son plays club soccer here — we’re pretty ingrained in the sports and culture community.”

White surprised the WNBA when she left the Connecticut Sun in October, a year before her contract was set to expire. She helped lead the team to the WNBA semifinals in 2024 and took home the league’s Coach of the Year award in 2023. Within weeks, the Indiana Fever announced that White would return to the program for a third time, steering an exciting roster of young stars led by standout shooting guard Caitlin Clark.

At least in part, the decision rested on being a weekly drive, rather than a flight, from her Brentwood home.

Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders will be the first two quarterbacks selected in next month’s NFL draft

AP Mock NFL Draft: Giants Trade up to Take Cam Ward No. 1 and Raiders Move up for Shedeur Sanders

Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders will be the first two quarterbacks selected in next month’s NFL draft.

Where they go is still uncertain.

The first three teams — Titans, Browns and Giants — each need a quarterback but Ward and Sanders aren’t locked in at 1-2 like Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels in 2024 and Bryce Young and C.J. Stroud in 2023.

Edge rusher Abdul Carter and two-way star Travis Hunter are higher-rated prospects on many draft boards and there's no consensus on the No. 1 overall pick. Still, franchises are built on quarterbacks. 

The first edition of the AP’s 2025 mock draft says Ward and Sanders will go 1-2 after two teams make trades to move up: 



  1. New York Giants (mock trade with the Titans): CAMERON WARD, QUARTERBACK, MIAMI
 

Giants coach Brian Daboll wanted general manager Joe Schoen to trade up to get Daniels last year but the Washington Commanders took him at No. 2 and he led them to the NFC championship game. New York pursued Matthew Stafford but he stayed with the Rams. The Giants could sign a veteran like Aaron Rodgers or Russell Wilson or go after Sam Darnold. Trading up to get Ward would be a long-term solution at the most important position.

Ward led the nation with 39 touchdown passes, finished second with 4,313 yards passing and tied for first with 74 throws of 20-plus yards while leading the Hurricanes to a 10-3 record.

Titans GM Mike Borgonzi needs a sure pick and would land a defensive player at No. 3 while adding another asset. Mock trade: Giants get No. 1 pick and a fifth-rounder (168) for the No. 3 overall pick and a second-rounder (34).



  2. Las Vegas Raiders (mock trade with the Browns): SHEDEUR SANDERS, QUARTERBACK, COLORADO
 

The best-case scenario for the Raiders would be to stay at No. 6 and have Sanders fall to them but they can’t take that chance. Tom Brady has mentored Sanders, who won’t be intimidated by high expectations.

Sanders has his detractors and some of the criticism he receives is unfair because it’s based on opinions of his personality. He’s Prime Time’s son and Deion Sanders had plenty of critics on his way to the Hall of Fame. 

The Browns traded a slew of picks to get Deshaun Watson in 2022 in what may end up being the worst trade in league history. Mock trade: Raiders get No. 2 pick and a fifth-rounder (165) for the No. 6 overall pick, and two third-rounders (68 and 73).



  3. Tennessee Titans (mock trade with Giants): ABDUL CARTER, EDGE RUSHER, PENN STATE
 

The Titans trade down and still get the premier pass rusher in the draft. Carter had 12 sacks and 24 tackles for a loss last year for Penn State.



  4. New England Patriots: TRAVIS HUNTER, CORNERBACK/WIDE RECEIVER, COLORADO
 

The Heisman Trophy winner wants to be a two-way player in the NFL. The Patriots need plenty of help at several positions so he’d be a perfect fit.



  5. Jacksonville Jaguars: MASON GRAHAM, DEFENSIVE TACKLE, MICHIGAN
 

The Jaguars need to upgrade both sides of the trenches and the versatile Graham could be the best interior defensive lineman in the draft.



  6. Cleveland Browns (mock trade with Raiders): WILL CAMPBELL, OFFENSIVE TACKLE, LSU
 

A left tackle who could protect a quarterback’s blindside for a decade is probably the second-most valued position on offense. The 6-foot-6, 319-pound Campbell is athletic and agile. He faced elite talent and is ready for NFL battles.



  7. New York Jets: TETAIROA McMILLAN, WIDE RECEIVER, ARIZONA
 

The Jets have several needs but can’t pass up the top wideout in the draft. Pairing McMillan with Garrett Wilson gives whoever ends up playing quarterback a dynamic tandem.



  8. Carolina Panthers: JALON WALKER, EDGE RUSHER, GEORGIA
 

The Panthers had a historically bad defense, allowing an NFL-record 534 points and 3,057 yards rushing. Adding a skill player is tempting but that defense desperately needs a boost. Drafting players from Georgia worked for the Philadelphia Eagles so either Walker or Mykel Williams would fit. Walker’s leadership ability gives him an edge for a team that needs to learn how to win.



  9. New Orleans Saints: SHEMAR STEWART, DEFENSIVE LINEMAN, TEXAS A&M
 

The Saints had the league’s third-worst defense in 2024. Stewart is an athlete who wowed scouts at the combine. He has potential to be a disruptive force anywhere on the defensive line.



  10. Chicago Bears: MYKEL WILLIAMS, EDGE RUSHER, GEORGIA
 

The Bears upgraded their offensive line by acquiring two-time All-Pro guard Joe Thuney and former Pro Bowl guard Jonah Jackson in trades. Those deals allow them to focus on the opposite side of the line. Williams teams up with Montez Sweat to fortify the defensive line.



  11. San Francisco 49ers, KELVIN BANKS JR., OFFENSIVE LINEMAN, TEXAS
 

Even with top secondary players available, the 49ers can’t pass up a talent like Banks. He’ll eventually replace perennial All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams, but the 49ers were among the teams asking him at the combine if he’d be willing to play guard in the NFL.



  12. Dallas Cowboys: ASHTON JEANTY, RUNNING BACK, BOISE STATE
 

The easiest pick of the draft. If Jeanty is available, the Cowboys can’t pass him up. He’s a special talent who would silence those criticizing Jerry Jones for not signing Derrick Henry in free agency last year.



  13. Miami Dolphins: ARMAND MEMBOU, OFFENSIVE TACKLE, MISSOURI
 

Though he played right tackle in college, Membou has the size (6-foot-4, 332 pounds) and athleticism to move to guard and potentially switch to left tackle to replace Terron Armstead. Membou ran a 4.91-second 40-yard dash at the combine, second fastest of all linemen. 



  14. Indianapolis Colts: TYLER WARREN, TIGHT END, PENN STATE
 

Warren is a do-it-all tight end who is projected in the top 10 on many draft boards. The Colts will snag him quickly if he slips to their spot.



  15. Atlanta Falcons: KENNETH GRANT, DEFENSIVE TACKLE, MICHIGAN
 

The Falcons get an immensely talented athlete who has the rare power and speed (6-4, 331 pounds) to be a major force in the middle of Atlanta’s defense. The Falcons were bottom third on defense in 2024.



  16. Arizona Cardinals: WILL JOHNSON, CORNERBACK, MICHIGAN
 

The Cardinals need cornerbacks and Johnson, despite his injury history, is among the best prospects at his position in the draft. 



  17. Cincinnati Bengals: WALTER NOLEN, DEFENSIVE TACKLE, MISSISSIPPI
 

Nolen is a plug-and-play starter with the potential to make an immediate impact for a defense that finished 25th in the league. With Joe Burrow and a dynamic offense, the Bengals need to focus on improving the defense.



  18. Seattle Seahawks: TYLER BOOKER, OFFENSIVE GUARD, ALABAMA
 

Booker is an immediate starter who provides a big boost to Seattle’s offensive line. He was among the most impressive performers at the combine.



  19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: JAMES PEARCE JR., EDGE RUSHER, TENNESSEE
 

The Buccaneers need to improve the pass rush and Todd Bowles made it clear he wants the front four to get to quarterbacks without having to rely on blitzing. Pearce had an impressive combine, running a 4.47-second 40 and showed his versatility. 



  20. Denver Broncos: COLSTON LOVELAND, TIGHT END, MICHIGAN
 

Loveland gives the Broncos another playmaker around Bo Nix. He can be a matchup nightmare for opponents.



  21. Pittsburgh Steelers: JAHDAE BARRON, CORNERBACK, TEXAS
 

Barron is a proven, tested and versatile player who can play outside or in the slot. The Steelers can address their receiver needs in free agency or through a trade, making Barron the pick here.



  22. Los Angeles Chargers: MATTHEW GOLDEN, WIDE RECEIVER, TEXAS
 

Justin Herbert and the Chargers get a deep threat to team with Ladd McConkey.



  23. Green Bay Packers: AZAREYE’H THOMAS, CORNERBACK, FLORIDA STATE
 

With Jaire Alexander’s return uncertain, Thomas fills a need.



  24. Philadelphia Eagles (mock trade with Vikings): MIKE GREEN, EDGE RUSHER, MARSHALL
 

With Josh Sweat expected to leave in free agency and Brandon Graham possibly retiring, Green gives the Super Bowl champions a high-energy edge rusher. The Vikings traded most of their picks away last year to move up for J.J. McCarthy so trading down and adding more assets makes sense. Mock trade: Eagles get No. 24 and a fifth-rounder (161) for the No. 32 pick, a fourth-rounder (129), a fifth-rounder (169) and a future fourth.



  25. Houston Texans: JOSH SIMMONS, OFFENSIVE LINEMAN, OHIO STATE
 

The Texans must protect C.J. Stroud. Simmons, who is coming off a torn patellar tendon in October, would be a higher pick if he wasn’t rehabbing his knee. He’s super talented and has played both tackle spots.



  26. Los Angeles Rams: JIHAAD CAMPBELL, LINEBACKER, ALABAMA
 

Campbell is a versatile player who can excel off-ball or on-ball and has strong coverage skills.



  27. Baltimore Ravens: BENJAMIN MORRISON, CORNERBACK, NOTRE DAME
 

A versatile cornerback who can play outside or in the slot, Morrison provides immediate help for a defense that finished second worst against the pass.



  28. Detroit Lions: DONOVAN EZEIRUAKU, EDGE RUSHER, BOSTON COLLEGE
 

Ezeiruaku gives the Lions a pass rusher to pair opposite Aidan Hutchinson.



  29. Washington Commanders: DERRICK HARMON, DEFENSIVE TACKLE, OREGON
 

Harmon would fill a big void if the Commanders trade Jonathan Allen.



  30. Buffalo Bills: NICK EMMANWORI, SAFETY, SOUTH CAROLINA
 

Emmanwori’s stock soared at the combine. He could be a difference-maker in the secondary for Buffalo. 



  31. Kansas City Chiefs: GREY ZABEL, OFFENSIVE LINEMAN, NORTH DAKOTA
 

Protecting Patrick Mahomes is a priority after the Eagles dominated the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. Zabel helps replace Thuney.



  32. Minnesota Vikings (mock trade with the Eagles): MALAKI STARKS, SAFETY, GEORGIA
 

After trading down, the Vikings still get an elite safety in Starks.

Longtime coach Jim Larranega, who led the Hurricanes to a 274-174 record over 14 seasons, stepped down in December. The Hurricanes were 4-8 through their first games this season under Larranega. They are 6-24 entering their final game of the regular-season against North Carolina State on Saturday in Coral Gables.

Lucas worked as a recruiter and defensive coordinator for the Blue Devils (27-3), who rank No. 2 in the country and clinched the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season crown.

""We are excited to welcome Jai and his family to the Hurricane Family,"" athletic director Dan Radakovich said. ""Jai is an innovative coach, a relentless recruiter and proven talent developer whose knowledge and passion for the game resonated throughout the interview process. He has coached at some of college basketball's most storied programs under tremendous head coaches.

The NFL's franchise tag deadline has come and gone, which puts the focus on free agency, which officially opens at 4 p.m. ET on March 12. Deals can be made before that though as the so-called legal tampering period begins at noon ET on March 10. But plenty of action is already underway as teams are cutting veterans, re-signing stars and shopping for potential trades.

Here's everything you need to know as teams across the league continue to make moves this offseason.

Kansas City Chiefs OL Trey Smith

Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins

This marks the fewest players tagged in a year since 1994, per ESPN.

The Dallas Cowboys worked out a four-year, $80 million deal with defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who reportedly would have been place on the tag if a deal couldn't be reached.

Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, meanwhile, seemed like a straightforward candidate for the tag, so that he and the Vikings could buy more time in trying to work out a longer-term deal. But the $40.2 million number for QBs on the tag (see below) was reportedly too high for the Vikings, and would have limited their ability to build out the rest of the roster.

Hargrave, 32, has played nine NFL seasons with the Steelers, Eagles and 49ers. He has 380 career tackles and 45.5 sacks.

He played only three games during the 2024 season after suffering a partially torn right triceps, which required season-ending surgery.

49ers have informed defensive tackle Javon Hargrave that he will be released on the first day of the league year next week, per source. Hargrave will be a free agent. pic.twitter.com/7d3LFBTrhq

Morse, 32, was a second-round pick in 2015 by the Kansas City Chiefs. He moved to the Buffalo Bills in 2023 and played his final season with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He played 143 career NFL games and was a Pro Bowler in 2022.

The Cleveland Browns were nearly $22 million over the salary cap before this move.

Watson has two years left on his five-year, $230 million contract signed in 2022. He is owed $46 million in 2025 and 2026.

The Browns have restructured the contract of QB Deshaun Watson, creating nearly $36M in 2025 cap space.

— Field Yates (@FieldYates) March 6, 2025

The Seahawks appear to be setting a high bar for what they want in return for DK Metcalf.

The 27-year-old receiver requested a trade from the team on Wednesday and according to The Athletic, the Seahawks want a first and third-round pick in return.

The Seahawks are seeking a first- and third-round pick for WR DK Metcalf, per sources. Metcalf is also eyeing a new contract worth around $30M per year. Multiple teams have inquired. pic.twitter.com/JX93XAvb52

— Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) March 6, 2025

Will a team actually meet that asking price? You can at least understand why the Seahawks are asking for a first-round pick. In 2022, the Chiefs traded Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins for the No. 29 pick in the draft along with a second-round pick, a fourth-round pick and two 2023 picks. The Dolphins then made Hill the highest-paid receiver in the NFL at the time with a contract extension.

A week before Hill was traded, the Raiders traded a first-round pick and a second-round pick to the Packers for Davante Adams.

Like Hill, Metcalf will get a contract extension from a team that trades for him. He's in the last year of his current deal with a cap number over $30 million. That number would very likely go down for the 2025 season with an extension.

Joey Bosa's time with the Los Angeles Chargers is officially over. The team opted to release the star pass rusher on Wednesday night. He had been with them since the team selected him with the No. 3 overall pick in 2016, when they were still located in San Diego.

Bosa had 22 total tackles and five sacks last season. The move will free up more than $25 million in cap space.

Per source, Dolphins LB Bradley Chubb has agreed to a restructured contract. After signing a 5-year $110M extension in 2022, he was owed a $19.45M base salary this year and represented a $28.6 million cap hit in 2025. Now, Miami gets some breathing room before free agency opens

The Cleveland Browns got some welcome good news on Wednesday.

Joel Bitonio is coming back. The five-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowl guard is returning to Cleveland for his 12th NFL season. The Browns announced Bitonio's decision.

Bitonio was unclear at the conclusion of last season if he would return in 2025.

""I really want to decompress and feel it out and give myself a chance to rest the mind and the body and see where we're at,"" Bitonio said on Jan. 5, per the Browns. ""The burden of playing in this league is tough. As an offensive lineman, you have to be fully committed. You're playing 55 to 85 snaps every game. I think I got close to almost 1,200 snaps this year on offense. And that's a big commitment.""

Bitonio, 33, has played his entire career in Cleveland and has made the Pro Bowl after each of the past seven seasons. He'll play next season on the last year of a three-year, $48 million contract.

Could the trade of Joe Thuney lead to the Chiefs adding a marquee left tackle?

According to the Athletic, Kansas City is preparing to make a run at signing Baltimore Ravens left tackle Ronnie Stanley when free agency opens. The Chiefs cleared $16 million in cap space earlier Wednesday when they agreed to trade Thuney to the Chicago Bears for a fourth-round pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.

New story. Joe Thuney did everything the Chiefs asked of him — & more.What’s next for the Chiefs?They plan to sign Trey Smith to an extension & acquire a new left tackle, targeting Ronnie Stanley.https://t.co/1cKzfqMDbu

— Nate Taylor (@ByNateTaylor) March 5, 2025

An All-Pro guard, Thuney played left tackle for the Chiefs in the final weeks of the regular season and throughout the playoffs as the Chiefs struggled to find suitable play on the outside. The team signed former Arizona Cardinals LT D.J. Humphries late in the season, but Humphries strained a hamstring during his first game with the team and didn't start during the postseason.

Stanley, who turns 31 on March 18 and is one of the top free agents set to hit the open market, played in all 19 of the Ravens' regular season and playoff games this year and made his second Pro Bowl. It was the first time Stanley had played a full regular season in his entire career after playing seven regular-season games combined in 2020 and 2021 after he was a first-team All-Pro selection in 2019.

Baun had a breakout season in his first year with the Philadelphia Eagles. The 28-year-old Wisconsin product recorded 150 total tackles, 11 for loss and 3.5 sacks during the 2024 season.

Christian Kirk spent the past three seasons in Jacksonville. He played eight games in 2024, making 27 catches for 379 yards and one touchdown.

He was set to make $15.5 million in 2025 with no guaranteed money left on his deal. The Jaguars will end up saving $10.37 million with Kirk's release and will eat $13.65 million in dead money, per Over The Cap.

The Las Vegas Raiders announced on Wednesday that they have signed Pro Bowl defensive end Maxx Crosby to a multi-year extension.

Per ESPN, the extension is for three years and $106.5 million with $91.5 in guaranteed money, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history in terms of annual salary ($35.5 million). Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson was previously the highest-paid non-quarterback with a four-year, $140 million contract that pays him $35 million per year.

Lockett was due $17 million in salary this season, which included a $5.3 million roster bonus that was to be paid out on March 16. His salary cap hit was set to be $30 million for 2025 and the Seahawks were reportedly nearly $6 million over the cap ceiling ahead of the free agent market opening next week.

Longtime kicker Mason Crosby has announced his retirement, the Green Bay Packers announced.

Crosby spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons in Green Bay after being a 2007 sixth-round pick out of Colorado. He played the most total games and most consecutive games in franchise history (258) and was part of their Super Bowl XLV winning team. He is also the Packers' leader in career points (1,918), field goals (395), 50-yard field goals (43) and extra points (733).

Only two players in NFL history have played 250-plus regular-season games and scored 1,900-plus points with a single team: Crosby and Detroit Lions kicker Jason Hanson.

Crosby last played in 2023 when he appeared in three games with the New York Giants.

This offseason, only Kansas City Chiefs OL Trey Smith and Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins were tagged by their teams.

This marks the fewest players tagged in a year since 1994, per ESPN.

“We want Tee around here not just next year but in the future,” Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said at the NFL combine. “Tee’s been a big part of all the wins we’ve had and keeping defenses accountable.""

Whether or not the Bengals will keep him together with MVP-caliber quarterback Joe Burrow and triple crown-winning receiver Ja'Marr Chase, however, is very much in question, mostly thanks to the team itself. Cincinnati failed to reach a contract extension agreement with Chase last summer, and the price has only gone up. Higgins has now received the franchise tag two years in a row, and while reports suggest the Bengals plan to negotiate a longer-term deal with him this time, they also are notorious for tightening purse strings relative to other franchises.

Smith's future, meanwhile, still seems to be in Kansas City, with multiple reports indicating the Chiefs want him long-term, especially given their offensive line issues. He received the non-exclusive tag, which means he's free to negotiate with other teams, but the Chiefs also have the right to match any offer sheet he receives. So it might just have been a way of gauging his market in negotiations.

Hubbard, 29, was a third-round pick by the Bengals in 2018 out of Ohio State. He played 104 games in Cincinnati in seven seasons and recorded 38.5 sacks, 398 total tackles and 55 tackles for loss.

Hubbard suffered a season-ending PCL injury in December during a game where he caught his first career offensive touchdown.

Gibson City-Melvin-Sibley sophomore guard Graydon Leonard, left, takes the ball to the hoop against Schlarman junior Miles Crosby on Wednesday night in a Class 1A sectional semifinal game at Ridgeview High School in Colfax. The Falcons coasted to a 69-39 victory.























Gibson City-Melvin-Sibley beat Schlarman in a Class 1A boys' basketball sectional semifinal game in Colfax on Wednesday, March 5, 2025.























COLFAX — The Gibson City-Melvin-Sibley baseball team will begin its pursuit of its second straight state appearance on March 17.

But the members of GCMS’ varsity basketball team that also play baseball aren’t thinking much about that right now. The Falcons drew within two wins of their first trip to the state basketball finals since 2019 with a 69-39 Class 1A sectional semifinal win against Schlarman on Wednesday night.

“Right now, the focus is really on basketball and keep pushing forward,” Brayden Elliott said.

Elliott factored into the Falcons’ commanding win with 17 points on Ridgeview’s hone floor, joining Spencer Kleist (17 points), Ryker Grauer (14 points) and Graydon Leonard (11 points) in leading GCMS to its fourth win in a row.

“Started off really well and had a little bit of a lull,” GCMS senior Austin Kasper said. “We went right back at them in the second half and it was a good win all-around.”

A 10-0 run to open the first quarter set the tone for the Falcons (21-12), with four different scorers forcing the Hilltoppers to call their first timeout with 5:32 remaining in the quarter.

Spencer Kleist broke away for a layup with 3:12 left in the first quarter, giving him eight points, the Falcons an 18-2 lead and forcing the Hilltoppers second timeout in roughly as many minutes.

“We came out firing,” Kleist said. “Hitting shots, moving really quickly. Coach told us run the floor, and that’s what we did. And we got to the bucket and we just made shots.”

The Falcons’ edge swelled to 26-8 by the end of the first frame.

“I think we got (the lead to) 10-0, 12-0,” GCMS coach Ryan Tompkins said. “And that’s got to make you feel a little bit more, not relaxed, but make you feel a little more (comfortable). ... Any time you have a strong start, it really helps you kind of feed off it.”

Schlarman’s fortunes improved marginally during the opening moments of the second quarter.

A 7-0 scoring burst brought the Hilltoppers (17-11) within 11 points, with Peyton Kuemmerle and Noah Fowler scoring six points apiece during the second quarter.

“Our theme was handle it,” Schlarman coach Zack Patterson said. “Anything that came up for us, whether we started 5-9 ... we kept handing it, handling it. At the end of the day, our culture has been built.”

But the Falcons matched Schalrman’s 14-point output in the second quarter to take a 38-22 lead into the halftime break.

“It was really just a good win overall,” Elliott said. “We came out, really punched them in the mouth in the beginning. Slowed down a little bit, but after that, realized at halftime we need to pick it back up, get better stops on defense, really secure stops and just go on from there.”

That margin remained consistent throughout the final 16 minutes, with seven points from Elliott in the second half to secure the final outcome.

Fowler finished with 22 points to lead the Hilltoppers — who were five days removed from their first regional title since 2002 — as they saw a seven-game winning streak draw to a close.

“These guys, whether they won the championship or not, I enjoyed coaching them,” Patterson said. “Schlarman’s got multi-sport athletes, and they come out for basketball and they work the best they could.”

Wednesday night’s result followed LeRoy’s dominant 66-38 win against Argenta-Oreana to set up a Heart of Illinois Conference rematch between the Panthers and Falcons on Friday. The Panthers claimed a 53-51 win last December in the teams’ only meeting this season.

“They’ve got guys right there that make plays happen on the offensive end,” Tompkins said. “They really, really do a good job in their rotations defensively. So we have to come out and play well.”

LeRoy and Gibson City-Melvin-Sibley are both situated less than 25 miles from Ridgeview, which was at capacity on Wednesday night despite Schlarman facing a roughly 160-mile round trip.

“The energy from the crowd definitely helps fuel us and have us have some energy,” Kasper said. “It’s always fun to have a good crowd behind us.”

'Now, it’s icing on the cake. It’s house money. It’s fun from here. Every game we play, it’s about going out and having fun.'

The banged up New Jersey Devils wasted no time filling an area of need ahead of the NHL trade deadline, while the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers made an under-the-radar move that could pave the way for another deep playoff run

Devils Get Dumoulin, While the Panthers Add More Depth Ahead of the NHL Trade Deadline

The banged up New Jersey Devils wasted no time filling an area of need ahead of the NHL trade deadline, while the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers made an under-the-radar move that could pave the way for another deep playoff run.

New Jersey acquired veteran defenseman Brian Dumoulin from the Anaheim Ducks on Thursday for a second-round pick and the rights to unsigned 19-year-old prospect Herman Traff. Florida got faceoff specialist and depth center Nico Sturm and a 2027 seventh-round pick from San Jose for a fourth-rounder in 2026.

The Devils’ acquisition comes after they learned leading scorer Jack Hughes is done for the season after undergoing shoulder surgery and with No. 1 defenseman Dougie Hamilton also out because of injury. With Hughes joining Jonas Siegenthaler on long-term injured reserve, they can add roughly $10 million worth of players before the deadline, even after getting Dumoulin.

That is because the Ducks are retaining half of Dumoulin's salary for the rest of this season. The pick they’re getting is the better of the second-rounders between Edmonton’s and Winnipeg’s in the draft this summer.

Dumoulin, 33, has played 768 regular-season and playoff games in the league. He won the Cup with Pittsburgh in 2016 and '17 and this season has 16 points while skating just under 20 minutes on average over 61 games with Anaheim.

“Brian was good for us both on and off the ice, and we wish him well in New Jersey,” Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek said. “This wasn’t an easy decision for us. We do feel this allows more opportunity for our young defensemen, who have proven they can play and succeed at the NHL level.”

General manager Tom Fitzgerald has any number of options for how to use his newly accrued space. Getting a high-end forward — ideally a center — would help fill the void left by Hughes' absence. Hughes is tied with Carolina's Mikko Rantanen in the league scoring race with 70 points on 27 goals and 43 assists.

Rantanen's future remains the biggest mystery to watch before the 3 p.m. EST deadline Friday. Already traded once this year from Colorado to the Hurricanes in a three-team blockbuster in late January, the 2022 Cup-winning, point-a-game winger in his prime could be on the move again with no guarantee Carolina will be able to sign the pending free agent beyond this season.

“If he got moved out of Carolina, it’s not because of his play,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said Thursday. ""Just looking at Mikko’s game, he’s played well since he’s been there — a little snake-bit at first — now the production is starting to come. I think he’s a fit on any team in the league, including Carolina. So, yeah, I think that’s just the business side of hockey at this point.”

In Sturm, the Panthers get a fourth-line center and capable penalty-killer who has won 62.7% of his draws this season with the Sharks, the highest total of anyone who has taken part in at least 200 faceoffs. The 29-year-old from Germany also has seven goals and six assists in 47 games.

With top winger Matthew Tkachuk on LTIR like Hughes, Florida — which already traded for defenseman Seth Jones from Chicago and added backup goaltender Vitek Vanecek — still has space to potentially add another forward in the aim of becoming the third series of back-to-back champs over the past decade.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

With crushing inevitability, Gianni Infantino confirmed on Wednesday that our greatest fears had come true. A set-piece soccer match will involve a halftime show. Next summer's World Cup final will see the best artists that Coldplay and Infantino can drag to MetLife Stadium take to the stage for just long enough that players halfway through their eighth game in a month can cool down. What's that you can hear over the sound system? Why it's ""22,"" hamstrings twinging.

No one wants this. Camilla Cabello's recent experience in the Champions League pre-game suggests few in the stands are really going to care. No one sat through the pinnacle of Lionel Messi's career in Qatar, his every effort desperately repelled by Kylian Mbappe and the rest of the France side, and thought, ""This needs Post Malone.""

And yet still, it's happening. All that can be done is to make the best of it. 

Generally, that hasn't happened when football has collided with popular music. Dua Lipa cut through to Liverpool fans with ""One Kiss"" in 2018. That aside, the music of the Champions League final has not embedded itself in fan culture. Real Madrid fans don't chant Cabello's ""Don't Go Yet"" to memorialize their glory in Paris four years later. A pity. That song goes hard.

Perhaps the nature of soccer matches also makes a halftime show a more challenging sell. Yes, the halftime intervals are about the same length for footballs in America and the rest of the world. However, in this writer's view -- a Brit from the heartlands of infinitely superior rugby union -- there is so little of note happening in two quarters of gridiron that the six-yard pass and seven-yard run have already been analyzed in plenty detail once halftime runs around. Again, this writer's view. The rhythms of soccer are different.

Still, that's enough pontificating. If this is going to happen, might as well dream big. 

Before, however, we get into the list, a word on how this was built. As best as possible, we're going to be straddling the boundary between the personal and the practical. I sincerely believe that given the platform, Arooj Aftab, Jessie Ware or Confidence Man could melt your brains with their interpretation of the halftime show. I reluctantly accept that FIFA's brand partners may have a different view. Also, it's very easy, and therefore boring, to just say that x artist did a great Super Bowl halftime show, so let's give them the World Cup. We're not going to eschew those artists entirely but we're not ranking the best past performers here either. Let's just have some fun with this.

This is the extremely FIFA choice. It's a hoodie under a sports jacket. It's Salt Bae sprinkling pop rap all down his arm and onto your plate. It's the ironic veneration of tat. And it has a place on one of the biggest musical stages of all. When every other recording artist in this universe and the broad sweep of the multiverse has turned the offer down then, and only then, is it time for Mr. Worldwide to take to the stage.

Has a greater football song ever been written than ""Waka Waka""? Yes. ""Together Stronger"" by Manic Street Preachers. Of course, England New Order's ""World In Motion."" And look, I think we could make a case for ""The Order of the Seasons"" by the incomparable Los Campesinos! But look, remember what we said earlier about living in the world as is. So yeah, Shakira would put on a perfectly cromulent show. 

If the World Cup final is what it ought to be. this is a chance for New York/New Jersey to show the best of itself to the world. An occasion to celebrate the many profound ways in which the city that never sleeps (and I guess also East Rutherford) has kept the rest of the world awake. Yes, I'm talking about the pioneers of the great indie explosion at the birth of the century. 

I wouldn't want you to think I've got carried away with all this, that I'm rereading ""Meet Me In The Bathroom"" for the 45th time, that I missed Wednesday night's Champions League fixtures for the dopamine rush of whatever post-punk icons I could find in London (Franz Ferdinand, still making music for girls to dance to). However, I have had a quick go at a setlist.

Yeah, I think this all works. Shall we get the ball rolling on this one, Gianni?

Lamar's halftime show in New Orleans last month at the Super Bowl was as compelling and purposeful as a 12-minute interlude in a sporting occasion can be. How could you not want more? Only maybe a different sort of more. I'm talking K Dot, Baby Keem, The Hillbillies, Neymar, Lionel Messi. Roll out the hit parade.

Yeah, we'd all moan about it. Everyone would have to dunk on your boozed-up aunt's favorite band. Tell you what though -- they'd put on a show. Did you see them at Glastonbury? Michael J. Fox on the guitar? These boys know when to get out of the way.

Let's be honest, Jude Bellingham and the boys are going to be in the final. Probably going to be trouncing whoever they're playing too. Might as well let us have our national anthem. ""Three Lions,"" I mean.

And for many of those who have made the pilgrimage over from Europe, the unseasoned meat and potatoes rock of Oasis strikes a chord. They should enjoy it. I'll be elsewhere.

Big name. Hasn't played the Super Bowl. Will probably be touring next summer. Might bring Mick Harford on stage.

Again, this is New York's World Cup final. Who better to command his city's big day than the greatest rapper of all time? Just imagine the hits he would have to leave out to get in under the 12-minute mark. Get ""Takeover"" in at the top, ""Brooklyn's Finest"" and ""99 Problems"" in there somewhere, a grand finale of ""Empire State of Mind."" It's the blueprint to something pretty memorable.

Meanwhile, if anyone knows how to build a halftime show that speaks to a modern audience, it is surely the man whose Roc Nation management company have brought the Super Bowl halftime show back towards relevance. He's good mates with Chris Martin, right? Pick up the phone, guys.

Honestly, FIFA, if you can book Bad Bunny, extend that halftime break to an hour and a half. I want to hear ""Un Verano Sin Ti"" in full.

You know how we've spent much of this article talking about the final as if it's New York's when it's really in New Jersey? And when the world thinks New Jersey, there's one person we think of.

It's not immediately apparent that JWoww is halftime show material though. 

I guess The Boss will do quite nicely. The mere thought of a 76-year-old man crowbarring soccer references into ""Glory Days"" is pure cringe but the guy can perform ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"" at will.

It has to be, doesn't it? If a halftime show is to be remembered as anything other than one of Infantino's grand follies, then it has to quickly establish itself as a platform where the biggest artists in the world connect with perhaps the biggest television audience on the planet. Get yourself Taylor Swift and you might have started something that will actually hold a fond place in the hearts of football fans.

All things considered, it was a relatively low-key offseason for the Philadelphia Phillies. Their most significant move was adding Jesús Luzardo in a three-player trade with the Miami Marlins. They also signed outfielder Max Kepler and reliever Jordan Romano to sensible one-year contracts, and that's pretty much it. No real blockbuster move for the Phillies this winter.   

POBO Dave Dombrowski and his staff of course considered many things over the winter, likely including some big things. And if it came down to it, Bryce Harper told the front office he was willing to move back to the outfield if it team could land a big first base bat. Here's what Harper told The Athletic:    

""I talked to (the Phillies) this offseason about that, just in case a  guy was available (at first) that we needed to have, needed to get,""  Harper said. ""I'd be more than open to it if we had a guy like that, who  was going to change our lineup or change the demeanor of our team. They  like me at first base. But I'd go out there to have a guy who was going  to play first base and hit 35 or 40 homers. 	 	 	 	

""When Pete (Alonso)  was on the block still, I kind of sat there and was like, 'Hey, why  not?' When we talked about it, I kind of just reiterated to (the  Phillies) and Scott (Boras) that I'm willing to move out there if it's  going to help us. I love playing first base. It's been great. But if  it's going to help us win, I'd go back out there."" 	 	 	 	

Alonso was the big name on the market this offseason, though he wasn't only first baseman available. Paul Goldschmidt, Carlos Santana, and Christian Walker were also free agents, plus Jake Burger, Nathaniel Lowe, and Josh Naylor were traded. Others like Luis Arraez and Yandy Díaz were reportedly available in trades, but ultimately stayed put.    

Had the Phillies taken Harper up on his offer and brought in a first baseman, it presumably would have meant no Kepler. Alonso did not sign until right as spring training opened, though those other first basemen all changed teams in mid-December. It is possible the Phillies explored the first base market, didn't like the prices, and pivoted to Kepler.    

Harper moved to first base in 2023, not because he was a defensive liability in the outfield but because he was working his way back from Tommy John surgery and first base was the quickest way to get him back in the lineup. Harper still wasn't cleared to make full effort throws from the outfield, though he could DH and play first, so that's where the Phillies put him.    

Understandably, there were growing pains initially, though Harper has turned into a very good defensive first baseman in fairly short order. He was a Gold Glove finalist last year and he ranked third among all first basemen with plus-7 outs above average, trailing only Santana (plus-14) and Walker (plus-13), the two Gold Glove winners.    

Harper's offer to move back to the outfield could come into play in the future, including next offseason, when Vladimir Guerrero Jr. will hit the market. The Phillies have several core players (Kyle Schwarber, Ranger Suárez, JT Realmuto, etc.) and a lot of money coming off the books after this year, and could pursue Guerrero.  

Harper, 32, slashed .285/.373/.525 with 30 homers in 145 games in 2024. The two-time MVP is entering the seventh year of the 13-year, $330 million contract he signed in February 2019. He'll again man first base this season with Kepler, Nick Castellanos, Brandon Marsh, and Johan Rojas handling outfield duty.    

The Phillies went 95-67 and won the NL East in 2025. They were eliminated by the New York Mets in the NLDS.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Alex Ovechkin goals tracker: 'The Great Eight' is 10 away from breaking Wayne Gretzky’s all-time record of 894,https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/article/alex-ovechkin-goals-tracker-the-great-eight-is-10-away-from-breaking-wayne-gretzkys-all-time-record-of-894-170506910.html,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:05:52 GMT","

Washington Capitals superstar Alex Ovechkin is inching closer to an NHL scoring record that many thought was unbreakable.

The 39-year-old Ovechkin is within striking distance of Wayne Gretzky's all-time NHL goals record of 894. ""The Great One"" scored his final goal on March 29, 1999. ""The Great Eight"" could very well surpass that mark 26 years later.

Ovechkin entered the 2024-25 NHL season with 853 career NHL goals. He started the season off red-hot with 15 goals in 18 games. But after suffering a broken fibula in November, he missed five weeks. That time off didn't affect his goal-scoring prowess: He recorded four goals in his first five games back from injury.

During Wednesday's 3-2 overtime win over the New York Rangers, Ovechkin moved to within 10 goals of passing Gretzky with goal No. 894.

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN IS ON... OVECHKIN IS 10 GOALS FROM PASSING WAYNE GRETZKY 🤯 pic.twitter.com/9D285BdNGp

— B/R Open Ice (@BR_OpenIce) March 6, 2025

""It's just a matter of time, whether it's late this year, early next year, whenever,"" Gretzky told NHL.com earlier this season about Ovechkin's chances of breaking his record. ""I mean, he's a great player. He's a great goal scorer.""

As he approaches Gretzky's record, Ovechkin has partnered with Hockey Fights Cancer and the V Foundation for Cancer Research to launch ""THE GR8 CHASE for Victory Over Cancer."" The campaign will see Ovechin donate a dollar amount equal to his career NHL goal total for each goal he scores for the rest of his career. onumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Capitals, will match every donation.

Ovechkin will continue his chase for Gretzky's mark on Friday against the Detroit Red Wings.

We will track Ovechkin's race to 894 goals and beyond all season.

Miami has tapped Duke associate head coach Jai Lucas as its next men's basketball head coach, the school announced on Thursday. Lucas was identified as the front-runner for the job in late February when CanesInSight was the first to report the development. CBS Sports first reported the news of Lucas' imminent hiring on Wednesday. 

Lucas will leave championship-minded Duke following its regular season finale this weekend against North Carolina to get a jump start on rebuilding the Hurricanes. 

""I am incredibly grateful and honored to be the next head coach at the University of Miami,"" Lucas said in a statement. ""Miami has everything you need to compete at the highest level — elite academics, a passionate fan base, and a commitment to excellence in athletics. Beyond that, the city of Miami has a rich culture and energy that makes this an incredibly special place. The history, diversity, and passion for sports here are second to none.

""I look forward to building on an incredible foundation and leading this program into an exciting new era. My family and I can't wait to get to Coral Gables and get to work.""

The 36-year-old Lucas has been a key asset under Jon Scheyer for the past two-plus years as Duke has maintained its elite reputation in the post-Mike Krzyzewski era. Lucas was a critical voice in the recruitments of players such as Cooper Flagg, in addition to incoming five-star Cameron Boozer and his twin brother, four-star Cayden, who coincidentally enough hail from Miami. (The Boozers chose Duke over Miami last fall and could be two of the most impactful freshmen in the sport next season.) 

Lucas is the son of John Lucas II, a well-renowned and highly respected person in basketball circles for decades, dating back to being the No. 1 pick out of Maryland in 1976. Lucas II played in the NBA from 1976-90 before moving into coaching in the Association from 1992-2023. Jai Lucas played at Texas — where he began his coaching career in 2016. He left in 2020 to take a job on John Calipari's staff at Kentucky, then was recruited away by Scheyer two years later. 

Scheyer spoke about Lucas' readiness to be a head coach after Duke's record-setting 110-67 win over Illinois at Madison Square Garden on Feb 22.  

""Absolutely he's a head coach, no question about it,"" Scheyer said. ""It's part of why I hired him, and the job he's done for us has been incredible. ... I can tell you 100% Jai's an amazing coach.""

Miami was one of the more aggressive programs in the first two years of the NIL era (thanks to having an outspoken, ambitious booster) but that turned in the past two years. With Lucas (set to be the youngest high-major head coach) coming aboard, the U is expected to again be a player both in the portal and high school recruiting. 

Beyond growing into one of the strongest recruiters in the industry, Lucas has also been a key defensive strategist at Duke. This season has seen the Blue Devils at their defensive best under Scheyer, ranking fourth nationalnly in adjusted defensive efficiency at KenPom.com. 

Lucas is expected to leave Duke and be with Miami in a full-time capacity after the Duke-UNC game this weekend, a source said. It's an unusual arrangement that reflects the drastic shift in college sports recruiting in 2025. Lucas has helped Duke to national title contender status. The Blue Devils are pacing toward a No. 1 seed and have the potential national player of the year in Flagg. In a previous era, an assistant coach would stay on until the end of the season. With the portal now playing a major factor in hastened roster turnover, Lucas can ill afford to stick around with the Blue Devils until their final game in the NCAA Tournament.

By leaving in early March, Lucas and Miami have a head start on every other power-conference program that will change coaches in this year's cycle.

Lucas will succeed Jim Larrañaga, who retired in late December amid a dismal 4-8 start. Jim Larrañaga coached Miami for more than 11 seasons and won 274 games, including a charmed run to the 2023 Final Four. Since he stepped down the day after Christmas, things got worse. Miami is an abysmal 6-24 and will conclude the regular season Saturday at home against NC State. With the ACC now an 18-team conference, the bottom three teams in the standings do not get invites to the league tournament, meaning Miami's season is done this weekend.

BERLIN — Each sport must set its own rules on the participation of transgender athletes instead of one global rule, and it must be based on scientific data, International Paralympics Committee President Andrew Parsons said on Thursday.

Speaking on one year ahead of the Milano-Cortina 2026 Paralympic Winter Games, Parsons, who is also an International Olympic Committee member, said any decision should have an inclusive approach.

The Olympic Games and Paralympics currently allow transgender athletes to compete.

Italy’s Valentina Petrillo became the first openly transgender athlete to participate in the Paralympics after the visually impaired sprinter competed in Paris last year.

“Protecting the female participation is a must but we also have to address the fact that there are more transgender individuals who want to practice high-level sport,” Parsons told Reuters in an interview.

“We must have an inclusive approach. It should be guided by science. I think science is what can give us answers in every sport about participation of transgender athletes.

“I believe that every sport has to find its own way. When it comes to transgender ... science is the guiding principle.”

The IOC has refused to apply any universal rule. Instead, in 2021, it instructed international federations to each come up with their own rules for their sport.

Some sports, including athletics, swimming and rugby, have done so, but many have yet to finalize a policy on the issue.

However, United States President Donald Trump, whose country will host the Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, has issued an order to exclude transgender girls and women from female sports.

Trump said he would not allow transgender athletes to compete at the LA28 Games and urged the IOC to “change everything to do with the Olympics and this absolutely ridiculous subject.

“We have three and a half years to go to the Games and a lot of things will happen between now and then,” Parsons said.

“I think we need to work with international federations. We will be supporting them in the build-up to the Games and to apply their rules in their specific competitions.”

Parsons has, however, more immediate issues to tackle with the 2026 Paralympics a year away and Italian organizers racing to complete key venues on a tight deadline.

“It’s a tight schedule but we are confident, and we have been reassured by the Italian authorities, that it’s going to be delivered,” he said.

The Paralympics will host more than 600 competitors in 80 events of six paralympic sports across Milan, Cortina and two more clusters in mainly existing or temporary venues.

“We maximize the use of existing venues. So in this edition, yes, it means that the venues are very spread out,” Parsons said.

The Winter Paralympics will have spectators back — with some 200,000 tickets on offer — after the Beijing 2022 Paralympics were affected by the pandemic. Nearly 90% of tickets cost 35 euros ($37.75) or less.

“We are happy where we are at the moment,” Parsons said regarding preparations for the Paralympics.

THE NO. 5 FLORIDA GATORS 

Beware: These Gators bite. No. 5 Florida beat No. 7 Alabama, 99-94, in Tuscaloosa, and, combined with Ole Miss' 78-76 win over No. 4 Tennessee, moved up to the No. 1 seed line in Jerry Palm's Bracketology. 

I like Ole Miss as a sleeper second-weekend NCAA Tournament team. The Rebels are experienced and have a bunch of guys who can score. 

But I love Florida, as in ""they're my championship pick"" love. The Gators are top 10 in offensive and defensive efficiency. They're lethal in transition, overwhelming on the offensive glass and full of firepower: Six different players have led them in scoring in a game this season. Their frontcourt is ridiculous, their backcourt explosive. They have experience, depth, versatility and star power. Count me all the way in. 

Also impressing last night? No. 13 Maryland, which won at No. 17 Michigan, 71-65. 

DK METCALF AND THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 

The Seahawks parted ways with one of their top wide receivers yesterday. If another gets his way, he'll be leaving Seattle, too. DK Metcalf requested a trade the same day the team released Tyler Lockett. 

Metcalf is one of several wide receivers who could be finding a new home this offseason, along with Davante Adams, Christian Kirk (released Wednesday) and Lockett. Bryan DeArdo has best landing spots for each. 

It's a good day to be Maxx Crosby, and it's a bad day to be a quarterback, running back or offensive lineman facing the Raiders. Las Vegas gave its superstar defensive end a three-year, $106.5 million extension with $91.5 million guaranteed. At $35.5 million per year, that's the top salary for a non-quarterback in NFL history. 

The Eagles also ensured their All-Pro defender isn't going anywhere, signing Zack Baun to a three-year, $51 million extension that includes $36 million guaranteed. Baun arrived on a minuscule one-year deal after playing sparingly for the Saints. Him transforming into an elite off-ball linebacker is one of the many success stories that helped Philadelphia win the Super Bowl. 

We'll see how many other contributors can return. Darius Slay said he'd ""love to be back."" 

As for one star not returning, the Chargers released Joey Bosa, saving over $25 million toward the cap. A star from 2016-21, he's struggled with injuries the past three years but is still just 29 years old. 

Finally, the Bears added their second offensive lineman in as many days, acquiring Joe Thuney from the Chiefs for a 2026 fourth-round pick. Thuney, 32, is a four-time Super Bowl champion and a two-time All-Pro. 

For those of you saying he doesn't fit Chicago's timeline, I say the timing is always right to upgrade your quarterback's protection, especially given Caleb Williams' sack-filled debut season. The Bears got another strong mark in Jordan Dajani's trade grades. 

Here's more ... 

I don't mean to pile on, Mavericks fans. Really, I don't. But the timing and severity of Kyrie Irving's torn ACL is simply too awful, and our staff's coverage is too good, for us to move on just yet. 

Mavs GM Nico Harrison expected to be buried from the moment he traded Luka Dončić for Anthony Davis, which probably wasn't a great sign, and the trade is blowing up in Harrison's face less than a month after it was made, Jasmyn Wimbish says. 

Whatever sliver of contender status Dallas was hanging on to this campaign is gone. And with Irving set to miss a significant chunk of next season, there's a Texas-sized question mark on the Mavs' 2025-26 -- the primary years Harrison was targeting. Things can change very quickly, but Sam Quinn says it may already be time to consider trading Davis. Yes, after just one game. 

Finally, Jason Kidd ranted about ""conspiracy theories"" surrounding the injury. It's safe to say no one is happy. 

""Expect the unexpected"" was the theme of Wednesday's UEFA Champions League action, with three of the four first legs producing surprises. 

Liverpool-PSG was a classic example of one goalkeeper bailing his team out. Even Red Devils coach Arne Slot admitted his team would have been lucky to even get a draw after getting outshot 27-2. But that's why goalies are there. Alisson called his nine-save game probably the best performance of his life, and what a time for it. 

Here's where things stand heading into the second legs.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Charles Barkley calls athletes who won’t visit Trump’s White House ‘stupid’. I disagree,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/06/charles-barkley-calls-athletes-who-wont-visit-trumps-white-house-stupid-i-disagree,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 11:02:00 GMT","

Sports stars have stayed silent about the policies of the new administration. I spoke to someone who knows all about the power – and price – of protest

Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, he has taken a blowtorch to America. He has pardoned January 6 rioters, started the gutting of the federal government, eliminated diversity, equity and inclusion programs, insulted who we thought were the country’s allies, and vilified immigrants.

While there have been voices of dissent in the sports world – such as former NFL punter Chris Kluwe and soccer coach Jesse Marsch – athletes have largely stayed silent on Trump’s policies, a stark contrast to his first term in power. In recent months, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce spoke of their pride in playing in front of Trump at the Super Bowl, while the Philadelphia Eagles are reportedly keen to visit the White House to celebrate their NFL title, a decision supported by Charles Barkley, who believes boycotts make the nation more divided.

I couldn’t disagree more with Barkley. So I wanted to sit down with the epitome of the athlete activist, someone who didn’t hesitate to express his beliefs, even in the face of enormous backlash. And that is the great Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, whose protest during the national anthem in 1996 cost him his NBA career. Below is our conversation, which was has been lightly edited for length and clarity, about the importance of protest under the Trump administration.

Etan Thomas: Do you think athletes have gone a little quiet since Trump has taken office? How important is it for athletes to not stay silent?

Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf: It’s definitely not just athletes, but for the context of this discussion, we can focus on athletes. And, yes, it’s super important [for athletes to speak up]. I can’t help but think of years ago, J Edgar Hoover was discussing the power of the athlete. And how [the] goal was to shift [focus] from the Muhammad Ali types to the more quiet type of athlete because those in power recognize the power that athletes had to influence people. Especially an athlete that’s articulate and knows how to communicate and is current with all of the issues. So, there is an enormous amount of power that a lot of athletes … don’t realize that they have.

ET: A lot of the reasoning given as to why athletes may be more reluctant to speak out now is because they are making so much more money and have much more to lose.

MAR: Well, to whom much is given much is expected. Sometimes, people are quiet when they’re trying to get ahead in fear of messing up their chances to succeed, and I understand that. But when you get to a point where you are making millions and your finances are all taken care of, you would think that it would embolden you even more. But for so many of us, it makes it even worse … Sometimes, people listen to athletes more than they will academics who have studied the issues continuously.

ET: Has the time of athlete activism passed? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once told me “if you have someone with that type of power and influence, pushing for something you don’t agree with, of course they are going to try to do whatever they can to silence them, because they are a threat to them.”

MAR: Mr Abdul Jabbar was absolutely correct. So athletes having that power, have to prepare themselves for that responsibility. And if you want to improve on anything, you have to practice. We have to prepare ourselves just like we do on the basketball court. Just as we train, plan and strategize to overcome the opponent, exploit their weaknesses, capitalize on your strengths to win the game, that same strategic analysis has to be applied in real life. You can’t lose those lessons. It has to carry over. And let me add to that, the more athletes surround themselves with people who can influence them in a positive way, the better.

ET: Like Muhammad Ali being mentored by Malcolm X.

MAR: Exactly. Without the influence of Malcolm X, we may have only known Muhammad Ali as the greatest boxer of all time. And that would’ve been tragic. An athlete can be utilized as a mouthpiece to wake up the masses … because if an athlete says it, they pay more attention. It shouldn’t be that way of course, but a lot of times, that’s the reality. But honestly, the masses shouldn’t need anyone to point out what is clear and evident. It is amazing that a small cabal of people have convinced the masses to accept their oppression while they know they are being oppressed.

ET: Like Trump getting so many people to vote against their own interests for a second time.

MAR: Exactly, yes. So to answer your original question, it’s mandatory [for athletes to speak out against Trump]. Too much is at stake. I have conversations with different athletes all the time, just as I’m sure you do. Different races, ages, colors, coaches, administrators, everyone. But I also have conversations with different people of everyday life all the time; not just athletes, people from all races, backgrounds, owners of companies, people in the workforce. But so many people are afraid to make it public. They got us so fearful right now.

ET: Almost like everyone is afraid to stand up to the school bully. The whole reason I wrote my book We Matter: Athletes And Activism is because I wanted to praise athletes like LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant who were using their voices in Trump’s first term, despite the criticism and backlash, and showing younger athletes that they can follow suit.

MAR: And they should look at those criticisms as a compliment. If the powers that be are speaking highly of you, in a system that doesn’t mean you or your people well, you should ask: “Why are they praising me?” Because they always have an angle. They are always trying to manipulate and conform to fit their agenda. But on the flip side, if they are going out of their way to tear you down, that means you are doing something right. The civil rights leader John Lewis talked about “good trouble”. Well, this is “good backlash”.

ET: I like that. In your day, there was no social media. Nowadays, athletes don’t have to wait for a reporter or media outlet to interpret what their message is. They have the power to construct their own message, however they want to. But power unrecognized is just a waste.

MAR: I wish we had social media back in the day. Being able to control your own narrative and get your own message out the way you want to is invaluable. And to add to that, now athletes have the ability to feel the support of the community through social media. So just as you can feel the backlash, you can also feel support. We didn’t have that when we were coming up. We kind of felt like we were on an island by ourselves because we only heard the media backlash. So, yes, social media plays a big difference in many ways.

ET: Any final thoughts?

MAR: OK, let me end it with this. If you’re really about human freedom and justice you have no choice but to speak up. With everything going on right now, it’s crucial for everyone to use whatever platform they have – not just athletes but everyone. I want to make that point clear. We can’t put this all on athletes even though we know and understand the level of influence athletes have. Silence is acceptance, compliance and ultimately agreement with the status quo. It was Huey P Newton who said: “I do not think life will change for the better without an assault on the establishment”. With the magnitude of where we are right now, remaining silent isn’t an option. Either you’re part of the solution, or you’re part of the problem. And that goes for everyone, not just athletes.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Players line up during the Penn State men’s hockey game against Minnesota in Pegula Ice Arena on Saturday, Mar. 1, 2025 in University Park, Pa. The Gophers beat the Nittany Lions 5-3.

On December 6th, 2024, the final horn sounded at the Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio, signaling yet another Penn State conference loss — its eighth straight to be exact.

The then 6-9 Nittany Lions were sitting dead last in conference play without a point in the win column, and although the season hadn’t yet reached the halfway point, their postseason hopes were starting to dwindle.

Fast forward exactly three months and the current blue and white team has been regarded as the “hottest team in college hockey”, managed to climb both the conference and national rankings, and is now sitting on the cusp of an NCAA Tournament appearance.

With a highly anticipated freshmen class, the addition of an NHL-drafted netminder and a solid veteran core leading the way, Penn State had high expectations for its 2024-25 season, and its opening few series’ were promising for the future.

The Nittany Lions started their season 4,000 miles from Hockey Valley against Alaska Fairbanks, completing the opening series sweep against the Nanooks.

The blue and white’s next contest was narrowly lost to a then-No. 8 Quinnipiac team, but it wasn’t long until the unit got back in the win column, sweeping St. Lawrence in its home opener the following week.

The Nittany Lions traveled to Minneapolis on Halloween weekend to open conference play against a top-five Minnesota team. The blue and white’s momentum stalled out, as it dropped both games against the Golden Gophers.

The Minnesota series created a snowball effect of struggling conference play, and the Nittany Lions went on to drop its next three conference series’ against Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio State to remain empty-handed in the Big Ten.

By the beginning of December, a glaring issue was coming to the forefront — Penn State’s slow starts. Through six of its eight Big Ten contests, the Nittany Lions were playing catch-up heading into the final period of play.

While its comeback bids had been successful against non-conference opponents, constantly playing from behind in the Big Ten gauntlet wasn’t sustainable.

As the Nittany Lions took the ice for the last time in 2024 in Washington, D.C. for the Capital Hockey Classic, there was something in the air, and when they stepped off the ice with a hard-fought victory against a solid Army team, a spark had been lit.

Before the excitement of playing in the Washington Capitals’ home arena could die down, Penn State headed to Wrigley Field for its first game of the new year on the same ice the NHL’s Winter Classic had taken place on just days prior.

The second game of a doubleheader for the Big Ten’s first-ever Frozen Confines series was a thriller, with the blue and white playing to a tie and eventually falling short in a shootout to Notre Dame. However, the Nittany Lions still tallied their first conference points and put on a solid performance.

The Nittany Lions got their revenge — and first Big Ten regulation win — two days later, after taking the rematch in South Bend, Indiana, 3-0.

The next series on its schedule was arguably its most important of the season to that point, facing off with then-No. 1 Michigan State. The Nittany Lions narrowly dropped the first game but stole the second one in a shootout to upset the top team in the country.

The Nittany Lions went from 0-8 in conference play to taking 12 of its last 16 Big Ten games and riding a seven-game win streak until it was narrowly snapped by then-No. 2 Minnesota in their last game of the regular season.

The Nittany Lions climbed their way back into the polls after three months out in early February at No. 18, eventually ending the year at No. 15.

Plenty of attention around the league was on the blue and white, especially after being awarded six straight Big Ten Star of the Week awards through the finals weeks of the season, including eight individual stars since the start of the new year.

For a team that desperately needed a spark just a few months ago, its second half heater was exactly the turnaround it had hoped for.

Competing in the Big Ten Tournament has a little more on the line for the Nittany Lions than some others.

With Michigan State, Minnesota, Ohio State and Michigan essentially shoe-ins for the NCAA Tournament, and Wisconsin and Notre Dame needing a miracle run for a bid, Penn State is sitting firmly on the bubble.

A win-and-they’re-in scenario for the Nittany Lions didn’t play out as they had hoped during the last regular season series, dropping its second matchup.

The blue and white’s dreams to go dancing are still very much alive, but it's a do-or-die situation in the conference tournament, with a chance to erase its early season struggles and solidify itself as a Big Ten powerhouse at stake.

When the referee raised Mikah Labuanan’s arm at the end of the Hawaii High School Athletic Association’s 150-pound Boys Wrestling Championship match Feb. 22 in Honolulu, Labuanan became the first wrestler outside of Oahu ever to win four state championships.

The gravity of being the first Maui Interscholastic League wrestler to accomplish the rare feat known as a Grand Slam still hadn’t quite set in for the senior from Kamehameha Schools-Maui on Sunday.

“Man, to this day I don’t really know how to explain how I’m feeling about being a four-time state champion, but to finally achieve a lifelong goal that I set for myself at a young age, it feels really good,” Labuanan said.

“I’ve set this goal for a long time,” he continued. “It’s been a dream of mine since I can remember, and to finally accomplish this goal I set out since I was little — and make that little me proud — it means the world. I can’t describe it in words.”

He said he went into this year’s state tournament feeling ready, confident and healthy, and he “didn’t have as many aches as usual.” Even though he had been to the big show before and felt well prepared for it, the moment wasn’t lost on the wrestler.

“Being at the state tournament — at the Blaisdell — it feels like a much different environment than Ka’ulaheanuiokamoku,” he said. “I honestly can’t really explain the difference in feeling, but walking into the arena again, from my freshman year winning it to now being a senior, walking in there I just felt all the energy, looked around, took in the moment and was ready to compete.”

Labuanan did more than compete; he put on a clinic as he dismantled the 150-pound bracket Feb. 21-22 at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center on his way to the title match.

Following a first-round bye, Labuanan opened the tournament with a 17-2 victory over Carson Suzuki of Assets School. In the quarterfinals, he pinned Waimea’s Kaylo Labanon at 0:51, and then he defeated Leilehua’s Isaiah Caminos-Freitas 19-2 in the semifinals.

In the championship match, Labuanan pinned senior Samson Paaluhi of Kamehameha Schools-Kapalama at 1:52. Once the tournament was over, Labuanan had finished the season with a 25-0 record, putting him at 88-2 throughout his high school career.

“It takes so much effort,” Labuanan said of what it takes to win four state championships. “For everyone watching, they see six minutes of wrestling, but to me and every athlete, you know it’s not just six minutes. It’s hours, days and losing countless hours of sleep, early mornings, late nights, like all of that equals the six minutes on the mat.”

And it wasn’t just special for the wrestler.

“Watching Mikah win his fourth state title and knowing the work he puts in day in and day out was such a proud moment for me as a dad and a coach,” said Michael Labuanan, who has been coaching his son since preschool.

“He set the goal of being the first boy to win the Grand Slam when he was just a young boy playing every sport and watching the older wrestlers accomplish so much in the state tournament and in the big national tournaments,” the father explained. “He kept his dream going every year by entering big tournaments and trained with the best kids and coaches that wanted to train with him.”

Mikah has been wrestling since he was 4 years old, and he has been going to major tournaments on the mainland since he was 8. Even today, he remembers growing up looking up to the high school wrestlers and dreaming of one day becoming a state champion.

“I’d always go to the local tournaments and see all the high school wrestlers and just see how hard they worked,” he said. “There really weren’t a lot of state champs from Maui and no one had ever been a four-time state champ from Maui, and as a boy, I decided to set that goal for myself because I want to be able to come and represent our island.”

Now, he focuses on the sport year-round, and he trains, lifts weights and works out daily in his garage with his teammates and his dad, who describes Mikah as a natural leader on and off the mat, always wanting to help the youth in hopes they will find success in their future.

Outside of wrestling, Labuanan is an accomplished bodyboarder who’s sponsored by multiple companies, and he said the ocean gives him a nice release while helping to keep him centered. He is also a decorated soccer player, but realizing he could go further with wrestling, said he stopped playing soccer competitively to focus on wrestling.

Labuanan said he’s still undecided where he will attend college, but he plans to wrestle at the collegiate level, and California State University, Bakersfield is high on the list of schools he’s considering.

Most of all, Labuanan said he’s grateful for the support he’s received from his family, teammates, coaches and the community that’s backed him all the way to four state championships.

“My whole team, honestly. Especially my dad. He’s been there for me since Day One. He’s been my main coach, my mentor, everything in life. And then my partners,” Labuanan said while rattling off the names of his teammates.

“All those guys really make up who I am as a wrestler,” he said. “Everybody thinks wrestling is an individual sport, but it’s seriously a team sport. You can’t really improve as a wrestler without having good partners. Having good partners around me is one of the reasons I’ve been able to make these jumps and leaps.”

Labuanan said his relationship with God is also important to him, and he often prays for guidance and strength.

“I know no matter what happens at the end of the day, this is just a sport and at the end of the day I just want to be able to represent God, my family and my friends,” he said.

Residents are encouraged to attend a South Maui community meeting being held by Mayor Richard Bissen at 5:30 p.m. ...

Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani is one of the best hitters in baseball, but MLB's all-time home run king thinks it's a little easier now than it was in his heyday. Bonds appeared on the ""All The Smoke"" podcast and said players today have less to worry about at the plate.

When Bonds was asked about Ohtani's brilliance, he did tip his cap to the 2024 NL MVP. Bonds said he admires Ohtani's ability to excel in every aspect of the game.

""The pitching and hitting has been outstanding for what he's done,"" Bonds said. ""Baserunning. He's a complete player. There's no doubt about the type of player he is and what he's accomplished in his career.""

Despite that praise, Bonds asserted that hitting isn't quite as difficult now because fewer pitchers are plunking hitters following home runs. Bonds said Ohtani wouldn't have been able to hit multiple home runs without getting plunked in the old days.

""The game has just changed,"" Bonds said. ""The game is way different than it was when I played. The same way Michael (Jordan) talks about it or anybody does. Ohtani is not gonna hit two home runs without seeing one go (by his ear) in my generation. I don't care what he does. He's not gonna steal two bases without someone decapitating his kneecap to slow him down. It's a different game back then.""

Bonds added there is less retribution for celebrating home runs in today's era. He claimed he would have been hospitalized for gloating after parking a ball in the stands.

""They should be better than us hitting-wise because they can hit a home run, throw their bat up in the air, run around, get a taco, come back down and have a limo drive them around,"" Bonds said. ""All these antics that we weren't allowed to do. If I did anything like that, I'm gonna see a star. I'm gonna see a hospital, but I ain't gonna see baseball that day.""

Another difference Bonds alluded to was how much batting practice players get today. He noted ""these guys hit more than I've ever seen in my lifetime.""

The good news for Bonds, and his home run record, is that Ohtani still has 537 homers to go before catching Bonds. Even with the supposed advantages Ohtani has, that's a tall task for any hitter.

Good morning! I caught you some beads.

We start with football first this morning, as the country’s biggest sport had a surprisingly busy day yesterday. Big names leaving and staying. New directions forged. All that. 

Let’s start with some splashy changes: 

And now for the eye-popping reunions: 



Whew. The legal tampering period doesn’t even start until Monday, either. One massive storyline hanging over us still: 

Stay tuned. Onward:

UConn’s big win
Interesting things are afoot with the two-time defending champion UConn Huskies, who entered last night’s game against No. 20 Marquette unranked. Remember when Dan Hurley turned down the Lakers this offseason to go for a three-peat? It hasn’t gone so well, but last night’s win over the Golden Eagles gives some hope for the elusive dynasty Hurley craves. The Huskies are still a No. 8 seed according to our projections. I thought Brendan Quinn’s big story on Hurley earlier this week was fitting, given last night’s result. Don’t count them out?

GREEN BAY (WLUK) -- Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS) is making its largest investment ever in its Green Bay hospitals.

HSHS is putting $270 million into its St. Mary's hospital location on Shawano Avenue and its St. Vincent hospital location on South Van Buren Street.

The investment will modernize and expand the hospitals to better care for the growing Brown County community.



The largest portion of the investment will go toward expanding St. Mary's, the city's only west side hospital.

Work is expected to begin in summer and will take about three years to complete.

In Northeast Wisconsin, HSHS also operates St. Clare Memorial Hospital in Oconto Falls and St. Nicholas Hospital in Sheboygan. ","{'href': 'https://fox11online.com', 'title': 'Fox11online.com'}"

Software companies like Epic and Oracle say they’re weaving AI into clinicians’ workflows to meet client demand, keep up with competitors and improve the productivity of a swamped healthcare system.

Health records companies are racing to weave artificial intelligence into multiple segments of their software, hoping that by streamlining clunky experiences they can attract clients and keep up with competitors doing the same.

Some of the largest EHR vendors, including Epic and Oracle, have announced or accelerated modernization efforts in recent months. The companies say they aim to increase the productivity of a healthcare system facing rising costs — while improving job satisfaction for doctors and nurses, increasing the quality of patient care and advancing the state of the art of medicine.

The shift represents a sea change for a software often cited by providers as a significant source of frustraction.

“Doctors are not looking for AI to act as a doctor, to step in their place,” said Leigh Burchell, chair of the Electronic Health Records Association. “They really want to take the things that are adminsitrative burdens, or that take them time after a visit to document, and get help with that. So those are really the areas where our members are most focused.”

EHR software allows clinicians to access and update a patient’s complete medical history electronically, including diagnoses, lab results and medications. Healthcare providers in the U.S. were required to adopt EHRs more than one decade ago in order to continue receiving full funds from federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Use of the software spiked, with 78% of physicians and 96% of hospitals using an EHR in 2021, according to government data.

However, doctors often express annoyance with EHRs. The systems can be tricky to use, cluttered with pop-ups and screens and requiring significant time for clinicians to enter and find data. Another common criticism is that EHRs were designed more for billing purposes than for clinical decisionmaking. Many doctors say the systems distract from patient care as a result.

Major EHR vendors have long said they’re working to make their products simpler and easier to use. That crusade is being significantly accelerated by recent advances in AI: like generative AI, which can understand and create original text and images; ambient listening, which marries microphones and machine learning to produce transcripts of clinician-patient encounters in real time; and agentic AI, which can complete complex tasks largely without human oversight.

In the past, navigating EHRs required a lot of data entry and “persistent screen after screen navigation,” Girish Navani, the CEO of EHR vendor eClinicalWorks, said. “If you look at the last two years, the advent and the rapid rise of generative AI makes a lot of those paradigms obsolete.”

Epic, the largest EHR vendor in the U.S., has “been working to incorporate in particular generative AI across the software,” said Seth Howard, Epic’s executive vice president of research and development.

The Wisconsin-based company holds more than one-third of the hospital market, trailed by Oracle Health, at 22%, and Meditech, with 13%, according to health analytics company Definitive Healthcare.

More than 3,100 hospitals use Epic, the company says. And about two-thirds of its customer base are live with the vendor’s generative AI products, according to Howard. Those include algorithms that help doctors write notes and summarize patient information for clinicians prior to a visit.

Epic integrated ambient listening software from a startup called Abridge into its workflow last year, but is working to make its software compatible with more products that can transcribe patient visits in real time, Howard said. The company is also working to make its documentation tools multimodal, so they can understand videos, images and other types of information beyond text.

Over the past year, Epic has also started building a framework aroung agentic AI into its software, to see how digital assistants that can summarize information, interact with patients, schedule followups and more can work together, according to Howard.

Overall, Epic has 125 AI use cases either in development or live, he said.

“We are investing massively to ensure we rapidly innovate and get it right at the same time.""

Similarly, in October Oracle announced that it plans to release a new EHR platform this year that incorporates its clinical AI agent, voice-activated navigation and search capabilities. The clinical agent, which can record and transcribe patient visits and draft a note in the EHR for the clinician’s approval, is currently available for more than 30 medical specialties, the company said on Tuesday.

Bharat Sutariya, Oracle’s chief health officer, called the refresh “nothing short of a complete reinvention of the EHR.”

“We are investing massively to ensure we rapidly innovate and get it right at the same time,” he said.

Meanwhile Meditech and eClinicalWorks, a company that offers cloud-based EHR software currently in use at 70,000 care sites, are pursing a partnership approach.

Meditech has long worked with Google to accelerate clinicians’ access to data and with Microsoft to automate scribing, including deploying Microsoft’s ambient listening and clinical documentation tools into its EHR.

Meditech also plans to include Microsoft’s latest clinical assistant as it rolls out this year, according to Rachel Wilkes, Meditech’s corporate lead for generative AI initiatives. A variety of other AI scribes are also available to Meditech’s customers through integrations with the company’s software, she said.

“We want to keep our existing customer base engaged,” Wilkes said. But “yes, we are looking to attract new customers as well by having a platform that is innovative, scalable, and a really good alternative to maybe other competitors that are out there.”

eClinicalWorks has also partnered with Microsoft to use machine learning to match patient records, and with a company called Healow to create an AI medical scribe and an AI contact center.

EHR vendors are remaking their software with AI despite dogged concerns about quality, privacy, bias and a lack of federal regulation around the technology.

Generative AI in particular is tricky to monitor. The models are known to hallucinate, or provide factually incorrect or irrelevant answers, or omit information altogether. Their performance can also degrade over time, in a phenomenon called model drift.

Still, records companies say that they, along with their clients, are carefully supervising AI to make sure they’re not making up any information — or leaving anything out.

Leaders with eClinicalWorks, Meditech and Epic said they’ve invested heavily in risk management and have stood up stringent guardrails, including ongoing assessment by clinicians.

There should always be a human in the loop when it comes to ambient documentation and generative AI products, said Meditech’s Wilkes.

Meditech also includes disclaimer language on any records created by AI, sharing that it was created by an algorithm and reviewed by medical staff. The company is working to put more formal citations into the workflow to clarify what’s generated and where the model pulled relevant information from, Wilkes said.

Epic applies the same principles to ensuring AI quality as it does to any other software to make sure it works well and isn’t causing harm, according to Howard.

But “the techniques you might use to understand, ‘is it working well?’ are different,” Howard said.

Still, despite concerns with the models, hospital customers are full steam ahead on adoption, vendors say. According to a survey from HIMSS conducted in the fall, 86% of respondents already leverage AI in their medical organizations, mostly for administrative tasks, though there’s growing interest in more clinical use cases.

“Our customers are very warm to it. More warm over the past 12 months,” said Wilkes. “We’ve gone from doing a lot of education about the impact, to — now the question we’re getting is, ‘When? When can I get it? How much is it going to cost? What’s the plan?’.”

“There’s always going to be the early adopters, the mid adopters and the lagging adopters of technology. It’s happened with smartphones, it happened with color TV, it’s happened with every product,” said eClinicalWorks’ Navani. “All I can tell you today is we are seeing incredible multiples of customers who you would call early adopters.”

But “this is not just being done because modern is new and it’s good,” Navani continued. “It’s got a clear efficiency benefit written all over it. That’s driving the change.”

Republicans are expected to fall short of their goal to slash the budget by $1.5tn despite Donald Trump’s assurances

Republicans cannot reach their budget goal of slashing at least $1.5tn in spending over the next decade to fund Donald Trump’s tax cuts and immigration crackdown without cutting healthcare relied upon by tens of millions of Americans – including seniors and children, according to the non-partisan budget assessor.

House Republicans last week narrowly passed a budget instructing the energy and commerce committee, which is responsible for federal healthcare, to cut spending under its jurisdiction by $880bn – in order to pay for Trump’s tax cuts, mass deportations and defence investments.

The House speaker, Mike Johnson, insists that the spending purge can be achieved by rooting out waste, fraud and tightening eligibility requirements, and that healthcare is safe in Republican hands.

But the numbers do not add up, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on Wednesday.

The independent in-house agency confirmed that it would be impossible to reduce spending by $880bn without cuts to Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip). That’s because after excluding Medicare, Medicaid and Chip, the committee oversees only $381bn in spending – much less than the $880bn target – the CBO said.

Trump and his Republican party want to extend the soon-to-expire 2017 tax cut law – which would cost nearly $5tn – while also spending hundreds of billions of dollars on their so-called “America first” agenda. To do so without further increasing the national debt, Republicans are looking to slash spending on existing programs.

Trump has repeatedly said he will not cut social security, Medicare or Medicaid – the country’s principal safety net programs which together accounted for almost half the $6.75tn federal spending in the last fiscal year.

Medicaid covers around 70 million low-income people, or one in five Americans, while Medicare provides health coverage for 66 million seniors over the age of 65. Chip is designed to cover uninsured children in families that don’t qualify for Medicaid.

But the CBO assessment, which was requested by Democratic congressman Frank Pallone, the ranking member of the energy and commerce committee, and Brendan Boyle, ranking member of the budget committee, makes clear that the unprecedented spending cuts will be impossible without dismantling the social safety net programs relied upon by large numbers of Americans in every district – Republican and Democratic – across the country.

“This letter from CBO confirms what we’ve been saying all along: the math doesn’t work without devastating Medicaid cuts,” said Pallone in a statement. “Republicans know their spin is a lie, and the truth is they have no problem taking healthcare away from millions of Americans so that the rich can get richer and pay less in taxes than they already do.”

Cuts to health and social security would be devastating for millions of Americans – and was categorically denied by Trump on the 2024 campaign trail.

The House is expected to vote on a motion on Thursday to censure Democrat Al Green for interrupting Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday night by shouting: “You have no mandate to cut Medicaid.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Military hospitals consistently earn top safety ratings. It’s easy to view these scores yourself.

Last year, 15 military hospitals earned “A” grades from the Leapfrog Group. This means that 75% of participating Defense Health Agency hospitals earned top grades. This is far above the national average of 32%.

Some DHA hospitals didn’t see enough patients to qualify for Leapfrog grades last year. But DHA has strict safety standards at all military hospitals and clinics.

“Our military hospitals rank among the nation’s safest,” said Heidi King, chief of DHA’s Patient Safety Program. “Our healthcare teams work every day to protect patients from preventable harm and deliver excellent care.”

These military hospitals earned “A” grades in fall 2024.

DHA started working with Leapfrog to check hospital quality five years ago. It became the first federal health system to participate in the safety grade program. DHA expanded the program after success at Walter Reed. 

These programs and others work together to create safer care for you at military hospitals and clinics.

You can compare up to three hospitals at once on this page.

You can also check out reports from the Joint Commission. The Joint Commission is an independent organization that accredits U.S. hospitals. The Joint Commission visits every U.S. hospital every three years. During these visits, experts check safety measures. These can range from hand washing to medication storage.

The chief medical officer of Providence Medical Group, Serene Perkins, spoke about the role of artificial intelligence, or AI, in health care at a conference on AI innovation Feb. 28 in Anchorage.

She outlined the AI tools Providence is already using across its network of health care facilities in Alaska and in six other states.

She said one AI tool Providence has incorporated uses artificial intelligence to analyze patient messages to providers. It identifies patients with the highest immediate risk so a health care provider can respond quickly.

“Things like suicidal ideation,” Perkins said. “We need to get that to the top of the inbox. We need to make sure that there is a mental health counselor that can get in touch with that person right away.”

Perkins said the AI tool adheres to HIPAA, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a federal law protecting patients’ privacy.

She said the biggest potential for AI interventions in the long term are for managing chronic disease and illness.

“The more that we can use AI to really attack those and be able to monitor patients on a much more frequent basis and prevent them from getting to the place where they have to be hospitalized, because once they're at that higher level of care, or need a surgery, the complications go up exponentially,” Perkins said.

She said Providence also recently started a program that incorporates wearable glucose monitors with AI to help manage diabetes.

Perkins said as a patient, she experienced the benefits of AI when her physician used an AI transcription note-taking service during her annual physical exam.

“To be able to sit there and have a 20-minute face-to-face conversation where she's not worrying about forgetting anything that I'm saying and I'm not watching her type on the computer, turned away from me, I experienced it myself, the transformation,” Perkins said.

But she said using AI is a big responsibility. “We have to be in charge of it.”

Perkins said there's potential in the future for AI to help manage other kinds of chronic disease, like depression or cancer. But she said, for now, Providence is sticking to using artificial intelligence for diabetes and heart health care. She said once they get those applications right and can show patient outcomes are improving, they can explore using AI to aid treatment of other health conditions.","{'href': 'https://alaskapublic.org', 'title': 'Alaska Public Media News'}"

Sandy Saggar, the new CEO of Connexall

Too often, hospitals and health systems invest in new systems only to face integration challenges, fragmented workflows and data silos that hinder efficiency – the goal is to emphasize that health IT is not just about technology, it's about enabling smarter, more connected healthcare environments, said Sandy Saggar, the new CEO of Connexall, about what he and his team are communicating to HIMSS25 attendees.

Connexall, in Booth 4675, is a vendor of clinical communication and workflow automation technologies.

""The future of healthcare depends on vendor-neutral interoperability, ensuring technology works for care teams rather than complicating their jobs,"" he said. ""By focusing on systems that seamlessly unify hospital ecosystems, healthcare leaders can maximize the value of their existing investments, improve coordination across departments, and make real-time, data-driven decisions that directly impact patient care.

""Beyond connectivity, the real transformation lies in how technology empowers people,"" he continued. ""The healthcare workforce is under immense pressure, facing staffing shortages, burnout and growing administrative burdens. Smart health IT systems must do more than just exchange data – they need to enhance clinical workflows, reduce inefficiencies and support frontline staff in delivering better care.""

As digital transformation accelerates, hospitals must move beyond fragmented point systems and adopt a holistic approach that breaks down silos, supports better decision making, and ultimately improves both operational efficiency and patient outcomes, he added.

""The future of healthcare isn't just about adopting new technologies – it's about ensuring they work together to create a truly unified, efficient and patient-centered healthcare system,"" he said.

As for what's hot at HIMSS25, Saggar points to AI, interoperability and telehealth.

""Artificial intelligence and automation are at the forefront of healthcare transformation, tackling some of the most persistent challenges in the industry,"" he noted. ""AI-powered systems are streamlining administrative workflows, helping to reduce clinician burden, and enhancing decision making by delivering real-time insights at the point of care.

""Predictive analytics, fueled by AI, are enabling hospitals to anticipate patient deterioration, optimize staffing and improve resource allocation before issues arise,"" he continued. ""Automation also is playing a crucial role in reducing manual, repetitive tasks, allowing clinicians to focus more on direct patient care rather than being bogged down by administrative processes.""

In an era of staffing shortages and increasing demand, these technologies are essential for maintaining high-quality care while improving operational efficiency, he added.

""Meanwhile, interoperability remains a top priority as hospitals strive to break free from siloed systems and disconnected workflows,"" Saggar said. ""Many health systems are moving toward vendor-neutral platforms that can integrate data across various clinical and operational systems, ensuring seamless communication across departments.

""Telehealth and virtual care continue to evolve, blending in-person visits with remote patient monitoring, AI-driven diagnostics and command center models that centralize hospital operations for more efficient patient flow,"" he continued. ""At the same time, cybersecurity has become a growing concern, with rising threats pushing healthcare organizations to strengthen data protection measures, enhance identity management and implement more robust security protocols.""

As hospitals navigate an increasingly complex digital landscape, the focus must remain on leveraging technology in ways that improve care delivery, enhance patient outcomes and create a more resilient healthcare system, he added.

For participants at HIMSS25, Saggar shared thoughts based on his previous experience as a health system CIO.

""There will constantly be emerging technologies and transformative opportunities, such as artificial intelligence, and you should always plan and pace your execution methodically for them,"" he advised. ""As long as they provide value, of course. But don't lose sight of all the investments and technologies that you already have in place and the optimization and interoperability opportunities that still exist.

""This is a more immediate and tangible benefit that you can help enable for your patients, clinicians and staff,"" he concluded.

One of healthcare’s biggest ongoing trends is the substantial rise of coronary CT angiography (CCTA). Hospitals and health systems that fail to embrace the modality risk falling behind.

CCTA has been growing more and more popular for years now, providing care teams with a noninvasive way to evaluate heart patients for a long list of potential complications. The modality was once used more as a gatekeeper—abnormal results would simply trigger physicians to order additional imaging. Now, however, CCTA offers a detailed look at the patient’s coronaries, including any worrisome plaques that may require treatment. 

Along the way, CCTA has earned class IA recommendations in guidelines developed by the European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and other leading medical societies. In addition, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized a new payment policy in 2024 that more than doubled the Medicare reimbursements hospitals receive for performing CCTA. U.S. cardiologists and imaging specialists cheered the news, knowing it would now be easier than ever to use cardiac CT when appropriate. 

California-based Heartflow is a leader in artificial intelligence (AI)-based CCTA evaluations, offering such software solutions as Roadmap Analysis, FFRCT Analysis and Plaque Analysis to help physicians identify, diagnose and manage potentially fatal cardiac complications. These technologies have made a considerable impact on patient care, even helping influence the recent CMS decision to expand Medicare coverage for using certain AI algorithms to assess CCTA results. 

It's with this forward momentum in mind that Georgia-based Wellstar Health System has collaborated with Cardiovascular Business on a new webinar designed to help healthcare executives, cardiologists, radiologists, cath lab directors and other cardiac imaging specialists learn more about how to build a thriving CCTA program.

The webinar, Wellstar’s CCTA + Heartflow Program Impact: Improving Patient Care While Driving Financial Growth, is scheduled for Tuesday, March 11 at 12 p.m. ET. An expert panel, including three Wellstar Health System leaders, will discuss their experience with CCTA before the floor is opened for a live Q&A session.

Access to healthcare, social isolation and financial worries are some of the challenges Howard County residents faced in 2024, according to a survey conducted by the county health department. 

The latest Howard County Health Assesment surveyed 2,266 adult residents to create a comprehensive view of health conditions and behaviors in the county. The health department has been conducting the survey since 2012.

In the most recent survey, 90% of participants said they have health coverage, a decline from 95% in 2016. According to the survey, residents faced challenges accessing high-quality, coordinated health care. 

""As a hospital, we see firsthand how barriers to health care coverage force patients to delay or forego treatment. Without proper coverage or a primary doctor, patients wait longer for care, leading to more complex health issues that impact the hospital's patient flow,"" said Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center President M. Shafeeq Ahmed, M.D.

Mental health and social isolation also posed challenges for residents, despite the survey reporting an increase in residents receiving treatment for mental health conditions. 

The survey found that 23% of participants were taking medicine or getting treatment for mental health conditions or emotional problems. That number has steadily increased from 7% in 2014. 

According to the survey, many Howard County residents suffered from financial worries and challenges in 2024. 

According to the study, 18% of participants said they ""often"" or ""sometimes"" worried that their food would run out before they had money to buy more, an increase of two percentage points since the 2021 survey. 

In the survey, 14% said their food ""often"" or ""sometimes"" did run out.

The survey also revealed that chronic health issues are getting worse in Howard County. 

About 63% of participants are considered either overweight or obese based on heights and weights reported in the survey. That number has increased from 56% in 2012, though it has plateaued at 63% since 2018. 

According to the survey, cigarette use has decreased in Howard County. The number of participants who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their life decreased from a 28% average in the previous three surveys to 20% in the 2024 survey. 

Howard County leaders use the survey to determine the areas of concern for residents and how they can expand programs and services to address the issues. 

""While it's encouraging to see declines in smoking and increased access to mental health treatment, we must address rising concerns like healthcare access, financial hardship, and chronic disease,"" said Howard County Health Officer Dr. Maura Rossman. 

The health department partners with the Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center, the Horizon Foundation and the Columbia Foundation to develop initiatives and strategies to address the issues reported by residents in the survey. 

""The survey underscores that racial inequities play a significant role in determining access to and quality of health care, highlighting the urgent need to address these disparities,"" said Nikki Highsmith Vernick, President and CEO of the Horizon Foundation.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), Texas’s leading small business advocacy organization, has released a health are policy paper that reveals a dire prognosis for the small-group insurance market as employer-provided health coverage is becoming unsustainable for millions of small businesses and their employees.

The report, Addressing the Health Insurance Affordability Crisis for Small Businesses, underscores the urgency for Texas to pass SB 818 and HB 1906. The bills would set up a process for estimating how proposed legislation could impact the cost of private health coverage for employers and families, filling a critical gap in Texas’ approach to benefit mandates.

“Health insurance costs have been the number one concern for small business owners for nearly 40 years,” said NFIB State Director Jeff Burdett. “Our small employers need real solutions to access affordable health policies.”

Key findings from the national report:
■ The small-group market is in freefall, with enrollment plummeting from 15 million individuals in 2014 to just 8.5 million in 2023, a 44% drop.
■ Average premiums for small businesses have skyrocketed: Average single plan premiums have gone up 120% in the last two decades, while average family plan premiums have increased by 129% for firms with 50 or fewer employees.
■ Only 30% of small businesses still offer health insurance, down from nearly 50% in 2000.
■ Ninety-eight percent of small businesses say they are concerned about whether they will be able to afford to continue offering health insurance in the next five years.
■ Small businesses pay twice as much for health insurance as large businesses, firms with less than $600,000 in revenue spend nearly 12% of payroll on health benefits, compared to 7% for firms with over $2.4 million in revenue.

“We will continue working with lawmakers on pro-small business health insurance legislation this session to immediately help Main Street businesses and their employees,” Burdett said. Click here to read the full report.

Vendors say their AI scribes and assistants will save doctors time. But the need for careful oversight and hospitals’ financial incentives could complicate things.

As hype grows around artificial intelligence in healthcare, a seemingly paradoxical question is setting off faint warning bells in the minds of skeptics and proponents alike: Could AI tools meant to reduce clinician burden actually increase it?

It’s too soon to say, given the technology’s nascency. But the answer — which has big implications for the future adoption of AI in the industry — depends in part on how intensely clinicians have to fact-check models’ outputs, along with financial incentives in healthcare’s majority fee-for-service payment infrastructure, according to experts.

All told, AI products could add up to weaker time savings than developers promise, and any time saved could quickly be filled up by additional patient visits as hospitals and medical groups hustle to increase earnings.

“That’s absolutely a worry,” said Graham Walker, the co-director for advanced development at Kaiser Permanente’s medical group, during a panel at the HIMSS healthcare conference in Las Vegas. “The easiest way to get more revenue out of your healthcare system is by telling the doctors and [nurse practitioners] and pharmacists to go faster and see maybe just one more patient.”

The goal of many AI tools in healthcare is to reduce administrative friction by helping with rote tasks like documenting patient visits, looking up medical information or filing paperwork. Such tasks contribute to clinician burnout, which is a major problem in the industry and can lead physicians to exit the field.

About one-third of doctors responding to an American Medical Association survey in 2023 said they were interested in or planning to leave their jobs in the next few years. Many cited work overload as the reason: According to some research, healthcare workers spend the majority of their week working on administrative tasks.

Enter AI. Algorithms have been in use by healthcare companies for decades, but excitement around the tech has reached a fever pitch in the past few years with advancements like generative AI, which can create original text, and AI agents, which can perform tasks without human oversight.

A number of companies are folding the technology into sleekly-packaged products, touting time-saving metrics that may almost seem too good to be true to clinicians sick of after-hours ‘pajama time’ spent on documentation.

Abridge, a startup that uses ambient listening and generative AI to automate clinical notetaking, and Nabla, another ambient AI assistant, both claim to save providers about two hours each day.

Software giant Oracle has woven AI into its health records platform for providers, including a clinical AI assistant. Physicians using that tool see a 30% decrease in documentation time, according to the company.

Meanwhile, Microsoft says its AI documentation product saves doctors five minutes on average per patient visit.

“The capabilities that AI scribes bring to the practice of care are remarkable,” said Rohit Chandra, the chief digital officer at the Cleveland Clinic, during a panel. (The academic medical system is currently rolling out an AI documentation software from Ambience across its provider network.)

Documentation products tackle an acute pain point for doctors, while being relatively simple to use, easy to implement and safe, because they’re supervised by clinicians, Chandra said. 

However, AI performance metrics such as time saved should be taken with a grain of salt, according to experts.

Clinicians still need to review the AI’s output to catch mistakes. That process, known as ‘human in the loop’, is key to ensure accuracy and build trust in AI, experts say.

Letting AI tools operate unsupervised could result in medical records containing made-up symptoms, or missing information that could be key to a patient’s health.

“That’s where I think we can get into trouble. The technology is going to get to the point where, at least in my opinion, I don’t think we’re going to need to worry as much. But as we think about early adoption, we do have to be cognizant that it is going to make mistakes,” Brenton Hill, head of operations at health AI standards group the Coalition of Health AI, said during a panel.

But deputizing clinicians to police what AI generates can cut significantly into time savings or, in some cases, erase them altogether.

“The tools aren’t perfect,” said Deborah Edberg, a family medicine physician with CVS-owned primary care chain Oak Street Health, during a panel. “We use AI to do our documentation and I do spend quite a bit of time going back and editing ... It can be a bit of a burden to make sure that what is recorded is accurate.”

To date, there have been no extensive, independent reviews of AI scribes in healthcare. But one recent study published in JAMA Network Open found Microsoft’s ambient scribe received mixed feedback from users.

“A recurring theme was the need for substantial editing and proofreading of the AI-generated notes, which sometimes offset the time saved,” the researchers wrote.

Fee-for-service incentives could also prove a problem. The payment structure, which underpins the majority of healthcare spending in the U.S., rewards providers based on the volume of visits, tests and procedures they perform.

Meanwhile, despite a recovery in operating margins since the COVID-19 pandemic, costs are continuing to rise for hospital operators.

As a result, hospitals and other physician owners are incentivized to stuff their clinicians’ schedules as tightly as possible, to bring in as much revenue as possible. Any time freed up for doctors by AI might be filled with another visit, experts say.

“It could happen. And some organizations want to do that. And from our perspective, that’s an organizational decision,” Rachel Wilkes, the corporate lead for generative AI initiatives at EHR vendor Meditech, said. “If they want to schedule more patients with time savings, they can do that.”

Things that improve the productivity of the healthcare system — like reducing patient no-shows — often result in a heavier visit load for physicians, said Seth Howard, executive vice president of research and development at Epic.

“The conversation between the health system and the doctors need to be, ‘What do we do with those time savings?’ Does it go back into helping the doctor have some flexibility during the day? ... Or for doctors to see more patients?” Howard said.

Vendors are aware that the draw of AI products for hospitals includes the potential to increase revenue. 

Along with saving five minutes per encounter, Microsoft’s ambient AI frees up “13 additional appointment slots per provider, per month,” according to marketing materials.

The need to bolster flagging finances is one reason hospitals are ravenous for the tools, experts say. Demand has been skyrocketing, with the CEO of one company using AI to automate provider workflows likening it to “a fairy tale.”

“Our ambient product went from zero appointments a year two years ago, to a couple hundred thousand last year, to on track for 10 million this year,” said Tanay Tandon, the CEO of Commure, during a panel. “That sort of expansion and usage of AI in healthcare is incredibly exciting. That’s no longer your nerdy technical doctors playing around with it in the corner. This is meaningful use.”

Experts say like with any other technology, there are pros and cons when it comes to AI scribes, assistants and similar tools. In addition, other metrics besides time saved are important to physicians, like reducing their mental load by simplifying tasks or improving their job satisfaction by allowing them to focus on clinical care.

And anecdotal feedback from clinicians has been great, according to tech giants, AI scribes and the EHR vendors weaving the tech into their workflows.

Epic, for example, doesn’t have an average figure for how much time its own ambient documentation tool saves. But according to Howard, “physicians say, very commonly, I could never go back to how I did documentation before.”

The first thing IT leaders at hospitals and health systems need to do today is fix the ""boring stuff"" – inefficiencies in patient flow, staff coordination and equipment management are responsible for significant waste, advised Philipp von Gilsa, CEO of Kontakt.io, a vendor of a care orchestration platform that combines AI-powered real-time location services and fully managed IoT infrastructure as a service. The company is in Booth 2250 at HIMSS25.

""For example, delays in room turnover lead to bed shortages, misplaced assets result in unnecessary capital expenditures, and fragmented processes force clinicians to spend time on phone calls instead of patient care,"" he explained. ""By unifying RTLS data with the EHR and leveraging AI, hospitals can better orchestrate care and resources throughout the patient journey, ensuring the right patient, staff and equipment are in the right place at the right time.

""Second, anticipate 'agentic orchestration' beyond static dashboards and manual processes,"" he continued. ""The key to reducing waste is not just tracking assets or collecting more data. It's using automation and AI-driven insights to make hospital operations proactive instead of reactive.""

Instead of manually coordinating bed assignments, discharges and equipment availability, hospitals should integrate AI-powered automation to continuously optimize patient flow, reduce wait times and maximize capacity, he added.

""RTLS provides real-time visibility into every resource in the hospital, while agentic AI orchestrates care delivery, helping staff focus on bedside care,"" von Gilsa said. ""By leveraging agentic AI to proactively predict demands and align resources just-in-time with staff and patient needs, hospital leaders can significantly cut waste, unlock capacity, improve financial performance, and, most important, enhance the quality of care for patients.""

Like many executives surrounding HIMSS25, he sees artificial intelligence as the technology dominating the conference and exhibition. And he has thoughts on the subject.

""AI will be critical to the future of hospitals because it enables healthcare organizations to operate more efficiently, reduce costs and improve patient care at scale,"" he said. ""AI can analyze vast amounts of data from electronic health records, real-time hospital operations and historical trends to optimize resource allocation, predict patient needs and automate time-consuming administrative tasks.

""From reducing length of stay through predictive discharge planning to enhancing workforce productivity by dynamically assigning tasks, AI helps hospitals maximize their existing capacity without adding unnecessary expenses.,"" he continued.

On a more personal note, RTLS powered by AI will be transformative for hospitals beyond providing real-time visibility into the movement of patients, staff and equipment, ultimately leading to better resource utilization and cost savings, he added.

""Hospitals today lose millions of dollars due to misplaced assets, inefficient workflows, and avoidable delays that impact both financial performance and patient outcomes,"" he explained. ""AI-powered RTLS eliminates these inefficiencies. And financially, it helps hospitals reduce unnecessary capital expenditures; operationally, it enhances care coordination; and for patients, it means shorter wait times, faster admissions and a smoother overall hospital experience.""

Interrupted access to health-related data has already led to worse outcomes and could undermine faith in the U.S. healthcare system, experts say.

The nation’s ability to combat emerging infectious diseases and chronic health conditions will be hamstrung by the Trump administration’s attempt to limit access to federal healthcare data, according to medical experts.

Federal agencies scrubbed healthcare data from their websites in January in an attempt to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive orders on sex and gender; diversity, equity and inclusion; and foreign aid.

After Trump signed the executive orders, many widespread, large-scale national health surveys, indices and dashboards went offline on Jan. 31. These data sources inform research, policymaking and medical decision-making.

By Feb. 2, some landing pages returned online with warning messages that the website’s contents had been or would be modified to comply with the executive orders. Following a lawsuit by Doctors for America, U.S. District Judge John Bates on Feb. 11 directed the Trump administration to reinstate certain data on HHS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration websites, noting that lack of access to such data impaired medical treatment. 

The ruling followed a letter sent by nearly 80 members of Congress to the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget insisting the Trump administration restore health data, which lawmakers called “essential to government accountability, public and private sector research, and the work conducted by businesses and non-profits across the country.”

Read on to learn more about the health data purge’s greatest impacts. 

In its complaint, Doctors for America said the executive orders prevented a physician from accessing critical CDC resources to address a chlamydia outbreak.

“In the short time that important web pages were removed from the websites of major public health agencies, our members have seen firsthand how dangerous it can be to practice medicine without critical clinical information,” Christine Petrin, president of the board of directors for Doctors for America, said in a statement on the temporary restraining order.

The health data purge also hampered access to key tools used to respond to infectious diseases.

During the pause, the CDC temporarily removed access to AtlasPlus, an interactive tool that many public health professionals, policymakers, providers and others rely on to respond to infectious disease outbreaks. 

AtlasPlus features nearly 20 years of surveillance data on HIV, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis, allowing users to create customized tables, maps and charts. Users can also view social determinants of health alongside surveillance data on each disease, making it easier to determine which groups may be most vulnerable.

Providers say it’s essential to ensure reliable access to such information.

“The removal of datasets and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) websites to comply with the President’s recent executive order puts the health and wellbeing of patients at risk and makes it more difficult for physicians to provide quality care,” according to a joint statement by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics and others. “These resources are not just academic references - they are vital for real-time clinical decision-making in hospitals, clinics and emergency departments across the country.”

Although it’s unclear exactly how the Trump administration’s changes could affect future access to infectious disease and related data, the long-term consequences could be dire if there is less information about which populations are most vulnerable to infection, said Susan Polan, associate executive director for public affairs and advocacy at the American Public Health Association. 

Limited access could hamstring the nation’s ability to combat public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected specific populations like older adults.

It’s especially worrisome because state and local public health agencies rely on federal agencies for funding, data collection and aggregation, which allows public health professionals to identify the source of an infectious disease outbreak, Polan said. 

If infectious disease-related data becomes “siloed” across 50 states — or “even worse,” 3,300 local health departments — it would be challenging to identify the source of an outbreak, such as the ongoing tuberculosis outbreak in Kansas or the measles outbreak in Texas, Polan said. 

In some instances, it may even be difficult for public health officials to identify when illnesses are connected instead of isolated incidents, such as during an E. coli outbreak, potentially obfuscating the outbreak entirely and hampering their response, Polan said.

The Trump administration also temporarily removed access to the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the world's largest continuously conducted health survey system, which provides detailed information on obesity rates, access to breast cancer screenings, vaccination rates and the share of people with pre-existing conditions.

It’s beneficial for understanding health issues in low-population states and rural areas because it collects data in every state, according to KFF.

The CDC also temporarily removed access to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which tracks behaviors like smoking and exercise habits that can influence high school students’ health and social outcomes.

“Recently, the YRBS has asked respondents about their sexual orientation and gender identity, and the data has been used to highlight substantial mental health disparities among LGBTQ+ high school students, compared to their non-LGBTQ+ peers,” KFF said.

While federal officials reinstated BRFSS access, including sexual orientation and gender identity data, some of that information could disappear or stop being collected, making related research difficult or impossible. 

A message on the BRFSS homepage says, “CDC’s website is being modified to comply with President Trump's Executive Orders.” Additionally, the Trump administration posted a message on the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System homepage stating “any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.”

Without precise information about who is getting sick and where, it could become increasingly difficult for providers and payers to carry out population health management and value-based care initiatives that improve health outcomes and lower costs. 

“It’s going to waste more money,” APHA’s Polan said. “People are going to be harmed.”

Many experts worry that limiting the type and quantity of health-related data collected by federal agencies and restricting access could lead to worse health policies and diminish trust in the U.S. healthcare system. 

The federal government should collect as much health-related data and information as possible to ensure policymakers are well-positioned to develop and implement effective health policies, regardless of their political or policy preferences, said Brian Castrucci, president and CEO of the de Beaumont Foundation. 

Decisions about interpreting and using that information should occur during the policymaking process, not during data collection, Castrucci said.

If the Trump administration stops collecting or sharing certain data for ideological reasons, “the bias is baked in from the start” because “measuring questions have become policy questions,” Castrucci said.

“Let the policymakers make the policy,” Castrucci said. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the first Trump administration directed health systems to report COVID cases and intensive care unit capacities to TeleTracking Technologies, a private company, instead of the CDC. That led to the loss of real-time COVID data and widespread confusion. The administration later came under fire for improperly awarding a federal contract to the company, which had ties to the Trump Organization. 

“The legacy of COVID is that we politicized basic information,” Castrucci said. “We couldn’t even get a case count.”

Further politicizing health-related data could create lasting, potentially irreversible damage.

“If the belief in the veracity of the data is dependent on who sits in the Oval Office, then we've lost any sense of information, of data, of objectivity,” Castrucci said.

Trent Green will step down in April, less than two years after he took on the chief executive role at the Amazon-owned primary care provider, according to a spokesperson.

Trent Green is stepping down as CEO of Amazon One Medical on April 4 after less than two years at the helm of the primary care provider, according to a company spokesperson.

He’ll start work as chief executive of the National Research Corporation, a healthcare analytics firm, on June 1.

Before he was CEO, Green was chief operating officer of One Medical, according to his LinkedIn. Green was appointed to replace Amir Dan Rubin as CEO of the primary care provider in August 2023, after Rubin served more than six years as chief executive. 

He joined the provider as COO just as Amazon inked plans to acquire One Medical for $3.9 billion. 

Since the retail and e-commerce giant closed the deal in early 2023, Amazon has taken steps to integrate One Medical into its other products, including offering membership discounts for Prime customers, folding Amazon’s telehealth marketplace into the primary care chain and rebranding its senior care centers under the One Medical name. 

The CEO change comes about a year after Amazon cut hundreds of jobs across One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy and closed several corporate offices. In the fall, the primary care chain said it was partnering with Cleveland Clinic to build clinics in Ohio, and it announced a partnership with New York-based Montefiore Health System early this year.

One Medical hasn’t been Amazon’s only foray into healthcare. The company acquired online pharmacy PillPack in 2018, later launching its own pharmacy arm. The company has also shut down some of its healthcare enterprises. It shuttered employee healthcare service Amazon Care in 2022 and a joint healthcare venture with J.P.

Times are changing, and patients now expect the same seamless integrated payment experience with their healthcare provider that they get with other industries, such as retail.

Healthcare providers need to adapt and implement secure new payment technologies across all their patient-facing environments, said John Welch, chief product officer at TrustCommerce, a payments technology company in Booth 2648 at HIMSS25.

""Implementing omnichannel payment systems allows patients to pay how they want, when they want – whether in person at point-of-service locations, through patient portals, via mobile devices, or over the phone with call center agents,"" he explained. ""This comprehensive approach ensures consistency and convenience while meeting patients where they are in their healthcare journey.

""To enhance security and reduce compliance burdens, providers should strongly consider deploying validated point-to-point encrypted (vP2PE) devices across their in-person environments,"" he continued. ""These solutions, along with hosted payment pages and tokenization technology, significantly decrease risk by helping keep sensitive payment data out of healthcare provider environments while also helping descope their systems from PCI DSS requirements.""

Additionally, healthcare organizations can benefit from centralizing their payment processing with one vendor, he suggested.

""One significant benefit of consolidating payment vendors is unified reporting across all payment channels, providing a comprehensive view of transaction data,"" Welch contended. ""This enhances efficiency by reducing manual overhead, streamlining reconciliation processes and offering valuable insights for strategic decision making.""

Welch has been offering advice to CIOs and other hospital and health system IT leaders on payment technologies. This is some he is sharing around HIMSS25.

""Healthcare leaders have numerous opportunities to enhance efficiency, streamline processes and improve patient collections – all while securing payment data and reducing their PCI DSS compliance burden,"" he explained. ""To maximize efficiency and deliver a seamless patient experience, providers should take a holistic approach to their payment processes, considering all touchpoints, including in-person locations, phone services, online platforms and mobile apps.

""This comprehensive strategy ensures consistency across channels while identifying opportunities for process optimization that can significantly impact both operational costs and patient satisfaction metrics,"" he continued.

On another front, Welch recommends conducting a thorough assessment of one's current payment infrastructure to identify security vulnerabilities, compliance gaps and friction points in the patient payment journey.

""Many healthcare organizations are operating with legacy systems or disconnected systems that create unnecessary complexity and increase risk exposure,"" he said. ""By mapping the entire payment ecosystem and evaluating each component against best practices for security and user experience, leaders can develop a strategic roadmap for technology investments that deliver measurable improvements in key performance indicators while addressing emerging threats.

""Focus particularly on implementations that can provide quick wins in both patient satisfaction and staff efficiency, such as self-service payment options and automated reconciliation tools that reduce manual workloads while improving accuracy,"" he concluded.

Health IT leaders must prioritize flexibility and interoperability in technology investments so they improve the patient experience – the demand for digital experiences continues to grow, and rigid, siloed systems fail to meet the needs of modern healthcare, said Jeff Fallon, CEO of Vibe Health by eVideon, a vendor of smart room technology and digital workflow systems. The company is in Booth C3714 at HIMSS25.

""Invest in open, scalable infrastructure to ensure long-term adaptability, reduce technical debt and position organizations to integrate emerging technologies without costly overhauls,"" he advised HIMSS25 attendees.

""Another priority is aligning technology with clinical and operational goals,"" he continued. ""Smart hospital initiatives must reduce clinician burden, enhance communication and improve the patient experience. Systems that automate routine tasks, enable real-time data sharing and integrate with existing workflows drive measurable impact. IT leaders must work closely with clinical teams to ensure technology supports – not complicates – care delivery.""

HIMSS25 offers an opportunity to evaluate systems that enhance both efficiency and experience – the smartest investments evolve with healthcare's needs, break down silos, and empower clinicians and patients alike, he added.

AI and cybersecurity are driving key discussions at HIMSS25, Fallon said of what he views as the big technologies at the show.

""The AI in Healthcare Forum covers real-world applications that cut administrative burden, optimize workflows and improve clinical decision making,"" he observed. ""Health systems turn to AI for predictive analytics, automation and precision medicine to maximize efficiency with fewer resources.

""And cybersecurity remains a top priority, with the Cybersecurity Forum and Command Center addressing the latest threats and strategies,"" he continued. ""Health systems face rising cyberattacks, stricter regulations and expanding digital footprints. A proactive approach secures patient data, blocks ransomware attacks and builds system resilience.""

On the exhibit hall floor, Fallon and his team have a primary message they are communicating to the hospital and health system attendees.

""Our main message is that smart room technology plays a transformative role in enhancing the patient and clinician experience while improving operational efficiency,"" he said. ""Hospitals and health systems, like Northwell Health, Nebraska Medicine and Valley Health System, are successfully integrating our systems to streamline workflows and empower patients and care teams.

""These real-world examples highlight how technology can be used to optimize clinical processes, improve communication, and create a more personalized care environment that benefits everyone – patients, families, clinicians and hospital staff,"" he concluded.

We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) stands against other trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

For centuries, work has been about physical abilities on farms in the factories and industries. There has been a paradigm shift in recent years, with work being about intellectual abilities. The trend is gathering steam as artificial intelligence increasingly disrupts global industries and workforces.

The emergence of AI is igniting a fresh conversation. As automation assumes more manual jobs and artificial intelligence dominates more cognitive functions, humanity will be characterized by its social skills. “But [generative AI] isn’t just another invention,” said Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn. “It’s a turning point, forcing us to rethink not just what work is, but what it means to be human at work.”

If generative AI fulfills its promises, the worldwide job market will be drastically transformed, according to a Goldman Sachs report regarding the rise of AI. The investment firm projects that 300 million jobs may be eliminated or reduced due to this rapidly advancing technology.

Goldman argues that automation fosters innovation, resulting in the emergence of new job categories. AI will bring about cost reductions for businesses, allowing them to allocate their resources towards developing and expanding operations, which could boost global GDP by 7% annually.

Goldman Sachs forecasts that the advancement of AI will reflect the path taken by previous computer and technology innovations. Much like the transition from large mainframe computers to contemporary tech. AI can successfully pass the bar exam for lawyers, excel on the SATs, and create original art pieces.

Administrative assistance in offices, legal services, architecture and engineering, business and financial operations, management, sales, healthcare, and art and design are among the fields that face significant transformation due to AI automation.

According to a scholarly study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, automation technology has been the main factor contributing to income inequality in the United States over the last four decades. The study asserts that 50% to 70% of the fluctuations in U.S. wages since 1980 are linked to wage drops experienced by blue-collar employees who have been replaced or negatively impacted by automation.

Advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, and other complex technologies have created a significant wealth and income disparity. This problem is set to intensify. Similarly, AI is causing significant changes to the coding workforce after years of hoopla and fear about how many jobs it will eliminate or replace. One of the first applications of generative AI was AI coding tools, which help write more code more quickly by automating large parts of the code development process.

“2025 is going to be a very fascinating year with some of these tools, as we start to scale,” said KeyBank Chief Information Officer Amy Brady. “We’re not far enough on the journey where I can confidently say it’s going to replace all entry-level code generation. Do I think it could replace some? Yes.”

Organizations are buzzing with discussions about artificial intelligence and the applications of generative AI, and numerous companies are progressing with their implementations. However, there is a risk of employee burnout from hastily adopting AI, and businesses must take precautions against this even as they eagerly embrace these technologies.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds in Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) is a software company that leverages AI to develop solutions that automate repetitive tasks. Its platform helps businesses transform how they operate by combining AI, automation, and robots. On March 3, the leading enterprise automation and AI software company confirmed a new global consulting agreement with a major Electronic Medical Record platform.

The agreement is proposed to expand the company’s professional services capabilities for healthcare organizations. UiPath Inc.’s (NYSE:PATH) focus on agentic automation capabilities places it at the nexus of advanced AI and healthcare administration, which is strategically aligned with the direction of enterprise technology. The company is also positioned to benefit from the $20 billion EMR market anticipated in 2025 by expanding its professional services capabilities to 16 new nations, including Australia, France, Germany, and Singapore.

“With professional services from UiPath and its qualified partners, healthcare organizations have significantly greater access and resources to drive down costs and automate more end-to-end processes with the ultimate goal of better care and more fulfilling work for healthcare professionals,” said Jason Warrelmann, Vice President of Industry Practice at UiPath.

Overall, PATH ranks 5th on our list of trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of PATH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PATH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In February, a coalition of healthcare organizations sent a letter to President Donald J. Trump and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (the Letter), urging the immediate rescission of a proposed update to the Security Rule under HIPAA. The update is aimed at strengthening safeguards for securing electronic protected health information.

According to The HIPAA Journal, the data breach trend in the healthcare industry over the past 14 years is up, not down. This is the case despite the HIPAA Security Rule having been in effect since 2005.

The HIPAA Journal goes on to provide some sobering statistics:

Between October 21, 2009, when OCR first started publishing summaries of data breach reports on its “Wall of Shame”, and and December 31, 2023, 5,887 large healthcare data breaches have been reported. On January 22, 2023, the breach portal listed 857 data breaches as still; under investigation. This time last year there were 882 breaches listed as under investigation, which shows OCR has made little progress in clearing its backlog of investigations – something that is unlikely to change given the chronic lack of funding for the department.

There have been notable changes over the years in the main causes of breaches. The loss/theft of healthcare records and electronic protected health information dominated the breach reports between 2009 and 2015. The move to digital record keeping, more accurate tracking of electronic devices, and more widespread adoption of data encryption have been key in reducing these data breaches. There has also been a downward trend in improper disposal incidents and unauthorized access/disclosure incidents, but data breaches continue to increase due to a massive increase in hacking incidents and ransomware attacks. In 2023, OCR reported a 239% increase in hacking-related data breaches between January 1, 2018, and September 30, 2023, and a 278% increase in ransomware attacks over the same period. In 2019, hacking accounted for 49% of all reported breaches. In 2023, 79.7% of data breaches were due to hacking incidents.

The letter, signed by numerous healthcare organizations, outlines several key concerns regarding the proposed HIPAA Security Rule update, including:

No doubt, the Trump Administration is intent on reducing regulation on business. However, it will be interesting to see whether it softens or even eliminates the proposed rule in response to the Letter, despite the clear trend of more numerous and damaging data breaches in the healthcare sector, and an increasing threat landscape facing all U.S. businesses.

A health care focused high school set to open in 2026 in Demopolis has hired a veteran educator for its top leadership role.

James ""Jimmy"" Martin, superintendent of Pell City schools in St. Clair County, will serve as president of the Alabama School of Healthcare Sciences.

Martin's appointment was approved Feb. 28 during a meeting of the Alabama School of Healthcare Sciences board of trustees.

Martin said he is anticipating the opportunity to make a difference and change lives as president at ASHS. The goal of the school is to solve Alabama's health care staffing shortage by training high school students for careers in the medical field.

“Every person who goes into education wants to make a difference for young people and in their communities,” Martin said in a news release. “The potential for this school to change lives in so many ways is what attracted me to it.”

According to the release, Martin said he views the Alabama School of Healthcare Sciences as a source of hope for youth and that the school has the real ability to make an impact by improving rural health care throughout the state.

Martin also said he welcomes the opportunity to build a school from the ground up and understands the immense work ahead before the first students are welcomed next year.

Mike Warren, president of the ASHS board of trustees, said he is confident that Martin will lead ASHS to success.

“We are delighted to find someone who not only understands the complexity of ASHS, but who is so willing to commit to its development and to attracting the students, faculty and staff who will fulfill its mission from the outset,” Warren said.

Martin has led Pell City Schools for six years. He also served as superintendent of the Harris County and Chattahoochee County school districts in Georgia for 10 years and led those districts to receiving honors for academic achievement. In 2017, he received the Georgia School Superintendents Association President’s Award.

His resume also includes stints as a school improvement specialist, a principal, a teacher and a band director.

Martin earned his bachelor’s degree in music education and a doctorate in educational leadership from Auburn University. He also earned a master of science degree in educational administration from Troy State University.

He was part of the Alabama State Department of Education Superintendents Academy through the University of Alabama from 2003-04.

The Alabama School of Healthcare Science is scheduled to welcome its first freshman class of up to 100 to 110 students in rural Demopolis in the fall of 2026. The school's $80 million campus will include a five-story dormitory, according to a December 2024 story by the Alabama Reflector.

The school will partner with Whitfield Regional Hospital, a member of the UAB Health System, in Demopolis.

The school will be one of 10 health care-focused high schools nationwide funded partially through the Bloomberg Philanthropies and affiliated with established healthcare systems.

Martin said the school will provide an experience students can't get anywhere else in Alabama.

""When you can make education relevant, students will buy in,” he said. “We will be offering something far beyond a traditional high school, and that kind of engagement and the experiences at our school will be what attract and retain students.

""The pathways and curriculum that are being developed right now are what will inspire students and their families to commit, and what will ultimately get the health care pipeline flowing into rural communities in a way that will transform the quality of life,"" Martin said.

ASHS will become the fourth in a network of tuition-free, residential specialty high schools in the Alabama public school system, the release states.

Other schools in that network are:

As artificial intelligence becomes widely used in health care, researchers studying the technology warn that it’s a tool that requires constant monitoring and revision.

“You always need a human in the loop, particularly in health care,” Fay Cobb Payton, a NC State University professor emeritus, said last week.

Cobb Payton, whose area of expertise is  information technology and business analytics, was one of two keynote speakers at the 46th annual Minority Health Conference last week at the Friday Conference Center at UNC Chapel Hill.

Even as artificial intelligence has the potential to transform health care into something more efficient and deliver the “personalized” health care long promised by technology, conference organizers noted flaws. “While technological innovations hold great promise for improving access to care, they often risk amplifying inequities when not designed with marginalized communities in mind,” the conference literature states.  

That was the reality displayed by Cobb Payton, who argued that if no one ensures that collection and use of data is done with an eye toward equity, outcomes can be skewed in ways that harm patients. 

“In health care, you’re not selling widgets, you’re not selling books, you’re not buying a piece of clothing,” she said. “You still need discernment.”



Her message was a poignant one to the capacity crowd, given recent moves by President Donald Trump’s new administration to erase programs focused on diversity, equity and inclusion from programs funded by federal dollars. The administration is pressuring business leaders to follow suit, and several bills have been introduced in the state Senate and state House to curtail such programs in public schools and state agencies.

That reality loomed over the conference, which has taken place almost every year since it was started in 1977 by the Minority Student Caucus at UNC. According to conference organizers, a student-run group like the Minority Student Caucus falls outside of the new constraints on the university policies that had addressed diversity, equity and inclusion. 

The conference was packed to capacity, with more than 600 people at the Friday Center and another 200 tuning in virtually. The topics and exhibitions were wide-ranging — from helping underserved populations understand how to access reliable health resources online to using telehealth to better serve a transgender population that has been the subject of care-limiting executive orders from the Trump administration.

The topic of artificial intelligence spurred robust discussion.

Artificial intelligence has the potential to cut some treatment costs in half because of its ability to home in on a diagnosis more quickly and earlier in the disease process, Cobb Payton said, citing research out of Harvard University. She said researchers also believe early intervention can help lead to 40 percent better health outcomes. 



Cobb Payton noted that AI innovation in health care could be a $200 billion market by 2030, offering providers strong incentives to adopt these new technological tools — and creators incentives to develop them. 

But they need to be adopted carefully to avoid potential bias. 

“Largely tech developers don’t have public health experts and clinical experts in the room,” she said. “There needs to be some transparency when it comes to how the technology is being developed, even when it’s developed.”

Cobb Payton shared examples of tools that were developed without the input of people of color that wound up having “algorithmic bias” that skewed results. 

One such example was an algorithm developed to assign patients to a care management program run by an insurance company for 100 million patients. The idea was to find patients who had chronic conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes and give them extra resources to help them be healthier.

 In a seminal paper published in 2019 in Science, a top-tier academic journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, researchers studying the effectiveness of the tool noted that the algorithm used cost as a predictive variable, not the patients’ actual diagnoses. 

The researchers showed that relying on that information skewed the needs assessment because Black patients who have the same needs as their white peers often spend less in the health care system because of wealth disparities and facing more barriers to accessing care.

“The algorithm falsely concluded that Black patients were healthier to equally sick white patients,” Cobb Payton said.

In reality the Black patients had more illnesses and were actually more at risk of poor health outcomes without intervention. If cost had been taken out of the equation, or if race had been added to the algorithm, the study showed, the percentage of Black patients automatically  assigned to the care management program would have risen from 17.7 percent to 47 percent. 

When Cobb Payton talked about this finding, the crowd took a collective gasp. 

“Here, the risk scores have become very critical because Black patients are considered sicker than white patients given the same risk score but receive fewer resource allocations,” she said. 

Cobb Payton gave several other examples of how algorithmic bias had led to lower priority for Black kidney transplant candidates and more caesarean deliveries for Black mothers. “The technology is running wild while the health policy is still trying to figure it out,” she added.

Justin Wang, a UNC Chapel Hill senior majoring in public health and one of the two students who organized the event, noted the “booming” interest in artificial intelligence over the past year. “It’s important that we’re conscious of all these biases that are built into machine learning, AI algorithms that we deal with every single day,” he said.

Wang comes at the issues cropping up with the advancement of artificial intelligence with the perspective of a student in public health with a concentration in biostatistics. 

“I kind of have been thinking a lot about how statistics can tie into minority health and how statistics can exacerbate the health disparities, but also how it can improve them,” Wang said. “And so that’s kind of where I started in thinking about all these things.”

Those thoughts led to further discussion with Mercy Adekola, who helped organize the conference — and thus the 2025 theme was born. “Minority health has always been something that I’ve been interested in, just my experiences within clinics and seeing how minorities might be treated differently just because of their background — or not even treated differently, but their experiences are different,” Wang said.

The two partnered with more than 30 other students to come up with a program for the conference, which has always been student-led.

Most of those attendees were members of minority student groups, and Wang and Adekola said that current events were on many people’s minds. 

“Many people have fought to get here, to be able to use words like diversity, equity, inclusion, racism, bias, prejudice — and it all came from things like slavery, civil rights,” said Adekola, who was born in Nigeria but grew up in Connecticut. 

Wang, whose grandparents emigrated from Taiwan, added: “There’s a lot of discouraging things going on in the world right now. But the important thing, I think, that I try to keep in mind, and I think this conference really tries to emphasize, is you can really only do what you can do. Regardless of what else is going on outside… there are always things that you can do in your own space, with the community around you, that you can help or improve the lives of.”

Despite the many hours the students spent developing the conference program, and the current political environment in which the president and others are trying to strip DEI programs of their funding and mission, Adekola said she felt rejuvenated after the conference.

“We are the future, you know? And I feel like tomorrow is now,” she said. “I feel like, as students, that sense of urgency is there to craft innovative solutions that help our tomorrow, because tomorrow is today, you know, and we are the tomorrow.

“We have to start being inspired to innovate solutions.”

Researchers tested an advanced method of generative artificial intelligence (AI), trained with data from patient records corresponding to 480.000 entries to the Bordeaux University Hospital Emergency Department. Its findings, presented at the Machine Learning for Health symposium in Vancouver, and published in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, show that the AI tested is likely to reproduce and measure caregiver biases relating to patient gender during triage. These results form a case study of how new generative AI algorithms can be used to identify and understand human cognitive biases. 

In emergency care settings that demand rapid decision-making, human cognitive biases, particularly “judgment” biases, can critically impact medical decisions and patient prognosis. These “cognitive shortcuts” occur when people are required to form opinions or make decisions based on incomplete or over-generalized information. Decision-making can therefore be unconsciously affected by these biases (related, for example, to sex/gender, age, ethnicity, etc.), and lead to under or overestimating the severity of a patient’s condition. 

So how can we better identify these biases and reduce their impact? One answer could be found in AI and particularly generative AI known as “large language models” (LLMs), which are capable of imitating human decision-making thanks to their mastery of human language (such as ChatGPT). These models are in fact capable of effectively understanding the “free-text” that accounts for a large proportion of the clinical data collected by healthcare staff, particularly in hospital emergency departments. 

This research shows how large language models can help detect and anticipate human cognitive biases – in this case regarding the goal of fairer and more effective management of medical emergencies

A team led by Inserm Research Director Emmanuel Lagarde at the Bordeaux Population Health Research Center (Inserm/University of Bordeaux), was interested in the potential of these LLMs to detect and quantify gender bias in a rapid decision-making setting. The context used to evaluate this method was the triage of patients in emergency departments. Accurate triage is critical: underestimating an emergency in which treatment is then delayed could worsen prognosis. However, overestimating the severity of a patient’s condition could lead to the overuse of resources, which can be particularly harmful if many other patients are also requiring attention. 

The scientists used an innovative approach in which AI was trained to triage patients based on the texts contained in their medical record, thereby reproducing any cognitive biases of the nursing staff having performed this triage. The data used for this training comprised over 480.000 entries to the Emergency Department of Bordeaux University Hospital between January 2013 and December 2021. 

Anyone who has exchanged a few lines of dialogue with a large language model (LLM), will probably agree that generative AI is an impressive new breed of technology. LLMs show great potential in addressing some of the most urgent challenges in healthcare. At the Medica tradefair, several expert sessions were dedicated to generative AI, its potential medical applications and current caveats.

Once trained, the model was capable of assigning a triage score (evaluating the severity of the patient’s condition) based on reading a record, as the nurse would do. The record was then altered in order to change patient gender references in the clinical texts, and a new score was assigned by the model. It was the difference between these two scores, one produced from the original record and the other from the altered record, which made it possible to estimate the cognitive bias. 

The results showed the AI to be significantly biased against women. Based on identical clinical records, the severity of their conditions tended to be underestimated compared to those of men (with around 5% classified as “less critical” and 1.81% classified as “more critical”). Conversely, the severity of the men’s conditions tended to be slightly overestimated (with 3.7% deemed “more critical” versus 2.9% deemed “less critical”). This bias increased in line with the level of inexperience of the nursing staff. 

“This research shows how large language models can help detect and anticipate human cognitive biases – in this case regarding the goal of fairer and more effective management of medical emergencies,” explains Lagarde. “The method used shows that, in this context, LLMs are able to identify and reproduce the biases that guide human decision-making from the clinical data collected by nursing staff,” adds Ariel Guerra-Adames, doctoral student and first author of this research. 

The team will now go on to study the evaluation of biases related to other patient characteristics (age, ethnic group). Ultimately, it should also be possible to refine the system with the introduction of non-verbal variables (facial expressions, tone of voice) which, while not necessarily appearing in the written data, could nevertheless be critical in decision-making.

—

Healthcare workers in Alabama are calling for legislative action to address the growing issue of workplace violence in hospitals and medical facilities.

According to the Alabama State Nurses Association (ASNA), one in four nurses will experience workplace violence each year. ASNA President Abby Horton emphasized that the problem has escalated in recent years.

“Violence against nurses and other healthcare workers has become an increasing problem,” Horton said.

National Nurses United reports that 80% of healthcare workers have faced some form of assault from patients in the past year. Casey Martin, a patient care technician in an intensive care unit, has experienced this firsthand.

“A patient suddenly became confused, kicked me multiple times, pulled a nurse’s hair, and punched another nurse,” Martin recalled.

Since the pandemic, hospitals have responded by implementing de-escalation training for staff. However, Martin believes this alone is not enough.

“It feels pointless sometimes,” he said. “At the end of the day, I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I also have to protect myself.”

Alabama law currently requires proof of intentional harm to convict someone of felony assault against a healthcare worker. Horton and other advocates argue that updating the law could provide stronger protections for medical staff.

“I think it’s important to have conversations about legislative changes,” Horton said. “Any support we can get is helpful.”

Martin, who has written multiple letters to state lawmakers, believes collective action is key to making a difference.

“It’s about standing up and saying, ‘This isn’t okay, and something needs to change,’” he said.

Healthcare workers across the state continue to push for stronger protection, hoping lawmakers will take action to address the rising violence in medical settings.

In response, Congressman Robert Aderholt issued the following statement calling violence against healthcare workers “absolutely unacceptable.”

“These men and women dedicate their lives to caring for others, and they deserve to do their jobs without fear for their safety,” Aderholt said.

“I firmly believe that anyone who commits violence against a healthcare worker should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Protecting those who care for us in healthcare settings is just common sense.”

“While current law needs to be fully enforced, I would also be inclined to support legislation that strengthens laws safeguarding healthcare workers from violence, ensuring they have the protection they need while serving our communities.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Tenet Healthcare Corporation (THC) is a Trending Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-tenet-healthcare-140012490.html,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 14:00:12 GMT","

Tenet Healthcare (THC) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Over the past month, shares of this hospital operator have returned -13.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry, which Tenet falls in, has lost 7.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Tenet is expected to post earnings of $3.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.06 points to a change of +1.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +7.2%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.40 indicates a change of +11.2% from what Tenet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Tenet.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of Tenet, the consensus sales estimate of $5.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -3.5%. The $20.84 billion and $21.89 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.9% and +5%, respectively.

Tenet reported revenues of $5.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.7%. EPS of $3.44 for the same period compares with $2.68 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.75%. The EPS surprise was +17.41%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Tenet is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tenet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Foundation announces $2 million in new Health Zones funding to support at-risk populations

WOONSOCKET, R.I., March 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The CVS Health® Foundation today announced $2 million in new Health Zones funding to support the Hispanic Health Council's Family Wellness Center and its agency partners, all located in Hartford, Connecticut. This funding will help address critical gaps in the health care and social system for individuals with chronic health conditions by increasing access to comprehensive health care services and resources.







""A variety of interconnected factors influences a person's health,"" said Sheryl Burke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility and Chief Sustainability Officer at CVS Health. ""To effectively address these specific barriers to improve health outcomes, we are collaborating with local organizations who know the community the best, like the Hispanic Health Council. This new funding in a city our Aetna corporate offices call home, illustrates the power of collaboration and the positive impact we can achieve when we work together to improve community health.""  

More than two million Connecticut residents, which accounts for over half of the population, live with one or more chronic health conditions. In response, the CVS Health Foundation tailored its Health Zones initiative to support the Family Wellness Center and its agency partners' efforts, including Mental Health Connecticut and the Villages for Families and Children. Services are open to all in the greater Hartford community, and include preventative care, nutrition counseling, mental health support, community health education and other supportive resources. Additionally, the CVS Health Foundation grant will enable the Hispanic Health Council to hire three new patient navigators to assist at-risk individuals in navigating the complex care process.

""At the Hispanic Health Council, we are dedicated to ensuring that every individual has access to the care and resources necessary to thrive,"" said Ken Barela, CEO of the Hispanic Health Council. ""Thanks to the generous support of the CVS Health Foundation, we are able to strengthen our community network by providing dedicated patient navigators who will guide individuals through the complexities of the health care system, ensuring they receive the care they need. With CVS Health's collaboration, our network of providers can more effectively integrate care and help us make future improvements and interventions. We are proud to join forces in expanding our impact and building a healthier, more resilient Hartford community.""

In addition to announcing the new Health Zones funding, CVS Health offered free health screenings to individuals at the Family Wellness Center today through its Project Health initiative. All individuals had an on-site consultation with a health care provider and were provided a directory of local health care providers and resources. Last year, CVS Health hosted 23 Project Health events in Hartford and screened more than 450 participants, which resulted in over 1,500 screenings. The program is offered throughout the year across the country and is available in Hartford from June 3 to June 28. A full schedule of events for the remainder of the year can be found online or through its iPhone or Android app.

Supporting the Hispanic Health Council builds on CVS Health and Aetna's long history of community support in Hartford, where Aetna's corporate offices call home. Last year, The CVS Health Foundation Hometown Fund awarded $750,000 in general operating support grants to 15 organizations in the Hartford area. Hartford-based colleagues volunteered nearly 4,000 hours of community service in 2024 to local nonprofits. Aetna Community Affairs also collaborated with local nonprofit organizations to conduct dozens of company volunteer activities and provide product donations to improve the health and well-being of more than 8,000 adults and youth living in Hartford. Additionally, CVS Health supported Hartford Promise's efforts last year to increase access to scholarship opportunities for Hartford Public School students, and has invested in the preservation and renovation of over 440 affordable housing units in the city of Hartford to date.

Medicaid SDOH Pilots Led to Reduced Spending,https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/population-health-management/social-determinants-of-health/news/55272762/research-nc-medicaid-sdoh-pilots-led-to-reduced-spending,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 15:32:43 GMT","

North Carolina’s efforts to address people’s social needs with services such as food, housing, and transportation through Medicaid led to less spending over time compared to what would have been expected otherwise.

That’s the conclusion of an evaluation led by Seth A. Berkowitz, M.D., M.P.H., associate professor and section chief for research in the division of general medicine and epidemiology in the UNC School of Medicine. These findings were published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved the Healthy Opportunities Pilots (HOPs) in 2018 as part of the state’s waiver to transition to Medicaid managed care. 

The state said the regional pilot projects marked the nation’s first comprehensive program to test evidence-based, non-medical interventions designed to reduce costs and improve the health of Medicaid beneficiaries.

Encouraged by early success of the program, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) renewed a federal 1115 waiver in October 2023, which included a request to allow expansion of Healthy Opportunities services statewide. The federal government authorized up to $650 million in Medicaid funding for the Pilots over five years.

“What I think is exciting about the findings is that they support the underlying idea of the Healthy Opportunities Pilots — that by addressing health-related social needs, the Medicaid program can improve the health of its beneficiaries,” Berkowitz said in a statement. In their evaluation, Berkowitz and his study co-authors analyzed North Carolina Medicaid data from March 2021 through November 2023. They compared 13,227 HOP enrollees with 73,469 Medicaid recipients who reported having a health-related social need but were not eligible for HOP due to their county of residence.Spending for HOP participants increased initially during the first month of enrollment, which may have been related to the reasons people enrolled in HOP in the first place, but over time spending trended downward by an average of $85 per beneficiary per month. After approximately 8 months of enrollment in HOP, monthly spending was about what it would have been in the absence of HOP, with lower spending thereafter.","{'href': 'https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com', 'title': 'Healthcare Innovation'}"

Harare, Mar 6 (EFE).- At least 300 newborns and 54 mothers have died since January due to childbirth complications, a crisis fueled by severe shortages in Zimbabwe’s public hospitals, authorities said on Thursday.

Health Minister Douglas Mombeshora said that in the capital, Harare, alone, 111 neonatal deaths and 19 maternal deaths had been recorded.

The healthcare has been facing a lack of essential medical equipment, shortages of experienced professionals, and an inadequate supply of life-saving medications.

“The absence of modern medical equipment, compounded by the exodus of skilled personnel and critical drug shortages, is crippling our healthcare system and leading to avoidable deaths,” Mombeshora told EFE.

He explained that maternal deaths were also caused by surgical complications and pre-existing health conditions.

“Hypertensive disorders, including renal failure, postpartum hemorrhage, and complications from abortions, normal deliveries, and cesarean sections, were among the leading causes. Some of the deceased had underlying conditions such as HIV and diabetes,” the minister said.

For the 300 neonatal deaths, the primary cause was respiratory distress.

Zimbabwe’s healthcare system has been in declining steadily, with authorities facing mounting criticism over its neglect. The crisis has worsened as experienced doctors and nurses leave for better-paying jobs in Europe.

Last month, Zimbabwe’s government condemned US President Donald Trump’s decision to suspend funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), warning that the move could jeopardize vital health programs, particularly those supporting HIV/AIDS treatment.

Mombeshora told EFE that the US withdrawal from the WHO would likely have a severe impact on Zimbabwe’s already fragile healthcare sector, which heavily relies on international donors. EFE

Officials say Kentucky ranks in the bottom 10 states across the U-S for healthcare, and about two thirds face a massive shortage of OBGYNs. Healthcare leaders and legislators have conflicting plans to tackle the Commonwealth’s shortage. Senate Bill 132 would establish what it calls individual civil protection for healthcare workers, permitting professionals to refuse to perform procedures or treatments based on a religious or ethical belief without consequence.

While the bill’s sponsors say the measure would enable more diversity in the healthcare field amidst the state’s healthcare field, other officials say it’s not the right way.

David Conway, a minister and registered nurse, spoke about the legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Health Services. Conway said he, alongside other providers and organizations like the American Medical Association, oppose this bill because it would likely cause delays and barriers to care, especially in rural areas.

“It makes it illegal for someone to even suggest that an employee who objects to providing care be reassigned to another task. In other words, if I were the lead nurse and I knew that a nurse was opposed to this procedure, I wouldn’t have the freedom to say, ‘why don’t you take a step out and let somebody else in?’ If an employee is uncomfortable providing care, the compassionate action is to reassign them,” said Conway.

He argued in rural areas without other options, this bill would cause worse outcomes, especially for women’s health. Other healthcare providers and senators were concerned about the possibility of discrimination against patients based on their identity, race, or religion.

Proponents argued the bill would not allow practitioners to discriminate against their patients based on identity, only protecting those who refuse to perform certain procedures or prescribe medications. SB 132’s sponsors named abortion as its primary target, arguing doctors should not feel coerced or forced to perform one if it’s against their conscience.

State Senator Donald Douglas, a co-sponsor of the bill, testified to the Senate Standing Committee on Health Services early this month. He said in his career as a physician, these protections would have been pivotal.

“When I worked in pain management, the clinic I worked with insisted on writing for a lot of opioids for the patients to keep them coming through the practice,” said Douglas. “How has that worked out in the substance use disorder area, Mister Chairman? It hasn’t. So because I exercised my right of conscience to say this isn’t working, I believe I’ve saved a lot of lives.”

Other healthcare workers said it would open opportunities for discrimination and that medical professionals have an ethical obligation to serve their patients regardless of their beliefs.

The bill passed its committee reading and moves on to the full senate.","{'href': 'https://www.wmky.org', 'title': 'WMKY'}"

Bill Murray is keeping it real. 

The ""Groundhog Day"" star, 74, recently set the record straight over rumors that popped up two years ago that he was dating singer Kelis, who is nearly 30 his junior. 

""I was fascinated, I met this girl named Kelis, who — I got great press that I was dating her, which really raised my cred,"" the ""Ghostbusters"" actor joked on SiriusXM’s ""Sway in the Morning"" while talking about how much he likes hip-hop. 

""Not all of us believed that,"" co-host Sway Calloway said while Murray smiled and nodded.

""That was false humility again,"" Murray joked of mentioning Kelis. 

He said he first discovered Kelis in rapper Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s 1999 song ""Got Your Money,"" in which she was a featured singer. 

""I was fascinated, I met this girl named Kelis, who —  I got great press that I was dating her, which really raised my cred."" 

""It’s so crazy,"" he said of the music video, adding that he wondered who the ""girl with the red hair"" was, ""and it was Kelis.""

Murray said he decided he wanted to meet her, ""and she turned out to be spectacular.""

He said that he spoke with her recently and found out she had just bought land in Kenya. 

""She’s in Africa,"" he said. ""She’s not afraid of the dark. She just goes out there and goes, ‘Well, I think I’ll just go to Africa and start a farm.’""

""So you weren’t dating?"" Calloway asked. 

""No,"" Murray confirmed.

Gene Hackman's nephew doesn't want to fuel ""negative theories"" surrounding the Hollywood legend's death.

The 95-year-old actor and his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, were found dead in their Santa Fe home last week but his nephew Tim Hackman has stressed that his loved ones don't want to ""speculate"" on what caused the mysterious tragedy, which has been described as ""suspicious"" by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.

Tim told Us Weekly: ""We're waiting on toxicology. That will tell us everything. It's hard to theorize. There are lots of theories out there and I don't want to speculate. It's easy to speculate negative theories.""

He added: ""The family wants to keep it positive for now and when we know the truth we will deal with it.""

Tim revealed that the description of 'The Royal Tenenbaums' actor and his wife's mummified bodies - as well as that of their dog Zinna - have left the family with lots of unanswered questions.

He said: ""My uncle was 95 years old at an age where you think about, 'Okay, it's time'. But from the circumstances now things have changed a bit. It's a major change.""

Tim explained that the Oscar-winning star was ""like any other family member"", although he was left in awe by his uncle's successful career in the movies.

He said: ""For me personally, it's something I would find strange because I was a fan and a nephew. There were moments of, 'Wow, Gene Hackman is in front of me'.""

It has emerged that Gene's death was not likely to have been as a result of gas poisoning.

The New Mexico Gas Company confirmed via a statement from officials to DailyMail.com that ""there were no significant findings"" of gas leaks or carbon monoxide in the home.

However, the authorities did confirm that five ""red tags"" had been issued, including one ""minor leak"" from a stove with a reading of ""0.03 per cent gas in the air"".

The statement added: ""The other four red tags were for code enforcement violations - not involving gas leaks or carbon monoxide - involving a water heater and gas log lighters installed in three fireplaces.""

Investigators have suggested that it could take weeks to determine the cause of the pair's deaths.

The country star and her husband also share a 10-year-old daughter, a 9-year-old son and a 6-year-old son.

As a mom of four, Jessie James Decker is more in love with her body today than she was at 23 years old. 

In a new interview, the country singer, 36, opened up about her postpartum journey after giving birth to her son, Denver, one year ago and got candid about the mental and physical challenges she's faced along the way. 

""After I stopped nursing, I was like, ‘Wow, [the weight] is not coming off as fast as it did before. I’m going to have to really go for it this time,’"" Decker - who shares daughter Vivianne, 10, and sons Eric Jr., 9, Forrest, 6, and Denver, 1, with husband Eric Decker - told Us Weekly. ""I wanted to feel strong.""

With a combination of intermittent fasting, weightlifting and HIIT workouts, Decker said she now feels better than ever. 

""I knew what I weighed before and around that ballpark felt good to me,"" she said. ""I love where I’m at [now] because I put in the time building the muscle. I like being toned, muscular and really strong.""

""As I’ve gotten older, I like the way I look now more than I did when I was 23,"" she added. 

Though Decker admitted she does not necessarily love working out with her husband, she is grateful for his constant support.

""He thinks I’m pretty no matter what, even when I’m having a hard day or after I’ve had a baby [and] I’m not feeling like myself,"" she said of Eric. ""I look for it in his face and he never flinches. He tells me I look pretty the way that I am.""

In May 2024, Decker shared two photos of herself in an orange bikini, admitting in the caption she ""really didn’t wanna post any of these kittenish swim photos"" due to her weight gain following baby No. 4.

Dolly Parton has shared a new statement following the death of her ""beloved husband,"" Carl Dean, earlier this week.

The legendary country star — whose husband of 58 years passed away on Monday, March 3 at age 82 — took to Instagram on Thursday, March 6, to thank everybody for their love and support amid the difficult time.

""This is a love note to family, friends, and fans. Thank you for all the messages, cards, and flowers that you've sent to pay your respects for the loss of my beloved husband Carl,"" the ""9 to 5"" singer, 79, wrote in her post. ""I can't reach out personally to each of you but just know it has meant the world to me. He is in God's arms now and I am okay with that.""

She concluded the heartfelt post with a nod to one of her most famous songs.

""I will always love you,"" Parton wrote.

Fans commented on the post, expressing sympathy for the 10-time Grammy Award winner.

""The I will always love you at the end 😭 so sorry for your loss,"" one person wrote. ""The price of love is grief, and I'm sending you so many prayers mama!""

""What a beautiful message and perspective. We will always love you, Dolly. ♥️,"" another fan commented.

""Dolly - if anyone could bring everyone together, it's you❤️,"" a separate individual wrote.

A post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton)

The musician's Instagram account first announced the heartbreaking news on Monday. The post included a quote from Parton, which read, ""Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy.""

The ""Jolene"" hitmaker and Dean wed in 1966 in Georgia. The couple opted not to have children.

In 2023, Parton spoke to UK publication Saga about her decision to not become a parent.

""I haven't missed it like I thought I might. When you're a young couple, you think you're going to have kids, but it just wasn't one of those burning things for me,"" she noted. ""I had my career and my music and I was travelling.""

Dean's cause of death has not been disclosed yet.

Netflix is giving Running Point fans exactly what they asked for: another season!

After tons of buzz and viewer requests, the streamer officially announced on Thursday, March 6, that the Mindy Kaling-created dramedy has been renewed for a second season. The news dropped via a special social media video featuring the show’s leading lady, Kate Hudson.

“A good basketball team owner knows when to listen to the fans. So we hear you and so did Netflix,” Hudson says in the clip. “Running Point is officially coming back for Season 2! Thank you so much to everyone who’s watched so far—you’re the reason we get to do this again. See you next season!”

The renewal comes just a week after Running Point premiered on February 27, but let’s be real—this was pretty much inevitable. The show wasted no time climbing to the top of Netflix’s most-watched list, proving it’s already a major hit.

For those who need a quick refresher, Running Point follows Isla Gordon (Hudson), a sharp, no-nonsense L.A. executive who suddenly finds herself in charge of one of the most famous professional basketball teams in the country after her older brother spectacularly flames out in public. 

The show boasts a seriously stacked ensemble cast, including Scott MacArthur (The Mick), Drew Tarver (The Other Two), Max Greenfield (New Girl), Brenda Song (The Last Showgirl), Chet Hanks (Your Honor) and Toby Sandeman (The Royals).

As for when season two will drop? Netflix hasn’t spilled the details just yet, but since the show only premiered a week ago, you’ll likely have to wait a bit. In the meantime, all ten episodes of Running Point season one are available to stream now on Netflix.

Bhad Bhabie has issued a stern warning to Alabama Barker, the daughter of Shanna Moakler and Travis Barker, amid their ongoing feud — and just hours after the rapper's boyfriend Le Vaughn was shot.

Referring to Alabama's diff track where she references the ""Hi Bich"" artist's daughter with Le Vaughn, Bhad Bhabie, whose real name is Danielle Bregoli, took to her Instagram Stories on Thursday, March 6, to hit back.

""Who told this h** to talk about my kid? You thought that was a good idea? That wasn't 'hard' like you thought it was gonna b the whole internet on your ass now slow a** h** when I see you you better run,"" Bregoli, 21, wrote.

Bregoli's message is the latest update in the ongoing drama between her and the 19-year-old influencer. Things really soured between the two rappers when Bregoli accused Barker of trying to steal Le Vaughn from her in late 2024. In the months that followed, Bregoli and Alabama have been going back and forth releasing diss tracks about each other.

In January 2025, Bregoli released the song ""Over Cooked,"" which many believe was about Alabama. Then, it was Alabama's turn. She released ""Cry Bhabie"" in which she rapped about the rumors involving her and Le Vaughn. Bregoli was next up, releasing ""Ms. Whitman,"" in which she was accused of dragging Alabama's family into the drama, even mentioning Travis' relationship with Kourtney Kardashian — Alabama's stepmother.

Most recently, Alabama previewed her next track in which she brings Bregoli's daughter, Kali, who turns 1 this month, into the mix. This got a scathing reaction from Bhad Bhabie's mom, Barbara Bregoli, who took aim at Alabama in a series of messages on her own Instagram Stories — even going as far as to say Travis ""has a whole new family"" per TMZ, referring to the musician's marriage to Kardashian and their 1-year-old son, Rocky (""Rocky Rules,"" Barbara also wrote).

Bhad Bhabie's new warning to Alabama comes just hours after Le Vaughn, 26, was shot at a strip club in Los Angeles. According to TMZ, Le Vaughn's injuries were not life-threatening. He posted a selfie from the hospital on Wednesday, March 5, showing his bandaged hand.

Jane Fonda saved her grandson from a bear.

The 87-year-old actress was living ""out in the wild"" in New Mexico and looking after her daughter Vanessa Vadim's son Malcolm, now 25, when she found the creature looming over him in his crib so took swift action to scare the animal away.

The story emerged when Jane appeared on Netflix's podcast 'Skip Intro' with her son Troy O'Donovan Garity and the 51-year-old actor was asked to share something people didn't know about his famous mom.

Troy - whose dad is Jane's late ex-husband Tom Hayden - told host Krista Smith: “She pushed a bear out of her bedroom...

“She heard something so she left the bedroom in the middle of the night to go see what the sound was. And when she came back in, the screen door was dismantled and there was a bear in the bedroom, sniffing over the crib.”

The host then asked the 'Grace and Frankie' star how she reacted, and Jane quickly held up her hands and shouted: ""Roar!""

Troy jokingly apologised to the ""sound man"" on the podcast for his mom's loudness and the '80 For Brady' actress explained the timing was lucky.

She said: ""I had just learned what to do if you’re close to a bear.

“And that was it [a scream]. And get very big; I opened my bathrobe.”

While Jane successfully scared away the bear, the creature ""urinated on the rug"" before it left.

She added: “And then [it] walked back to the door and sat down and I did, I pushed it out, yeah.""

On consumerism

The 'Barbarella' actress recently admitted she doesn't like shopping.

She told the New York Times newspaper: ""I basically don’t go shopping.

""Occasionally I will order something online if I’m on a trip and going into forests and need quick-drying pants and shirts - that kind of thing. But I don’t like to shop. I feel uncomfortable.""

Jane previously bemoaned the rise of ""consumerism"" during an appearance on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show'.

The veteran movie star - who is also well-known for her environmental activism - admitted to feeling frustrated by the attitude of some shoppers.

She said: ""I vowed a couple of years ago I would never buy any new clothes again.

""We spend too much money, we buy too many things, and then we get rid of them. We try to develop our identity by shopping, right? We gotta stop that. Stop all this consumerism.""

During the trailer launch of the series, the media questioned Neeraj about the ongoing discussion about the guest appearance of cricketer Sourav Ganguly in Khakee: The Bengal Chapter. Although the filmmaker did not say much about this, he answered the question with a smile and said that as far as Sourav is concerned, keep watching.

Neeraj said, ""I was born and brought up in Kolkata. This is the reason why I chose Kolkata for the second phase of the Khaki series. This is my personal choice."" The series will show the story of an IPS officer

Directed by Debatma Mandal and Tushar Kanti Ray, this series is the second part of Neeraj Pandey's Khakee: The Bihar Chapter, in which a story based on Bengal will be shown and the events here will be shown. The story of the series is based on Kolkata in the early 2000s. The series will show the struggle of an IPS officer against crime, corruption and political power. The series is co-written by Neeraj Pandey, Debatma Mandal and Samrat Chakraborty.

Other Bengali actors in the series

The series has a large number of Bengali actors. Which includes Sita, like Prosenjit Chatterjee, Jeet, Parambrata Chattopadhyay and Saswata Chatterjee among others.

Big changes are coming to professional women's tennis.

The Women's Tennis Association and Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund have launched a new program to provide players with maternity and child family planning benefits, the organizations said on Thursday. Women's tennis is one of the last professional sports to provide these benefits — and players have been asking.

As part of the program, eligible players will receive up to 12 months of paid maternity leave. Players will also have access to grants to cover fertility conception and egg freezing treatments. The WTA said the new policy will benefit 320 eligible players.

""This initiative will provide the current and next generation of players the support and flexibility to explore family life, in whatever form they choose,"" Portia Archer, WTA CEO, said in a statement.

The PIF WTA maternity fund program is the first and only maternity program in women's sport to be fully funded and supported by an external partner, the WTA said. PIF declined to comment on how much it is contributing to this program, but the organizations said players will be compensated equally.

In May, the Saudi public investment fund and the WTA agreed to a multi-year partnership as Saudi Arabia looks to further its investment into sports. PIF also funds the LIV Golf league.

The partnership has drawn criticism from some current and former players due to Saudi Arabia's history of human rights abuses. The new policy could be an attempt by the PIF to show U.S. tennis fans that the Kingdom is changing.

""PIF partnerships are designed to elevate every level of sport and leave a legacy of transformative impact on a global scale,"" said Alanoud Althonayan, head of events and sponsorships at PIF, in a statement.

While the changes signal a positive step for women's tennis, the sport is following in the footsteps of other professional women's sports as maternity benefits have emerged as a key issue for players in recent years.

""Thinking back about my experience in 2008 when I had my daughter, there was no support,"" said Kim Clijsters, former WTA No. 1 player and a PIF Ambassador, in a statement. ""I think this is going to be a career changing opportunity for a lot of players.""

The WNBA's latest collective bargaining agreement with players guarantees women full pay during maternity leave. FIFA and the National Women's Soccer League also recently expanded their maternity benefits.

Thursday's announcement has been a long time coming for former top ranked star Victoria Azarenka. She has been advocating for maternity pay in tennis since giving birth to her son in 2016. Azarenka sits on the players' council advocating for increased benefits.

""This marks the beginning of a meaningful shift in how we support women in tennis, making it easier for athletes to pursue both their careers and their aspirations of starting a family,"" Azarenka said in a statement. ""Ensuring that programs like this exist has been a personal mission of mine, and I'm excited to see the lasting impact it will have for generations to come.""

            Two-time grand slam champion Victoria Azarenka has told CNN Sport that a landmark maternity fund created for professional women’s tennis players is a game-changing moment for the sport.
    


            The first-of-its-kind initiative provides eligible WTA players with the financial support and comprehensive resources to start or expand their families, according to the tennis body.
    


            Fully funded by the Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), players will receive paid maternity and parental support for the first time, as well as grants for egg and embryo freezing and IVF treatment.
    


            “It’s a very global conversation, much bigger than just sport,” says Azarenka, a WTA players’ council representative who has been at the forefront of the discussion.
    


            “It’s such an important topic in all walks of life, people have families, and I think that it’s a very important conversation to continue to bring to the table.”
    


            The initiative has personal meaning for the former world No. 1.
    


            Having lifted back-to-back Australian Open titles in 2012 and 2013, Azarenka gave birth to son Leo in December 2016 but says there was no maternity leave policy in place at the time. That led her to question her career in the game – and she wasn’t the only one.
    


Serena Williams also experienced the limitations of the system for returning mothers following the birth of her daughter, Olympia, in September 2017.
    


            “When I became pregnant with my son, it was a conversation about: am I going to be coming back to the tour or not?” Azarenka recalls. “I had doubts right away. I was also scared … I was top five in the world at the time.
    


            “It was an interesting way for me to find out that we didn’t really have any rules even in our organization to address maternity leave.”
    


            It wasn’t until 2019 that the WTA gave increased protection for returning mothers on the tour, specifically with a change in the protective ranking system.
    


            The rule change has allowed returning players to compete in a certain number of tournaments based on the ranking they held before going on maternity leave for a period of up to three years.
    


            According to the WTA, 50 players have already benefited since its introduction.
    


            “I feel like me and Serena broke the stereotype that in tennis it’s going to be possible and that’s what we’re so proud to do,” Azarenka explains.
    


            “I wanted to make sure that all of our other athletes feel the same way as well as that. Not everybody has the financial opportunity to stop playing and not have any income so that was a very big project of mine.
    


            “I really believe that helping other people, helping our sport grow is something that gives me a lot of pleasure, a lot of pride, probably more than my own winnings (and) I do believe this is a very life-changing program.”
    


            The launch of the fund is the latest significant move following the multi-year partnership signed by the WTA with PIF in May 2024.
    


            This was part of Saudi Arabia’s wider plan to invest in tennis, which has been the subject of criticism from some of the sport’s leading figures. Legendary players Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, for instance, have described hosting the WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia as a “step backward,” expressing concerns about the kingdom’s record on women’s rights, human rights and LGBTQ rights.
    


            Despite such criticism, Azarenka is confident that the intentions behind the initiative are the right ones.
    


            “I’ve personally not been there, so I cannot judge without seeing with my own eyes,” the 35-year-old says. “I am very appreciative that they saw the vision (and) I think it’s a big testament that … they were the ones who really wanted to support that and want to continue to grow that.”

            And it’s not just existing moms on tour that she believes could stand to benefit from the fund: A whole new generation of players will be empowered to not have to choose between peak performance and future family planning.
    


            “We have full (and) non-full members covered, which is very unprecedented in sports,” she says.
    


            “A lot of players (will) see these opportunities like, ‘Hey, maybe we actually can prolong our careers, and we can have families,’ and it’s almost like a two-phase way you can look at your career: before family and then you have family and you continue your career.”
    


            Azarenka sees the fund as “just the beginning” for what she hopes will open up even more benefits, opportunities and conversations in other areas of the women’s game, including childcare and healthcare services.
    


            “It’s important to create just a little bit of an ecosystem that is part of the healthcare, part of financial support, part of childcare services, so how we can navigate that we need,” she says.
    


            “(We also need) people who are willing to look for outside of the boxes for the opportunities and to create those programs.”
    


            Indeed, a growing number of returning champion moms are creating that very path for the new generation to follow suit.
    


            Former Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki and two-time grand slam winner Naomi Osaka have returned to the fold alongside Azarenka, while Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina and Switzerland’s Belinda Bencic have recorded notable wins as mothers on the WTA Tour.
    


            And while Belgium’s Kim Clijsters remains the only player to have won a grand slam singles title as a mother – the 2011 Australian Open – Azarenka hopes it’s not too long before that changes.
    


            Serena Williams notably reached four grand slams singles finals but on each occasion narrowly missed out on capturing a record-equaling 24th major, while Azarenka herself reached the US Open final in 2020.
    


            “I’m extremely happy for all the young moms, new moms when they come out and succeed and just go out there and do their thing and represent our sport on such a global stage,” Azarenka says, smiling.
    


            “There’s probably going to be more grand slam champions that are moms and I think that is amazing. I hope, of course, it’s going be me as a competitor. We had Serena be also very close to that. I was very close to that achievement.
    


            “We’re still competitors, we want to make that happen, (and) I think it’s going be an incredible opportunity to see that happen.”

The Women’s Tennis Association has become the first international sports body to introduce up to 12 months of paid maternity leave for players, in what it has hailed as a defining moment for women’s sport.

Under the new policy, funded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, players will also get access to grants for fertility treatments, including egg freezing and IVF.

The WTA said that at least 320 of the world’s top players would be entitled to access the fund, which also includes two months of paid leave to anyone who becomes a parent via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption.

The two-times grand slam winner Victoria Azarenka, who is a representative on the WTA players’ council, told the Guardian that the response from her colleagues to the new WTA PIF Maternity Fund programme had been “incredible”.

“The players are extremely excited and some were really surprised that we are creating this,” she said. “The feedback from players has actually been incredible. And it is incredibly motivating that we can make the difference. It’s also important to point out this was a player-led programme and we really pushed very hard to make it happen.”

The 35-year-old – who has a son, Leo, born in 2016 – said it had been a long battle to set up a programme that she hoped would be a model for other sports, as well as sparking global conversations.

“I absolutely believed this day would come,” she added. “It took a lot of work, even if I thought in the beginning it wouldn’t take this long. I was getting quite impatient, so I am very proud that we are here. I strongly feel this is just the beginning.

“This type of programme will also open global conversations about how important family planning, maternity leave, parental leave is. Because one way or another, almost everyone gets to experience this, if they wish to.”

To receive assistance, players will need to have competed in a minimum of eight WTA tournaments, including grand slams, in the previous 12 months, at least four of which must be at WTA 250 level or above.

Players who have played a minimum of 24 WTA tournaments on the WTA Tour over the previous 36 months, at least 12 of which must be at WTA 250 level or above, will also be entitled to help.

The same amount will be paid to each player regardless of ranking, with the exact sum dependent on whether they fit the first or second criteria.

It is still relatively rare for active players on the WTA tour to have children, although there are several currently in the world’s top 100, including Azarenka, Naomi Osaka, Elina Svitolina, Caroline Wozniacki, Belinda Bencic and Taylor Townsend.

The WTA chief executive, Portia Archer, said the programme would give more players the flexibility to choose when they wanted to start their family life.

“They can do so at a time of their choosing now, and they have some agency, because they have the financial resources, benefits, flexibility and the support to be able to make that decision,” she said. “It is important for players across the ranking profile, but we do think that it will have great impact and be quite transformational for players who are not earning at the highest levels in the sport.”

Archer also said it was another example of the WTA, which was founded by Billie Jean King in 1973, leading the way when it comes to women’s sport.

“This is really is a groundbreaking initiative that hasn’t been made available in women’s sports for players and athletes who are self-employed – so-called independent contractors,” she said. “And this comprehensive set of benefits for paid maternity leave, paid parental leave, grants for fertility preservation also has never been made available.”

“So we’re excited at the WTA to launch this. We have been in the business of trailblazing and being the first many times. And we’re excited to be in this position again.”

Archer also denied suggestions that partnering with the investment arm of the Saudi government could send mixed messages, given that human rights groups such as Amnesty International report that women continue to face discrimination in law and in practice.

“From the very beginning, PIF has been very supportive of our ambition to create this comprehensive programme,” she said. “They’ve been very eager to partner and collaborate with us. They are funding the programme, which is a high priority for our players. And I think it will be a great opportunity for the WTA to leverage the power of sport to provide empowerment and to progress women.”

Alanoud Althonayan, head of events and sponsorships at PIF, echoed Archer’s sentiments. “PIF partnerships are designed to elevate every level of sport and leave a legacy of transformative impact on a global scale,” she said. “Our partnership with WTA is built on a shared ambition, aligned with PIF’s vision, purpose and values.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Greg Garber


INDIAN WELLS -- After the US Open, the BNP Paribas Open is probably the most sought-after American tennis title for Americans.

You might think a homegrown woman would have found a way to win here in the desert sometime over the past couple of decades. If so, you’d think wrong. It’s been 24 years since Serena Williams wrested the title from Kim Clijsters in a three-set final.

Before this year’s tournament, Madison Keys seemed to sense a change in the wind.

“I think it’s probably been a little while since there has been so many American women doing as well as they are,” Keys said. “I think not only are there the names that everyone obviously knows and are a little bit more established, but there’s also a ton of up-and-comers that are doing really, really well.

“I would not be surprised if you saw some really great results from the U.S. women.”

Keys, of course, won the season’s first Grand Slam singles title in Melbourne -- and, at the age of nearly 30, the first of her career. That moved Keys into the Top 5 in the PIF WTA Rankings, joining compatriots Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula in that rare air. It’s the first time three Americans have been ranked among the Top 5 since 2003, when Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Jennifer Capriati were dominating.

“I think it’s just a really great group of women that I’ve grown up with that have continued to encourage and push and support each other,” Keys said. “When we see each other do well, we’re not only extremely excited for them, but with the support and kind of we’re all being cheerleaders with each other. I think it just helps push all of us to continue to have some really good success.”

It goes well beyond the very top, too. Amanda Anisimova won her first WTA Tour 1000 title in Dubai, vaulting into the Top 20 and just last week Pegula was the winner in Austin and Emma Navarro was crowned in Merida, Mexico. Including the United Cup -- where Gauff went 5-0 and led US to the team victory -- U.S. players have won seven of 14 titles contested so far.

Gauff’s eyes widened visibly when she heard that last statistic. She believes it’s been a collective, collaborative effort -- that extends to the men’s side, too. Taylor Fritz, Tommy Paul and Ben Shelton are all inside the Top 15, and there are eight American men among the Top 50.

“We’re all pushing each other to do better,” Gauff told reporters. “Now the men have strong depth, and I think that it just inspires us to do more. You see one win a tournament and you also want to do that.”

Fritz, the No. 4-ranked player on the ATP Tour, went even further.

“I think it’s great that we are kind of building the tennis, we can help build the tennis culture in the U.S.,” he said. “I think that’s something that I wanted to contribute to help my whole career. I think the women have been doing an incredible job of that for a long, long time, and I think the guys kind of need to step it up a little bit.”

Sparking the belief

These days, Pam Shriver is an astute broadcaster for ESPN’s Grand Slam coverage, a mother of three and, here at Indian Wells, the coach of No. 20-ranked Donna Vekic. She’s also one of most decorated U.S. players in history, winning 133 singles and doubles titles combined on the WTA Tour.

“I think it’s unusual that we’ve had a numbers gap on the women’s side,” Shriver said, standing by the players’ soccer pitch. “We always had great names at the top -- Venus and Serena. But this feels more conjoined, more momentum grabbing.”

Shriver pointed to three events that, in her mind, led to this American resurgence that, in her words, “sparked the belief.” The first came at the 2017 US Open, when a 16-year-old Anisimova was a 6-0, 6-2 winner in the junior final over 13-year-old Gauff, the youngest girls’ singles finalist in tournament history.

“Whenever you have two juniors reach the finals of a Grand Slam,” Shriver said, “that’s a big deal.”

Six years later, Gauff was the 2023 US Open champion, defeating Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set final. That was a signal, Shriver said, to her fellow Americans -- even those younger than her -- of what was possible.

“I don’t consider myself a mentor or anything,” the 20-year-old Gauff said. “I’m just me. I’m just out here vibing, trying to do my best. But it is cool.”

The third was Pegula’s run to the final of last year’s US Open. She had turned 30 in February and her Grand Slam resume showed six quarterfinals reached since 2021 -- but never further. This time, she surprised Iga Swiatek in the quarters and Karolina Muchova in the semifinals before losing in the final to Sabalenka.

“Everyone can relate to getting stuck -- in the rankings, at a certain level of big tournaments,” Shriver said. “That was a really good thing for the Americans to see Pegula break through at her home Slam. Another example of the power of perseverance.

“It shows in the diversity of this group.”

Not out of their depth

Indeed, beyond the quality of play among the American women, there is an undeniable quantity as well. Six are ranked among the Top 20 and 17 in the Top 100, four more than the next-best nation.

While Gauff, Pegula and Keys are the marquee names, there are a lot of different moving, grooving parts not far behind. 

No. 8-ranked Navarro hurtled into the Top 10 only three years after winning the NCAA Division 1 singles title as a freshman at the University of Virginia. No. 14 Danielle Collins had the season of her career in 2024 -- at the age of 30. No. 41 Ashlyn Krueger is only 20 but has been playing professionally for nearly five years.





 Jimmie48/WTA
                        

Taylor Townsend is a Top 100 singles player -- and a mother -- but the 28-year-old, along with Katerina Siniakova, is also part of the World No. 1 doubles team. They won Wimbledon last year and have already taken titles at the Australian Open and in Dubai.

Another testament to America’s depth is the fact that No. 228 Whitney Osuigwe won both her qualifying matches. It’s her first WTA main draw in nearly four years -- she nearly made the Top 100 as a teenager but she’s still only 22.

So … why now?

“That’s a great question,” Pegula said on Wednesday. “I don’t really know exactly why now, but I just think that our depth is pretty incredible. I think we’re just seeing more Americans maybe in the Top 10, obviously Top 20, for sure. 

“Having Coco and Maddie win Slams over the last couple of years as Americans is huge for women’s tennis or for women’s tennis in America. I don’t know if maybe that’s kind of inspiring to maybe some of the lower-ranked Americans to do really well or the younger generation.”

Gauff, for one, is ready to end America’s 0-for streak at Indian Wells.

“I don’t remember the last time an American woman has won this tournament,” Gauff said in her press conference.

Serena Williams in 2001, she was told.

“OK, so before I was born,” Gauff acknowledged. “Every year they love to remind us of that stat when we compete. We’re all like, ‘Who’s it going to be?’ I was in the semis last year, so I was hoping it would be me. Hopefully this year we can, and if it’s not me I hopefully it's an American.”

A win by an American here at the BNP Paribas Open, Pegula believes, could help grow the game in a nation whose population exceeds 325 million.

“To get an American to win it I think would only grow that exposure of tennis in the U.S. which would be really, really cool,” Pegula said. “Even for me, if I didn’t watch that much, I’d want to go watch someone that's from the same country, and that's an American.

“I think that goes a long way, especially in a country where we have so many other dominant sports. The fact that we have that depth I think is going to help tennis fans in the U.S. a lot to kind of get behind the sport and find their American to root for, because there is definitely a lot of us.”

Jessica Pegula has been part of a strong start to the 2025 season for American players on the WTA Tour.

Pegula won the ATX Open title last week, after beating compatriot McCartney Kessler in the final.

This was a monumental moment for women’s tennis, with Pegula and Kessler making history after achieving something that had not been done in nearly eight years.

Pegula was not the only American to win a title last week, with Emma Navarro making history of her own in Merida after a dominant run to her second WTA trophy.

This continues on from a very positive start to the season for American women, headlined by Madison Keys’ Australian Open triumph. 

American women have dominated the 2025 WTA season so far, winning half of the available titles.

This includes Amanda Anisimova winning the Qatar Open in the biggest triumph of her career so far.

All of this success means that American women have made WTA ranking history already this year, and have a total of 17 women inside the top 100.

Pegula previously praised American tennis, and has now elaborated on this in her pre-tournament press conference at Indian Wells when asked why she thinks it is so strong at the moment.

The world number four also referenced both Keys and Coco Gauff winning Grand Slam titles as a potential inspiration for lower ranked American players.

“I mean, that’s a great question,” said Pegula. “I don’t really know exactly why now, but I just think that our depth is pretty incredible. I think it has been, though, honestly, for a few years now. I think we’re just seeing more Americans maybe in the top 10, obviously top 20, for sure. That’s definitely a big change.

“You know, having Coco and Maddie win Slams over the last couple of years as Americans is huge for women’s tennis or for women’s tennis in America. I don’t know if maybe that’s kind of inspiring to maybe some of the lower-ranked Americans to do really well or the younger generation.

“That’s just been really incredible. I’m happy to just kind of be a part of that group, to be a part of that group for the last couple years now, it’s been really cool. It’s nice to see, you know, we don’t have to hold the fort down by ourselves. We have a lot of help, which is nice.”

Despite American women enjoying success on the WTA Tour at the moment, they have not won the title at Indian Wells since 2001.

Serena Williams beat Kim Clijsters at Indian Wells that year, and at the time American women had won eight of the last 12 titles at the WTA 1000 tournament.

However, since then there have only been two different American finalists, with Williams the last player to reach the Indian Wells final before losing to Victoria Azarenka in 2016.

Pegula, Gauff and Keys can end this drought in 2025, but could face tricky runs if they are to do so.

After struggling for form during the Middle Eastern swing, Gauff could play a fellow Grand Slam champion in her first match at Indian Wells.

Further down the line, Gauff and Keys could go head-to-head if both players reach the quarter-finals.

While in the other half of the draw, Pegula will play Magda Linette, who beat an American that Ons Jabeur has praised. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

Second up in Stadium 1 is another match between two players who are close in ranking—Uchijima is 52, Raducanu 55. But those numbers don’t reveal much about the direction these two women are taking. Raducanu, the younger of the two at 22, had a meteoric rise to Grand Slam fame four years ago in New York, but has been treading injury-plagued waters ever since. Uchijima, while she is older at 23, appears to be coming into her own in 2025. She nearly beat Mirra Andreeva at the Australian Open, she upset Jelena Ostapenko in Dubai, and her ranking of 52 is a career high.Still, Raducanu won their only meeting, three years ago, and she played some credible tennis in Dubai, beating Maria Sakkari and losing a close two-setter to Karolina Muchova. Raducanu likes a stage; if she wins this match, she’ll get a big one against Coco Gauff. Winner: Raducanu—Steve Tignor👉 Click here for more news on the BNP Paribas Open.

LEXINGTON, Ky. – Kentucky men’s tennis will hit the road this weekend, playing back-to-back road matches for the first time this season. The Cats (9-4, 2-1 SEC) will open the weekend in Athens, taking on No. 50 Georgia (7-6, 1-2 SEC) at 2 p.m. ET on Friday, March 7 at the Dan Magill Tennis Complex. The squad will then travel up Interstate-75 for a rivalry matchup with No. 19 Tennessee (10-5, 1-3 SEC) at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday, March 9 at Barksdale Stadium in Knoxville.

Ranked No. 27 in the latest ITA Computer Rankings, Kentucky heads into the weekend after defeating South Carolina in a rematch of last year’s SEC Tournament championship. The Cats moved to 2-0 in SEC play and 3-3 overall after losing doubles, using singles wins on courts one, two, four, and six to move to 7-0 in home matches this season.

Four Wildcats are currently ranked in singles by the ITA, led by No. 53 Jaden Weekes. No. 70 Antoine Ghibaudo, No. 105 Charlelie Cosnet, and No. 121 Jack Loutit help round out the ranked players in one of the deepest singles lineups in the country.

The Cats are looking for their first win in Athens since 2012, when Kentucky earned the program’s second SEC regular season championship. Georgia enters Friday’s match with a 7-1 home record, featuring a win over No. 16 Tennessee and a lone loss to No. 5 Virginia. Three Bulldogs feature in the top 32 of the ITA Singles Rankings—No. 26 Thomas Paulsell, No. 27 Ryan Colby, and No. 32 Miguel Perez Pena. Paulsell and Colby check in at No. 14 in the ITA Doubles Rankings with No. 23 Freddy Blaydes and Niels Ratiu and No. 47 Miguel Perez Pena and Oscar Pinto Sansano also featuring as ranked pairings.

The matchup with the Vols will be the first top 25 opponent Kentucky has faced since falling to No. 14 Texas A&M at the ITA Indoor National Championships. The Cats are 2-2 this season against ranked opponents. Tennessee is led by Alex Kotzen who ranks No. 29 in singles and No. 11 in doubles alongside Alejandro Moreno. Shunsuke Mitsui also features at No. 25 in the singles rankings. The Cats defeated Tennessee in Lexington last season, clinching a perfect conference record and outright SEC Regular Season title with a 4-3 win over the Vols.

The Cats will return home to the Boone next week, hosting LSU on Thursday, March 13 at 5 p.m. ET and Vanderbilt at 1 p.m. ET on Saturday, March 15.

All home matches will be played at the Hilary J. Boone Tennis Complex, and admission is free to the public for all regular season contests. A live stream will be provided for all home matches on UKAthletics.com.

CEDAR FALLS, Iowa — After a weekend off from competition, the UNI women's tennis team is ready to travel to Wisconsin to compete in a non-conference matchup against Milwaukee on Saturday, March 8. The Panthers will compete at 11:30 a.m. CT at the River Glen Elite Center. 

Two weeks ago, the Panthers faced tough competition in a pair of duals, falling 1-4 to SIU Edwardsville and 3-4 to St. Thomas. Despite the losses, several standout performances showcased the team's growth.

The Panthers continued to compete against St. Thomas, earning three singles victories. Senior Darta Dalecka delivered a dominant performance, defeating her opponent 6-4, 6-0. Raznatovic showed her resilience, earning a hard-fought 6-4, 7-6 win. Additionally, the number 1 duo of Darta and Lorena Cardoso won a tight 7-6 battle in doubles play.

Rutgers started the spring 9-3, their best start since the COVID-19 shortened 2020 season. The team also added two Big Ten regular season wins, defeating Michigan State and Minnesota.  

Rutgers made history in the ITA rankings, claiming its first-ever team and doubles ranking. The Scarlet Knights reached as high as No. 68 in the polls while the pair of Amira Badawi and Mai Nguyen came in at a season-best No. 54.  

Graduate Student Yana Gurevich became the first Scarlet Knight in program history to earn All-Big Ten honors, after going 12-5 in conference play.

Chilton, who came to Rutgers in the fall of 2023 at the start of her junior season, has made a long-lasting impact on the Scarlet Knights. During her time On The Banks Chilton has excelled in all areas including in tennis, academics and volunteering in her community. 

""The Arthur Ashe Award is a prestigious ITA Award and Tara is a perfect recipient,"" head coach Hilary Ritchie said. ""Tara always strives for excellence. In her two years at Rutgers, she made a big impact on our team, the business school and the student-athlete community overall."" 

The ITA Assistant Coach of the Year honors an assistant coach who has exhibited outstanding leadership in ways that contribute to on and off-court team performance. These are qualities that assistant coach Barrett has exemplified since arriving On The Banks.  

""Hailey is so deserving of this award,"" Ritchie said. ""She wears an incredible number of hats to help this team and the individual student-athletes as well. During a time when there is a lot of uncertainty in college athletics, Hailey always remains positive and puts her passion for tennis first.""

In the offseason, head coach Hilary Ritchie welcomed four newcomers to the team including two freshman in Zeynep Ilker and Karina Jumazhanova in addition to two transfers in Zuzanna Frankowska and Zhou ""Cindy"" Xintong.  

Zuzanna Frankowska played her freshman year at Baylor and hails from Kobylka, Poland. In the fall of 2023, she made her debut at the TCU Fall Invitational and went onto pick up four singles wins and a doubles victory throughout the slate. In the 2024 spring, she played two matches at the No. 5 lineup spot and picked up a doubles win against the Iowa State on the third court.  

Zhou ""Cindy"" Xintong spent her rookie season at Fordham, where she excelled. In the 2023 fall, she went 4-3 in singles play and 6-1 in doubles. She saw action in 18 of the team's 22 spring matches, going 8-5 in singles play, earning victories on courts No. 3, 4 and 5. The Mississauga, Ontario, Canada native went 11 matches without a loss, picking up big two-set wins over George Washington, Brown, Richmond and George Mason.  

Originally from Bursa, Turkey Zeynep Ilker comes to Rutgers with a wealth of international playing experience. A member of Turkey's National Team, she has taken part in European Championships. She spent several years competing on the ITF Junior Tour and in 2023 reached a career-best ranking of 408.  

Karina Jumazhanova also brings lots of worldly experience to the team, coming from Almaty, Kazakhstan. She mainly competed in Women's 15k events on the ITF World Tennis Tour, reaching a career-high ITF ranking of 178. The freshman also saw action in the U16 Juniors Billie Jean King Cup, representing Kazakhstan. She is an ITF J4 Doubles Winner and Finalist, in addition to being a Kazakhstan Doubles Finalist Champion.  

The Returners  

In addition to the four newcomers, Ritchie also welcomed back four returners in Jackie Lopez, Minchae Kim, Mai Nguyen and Naomi Karki.  

Lopez compiled eight singles wins across the 2023 season, finishing the campaign on a three-match winning streak. She clinched RU's first-ever victory over Minnesota in addition to the win over NJIT.

ORLANDO - Big 12 tennis returns to the USTA National Campus this weekend as the No. 23 UCF women’s tennis team gears up to face No. 15 Baylor and No. 40 TCU.

The Knights (10-1) will strive to protect its flawless 6-0 record at home this season, starting with the Bears at 6 p.m. on Friday before they meet the Horned Frogs at noon on Sunday. UCF already boasts a 2-0 record in conference play this season.

LAST TIME OUT 

The Knights kicked off their 2025 Big 12 campaign on the road last Friday against No. 73 Kansas State in a hard-fought 4-1 victory at the Mike Goss Tennis Stadium. UCF snatched the doubles point with tiebreak triumphs on courts one and two against the Wildcats. Kansas State leveled the match on court four to open singles play, but the Black and Gold were quick to respond, winning straight sets for the rest of the match to deliver their first conference win of the season.

The Knights only stepped harder on the gas in their following match against conference favorites Oklahoma State. The nearly four-hour thriller saw UCF claim the vital doubles point across a pair of tiebreaks before a chaotic stalemate in singles play. Both sides took three courts each, with court two serving as a stage for Olivia Lincer to upset No. 88 Anastasiya Komar in a sensational series of play, 7-6 (10-8), 6-3. UCF now sits on a 10-1 record this season after the intense win at the Greenwood Tennis Center.

THE OPPONENTS

BAYLOR

The Bears will arrive in Orlando on a nine-game win streak, only allowing nine points in that stretch. Their only loss was handed to them by No.12 Texas in the second round of the ITF Kickoff Weekend after a court-two loss in the third set tiebreak ended the match, 3-4.

TCU

The Horned Frogs have shown a relentless form in their last three games, sweeping their opponents 4-0 in each match. Their 7-3 record includes a win against No. 45 Washington State that went down to the wire, 4-3. 

The last time the Knights faced TCU ended in a 4-3 victory away from home for UCF last year. Among the line up was Biolay and Lincer, who will hope to make another big impact against the Frogs this time around.

ORLANDO - A historic non-conference campaign will come to a close this weekend for the No. 13 UCF men’s tennis team as it plays host to a trio of programs at the USTA National Campus.

On Friday, the 2024 season-opening doubleheader will shift to Orlando, as UNC-Wilmington and Coastal Carolina will match up with the Knights (12-3) once again. The finale will be a fitting contest, with UCF set to host No. 36 South Florida on Sunday afternoon, marking the second meeting between the two teams this season and the 52nd match all-time.

Same position, new rankings 🫡🗞️ https://t.co/FYl8eexi0v pic.twitter.com/KJbsMIcLML

LAST TIME OUT

Following the Knights’ inaugural ITA Indoor Championship in Waco, where they topped No. 4 Ohio State and faced three teams currently in the top 10, the squad returned home with a pair of dominating displays against UAB and Stetson.

A 4-0 record across six doubles matches made for an easy pathway in singles, with the Black and Gold dropping just one court over two days. Paul Colin jumped into the win column with a pair of triumphs on courts three and four, while his fellow Frenchman Liam Branger also grabbed two victories.

THE OPPONENTS

While UNCW (3-6) ride a five-match losing streak before its first trip to Orlando since 2017, the Seahawks have consistently held their own against some of the nation’s best. Two weeks ago, the squad took two singles courts off No. 1 Wake Forest, a feat also achieved against No. 56 Georgia Tech. 

The squad is led by Harold Huens, who holds a 4-2 record on court one, along with Sam Nicholson and Wayand Joseph on courts two and three. UNCW is led by Mait Dubois, embarking on his 18th season leading the program, claiming 10 conference championships in that span and 11 NCAA tournament appearances. 

A mixed bag of results for Coastal Carolina (4-4) precedes its Friday evening contest with the Knights, the second between the two program’s all-time. Christopher Norlin leads the Chanticleers with a 4-1 record on court one, while head coach Chris Powers continued to lead the squad in his 24th season in Conway and 21st as head coach.

A tight meeting with No. 36 South Florida (10-3) in Tampa to begin February action makes for an anticipated ranked matchup in Orlando. A seven-match road swing propelled the Bulls into the national rankings, with their lone defeat coming at the hands of No. 2 TCU in Fort Worth. Triumphs over Oregon, UC Santa Barbara and Florida Atlantic highlighted the trip.

Eighth-year head coach Ashley Fisher’s team has been dominant on the back two courts, compiling a 20-6 record, while also boasting an 11-1 record on court one. Hugo Car (8-1), Agustin Cuellar (8-0) and Stepan Mruzek (8-0) have underlined their success in singles.

Kim Clijsters of Belgium and daughter Jada after her US Open triumph in 2010

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is to finance a joint initiative with the WTA for paid maternity leave of ""up to 12 months"" for players on the women's tennis circuit, it was announced on Thursday.

The PIF WTA Maternity Fund Program ""will offer benefits to more than 320 eligible WTA players"", the Women's Tennis Association said in a statement.

""WTA players will for the first time receive paid maternity leave up to 12 months, and have access to grants for fertility treatments to build families, as well as other benefits,"" it read.

Players will have to compete ""in a certain number of WTA tournaments in a window of time"" to benefit from the payments.

Two-time Grand Slam winner Victoria Azarenka, a WTA players' council representative, welcomed ""the beginning of a meaningful shift in how we support women in tennis, making it easier for athletes to pursue both their careers and their aspirations of starting a family.""

""Ensuring that programs like this exist has been a personal mission of mine,"" the Belarusian former world number one, who gave birth to a son in 2016, was quoted in the statement as saying. 

For WTA CEO Portia Archer ""this initiative will provide the current and next generation of players the support and flexibility to explore family life, in whatever form they choose.""

Several top players have taken a break from their careers to give birth, with varying degrees of impact on their subsequent careers. 

Belgian Kim Clijsters won three majors -- the US Open in 2009 and 2010 and the Australian Open in 2011 -- after giving birth to her daughter in 2008, following in the footsteps of Australians Margaret Court and Evonne Goolagong, who triumphed at Grand Slams as mothers.

However, 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams did not win any after the birth of her first child in September 2017, even though the American reached four finals at Wimbledon and the US Open.

Four-time Grand Slam winner and former world number one Naomi Osaka of Japan returned to the courts in early 2024 after giving birth to a daughter. 

Since then, the 27-year-old's best result has been a final at the modest Auckland tournament in January. 

Criticised by some tennis figures for its record on women's rights, Saudi Arabia has boosted its tennis investments in recent years, organising the season-ending WTA Finals for the first time in Riyadh last November.

That came months after the WTA entered into a multi-year partnership with the PIF sovereign wealth fund, with the kingdom again set to host the WTA Finals in 2025 and 2026.

A former nationally ranked tennis player convinced the Ninth Circuit to revive her claims that the US Tennis Association failed to stop her coach’s sexual abuse. 

The lower court wrongly found that a dismissal of Adrienne Jensen’s suit against USTA in Kansas precluded her from trying again in Arizona, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said Thursday. 

Jensen alleges that when she was a rising teen tennis star, the USTA failed to protect her from sexual abuse by her coach, Rex Haultain. Haultain pleaded guilty to soliciting child pornography in a separate federal criminal case.

Australian tennis great Fred Stolle, a former world No 1, dual grand slam singles champion and three-times Davis Cup winner, has died at the age of 86.

To modern-day fans, Stolle will be best remembered for his colourful commentary and anecdotes after featuring on TV for almost 50 years. To old-timers and aficionados, Stolle will be regarded as a giant of the game during the halcyon days of the 1960s when Australia ruled the tennis world and Stolle ruled some of the country’s finest ever players.

Stolle reached world No 1 in 1966 after conquering John Newcombe in the final of the US championship, a year after defeating Tony Roche at the French. He made five other grand slam singles finals, twice in Australia and three times at Wimbledon, while also helping Australia win three straight Davis Cups from 1964 to 1966.

It was during his Davis Cup years that Stolle was nicknamed “Fiery” – in the tradition of ironic nicknames because of his sluggish start in the morning and his quiet early play on practice courts. He once wrote that for some the tennis court was like a boxing ring but for him it was “like being on stage”.

But his greatest successes came in doubles, winning 10 majors – four with Roy Emerson, four with Bob Hewitt and two with Ken Rosewall – while completing a distinguished doubles career grand slam.

Rod Laver, Australia’s greatest men’s player, led the tributes. “Fred Stolle was too nice a guy to hold a grudge,” he said.

“He won many grand slams and was in the finals of many more. It took the best to beat the best. We never tired of reliving the past as we travelled the world looking into the future with an enduring love of the sport. You will be missed, Fiery, RIP.”

“When we speak about Australia’s golden era and the progression from amateur to professionalism, Stolle’s name is right up there with the best,” said Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley. “A star member of Australia’s Davis Cup team, Fred made significant contributions to the sport following his decorated career, as a coach and astute commentator.

“His legacy is one of excellence, dedication, and a profound love for tennis. His impact on the sport will be remembered and cherished by all who had the privilege to witness his contributions. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Fred’s family and friends during this sad time.”

Stolle is survived by wife Pat, son Sandon – himself a former doubles world No 2 and grand slam champion – and daughters Monique and Nadine.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

EU Leaders Cautiously Welcome Macron's Nuclear Umbrella Offer

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European leaders showed a cautiously receptive ear to President Emmanuel Macron's proposal to debate extending the French nuclear umbrella to Europe on Thursday, though some were reluctant to draw a line under years of U.S. protection.

In an address to the nation on Wednesday, Macron said he would launch a strategic dialogue over extending the protection offered by France's nuclear arsenal to its European partners, seizing on comments from future German leader Friedrich Merz.

Although both France and Britain are nuclear powers, most European countries' primary nuclear deterrence comes from the United States, a decades-old symbol of trans-Atlantic solidarity.

But the radical shift engineered by U.S. President Donald Trump's new administration, which has made overtures to Russia, pressured Ukraine to make peace with Moscow, and adopted a more aggressive stance towards traditional allies, has focused minds.

""We Swedes, like most people, want to have as few nuclear weapons as possible, but right now we should be happy and grateful that there are two neighbouring countries that have nuclear weapons,"" Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said.

""So I think it is good that France is showing openness,"" he told reporters ahead of an EU summit in Brussels, though he said the issue was not on the meeting's agenda on Thursday.

Denmark, once a staunch U.S. ally now shocked by Trump's thinly-veiled threats of taking over Greenland, a Danish territory, also appeared receptive.

""I think we have to discuss everything now, so all good ideas around the table have to be a part of our discussion,"" said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.

Some Baltic countries, which have expressed fears they could be next if Russia was allowed to prevail in Ukraine, showed openness too.

""I think it's a very interesting idea,"" Lithuanian Prime Minister Gitanas Nauseda said. ""A nuclear umbrella would serve as really very serious deterrence toward Russia,"" he said.

EUROPEAN CAUTION, RUSSIAN FURY

After Macron first aired the idea of involving Europe in French strategic thinking around its nuclear deterrence in 2020, the response from his EU partners was muted.

But the clearest sign the mood had shifted after five weeks of Trump presidency came from Germany, with Merz saying Berlin might need to become less reliant on the U.S. nuclear umbrella.

He called for talks with France and Britain about an expansion of their nuclear protection, something Macron referred to in his speech on Wednesday as a ""historical"" turning point.

Inevitably for an issue where strategic ambiguity is essential, Macron's proposal remains very vague, however, and some EU leaders expressed caution.

Experts say France could not hope to replicate the same level of strategic nuclear infrastructure the U.S. has in Europe.

France has only a fraction of the number of airborne nuclear weapons the U.S. can provide, and any upgrade of its systems would be costly and complicated.

Asked whether Latvia would accept French nuclear weapons on Latvian territory, Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina said it was ""too soon"" to answer that.

Others also expressed caution. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala called the debate ""premature"".

""It is possible to consider it, but for now our security is guaranteed by close cooperation with the United States,"" Fiala told a news conference in Prague before the EU summit.

Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has displayed stark strategic differences with Macron over the course of his mandate, said it was important not to give up on U.S. military protection.

Macron's comments caused furious reactions in Russia, with the foreign ministry saying Paris' ""ambitions to become the nuclear 'patron' of all of Europe"" would not lead to more security for France or its allies.

 SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pledged Thursday to help Puerto Rico in her first visit to the U.S. territory as it struggles to rebuild from catastrophic hurricanes amid chronic power outages. 

 Noem spoke briefly with reporters during her one-day trip to the island, saying she would look into how the federal government can cut some of the permitting and requirements of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency “to make sure that people are going to get the help that they need and that they were promised.” 

 FEMA has been funding much of the reconstruction after Hurricane Maria slammed into the island as a Category 4 storm in September 2017, but Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González recently criticized the agency, saying it has not yet released $18 billion slated for the power grid that was razed. 

 Noem said that she and González talked “extensively” about energy and how the federal government could help streamline efforts to update energy sources on the island. She did not provide further details and did not take questions from the press. 

 Under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, the U.S. Department of Energy invested millions of dollars in solar projects across Puerto Rico, generating more than 1,200 megawatts of new renewable capacity. 

 Some $6 billion in federal funds have been obligated to help rebuild the power grid, with FEMA approving 200 of more than 440 projects submitted to the agency to repair and strengthen the grid. Of those approved, at least 125 are under construction. 

 González, who is a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, said she and Noem also talked about ways to strengthen Puerto Rico’s border security, and how the island can beef up relations with federal security agencies. 

 “We want to dismantle all those criminal organizations hitting our shores,” González said, adding that Noem’s visit “demonstrates how important Puerto Rico is in this fight.” 

 Noem traveled to Puerto Rico for a ceremony honoring Michel O. Maceda, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent who was killed in November 2022 during a shootout at sea with suspected drug traffickers. Three other agents were wounded. 

 Her visit comes weeks after federal agents in Puerto Rico began arresting people believed to be undocumented immigrants, a move that has been widely criticized on the island. 

 Noem said González is willing to build partnerships with the federal government “not only for the betterment of her people, but also for the United States of America. The mission of the Department of Homeland Security is to protect the American homeland, but to do it with integrity and honor as well."" 

 González met with Noem days after traveling to Washington D.C. to push for U.S. statehood, a central goal of her New Progressive Party.

Pope Francis was ""resting"" Thursday after spending a ""peaceful night"", as he nears three weeks in hospital with pneumonia, the Vatican said.

The 88-year-old had used an oxygen mask overnight for a third time, the Holy See said.

The pontiff was hospitalised on February 14 at Rome's Gemelli hospital with breathing difficulties but is now battling pneumonia in both lungs.

Francis missed the formal Ash Wednesday celebrations in Rome marking the start of Lent, but took part in a blessing in the private suite reserved for popes on the 10th floor of the Gemelli.

Christians across the globe celebrating Ash Wednesday prayed for the pontiff's recovery, including in his native Argentina.

Francis, leader of the world's almost 1.4 billion Catholics, has not been seen in public since his hospitalisation, nor has the Vatican issued any photos, although he has published several texts.

WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.

The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday’s journal Science.

“Butterflies have been declining the last 20 years,” said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. “And we don’t see any sign that that’s going to end.”

A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.

Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.

David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn’t part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is “catastrophic and saddening” when compounded over time.

“In just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!” Wagner said in an email. “The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.”

The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn’t show up in the data and another 212 species weren’t found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

“I’m probably most worried about the species that couldn’t even be included in the analyses” because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn’t part of the research. 

Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies — which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina — “so it could be extinct.” 

Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said. 

Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, “a species that is well adapted to invade the world,” according to Haddad, fell by 50%. 

“How can that be?” Haddad wondered.

Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.

“The loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,” Agrawal, who wasn’t part of the study, said in an email. “They are telling us that our continent’s health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature’s beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.”

Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that “calms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.”

What’s happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.

Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.

The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest — Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma — where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.

“It looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,” Edwards said. “And that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.”

Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.

Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.

“It makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,” Haddad said.

Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there’s hope, Haddad said.

“You can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,” Haddad said. “That could really improve the situation for a lot of species.”

Wall Street Journal editor in chief Emma Tucker sent out the following on Tuesday:

Today we announced changes to our technology coverage at the Journal.

The Journal has a rich tradition of groundbreaking coverage of the biggest technology companies. The time has come for us to put in place a structure that fully acknowledges tech’s all-encompassing role in the economy and our lives. To that end, tech coverage will be part of a wider Technology & Media group, based in New York. I’m happy to announce that Sarah Krouse will run that group as Tech & Media editor. Sarah will be returning to New York from a successful run in Los Angeles as  LA bureau chief. She’ll manage the tech-focused reporters and editors in San Francisco and New York, the New York-based media team and the Los Angeles-based entertainment team.

We are advertising for a deputy Technology bureau chief based in New York and for a second deputy Technology bureau chief based in San Francisco.

We’re also creating a new Tech & Media enterprise team, reporting to Sarah, and we’re creating two new jobs on this team based in San Francisco. In the coming weeks, we’ll be reconfiguring beats on the tech team to give more of them a wide ambit. Fewer will focus narrowly on individual companies. We are also advertising for  a new tech-focused job on Heard in New York.

These changes do mean that some reporters and editors in San Francisco and New York will be leaving us. I want to thank them for their contributions to the Journal. I want to especially thank Jason Dean, who is departing, for his long and distinguished service.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Armis, the cyber exposure management & security company, announced today that it has acquired OTORIO, a leading provider of OT (Operational Technology) and CPS (Cyber Physical Systems) security.

Through this acquisition, Armis can now offer an on-premises solution for customers that require a fully air-gapped environment for heavy industry and critical infrastructure like energy or utilities,” said Yevgeny Dibrov, CEO and Co-founder, Armis.



“I am excited to welcome the OTORIO team to Armis and leveraging their expertise and deep foundational industry knowledge to support our customers in securing their critical infrastructure,” continued Dibrov. “This new hybrid and on-premises expansion of Armis Centrix™ makes it the most complete platform for any customer looking to secure their operational technology and cyber-physical environments.”

Armis has a proven history of seamlessly integrating acquisitions into its Armis Centrix™ platform and transforming acquired technologies into substantial revenue drivers. Following the acquisitions of Silk Security and CTCI, Armis has achieved an exceptional 2000% increase in related revenues, demonstrating its ability to maximize value and accelerate growth as it continues to prepare for an IPO.



This marks Armis’ third acquisition in less than 12-months, (having acquired AI security startup CTCI and risk prioritization startup Silk Security) – each aimed at strengthening the company’s already robust product capabilities and expanding ability to reach new market segments.



Armis is the leader in cyber exposure management and now offers unparalleled security solutions covering all industries, sectors & environments. Only Armis offers a platform that provides for your complete cyber exposure needs from the ground to the cloud. In October 2024, Armis announced a new $200m funding round which has enabled Armis to rapidly advance and scale to complete its vision and roadmap in line with customer demand.

 Sacks’ message came on the eve of the White House’s first crypto summit, where Bitcoin is expected to feature prominently on the agenda. 

White House crypto czar David Sacks has criticized the US government’s sale of confiscated Bitcoin over the years, referring to it as a strategic mistake that has cost taxpayers billions.

In a March 6 social media post, Sacks said the US government generated $366 million in proceeds from its Bitcoin (BTC) sales over the past decade. 

“If the government had held the bitcoin, it would be worth over $17 billion today,” said Sacks. “That’s how much it cost American taxpayers not having a long-term strategy.”

The folly of treating Bitcoin as a short-term trade was highlighted by Joe Burnett, the head of market research at Unchained. 

“Long-term holders shape the market,” Burnett told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “Bitcoin isn’t about timing the market. It’s about time in the market. In short, Bitcoin’s price will swing, but its true value is built for generations.”

In January, the Department of Justice received the green light to sell the 198,000 BTC it seized from Silk Road, the darknet marketplace that was shuttered in 2013. The decision was widely panned by the crypto community for being short-sighted and not carefully weighing Bitcoin’s long-term wealth effect.

However, the US government continues to hold the confiscated Bitcoin. The status of the stockpile has been subject to debate since Donald Trump secured the US presidency in November. 

Trump has vowed to make America the world’s leader in crypto and blockchain technology, which includes adopting a strategic crypto reserve with a special status for Bitcoin.

Sacks delivered his message on the eve of the White House’s first crypto summit, where more than 20 industry leaders have been invited to discuss America’s evolving cryptocurrency priorities. 

The confirmed attendees include Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Strategy founder Michael Saylor, and Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

According to Sacks, the White House chose to keep the attendee list small to facilitate a “meaningful conversation” around digital asset policies and strategies.

There is growing speculation that the White House will unveil plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve during the March 7 summit. Unconfirmed reports also suggest the president is considering lowering or eliminating capital gains taxes on Bitcoin and crypto holdings. 

However, until now, the clearest indication given by Sacks is that industry representatives will meet with President Trump’s Working Group on Digital Assets.

Bitcoin Foundation Chairman Brock Pierce joins ‘Varney & Co.’ to discuss Trump’s ‘crypto strategic reserve’ plan. 

White House artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto czar David Sacks claimed Thursday that the federal government’s lack of a ""long-term strategy"" on cryptocurrency has negatively impacted American taxpayers.

""Over the past decade, the federal government sold approximately 195,000 bitcoin for proceeds of $366 million. If the government had held the bitcoin, it would be worth over $17 billion today,"" he claimed in an X post. ""That’s how much it has cost American taxpayers not to have a long-term strategy."" 

He pointed to calculations by Grok, the xAI-developed AI chatbot, as the source of those figures. xAI is an AI company that Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and owner of X, launched in 2023.

TRUMP MOVES ‘CRYPTO STRATEGIC RESERVE’ FORWARD, PROMISES TO ELEVATE INDUSTRY

President Donald Trump selected Sacks to serve as the White House AI and crypto czar within his administration in early December. He is also heading up the ""Working Group on Digital Asset Markets"" that the president formed in January through an executive order.

The executive order tasked the working group with multiple things related to digital assets, including looking into the ""potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile"" and proposing ""criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts."" 

Over the weekend, Trump indicated he indeed wanted to pursue creating the stockpile.

""A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,"" the president said on Truth Social.

Bitcoin has posted a nearly 5.5% jump in price over the past five days. The other cryptocurrencies that Trump mentioned have also seen increases in that timeframe, such as Cardano jumping nearly 41% and XRP rising 19.8%.

The White House is hosting a crypto summit on Friday that the administration said will feature ""prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the president’s Working Group on Digital Assets,"" FOX Business previously reported.

According to André Dragosch, the primary argument for a Bitcoin-only reserve lies in its proof-of-work mechanism. He highlights that while foreign adversaries could potentially harm a network by acquiring 33% of the supply in Ethereum's proof-of-stake system, achieving a 51% hash rate in Bitcoin's proof-of-work is significantly more challenging, thereby offering a stronger security measure.

Six Premier League stars have been nominated for the February 2025 EA SPORTS Player of the Month award, and you can help decide who wins.

You, the fans, have until 12:00 GMT on Monday 10 March to vote for one player from the shortlist below.

Your vote will be combined with those of a panel of football experts to determine the winner, who will be revealed next week.

Beto (Everton)P5 W2 D3 L0 G5 A0The Everton forward was the Premier League’s second-highest scorer for February with five goals in as many matches. He began the month with a brace in a 4-0 win over Leicester City. He followed that up with the openers in the next three matches against Liverpool, Crystal Palace and Manchester United as the Toffees went unbeaten through February with two wins and three draws.

Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)P4 W3 D0 L1 G4 A1The Frenchman enjoyed another excellent month in front of goal for Oliver Glasner’s side. Having been nominated for January’s award, Mateta picked up where he left off with both goals at Old Trafford in a 2-0 win over Man Utd. He then scored the equaliser against Everton, even if it was not enough to prevent a 2-1 loss. Mateta then provided an assist for Daniel Munoz to score in the win at Fulham before netting once more against Aston Villa in an emphatic 4-1 victory.

Yankuba Minteh (Brighton & Hove Albion)P4 W3 D0 L1 G2 A1The 20-year-old winger scored twice against Chelsea to earn the Seagulls an impressive 3-0 win, before providing an assist for Georginio Rutter in the 4-0 victory over Southampton. Minteh then helped the Seagulls towards a vital 2-1 victory over fellow European hopefuls AFC Bournemouth.

Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)P6 W4 D2 L0 G6 A4Another record-breaking month for the Egyptian, who led the way in February for goal involvements, with 10. Salah started the month with both goals in the 2-0 win at Bournemouth, followed by strikes against Everton, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Villa. He then starred in the 2-0 win over Manchester City, becoming the first Premier League player to score and assist in both matches against the reigning champions in a season. His assist for the second goal against Newcastle United was his 17th of 2024/25, two more than the record for a Liverpool player in a single Premier League season and three off the all-time mark for an entire campaign.

Djed Spence (Tottenham Hotspur)P4 W3 D0 L1 G1 A0 CS2The Spurs full-back impressed at both ends of the pitch during February. He helped Ange Postecoglou’s side keep successive clean sheets in wins over Brentford and Man Utd, before scoring his first Premier League goal for the club in a 4-1 victory at Ipswich Town.

Dominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool)P6 W4 D2 L0 G2 A1Another key player during the month for Liverpool, Szoboszlai helped Liverpool extend their lead at the top of the table thanks to two goals and an assist. He created the opener and scored the second in their 2-0 win at Man City and was again on target in the following match, as Newcastle were beaten by the same scoreline.

News-Bulletin Sports Writer

Los Lunas, in white last week against West Mesa, will take an aggressive attack to the 5A Girls State Basketball Championship.

Three Valencia County teams are off to the state basketball tournaments.

The 5A Los Lunas and 4A Valencia girls’ squads earned home court advantage, while Belen advanced to the 4A boys’ tournament after being squarely on the “bubble” until the brackets were revealed Sunday by the New Mexico Activities Association.

LLHS coach Manny Vigil was a bit disappointed in the Tigers drawing the seventh seed, leading to a home game at 6 p.m. Saturday against No. 10 Rio Rancho (20-10).

“They are way better than a 10 seed,” said Vigil, calling the Rams, “a tough draw for us.”

Rio Rancho has played well, with a recent win over No. 9 Volcano Vista and a narrow loss to fourth-seeded Farmington, both district rivals.

“They’ve got some really strong guards,” Vigil said, and are talented inside. “They’ve got some really big kids.”

The Rams have stayed competitive despite the partial absence of head coach Lori Mabrey, whose husband, Buster Mabrey, executive director of the New Mexico High School Coaches Association, died Dec. 30 after a lengthy illness.

Eric Jack has been coaching the team, with Mabrey assisting since mid-January.

LLHS (23-6) will continue to rely on pressure defense and up-tempo offense led by Vayda Galino and Tessa Jaramillo, with freshman Kayla Finley, 11.5 points and 9.5 rebounds per game, countering the Rams’ post players.

“We’re just ready to go. We’re excited to host a game, see if we can take care of business,” said Vigil, with the goal to “make it to the Pit,” for the state quarterfinals against either No. 2 Sandia or 15th seeded Centennial.

Valencia, in white, used pressure defense to defeat Belen in the girls district tournament and Friday will host Highland in the 4A state playoffs.

In 4A, Valencia (23-7) has been ranked in the top five all season and will go into the tournament as a four seed against a familiar foe. The Jaguars will face at 6 p.m. Friday district rival Highland (14-14), the No. 14 seed. VHS went 3-0 against the Hornets.

“It’s hard to beat a team four times, but at the same time I like our matchup — across the board,” said Raymond Montoya, VHS coach.

After taking a deflating one game playoff loss to St. Pius at the start of last week to decide the top seed in the district tournament, the Jaguars found their footing. VHS won three games in five days over Belen, Highland and St. Pius to claim the district tournament title.

That stretch “gave us a chance to find our swagger again, find our rhythm, figure out how to get going again,” Montoya believes.

However far Valencia goes, they will look to guards Jaydn Montoya, 16.3 points, and Francesa Otero, 7.6 points, for firepower outside, with sisters Jaiden and Eden Montgomery anchoring in the paint.

Montoya says the players, “feel like we’ve earned where we are at. They like our route,” with either Albuquerque Academy or Silver as a possible quarterfinal opponent.

A 3-0 record against Valencia helped Belen, in maroon, earn a spot Saturday in the 4A state playoffs, playing at Espanola Valley.

Despite a losing record, Belen (12-15) made the 4A boys’ tournament as a 14 seed.

“We felt we were in, but we had our fingers crossed,” said Donald Marquez, BHS coach.

Marquez believes a double-overtime victory at Grants during the district tournament and losses by potential bid-stealers Aztec and Portales in their tournament title games opened the door for the Eagles.

“If those teams would have won, it would have been really scary for us,” the coach said.

Speaking of scary, BHS will play 6 p.m. Saturday at Espanola Valley (22-6), the third seed.

“We know it’s going to be a tough environment — a hostile crowd,” according to Marquez. “I feel like playing at Grants and places like that have gotten us ready for this.”

The Sundevils are led by Josiah Fresquez, a senior guard, but Marquez believes Belen matches up well.

“What we do like is they’re a lot like us. They don’t have much size. We have different guards that have prepared us for a team like Espanola,” Marquez said.

Those guards include four seniors, Josiah Navarro, Jasode Harris, Damian Avila and Alan Moreno.

If the Eagles pull the upset, they are matched up against either No. 6 Silver or No. 11 Hope Christian.

Valencia was on the bubble in 4A but narrowly missed out on making the field. According to the NMAA, Valencia was tied for the final spot with Bloomfield and Goddard, with the Rockets taking the 16 seed based on criteria points.

It was a two-point loss Jan. 3 to Goddard that Valencia coach Jesse Hathoot believes kept the Jaguars out of the tournament.

“You don’t think of these things when you’re in the middle of the season,” Hathoot said about the loss. “That was ultimately the difference in not getting in. We’re pretty bummed out. We’ve been holding out hope all weekend.”

Hathoot stills believes VHS was among the top 16 teams in 4A, with victories over three schools in the field, including No. 2 Artesia.

“Ultimately, you’ve got to win more than nine games,” he said. “We’ve got nobody to blame but ourselves.”

In addition to Valencia, the Los Lunas (6-20) boys and the Belen (8-19) girls did not qualify for postseason play.

The Los Lunas Powerlifting Invitational, with athletes from LLHS and Belen, was a team effort to prepare the school cafeteria for the competition.

Los Lunas

In a matter of several hours Friday, the cafeteria at Los Lunas High School went from ladles and hair nets to barbells and singlets.

Shortly after B-lunch ended at about 12:40 p.m., the rush began to transform the lunchroom into a weight room in time for the Los Lunas Powerlifting Invitational.

“There is a lot going on — it takes all hands-on deck,” said Nathanial Charley, LLHS powerlifting coach.

To get the equipment, enough for five competition racks, moved from the weight room in a separate building, maintenance crews and athletes from many sports teams at the school did the heavy lifting.

“It was a big community effort from our staff; everyone helped out,” Charley said.

The effort came from a variety of areas — an LLHS shop class, which got platforms ready, Valencia donated mats, students trained as spotters and teachers and staff received certification by New Mexico Activities Association for various roles.

In addition, Charley sought out the state’s top powerlifting officials, “so that our kids are coached up well on the technique,” as judges explain what they may have done incorrectly.

When Valencia opted for another meet, the contest turned into a dual between the Tigers and Belen Eagles.

The state’s newest high school sport has attracted more and more participants.

“It’s a cool environment,” said Chris Peralta, BHS coach, as students and fans from both schools crowded into the room, many watching from the balcony above.

“We battle against each other, but other than that we’re good allies,” Peralta said about the two schools and his friendship with Charley.

“Getting Belen and Los Lunas back together is a good thing,” Charley said.

The barbell battle was enthusiastic and close. The Eagles captured the boys’ division, 72-68, while the BHS girls prevailed 64-53.

In only its second season as a sanctioned high school sport in New Mexico, powerlifting’s popularity is on the rise.

“I think it’s the fastest growing sport, even more so on the girl’s side,” said Peralta, who has more than 30 athletes on the team. “It’s catching on. We’re excited.”

Numbers at LLHS have exploded, with nearly 90 participants. That includes 23 girls, 20 more than last season.

According to Charley, prospective lifters ask, “How can I get in shape? Can I be a part of this?”

For many, this is their first experience in athletics.

“Pretty soon, we can’t kick them out of practice,” the Los Lunas coach said. “They are loving it.”

Athletes will continue to try to improve their lifts in hopes of qualifying for the New Mexico Powerlifting Championships April 4-5 at the Rio Rancho Events Center.

Tennis and fashion go hand in hand. That is especially true when the tennis world descends upon the Coachella Valley for the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.

The annual Masters 1000 tournament is one of the most glamorous events in the United States. Players and fans alike bring their best style to ""Tennis Paradise,"" and lululemon is raising the bar this year.

First, lululemon ambassadors Frances Tiafoe and Leylah Fernandez will be competing in brand-new on-court kits that sport a bold shade of Starch Blue. 

Fernandez will rock the Power Pivot Tank Top ($58) and Perforated Narrow Waistband Tennis Skirt ($88) in Starch Blue on the court. Additionally, she will wear the Energy Bra in Starch Blue ($52).

Off the court, the Canadian tennis star will wear the Court Rival Track Jacket Perforated ($128) and Court Rival Wide-Leg Track Pant Regular ($128) in matching Starch Blue.

Meanwhile, Tiafoe will wear the Striped Mesh Tennis Short Sleeve ($88) and the Striped Mesh Tennis Short 7-inch Linerless ($78) in a matching Starch Blue color scheme. Additionally, he will wear the Built to Move Boxer ($38).

The American tennis star will customize his accessories (headband, sweatbands, socks) with either Starch Blue or Lavender Lux and White. Off the court, Tiafoe will wear the 2-in-1 Transformable Mesh Jacket and Mesh-Paneled Pant in Stoney/Tru Tangerine.

In addition to stealing the spotlight on the court, lululemon is bringing an immersive activation to the tournament, designed to celebrate athletes and engage tennis fans like never before. 

The festivities kicked off on Wednesday night and will continue throughout the tournament. Lululemon's Indian Wells Activation Highlights, on and off the court: 

BIG Stunt Activation:

A large-scale installation steps from the tournament grounds, featuring larger-than-life tennis props, immersive photo ops, and exclusive giveaways. 

BIG FOE Vending Machines:

Custom, oversized vending machines at the Palm Desert lululemon store and near the tournament entrance are dispensing limited-edition BIG FOE headbands to fans who verify their lululemon membership. 

Additionally, fans caught wearing the gear during the tournament have a chance to receive a lululemon gift card to redeem at the local store.

Billboards and Digital Takeover:

Fans can catch the billboards along I-10 and inside Palm Springs airport, spotlighting Tiafoe. 

Palm Desert Store Takeover:

A complete transformation of the lululemon Palm Desert store with exclusive tennis products, athlete-inspired displays, and interactive moments for guests.

People from Afghanistan and Pakistan might not be able to enter the United States from as early as next week as US President Donald Trump mulls a new new travel ban proposed, sources familiar with the matter said.

The ban is based on a review of the security and vetting risks of certain countries, the sources, who requested anonymity, said. Other countries may also be included, though the specifics remain unclear, according to three sources, who requested anonymity, cited in a Reuters report.

Other countries may also be included, though the specifics remain unclear, the report said.

The proposed ban could result in massive consequences for tens of thousands of Afghans who have been cleared to resettle in the US under refugee or Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs). These Afghans are at risk of Taliban retribution for assisting US efforts during the two-decade-long war in Afghanistan.

In January, Donald Trump issued an executive order mandating a review of foreign nationals seeking US entry, with the goal of identifying national security threats through intensified vetting. This order directed several government agencies to submit recommendations for a list of countries whose travel should be restricted due to inadequate screening by March 21, the Reuters report mentioned.

This new travel ban is part of Donald Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, which he first announced in October 2023. During that speech, he vowed to restrict immigration from countries like Gaza, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, as well as others deemed security threats.

Afghanistan and Pakistan are both expected to be on the list of countries subject to full travel bans, the sources cited in the report confirmed. The US departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which are overseeing the review, have not responded to requests for comment.

One source said out that Afghans cleared for resettlement undergo intense screening, making them ""more highly vetted than any population"" globally. Despite this, the State Department's office overseeing Afghan relocation efforts is seeking an exemption for SIV holders from the new ban, though approval is not guaranteed.

The department has also been tasked with preparing for the closure of the Afghan relocation office by April, as previously reported by Reuters.

Since the Taliban's takeover of Kabul in August 2021, following the US military withdrawal, the insurgency by ISIS's regional branch has further destabilised Afghanistan while Pakistan also faces its own security challenges due to violent Islamist militants.

Shawn VanDiver, head of #AfghanEvac, a coalition assisting in the resettlement of Afghans, urged those holding valid US visas to travel as soon as possible. 

""While no official announcement has been made, multiple sources within the U.S. government suggest a new travel restriction could be implemented within the next week,"" Reuters quoted VanDiver as saying.

Currently, around 2,00,000 Afghans are either approved for resettlement or have pending refugee or SIV applications. Many remain stranded in Afghanistan and other countries, including about 20,000 in Pakistan, following Donald Trump’s January order that froze refugee admissions and foreign aid funding for their flights.

US President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress this week and highlighted multiple examples of ""appalling waste"" funded by American taxpayers by the administration led by his predecessor, Joe Biden. 

During the 99-minute address on Tuesday, he claimed that the billionaire Elon Musk's government cost-cutting team, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has identified that the Biden administration spent $8 million on ""making mice transgender"".

""This is real,"" he said to laughter from his fellow Republicans.

Critics, however, challenged his claim and said the funding was meant for health studies that involved transgenic mice, not transgender mice, receiving treatments. Studies were conducted to figure out how these treatments might affect the health of humans who take them.

Transgenic mice are genetically modified mice that have had foreign DNA introduced into their genome, a process that is typically done to study the function of specific genes, model human diseases, or test potential treatments. 

The White House, however, later claimed that under the Biden administration, the National Institutes of Health spent millions of dollars to perform ""transgender experiments on mice"".

Citing examples that these studies exceeded $8.2 million, the White House said that $455,000 was spent on a study to test differences in the ways an HIV vaccine worked in mice that had received cross-sex hormone therapy.

It also said the National Cancer Institute awarded $299,940 to a project to compare breast cancer rates among female mice and those receiving testosterone therapy.

The White House said that $3.1 million was spent to investigate how hormones influence asthma outcomes, $2.5 million to examine the reproductive consequences of steroid hormone administration, $1.2 million to analyze androgen effects on the reproductive neuroendocrine axis and $735,113 for a study on how gender-affirming hormone therapy affects the microbiome in mice.

These projects, however, didn't involve physically transitioning mice from one gender to another and were aimed at figuring out the effects of hormones on disease, reproductive health, and immune responses.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The world's biggest YouTube star, MrBeast, had jumped in to sample Formula E's GEN3 Evo car at the Evo Sessions event on Thursday at the Miami International Autodrome, but crashed into the barriers on just his second lap.

The 26-year-old YouTuber - the most watched on the planet, with some 370 million followers - is at the Miami International Autodrome with Formula E this week, as Formula E hosts some of the world's most followed stars at its Evo Sessions event.

MrBeast - real name James 'Jimmy' Donaldson - set off for his first outing in the GEN3 Evo race car behind the Porsche Taycan Safety Car to get a feel for the Miami circuit and the world's fastest accelerating single-seater - capable of outdragging an F1 car to 60mph by some 30 percent, in a time of just 1.82 seconds.

Lap one went smoothly, but Mr Beast found himself spinning and in the wall through the first corners of his second lap. He wasn't hurt in the shunt, and was able to jump out of the car unaided when the medical car arrived on the scene.

Damage to the CUPRA KIRO GEN3 Evo race car - usually driven by German David Beckmann - looked to be limited but the session was halted for the car to be recovered to the pits.

MrBeast's initial outing was effectively guided tour of the track, as had been the case with the other personalities' opening efforts in Miami this week. Following the Safety Car meant the pace was limited so he could get used to the car and his surroundings but even so, its capabilities proved a little too hot to handle as out of a left hander in Sector 1, he span into a full 360, before clipping the wall with the left side of the car.

The team watched on, with driver Dan Ticktum cracking a smile after a little wince. Both the team and MrBeast joked and laughed about the shunt once he made it back to the garage with a sheepish ""I did the thing..."" as a nod to his foul up.

Evo Sessions is a motorsport-first that gives 11 personalities from the worlds of sport, tech and entertainment the unprecedented opportunity to get behind the wheel of the world’s fastest electric race car - the GEN3 Evo - and understand what it takes to reach the pinnacle of motorsport.

The armed wing of Hamas said on Thursday it remained committed to its fragile ceasefire with Israel, after Donald Trump told the people of Gaza they would be ""DEAD"" if hostages held there are not freed.The first phase of the six-week-old truce expired at the weekend and talks on the deal's future have hit an impasse.

Hamas said Trump's threats would encourage Israel to ignore the deal, which largely halted more than 15 months of war in Gaza between Israel and Palestinian militants.

Trump had earlier floated a widely condemned plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, prompting Arab leaders who met in Cairo this week to support an alternative.

A United States envoy praised Egypt on Thursday for coming up with the new plan, but did not endorse details of the proposed alternative.

Trump's warning followed his administration's revelation that it held unprecedented direct talks with Hamas -- listed as a ""terrorist"" group by Washington -- focused on American hostages in Gaza.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed Israel was consulted and said it had ""expressed its opinion"" on the talks.

""Despite all the enemy's attempts at evasion, lies and deception... we preferred and still prefer to adhere to the agreement in order to spare the blood of our people,"" Abu Obaida, spokesman for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said in a video statement.

On Wednesday, Trump issued what he called a ""last warning!"" to Hamas leaders, telling the movement to immediately release all hostages ""or it is OVER for you"".

Israel killed Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar as well as the movement's military leader Mohammed Deif during the war in Gaza that began with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.

Trump also warned of repercussions for Gaza as a whole, where virtually the entire population has been displaced by Israel's military campaign in response to Hamas's attack.

""To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!""

Hamas's attack resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, most of them civilians, while Israel's military retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 48,446 people, also mostly civilians, figures from the two sides show.

Leaning on a cane outside a makeshift shelter in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, Mohammed Salim dismissed Trump's talk of turning the territory into hell.

""It has already become one,"" he said. ""We have been devastated, our homes reduced to rubble, our sons, fathers and elders lost. There is nothing left to mourn.""

- Israelis 'worried' -

Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim said Trump's words were pushing Israel to disregard the terms of the ceasefire in place since January 19, after more than 15 months of war.

""These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation to avoid implementing its terms,"" Qasim said, urging the United States to pressure Israel to enter the ceasefire's second phase, which is envisioned as leading to a lasting truce.

Analysts said the US-Hamas direct talks are a sign of dysfunction in talks to prolong the truce.

James Dorsey, an honorary fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute, said the direct talks would give Hamas ""a sense of having been legitimised strongly"".

The Israelis are in turn ""obviously worried"" by the outreach, he said.

The first phase -- negotiated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt -- brought a period of relative calm during which Israeli hostages were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and humanitarian assistance flowed into Gaza.

Israel, which on Sunday halted the aid flow, wants to extend the initial phase until mid-April.

- 'Good-faith' -

The US-Hamas talks were first reported by media outlet Axios, which said Washington's hostage envoy Adam Boehler met with Hamas in Qatar about the US captives but also about a longer-term truce.

Washington had refused direct contact with Hamas since designating it a terrorist organisation in 1997.

Of the 251 captives taken during Hamas's attack, 58 remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military has said are dead.

Five Americans are believed to remain among the hostages -- four have been confirmed dead and one, Edan Alexander, is believed to be alive.

The White House said Trump met with eight of the freed captives, who ""expressed gratitude"" for his efforts to bring them home.

""Hamas' actions have inflicted immense suffering, AND THEIR REIGN OF TERROR MUST BE STOPPED,"" the White House posted on X.

Trump previously triggered global outrage by suggesting the United States should ""take over"" rubble-strewn Gaza, turn it into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"" and relocate Palestinians to Egypt or Jordan.

Arab leaders this week endorsed an alternative plan that would finance Gaza's reconstruction through a trust fund, and would see the return of the Palestinian Authority to the territory.

The PA currently has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and is dominated by Hamas rivals Fatah.

""We need more discussion about it, but it's a good-faith first step from the Egyptians,"" Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy, told reporters in Washington.

The State Department, however, said Egypt's plan ""does not meet the expectations.""

Stock markets tumbled after Trump's duties of up to 25 percent took effect Tuesday

US President Donald Trump on Thursday delayed some tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico -- leading Ottawa to halt an upcoming wave of countermeasures -- in moves that bring reprieve to companies and consumers after blowback on financial markets.

Stock markets tumbled after Trump's duties of up to 25 percent took effect Tuesday, as economists warned that blanket levies could weigh on US growth and raise inflation.

But Trump signed orders Thursday to delay the fresh tariffs for Canadian and Mexican imports covered by a North American trade agreement, though he dismissed suggestions that his decisions were linked to market turmoil.

The halt -- which will last until April 2 -- offers relief to automakers.

In the auto sector, parts cross North American borders multiple times during production.

Following talks with the ""Big Three"" US automakers -- Stellantis, Ford and General Motors -- Washington initially announced a one-month exemption on autos coming through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

A White House official told reporters that about 62 percent of Canadian imports will still face the new tariffs, although much of these are energy products hit by a lower rate of 10 percent.

About half of Mexican imports come through the USMCA.

The latest moves make conditions ""much more favorable for our American car manufacturers,"" Trump said Thursday.

Shortly after Trump's decision, Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc wrote on X that his country ""will not proceed with the second wave of tariffs on $125B of US products until April 2nd, while we continue to work for the removal of all tariffs.""

Trump said Thursday that more tariffs would come on April 2, adding they will be ""reciprocal in nature."" He had earlier vowed reciprocal levies to remedy practices Washington deems unfair.

At that point, Canadian and Mexican goods could still face levies.

The US president also said he would not modify broad tariffs for steel and aluminum imports, which are due to take effect next week.

US stock markets slumped again Thursday despite Trump's partial tariff delay.

Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office that he had a ""very good conversation"" with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.

He claimed ""tremendous progress"" on both illegal immigration and drugs coming into the United States -- both reasons that Washington cited in imposing levies on Mexico, Canada and China.

His remarks stood in sharp contrast to simmering tensions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Trudeau said Thursday that Ottawa will remain in a trade war with Washington for ""the foreseeable future"" even if there are ""breaks for certain sectors.""

""Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,"" Trudeau added.

Canada contributes less than one percent of fentanyl to the illicit US supply, according to Canadian and US government data.

China, meanwhile, has pushed back on US allegations of its role in the fentanyl supply chain, calling this a domestic issue that tariffs will not resolve.

For Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, Trump's easing of tariffs was ""a recognition of economic reality.""

The move was an acknowledgment that tariffs disrupt supply chains, that the burden of levies fall to Americans, and ""that the market doesn't like them and certainly doesn't like the uncertainty surrounding them,"" Lincicome told AFP.

Since taking office for his second term in January, Trump has made tariff threats on allies and adversaries alike.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday that he was not concerned Trump's tariffs would be inflationary, adding that any impact on prices would likely be temporary.

He told the Economic Club of New York that ""access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American Dream,"" saying this was instead rooted in the idea that citizens can achieve upward mobility and economic security.

Trump has referred to tariffs as a source of US government revenue and a way to remedy trade imbalances.

The US trade deficit surged to a new record in January, ballooning 34 percent to $131.4 billion as imports rose.

Analysts say the deficit was likely bolstered by gold imports, but that data suggests businesses were also trying to get ahead of tariffs.

Starship had successfully blasted off from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Texas

Elon Musk's SpaceX on Thursday once again lost the upper stage of its massive Starship rocket in a fiery explosion, even as the booster was successfully caught in its latest orbital test -- a near replay of the previous attempt.

Minutes after liftoff and booster separation, a live video feed showed the upper stage tumbling uncontrollably before the signal abruptly cut out. 

Dramatic footage circulating online captured red-hot debris raining down over the Bahamas.

""Can confirm we did lose contact with the ship. Unfortunately, this happened last time, too,"" SpaceX spokesman Dan Huot said, referring to January's flight, which also ended with the upper stage disintegrating over the Caribbean.

The fallout was felt immediately in US airspace. 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) briefly activated a ""debris response area,"" delaying flights from airports stretching from Newark and Philadelphia to Miami. 

The agency confirmed SpaceX will be required to conduct a mishap investigation before it can fly again.

Despite the setback, SpaceX's ""fail fast, learn fast"" approach has helped it become the world's dominant launch services provider. 

But Musk's status as one of President Donald Trump's closest advisors and his influence over federal regulators are raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

Starship -- the world's largest and most powerful rocket -- lifted off from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, shortly after 5:30 pm (2330 GMT). 

It marked its eighth uncrewed orbital test, after earlier launch attempts were scrubbed on Monday and Wednesday.

While the upper stage was lost for a second consecutive flight, SpaceX successfully recovered the Super Heavy booster, catching it with the launch tower's mechanical ""chopstick"" arms for the third time -- an impressive feat of engineering.

About 40 minutes after launch, SpaceX ended its livestream without providing further details.

Standing 403 feet (123 meters) tall -- about 100 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty -- Starship is designed to eventually be fully reusable and is key to Musk's long-term vision of colonizing Mars.

NASA is also awaiting a modified version of Starship as a lunar lander for its Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon this decade. 

But before SpaceX can carry out those missions, it must prove the vehicle is reliable, safe for crew, and capable of complex in-orbit refueling -- critical for deep space missions.

The FAA previously grounded Starship after its January 16 flight ended in an upper-stage explosion. 

Last Friday, the agency allowed SpaceX to proceed with this latest test before finalizing its investigation into that mishap.

During Joe Biden's presidency, Musk frequently clashed with the FAA, accusing it of over-regulating SpaceX over safety and environmental concerns.

Now, as Trump's chief advisor on cost-cutting initiatives, Musk faces scrutiny over his influence on federal agencies overseeing his companies.

According to Bloomberg News, a SpaceX engineer recently visited FAA headquarters, warning employees their jobs were at risk if they did not begin work on a program to deploy thousands of the company's Starlink satellite terminals in support of the national airspace system.

Telecom giant Verizon currently holds a contract to upgrade the FAA's infrastructure, but that deal could be in jeopardy, Bloomberg reported. SpaceX has denied the allegations, stating ""recent media reports about SpaceX and the FAA are false.""

How It Impacts Indians,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/h-1b-visa-why-us-has-warned-employers-to-hire-americans-over-migrant-workers-how-it-impacts-indians-7862390,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 11:43:28 GMT","

The Trump administration's efforts to challenge what it deems as illegal hiring preferences for foreign workers, particularly in the H-1B visa program, has caused apprehension among the immigrant community. At the heart of this controversy lies the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) investigation into the matter, aimed at safeguarding jobs for US workers.

In a stern warning issued on February 19, 2025, businesses were cautioned against prioritising foreign workers over American candidates, with EEOC's acting chair, Andrea Lucas, highlighting the pervasive nature of national origin discrimination in hiring across multiple industries, according to a Business Standard report.

""Unlawful bias against American workers, in violation of Title VII, is a large-scale problem in multiple industries nationwide,"" said Lucas. ""Many employers have policies and practices preferring illegal aliens, migrant workers, and visa holders or other legal immigrants over American workers-in direct violation of federal employment law. Cracking down on this type of unlawful discrimination will shift employer incentives, decreasing demand for illegal alien workers and decreasing abuse of the United States' legal immigration system.""

Lucas added, ""The EEOC is putting employers and other covered entities on notice: if you are part of the pipeline contributing to our immigration crisis or abusing our legal immigration system via illegal preferences against American workers, you must stop. The law applies to you, and you are not above the law. The EEOC is here to protect all workers from unlawful national origin discrimination, including American workers.""

The H-1B visa program, which enables US companies to hire foreign professionals in fields requiring a degree, such as technology, engineering and medical sciences, has come under scrutiny. Critics argue that this program displaces American workers, with some employers allegedly favouring foreign workers due to lower labour costs that get achieved through illegal payments, perceived stronger work ethic, customer preferences or the mindset that foreign workers are easier to exploit because they have limited knowledge of labour rights.

A notable example is the lawsuit against Meta Platforms, which alleges the company systematically preferred visa holders over American candidates to cut costs.

Both the Trump and Biden administrations have introduced measures to tighten regulations around the H-1B system, increasing scrutiny of employers and adjusting wage requirements. However, experts warn that such changes could have far-reaching consequences for Indian professionals, who received 72.3% of all H-1B visas issued between October 2022 and September 2023.

Jidesh Kumar, managing partner at King Stubb & Kasiva, a corporate law firm, emphasises the US economy's reliance on H-1B visas to address skilled labour shortages, particularly in technology, engineering, and healthcare, according to the report. He cautions that tightening the program could drive global talent to other destinations such as Canada or the UK, potentially undermining the US's position as a leader in innovation and economic growth. ""Tech giants and startups alike depend on H-1B professionals for cutting-edge research and product development. Many also go on to become entrepreneurs, creating jobs and boosting the economy"", he added.

Ten Indian construction workers were rescued from Palestine's West Bank village, a month after they were stripped of their passports, local media reported.

News agency PTI quoted reports which claimed that the workers were lured to the West Bank village of al-Zaayem for work. They had originally come to Israel to work in the construction industry.

News portal Ynetnews reported that Israeli forces intercepted some suspects at a checkpoint which led to the recovery of the Indian workers. The Palestinians allegedly used the Indian passports to easily cross checkpoints into Israel.

In an overnight operation led by the Population and Immigration authority together with the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and the Justice Ministry, the workers were rescued and transferred to a safe location where they will stay till their employment status is determined.

The Indian Embassy in Israel said that the matter is under investigation. It added that it has urged Israeli authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of the workers.

Some 16,000 workers from India are said to have come to Israel to work in the construction industry in the last one year after tens of thousands of Palestinian construction workers were barred from entering Israel after Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

 US appeals court says church lacked standing to sue 

 * 

 Seattle-area church says religious rights were violated

 Lawyer representing church calls decision 'shocking' 

 By Jonathan Stempel 

 March 6 - A divided U.S. appeals court on Thursday rejected a suburban Seattle church's bid to void a Washington state law requiring insurers that offer maternity coverage in employee health plans to also cover abortions. 

 In a 2-1 decision, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Cedar Park Assembly of God of Kirkland lacked the necessary standing to challenge the state's Reproductive Parity Act because some insurers still offer group plans that exclude coverage for abortion services. 

 The Pentecostal church argued that the 2018 law violated its right to the free exercise of religion under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. 

 It sued in 2019 when healthcare company Kaiser Permanente began requiring abortion coverage in its group plan, which the church said it still holds because it could not find an affordable replacement. 

 The church's appeal to the 9th Circuit drew support from dozens of conservative entities, including 18 U.S. states led by South Carolina. 

 Circuit Judge Susan Graber wrote for Thursday's majority that Washington's conscientious objection statute, which excuses payment for coverage of services ""for reason of conscience or religion,"" exempted the church from the Parity Act. Graber said that law had no bearing on the church's ability to find plans, or plans it could afford, that excluded abortion coverage. 

 Graber also rejected as speculative the church's claims that it faced harm because insurers might raise premiums to cover abortion services, or its employees might use those services despite its objections. 

 Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan dissented, saying the church faced a ""Catch-22"" between choosing a health plan that covers abortions, violating its free exercise rights or canceling its health plan, violating federal and state law. 

 ""The majority's ruling is shocking,"" said Rory Gray, senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented the church. ""We'll be considering our legal options to keep this important case going because no church should be forced to fund abortions."" 

 The office of Washington Attorney General Nick Brown appreciated the court's ""thoughtful consideration,"" a spokesperson said. 

 Cedar Park Assembly of God is located in Bothell, Washington, about six miles north of Kirkland. 

 A lower court judge in Seattle had in July 2023 dismissed the case, rejecting the church's First Amendment challenge. Thursday's decision did not reach the constitutional question, but ordered a dismissal for lack of standing. 

 Graber and the other member of Thursday's majority, Circuit Judge Lucy Koh, are appointees of Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Joe Biden, respectively. Callahan was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush. 

 The case is Cedar Park Assembly of God of Kirkland, Washington v Kreidler, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 23-35560 and 23-35585.

 China's foreign minister on Friday vowed Beijing would ""firmly counter"" US pressure, after Donald Trump heaped tariffs on Chinese goods and torched off a trade war between the world's two largest economies. 

 Speaking at a press conference on the sidelines of a key political meeting, Wang Yi warned the ""law of the jungle"" could take hold in the world if nations were to pursue purely their own interests. 

 Touting Beijing's cooperation in the fight against the fentanyl epidemic in the United States, Wang said Washington should not ""repay kindness with resentment, let alone impose tariffs without reason"". 

 ""There are around 190 countries in the world,"" Wang said. 

 ""Imagine if every country emphasised their own priority and believed in strength and status, the world would fall back into the law of the jungle,"" he added. 

 Washington's current policy, Wang said, was ""not how a responsible major country behaves"". 

 ""China-US economic and trade ties are mutual,"" the veteran diplomat said. 

 ""If you choose to cooperate, you can achieve mutually beneficial and win-win results. If you use only pressure, China will firmly counter,"" he added. 

 Wang also called for negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, warning ""conflict has no winners, and peace has no losers"". 

 ""China welcomes and supports all efforts dedicated to peace,"" he stressed. 

 And he urged all parties to seek a ""comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza and increase humanitarian assistance"". 

 The Chinese top diplomat was speaking on the sidelines of the ""Two Sessions"" political meetings in Beijing, so far clouded by a new administration in the United States that is overturning the international order. 

 Beijing has vowed to fight a trade war with the United States ""to the end"" as tariffs from Washington buffeted the global economy and threatened to hit Beijing's lagging growth. 

 The country's leaders set an ambitious annual growth target of around five percent this week, vowing to make domestic demand its main economic driver as the escalating trade confrontation with the United States hit exports. 

 US President Donald Trump imposed more blanket tariffs on Chinese imports this week, following a similar move last month levies expected to hit hundreds of billions of dollars in total trade between the world's two largest economies.

The United States offered a $10-million reward on Thursday for information leading to the arrest of a Canadian former Olympic snowboarder wanted on drug and murder charges.

Ryan Wedding, 43, who is believed to be in Mexico or another Latin American country, was also placed on the FBI's list of the ""Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.""

""Wedding went from shredding powder on the slopes at the Olympics to distributing powder cocaine on the streets of US cities and in his native Canada,"" said Akil Davis, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles field office.

""The alleged murders of his competitors make Wedding a very dangerous man,"" Davis said.

Wedding, whose aliases include ""El Jefe,"" ""Giant"" and ""Public Enemy,"" may possibly be living under the protection of the Sinaloa drug cartel, Davis said at a press conference.

Acting US Attorney Joseph McNally said Wedding had allegedly shipped hundreds of millions of dollars of cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the United States and Canada.

Alan Hamilton, chief of detectives for the Los Angeles Police Department, said Wedding used the southern California city as the hub for the drug smuggling operation.

""An estimated 60 metric tons of cocaine per year and five metric tons of fentanyl per month moved through Los Angeles on its way to US and Canadian cities,"" Hamilton said.

Wedding, who competed for Canada in snowboarding at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, finishing 24th in the parallel giant slalom, is one of 16 defendants facing US charges for their roles in the drug operation.

""The organization is violent, responsible for deaths as part of its criminal operations,"" McNally said.

These include the November 2023 murders of two members of a family in Ontario, Canada, in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment and a May 2024 murder in Niagara Falls, Ontario, over a drug debt.

The State Department is offering a $10-million reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Wedding.

Wedding's second-in-command, fellow Canadian Andrew Clark, 34, known as ""El Dictador,"" was among 29 alleged or convicted narcotics traffickers extradited to the United States from Mexico last week.

US President Donald Trump said Thursday he planned to visit Saudi Arabia, suggesting a deal for major investment from the kingdom that has become the key venue for US diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine.

Trump, asked if he would meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia, confirmed his intention to visit the oil-rich Gulf nation but suggested that business was the main motive. 

""I'm going to Saudi Arabia,"" Trump told reporters, without mentioning a date.

""I said, I'll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies, (spreading) the purchase over a four-year period, of a trillion dollars,"" he said, referring to the duration of his presidency.

""They've agreed to do that, so I'm going to be going there.""

Trump, who has yet to travel overseas since returning to the White House, made Saudi Arabia his first foreign destination after he took office in 2017.

He said recently that he decided to visit Saudi Arabia rather than Britain on his first trip in 2017 because the Arab kingdom promised to buy $450 billion worth of US products.

Trump has forged close business ties with Saudi Arabia, with the Trump Organization in December announcing a Trump Tower in Jeddah.

In his last term, Trump boasted of shielding Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from consequences over the killing of US-based Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, with the president citing the importance of Saudi purchases of US weapons.

Former president Joe Biden initially vowed to make the crown prince a ""pariah"" due to human rights but his administration later courted Saudi Arabia, including with a draft defense agreement, as it sought to encourage it to recognize Israel.

The Trump administration has vowed to move full-speed with trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to normalize with Israel, in what would be a landmark step as the kingdom is home to Islam's two holiest sites.

 By Ryan Woo, Ethan Wang and Laurie Chen 

 BEIJING -China said on Friday it will ""resolutely counter"" pressure from the United States on the fentanyl issue and presented itself as a stable global power amid geopolitical turmoil, in an appeal to Global South countries. 

 Washington levied an additional 10% tariffs on Chinese imports this week over the continued flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the country, threatening to worsen an escalatory spiral of trade actions against China and other countries including Canada and Mexico. 

 ""The abuse of fentanyl is an issue that the U.S. has to solve itself,"" Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a briefing on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary meeting. 

 ""If one side blindly exerts pressure, China will resolutely counter that,"" he said, adding that both countries still have ""broad common interests and space for cooperation"". 

 ""No country can imagine that it can suppress China on one hand while developing good relations with China on the other hand,"" Wang added. 

 He said that the U.S. ""should not repay kindness with grievances, let alone impose tariffs without reason,"" referring to the ""various assistance"" Beijing has provided Washington over the years on the fentanyl issue. 

 Wang was also bullish U.S.-China tech competition, saying that ""where there is a blockade, there is a breakthrough, and where there is suppression, there is innovation."" 

 On resolving the Ukraine war, China wants to achieve a ""fair, lasting and binding peace agreement"" acceptable to all parties, Wang Yi said. 

 ""China is willing to continue to play a constructive role in the final resolution of the crisis and the realization of lasting peace, in accordance with the wishes of the parties concerned, together with the international community."" 

 Western countries have urged Beijing to take a more active role in using its economic leverage over Russia to stop the war, but Beijing has so far refused to publicly criticise its strategic partner. 

 In one of the first answers of the press conference, Wang said China-Russia relations are a ""constant in a turbulent world, not a variable in geopolitical games"". 

 Chinese President Xi Jinping recently reaffirmed Beijing's ""no limits"" partnership with Moscow in a telephone call with his Russian counterpart on the third anniversary of Moscow's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 

 U.S. President Donald Trump's administration recently began talks with Russia after virtually no contact since the war began, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Washington wished to ""peel off"" Moscow from Beijing. 

 GLOBAL SOUTH 

 Wang Yi also urged developing countries to ""continue to improve our representation and discourse power in global governance"", while facing pressure from the U.S. 

 ""If every country emphasizes its own national priority and believes in strength and status, the world will regress to the law of the jungle, small and weak countries will bear the brunt, and the international rules and order will be severely impacted,"" said Wang in a veiled reference to Washington's actions. 

 ""Major powers should assume international obligations and fulfill their responsibilities as major powers. They should not be profit-driven, and they should not bully the weak."" 

 Within the first two months of taking office, President Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from several multilateral organisations and climate agreements, suspended most foreign aid, and voted against a United Nations resolution condemning Russia for the Ukraine invasion.

The Royal Family are reportedly planning to strip Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of their Sussex titles if they do not stop making damaging claims against the monarchy.

Just a year after she and Harry quit royal duties, Meghan publicly bashed the royal institution in a sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021. She even noted how they faced racism in the Royal spectrum.

Then, Spare, Prince Harry's tell-all memoir, hit the shelves in January 2023. The book detailed his conflicts with senior royals, including his father, King Charles III, and his brother, Prince William.

Although stripping the couple of their Sussex titles would require an Act of Parliament, sources suggest it remains an option should further controversial claims be made through interviews, books, or media projects. Daily Mail reported that discussions about this possible course of action have taken place within royal circles.

Meanwhile, Meghan has made a point of emphasizing the significance of her Sussex title, during a recent exchange in her new Netflix series, where she spoke with American actress Mindy Kaling.

“It’s so funny you keep saying Meghan Markle. You know I’m ‘Sussex’ now,” Meghan corrected Kaling during their conversation.

She then elaborated, “I didn’t know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go, ‘This is our family name. Our little family name.’”

“Well, now I know, and I love it,” Mindy replied.

“It’s our shared name as a family, and I guess I hadn’t recognised how meaningful that would be to me until we had children,” she told People Magazine. “I love that that is something that Archie, Lili, H, and I all have together. It means a lot to me.”

A deadly missile strike hit a hotel in the hometown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy overnight, killing four people and injuring dozens.

Ukraine reports more than 100 drone strikes and two missiles were launched by Russia, following a similar attack a day earlier. One of the missiles hit a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine. 

Scripps News sources in Ukraine said they received a missile alert ahead of the hotel strike. But international aid workers staying at the hotel said they had just 20 seconds of warning.

Zelenskyy didn't say whether any international aid workers were among the dead. It marks the second time in five months the hotel has been targeted by Russian strikes.

This comes as Zelenskyy is in Brussels, meeting with European officials after the U.S. suspended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The U.K. has said it will increase its intelligence sharing to help make up for the U.S. withdrawal.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared that occupied Ukrainian territories, including Crimea, are officially part of Russia and the Kremlin wants full control of those areas. The Russian foreign minister says the current front lines are unacceptable to Russia.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, a day before meeting with executives from the cryptocurrency industry at the White House.

The reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, the White House crypto czar, billionaire David Sacks, said in a post on social media platform X.

Attendees at Friday's White House crypto summit expect the event to serve as a stage for Trump to formally announce his plans to build a strategic reserve containing bitcoin and four other cryptocurrencies.

Earlier this week, Trump announced the names of five digital assets he expects to include in this reserve, spiking the market value of each. The five are bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano, the president said.

It is not clear how such a reserve would work or how it would benefit taxpayers.

Trump's moves to support the crypto industry, which spent millions backing him and other Republicans in the November elections, have drawn concern from some conservatives and crypto backers over giveaways to an already wealthy community and delegitimizing the digital currency industry.

Proponents argue that a reserve would help taxpayers benefit from crypto's price growth.

The president's support for the crypto industry has also sparked conflict-of-interest concerns. Trump's family has launched cryptocurrency meme coins, and the president also holds a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform.

His aides have said Trump has handed over control of his business ventures, which are being reviewed by outside ethics lawyers.

 A major Israeli offensive which over several weeks has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians and ravaged refugee camps increasingly appears to be aligned with the ""vision of annexation"" of the West Bank, a UN official told AFP. 

 Israeli forces carry out regular raids targeting militants in the West Bank, occupied since 1967, but the ongoing operation since late January is already the longest in two decades, with dire effects on Palestinians. 

 ""There are growing concerns that the reality being created on the ground aligns with the vision of annexation of the West Bank,"" said Roland Friedrich, director of West Bank affairs for UNRWA, the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees. 

 ""It's an unprecedented situation, both from a humanitarian and wider political perspective,"" he said. 

 ""We talk about 40,000 people that have been forcibly displaced from their homes"" in the northern West Bank, mainly from three refugee camps where the operation had begun, said Friedrich. 

 ""These camps are now largely empty,"" their residents unable to return and struggling to find shelter elsewhere, he said. 

 Inside the camps, the level of destruction to ""electricity, sewage and water, but also private houses"" was ""very concerning"", Friedrich added. 

 The Israeli operation, which the military says targets militants in the northern West Bank, was launched shortly after a truce took hold in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, a separate Palestinian territory. 

 The operation initially focused on Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams refugee camps, where UNRWA operates, but has since expanded to more areas of the West Bank's north.

 Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz has said troops would remain for many months in the evacuated camps to ""prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism"". 

 And Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right politician who lives in one of dozens of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, has said that Israel would be ""applying sovereignty"" over parts of the territory in 2025. 

 According to Friedrich, ""the statements we are hearing indicate that this is a political operation. It is clearly being said that people will not be allowed to return."" 

 Last year the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion saying that Israel's prolonged presence in the West Bank was unlawful. 

 Away from home, the displaced Palestinian residents also grapple with a worsening financial burden. 

 ""There is an increasing demand now, especially in Jenin, for public shelter, because people can't pay these amounts for rent anymore,"" said Friedrich. 

 ""Everyone wants to go back to the camps."" 

 The UN official provided examples he said pointed to plans for long-term Israeli presence inside Palestinian cities, which should be under the control of the Palestinian Authority . 

 ""In Tulkarem you have more and more reports about the army just walking around... asking shop owners to keep the shops open, going out and issuing traffic tickets to cars, so almost as if there is no Palestinian Authority,"" said Friedrich. 

 ""It is very worrying, including for the future of the PA as such and the investments made by the international community into building Palestinian institutions."" 

 The Ramallah-based PA was created in the 1990s as a temporary government that would pave the way to a future sovereign state.

 UNRWA is the main humanitarian agency for Palestinians, but a recent law bars the agency from working with the Israeli authorities, hindering its badly needed operations. 

 ""It's much more complicated for us now because we can't speak directly to the military anymore,"" said Friedrich. 

 ""But at the same time, we continue to do our work,"" he said, assessing needs and coordinating ""the actual emergency response on the ground"". 

 Israeli lawmakers had passed the legislation against UNRWA's work over accusations that it had provided cover for Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip claims the UN and many donor governments dispute. 

 The prolonged Israeli operation could have long-term consequences for residents, particularly children traumatised by the experience of displacement, Friedrich warned. 

 ""If people can't go back to the camp and we can't reopen the schools... clearly, that will lead to more radicalisation going forward."" 

 He said the situation could compound a legitimacy crisis for the PA, often criticised by militant Palestinian factions for coordinating security matters with Israel. 

 Displaced Palestinians ""feel that they are kicked out of their homes and that nobody is supporting them"", said Friedrich. 

 A ""stronger international response"" was needed, he added, ""both to provide humanitarian aid on the ground, and secondly, to ensure that the situation in the West Bank doesn't spin out of control"".

 Sixteen British climate activists jailed for their high-profile protests will find out Friday if they have won an appeal against their heavy sentences. 

 Lawyer Danny Friedman told London's Court of Appeal in January that the prison terms of between 15 months to five years for separate protests were ""the highest of their kind in modern British history"". 

 The activists ""did what they did out of sacrifice"" and were acting in the ""best interests of the public, the planet and future generations,"" he said, asking for the jail terms to be reduced. 

 Prosecutors argued the sentences had been merited as ""all of these applicants went so far beyond what was reasonable"". 

 Their actions also presented an ""extreme danger"" to the public and to themselves, they said. 

 Lady Chief Justice Sue Carr is to hand down the ruling at the Court of Appeal in London at 1000 GMT on Friday, in a case which could have far-reaching implications for future protests. 

 The hearing is being closely watched amid fears that peaceful protest risks being stifled in Britain. 

 Activist groups Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion have launched high profile protests in recent years to fight the use of fossil fuels, which scientists say are causing global warming and climate change.  - Tomato soup, orange powder - 

 Just Stop Oil, which is urging the government to ban fossil fuel use by 2030, is known for its eye-catching stunts at museums, sports events and shows but has attracted criticism over its methods. 

 The 16 activists, including some who threw tomato soup on Vincent van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" painting at London's National Gallery, are seeking to reduce or quash lengthy jail terms. 

 Environmental NGOs Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have joined what they call ""a critically important legal appeal over the right to protest"". 

 Other cases are still before the courts, including charges brought against two Just Stop Oil members accused of throwing orange paint powder over the stone megaliths of Stonehenge as well as two activists charged with spray-painting the tomb of naturalist Charles Darwin in Westminister Abbey. 

 The activists' stunts have drawn condemnation from politicians and police and sparked a backlash among some sections of the public. 

 In July, five of the 16 activists who brought the appeal were stunned after being sentenced to between four and five years in prison for planning to block the M25 motorway around London, a key transport link for the capital. 

 They include Roger Hallam, 58, a co-founder of JSO and Extinction Rebellion. His four co-accused were also jailed. 

 ""The plain fact is that each of you some time ago has crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic,"" judge Christopher Hehir said, during their sentencing. 

 The country's previous Conservative government took a hostile stance towards disruptive direct action, and passed laws toughening punishments for such offences.

 BEIJING — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China will continue to retaliate to the United States’ “arbitrary tariffs” and accused Washington of “meeting good with evil” in a press conference Friday on the sidelines of the country’s annual parliamentary session. 

 Wang said China’s efforts to help the U.S. contain its fentanyl crisis have been met with punitive tariffs, which are straining the ties between the countries. 

 “No country should fantasize that it can suppress China and maintain good relationship with China at the same time,” Wang said. “Such two-faced acts are not good for the stability of bilateral relations or for building mutual trust.” 

 The two countries have been reengaging in tit-for-tat retaliatory tariffs since U.S. President Donald Trump’s return to office in January. The U.S. has imposed flat tariffs of 20% of all Chinese imports, while Beijing has countered with additional 15% duties on U.S. imports including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and expanded controls on doing business with key U.S. companies. 

 Regarding the Trump administration’s policy of safeguarding U.S. interests above international cooperation, Wang said such an approach, if adopted by every country in the world, would result in the “law of the jungle.” 

 “Small and weak countries will get burnt first, and the international order and rules will be under severe shock,” Wang said. “Major countries should undertake their international obligations … and not seek to profit from and bully the weak.”

Taiwan President Lai Ching-te denied that TSMC's investment decision was due to political pressure by the United States


	Taiwan's president and top chipmaker TSMC held a joint news conference Thursday to defend the company's decision to invest $100 billion in the US, saying it stemmed from customer demand and not pressure from the Trump administration.


	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest chipmaker, said earlier this week it would invest $100 billion in three more chip manufacturing plants, along with two packaging facilities in Arizona.


	The decision sparked concerns that Taiwan would gain little in return for moving some of its most advanced manufacturing processes to the US.


	Taiwan President Lai Ching-te denied that TSMC's investment decision was due to political pressure by the United States. US President Donald Trump had previously said that Taiwan had taken away the US chip business and that he wanted it back.


	""TSMC's decision is necessary for its future development. The government did not face pressure from the United States during TSMC's investment process in the US,"" said Lai on Thursday.


	TSMC CEO CC Wei said that he had spoken with the firm's customers and realised that TSMC's current expansion plans in the US were insufficient to meet current demand.


	""Customer demand has been steadily increasing. For TSMC, our investment plans are based on customer needs, and we are very cautious,"" Wei said.


	""The amount of investment in the US may seem large, but it is still not enough to meet demand,"" he added.


	He also said that the development plans in the US would not affect TSMC's plans in Taiwan, and that the company currently had 10,000 employees researching and developing 1.0 nanometer chips.


	While Taiwan is a self-ruled island, Beijing sees Taiwan as a renegade province to be taken back by force if necessary.


	The US does not recognise Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.


	But the continued support of the US appears increasingly fragile under the Trump administration, who has contended that Taiwan relies too much on the US and needs to spend more on defence.


	A Pentagon nominee earlier this week said Taiwan should be spending about 10 per cent of its gross domestic product on defence to deter a war with China.


	Taiwan's Lai last month pledged to increase defence spending to over 3 per cent of its gross domestic product, up from less than 2.5 per cent.

 MELBOURNE, Australia — A 17-year-old boy with a loaded shotgun boarded a plane at an Australian airport before being restrained by a pilot and two passengers, police said Friday. 

 The boy was disarmed and detained before police arrived on the scene Thursday at Avalon Airport in Victoria state. 

 Barry Clark, a passenger who tackled the suspect, said the boy had posed as a maintenance worker and became agitated when questioned by a flight attendant at the plane’s entrance. 

 “I looked up and then within a second I saw the barrel of a shotgun and I thought to myself that ain’t a tool that should be on a plane,” Clark told Network 10 television. 

 “When I saw the complete gun I said: we’re in trouble here,” Clark said. 

 “Then I saw it towards her chest and so I thought, well, I’ve got to do something — this is all happening in a matter of seconds,” Clark added.  Passenger takes on suspect   

 Clark, a former professional boxer and sheep shearer, said he snuck up behind the boy then pushed the gun and the flight attendant away in different directions so that she would not be hit if the gun discharged. 

 “I then proceeded to do what I had to do and just put him in a bit of a lock, got his hand and twisted it and put it up in his back, threw him to the floor and then put my knee in his back and held him in a position where he couldn’t get out,” Clark said. 

 Victoria Police Superintendent Michael Reid told reporters the boy from Ballarat in regional Victoria had climbed through a hole in the airport’s security fence before making his way to the plane’s stairs. 

 Reid credited Clark, the pilot and another passenger with restraining the boy. 

 “This would have been a very terrifying incident for the passengers of that plane and Victoria Police really commend the bravery of those passengers who were able to overpower that male,” Reid said. 

 Sydney-bound Jetstar Airways Flight 610 was carrying about 150 people and no one was hurt, police said. The flight was cancelled.  Counterterrorism police not involved in the investigation  

 An investigation was being carried out by crime squad detectives with no involvement from the police force’s counterterrorism unit. 

 The boy has been charged with multiple offenses including unlawfully taking control of an aircraft, orchestrating a bomb hoax and possessing a firearm, a police statement said. He was remanded in custody to appear in a children’s court on a date to be determined. 

 Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australian airports had robust security. 

 “This incident is concerning for members of the public. I commend the work of police and aviation officials in responding to it quickly,” Albanese told reporters. 

 Avalon Airport’s chief executive Ari Suss said his organization was working with Victoria Police in response to the emergency. 

 “As part of our ongoing commitment to security, we have implemented further measures across the airport, including within the terminal and surrounding areas,” Suss said in a statement. 

 “We continue to work closely with authorities to maintain a safe and secure environment for all travelers,” he added. 

 Jetstar, a budget subsidiary of Sydney-based Qantas Airways, said it was working with police and the airport to understand what happened.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday showed no signs of backing down from his tough stance on the tariff war initiated by US President Donald Trump, as he said Canada will continue its trade onslaught against the country for the ""foreseeable future"".

A day after what he described as a “colorful” call with Trump, Justin Trudeau said his country will not back down from the trade war started by the United States.

He, however, said Canada would continue to engage with senior Trump administration officials about tariffs Washington says it will impose on Canadian imports.

""I can confirm that we will continue to be in a trade war that was launched by the United States for the foreseeable future,"" he told reporters in Ottawa.

""We will not be backing down from our response tariffs until such a time as the unjustified American tariffs on Canadian goods are lifted,"" he added.

Trudeau and Trump held a 50-minute call on Wednesday.

""It was a colorful call. It was also a very substantive call,"" said Trudeau, adding that the two sides were in talks but had nothing to announce yet.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration placed tariffs on Canada. The Canadian government retaliated by levying 25 percent tax on C$30 billion worth of US imports.

Canada has threatened that it would impose tariffs on C$125 billion of US imports.

The White House, meanwhile, announced on Wednesday that Trump would exempt automakers from tariffs on Canada and Mexico for one month as long as they comply with existing free trade rules

""Any carve outs that support any workers in Canada, even if it's just one industry or another, are going to be a good thing,"" said Trudeau.

Ever since Donald Trump became the President of the United States for the second time, his administration has been working on implementing reciprocal tariffs on several countries.

Mexico, China and Canada have already levied retaliatory tariffs on the United States, sparking fears of a global trade war, which have upended stock markets across the world, including India.

The USGS said that the quake, at 12:21 pm local time, had a depth of 93 kilometres. Chile's national disaster agency deemed the earthquake to be of “medium intensity,” and it said it would keep evaluating for any potential damage. It said the quake did “not meet the conditions necessary to generate a tsunami"" along the coast.

Chile is located in the so-called “Ring of Fire” — the region running from Chile to Alaska where tectonic plates clash under the surface of the Pacific Ocean and spawn earthquakes and tsunamis.

Chileans still have painful memories of a magnitude 8.8 earthquake in 2010 that triggered a tsunami and killed 526 people. Since that disaster, Chilean authorities have sought to improve emergency procedures and fit buildings with shock-absorbing devices that can greatly reduce damage and prevent collapse.

Follow:


            President Donald Trump is promising to unleash the US timber industry by allowing companies to raze swaths of federally protected national forests.
    


            The Trump administration quietly issued an executive order Saturday for the “immediate expansion” of commercial logging on federal lands, setting out deadlines for officials to figure out how to fast-track permits and circumvent restrictions set out in the Endangered Species Act and other environmental protections.
    


            The order — which calls for the ramping up of the domestic timber production to avoid reliance on “foreign producers” — was followed three days later by sweeping 25% tariffs on Canadian products, including lumber.
    


            The United States has an “abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs,” the executive order says. 



            However, it’s more complex than simply swapping out Canadian imports for homegrown timber, said industry experts, who warned tariffs could end up increasing lumber and building costs — and even push up housing prices for consumers.
    


            Meanwhile, environmental groups say clearcutting national forests will pollute the air and water, endanger wildlife and exacerbate climate change. “Trump’s order will unleash the chainsaws and bulldozers on our beautiful, irreplaceable federal forests,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity.
    


            The US relies heavily on Canada for its lumber. Last year 23.6% of the lumber consumed in the US was shipped in from its northern neighbor, according to Forest Economic Advisors.
    


            Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, said Trump’s executive order addresses “the national security threat posed by an overreliance on foreign timber and lumber, while simultaneously increasing America’s lumber supply at home.”
    


            She referred to multiple organizations that have released statements of support about opening up federal land for logging, including the American Loggers Council, the American Forest Resource Council and the Forest Landowners Association.
    


            Increasing logging on federal lands would increase the supply of logs for US industry, said Rocky Goodnow, vice president of North American Timber Service at Forest Economic Advisors. But it won’t replace Canadian imports in the near term, he told CNN.
    


            That’s because it takes time to expand an industry. The US needs to build more sawmills to produce the lumber, as well as develop the labor force in rural areas and increase logging capacity, Goodnow said.

            In the meantime, prices are already going up, said Buddy Hughes, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.
    


            While he welcomed “efforts to eliminate barriers to domestic lumber production,” he said a lack of sawmill capacity means “any move in the short-term to add tariffs or hinder the flow of lumber from Canada will only harm housing affordability.”
    


            Any more tariffs or restrictions could further increase the cost of construction and discourage new development, he told CNN. “Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,” he added.
    


            The NAHB’s chief economist Robert Dietz said he was hearing anecdotally from builders that the new tariffs could increase costs anywhere from $7,500 to $10,000 per home.
    


            For environmental advocates, the plan to open up federal land for logging is fraught with risk.
    


            Trump’s executive order says federal restrictions on logging have “contributed to wildfire disasters (and) degraded fish and wildlife habitats,” but the environmental law group Earthjustice said cutting down trees releases planet-heating pollution, exacerbating the climate crisis.
    


            “Hotter temperatures caused by climate change, in turn, create dry forest conditions that are more susceptible to fire,” said a spokesperson for Earthjustice. In addition, the debris often left behind by the logging industry, including needles and leaves, “essentially acts as tinder,” they added.
    


            Spivak of the Center for Biological Diversity said logging on public lands risks polluting water and threatens the more than 400 species protected under the Endangered Species Act that rely on national forests, including grizzly bears, spotted owls and wild salmon.
    


            “This is a particularly horrific move by Trump to loot our public lands by handing the keys to the kingdom over to big business,” Spivak said.
    


            Earthjustice — which sued the government over its attempts to approve a huge logging program in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska during Trump’s first term — said it plans to closely monitor what the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management do in response to the order.

                People take pictures with the Las Vegas sign in that city on July 29, 2023. Tourism industry leaders warn that recent actions by the Trump administration may be causing a drop in Canadians traveling to the U.S.

Leena Yousefi and her family typically visit Hawaii four or five times a year. The Vancouver attorney used to live in Maui and had booked another trip for this year.

But that was before President Trump, shortly after taking office in January, said he would impose 25% tariffs on many Canadian goods and repeated his wish to turn the country into the 51st U.S. state.

""Obviously out of loyalty to Canada and our values and just holding our ground, we had to cancel,"" Yousefi said.

Her family was even considering buying a two-bedroom condo in Hawaii given how often they vacation there. ""But now we're looking at Costa Rica,"" she said.

The Trump administration's recent attacks on its northern neighbor have been met with confusion, frustration and anger by many Canadians, some of whom are now abandoning their trips south and boycotting travel to the U.S. in protest.

Tourism industry leaders say that could pose a major threat to the U.S. travel sector, which relies heavily on Canadian visitors. According to the U.S. Travel Association, Canadians are the largest group of foreign visitors to the U.S. annually and accounted for $20.5 billion in spending last year alone.

Florida, California, Nevada, New York and Texas are the top U.S. states for Canadian tourists.

Signs of a Canadian tourist backlash are cropping up from accommodations in Vermont to campgrounds in New Jersey.

Bookings at U.S. hotels just over the Canadian border are also down. The data analytics firm CoStar Group found that the demand for hotel rooms in a four-week period covering part of January and most of February had decreased 8% year over year in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and 12% in the Bellingham area of northwest Washington, about 50 miles south of Vancouver.

Catherine Prather, president of the U.S.-based National Tour Association, said she's heard reports from ""dozens"" of members about Canadian travelers cancelling the tours they had booked to the U.S. — particularly in response to Trump's stated goal of annexing the longtime ally. ""Canadians feel disrespected, and that's very challenging to them because we have always been such loyal, loyal partners,"" she said.

Not everyone is as worried about a potential decline in Canadian travel to the U.S.

Beth Potter, president of the Tourism Industry Association of Canada, said there has been an increase in Canadians booking domestic vacations but that the tourism industry is viewing the situation as a ""small blip"" in the longstanding relationship between the two countries.

Marriott recently downplayed concerns that Canadians would quit traveling to the U.S., and Air Canada Executive Vice President Mark Galardo said in an earnings call that there ""could be a slowdown"" but that the carrier wasn't seeing it yet.

Still, according to a poll released last month by the market research firm Leger, nearly half of Canadians surveyed said they were less likely to travel to the U.S. this year. Most of them said they planned to travel within Canada instead.

The shift in Canadians' travel preferences dovetails with a souring national mood toward the U.S. An Ipsos poll for Global News released in early February, after Trump had announced the tariffs, found that 68% of residents surveyed thought less of their southern neighbor.

Lorna Hundt, CEO of the tour company Great Canadian Holidays, said most of the firm's U.S. tours are now ""dead in the water"" because so many of their Canadian customers have backed out.

""The anger is not with the American people. The anger is with Donald Trump,"" Hundt said. ""And the feeling is that if he is going to go to war with Canada — something we never asked for, an economic war — then why on Earth would they spend a nickel in the United States when they don't have to?""

In early February, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau encouraged Canadians to spend their money domestically in response to the U.S. tariffs.

""It might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada and explore the many national and provincial parks, historical sites and tourist destinations our great country has to offer,"" Trudeau said.

Tourism industry leaders say it's too early to tell how much of an impact would be felt by a dip in Canadian tourism, but estimates suggest the U.S. has a lot to lose if Canadians snub the States en masse.

Prather of the National Tour Association said cancellations could mean ""millions"" in lost revenue to tour companies, hotels, restaurants and more. The U.S. Travel Association estimated that even a 10% reduction in Canadian tourism to the U.S. would spell a $2.1 billion drop in spending and a loss of 14,000 American jobs.

An expanded trade war ensnaring Canada, Mexico, China and even Europe, according to the research firm Tourism Economics, could result in a $22 billion loss in tourism revenue from international visitors.

This all comes as the tourism industry continues to dig out of the hole left by the COVID-19 pandemic, which clobbered the hospitality sector.

American Bus Association President Fred Ferguson says there are still more American tourists leaving the country than there are foreign visitors coming in, but Canadian travelers are helping lessen that deficit.

""Canada has been one of the bright spots post-COVID of closing the gap, but I think with the rhetoric, with the news, we are going to see slowdowns in Canadian travel,"" Ferguson said.

And it's not just the resentment created by the tariffs but also the tariffs themselves that will impact the U.S. tourism industry. The association says motor coach equipment manufacturers are mainly located in Canada and Europe, and many motor coach buses are imported.

Those economic pressures are squeezing the U.S. tourism industry just as it prepares for the busy spring and summer travel seasons, Ferguson added.

""We're just now kind of ramping up to be hosting this influx of visitation,"" he said. ""And I think people are really concerned that if this rhetoric continues — which seemingly it is — people are just going to say, 'You know what, we're not coming. We're going to stay local, stay in Canada, stay in Europe, and not deal with the U.S.' ""

More than 100 protesters gathered on Columbia University's campus on Tuesday in response to an appearance from former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.

The State Department has revoked the visa of a student who participated in protesting in favor of Hamas, a move in line with President Donald Trump's call for canceling visas of students involved in the anti-Israel demonstrations on college campuses.

The State Department confirmed the matter with Fox News, without identifying the student or what university they attended due to ""legal constraints.""

""Yesterday evening, we revoked the first visa of an alien who was previously cited for criminal behavior in connection with Hamas-supporting disruptions,"" the State Department said. ""This individual was a university student. ICE will proceed with removing this person from the country.""

The State Department reviewed over 100,000 student visas and none were revoked during the Biden administration, despite all the anti-Israel protests and disruptions on college campuses. 

Trump has repeatedly called for foreign students attending American universities to have their visas revoked for supporting Hamas and other terror groups. 

Upon taking office in January, he signed an executive order to combat antisemitism.

""To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,"" Trump is quoted in a fact sheet issued by the White House. ""I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before.""

U.S. college campuses have been a hotbed for anti-Israel protests and disruptions, including vandalism, threats against Jewish students and violence against law enforcement. 

""The Biden Administration turned a blind eye to this coordinated assault on public order; it simply refused to protect the civil rights of Jewish Americans, especially students,"" the fact sheet states. ""According to a December 2024 U.S. House of Representatives Staff Report on anti-Semitism, ‘the failure of our federal government departments and agencies is astounding.'""

On Thursday, Axios reported that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is launching an AI-fueled ""Catch and Revoke"" effort to cancel the visas of foreign students who appear to support designated terror groups.

""Those who support designated terrorist organizations, including Hamas, threaten our national security,"" he wrote on X. ""The United States has zero tolerance for foreign visitors who support terrorists. Violators of U.S. law — including international students — face visa denial or revocation, and deportation.""

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday establishing a government reserve of bitcoin, a key marker in the cryptocurrency’s journey towards possible mainstream acceptance. 

Under Trump’s new order, the U.S. government will retain the estimated 200,000 bitcoin it’s already seized in criminal and civil proceedings, according to Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks. 

“The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,’” Sacks said on social media. 

The executive order calls for a “full accounting” of the government’s bitcoin holdings, which Sacks said have never been fully audited. He added that the U.S. government has previously sold off about 195,000 bitcoin over the last decade for $366 million. He said those bitcoins would be worth about $17 billion if the government hadn’t sold them.

Sacks said the order allows for the Treasury and Commerce Departments “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin.”

Once a skeptic who said a few years ago that bitcoin “ seems like a scam,” Trump has embraced digital currencies and leaned into his unofficial role as the “ crypto president ” in ways that can both help the crypto industry and enrich himself and his family. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, who felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last year’s election. 

Establishing a bitcoin reserve was one of several crypto-related promises Trump made on the campaign trail last year. Trump is also pushing Congress to pass industry-friendly legislation, and under his administration the Securities and Exchange Commission has started dropping enforcement actions it had taken against some major crypto companies. On Friday, Trump is set to host many key industry leaders at a White House “Crypto Summit.”




Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by an anonymous person or persons, bitcoin has blossomed from an experiment by libertarian cryptography enthusiasts into an asset with a market cap of about $1.7 trillion. While it hasn’t taken off as a way to pay for everyday things, bitcoin has found popularity as a store of value that’s not controlled by banks, governments or other powerful entities. 

Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, a built-in scarcity that supporters say makes it a great hedge against inflation. Critics have long said bitcoin lacks any inherent value, but it’s so far defied naysayers with remarkable price increases. Some supporters of a strategic bitcoin reserve said it could one day help pay off the U.S. national debt.

Crypto prices soared after Trump’s victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!” on social media.

But prices have since cooled off. Trump’s executive order did not equate to an immediate price spike for bitcoin, which was trading around $86,000 shortly after his announcement. 

The executive order also creates a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” where the government will hold seized cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. On Sunday, Trump sent crypto prices on a short-lived surge after a surprise announcement that he wanted the government to hold lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana and cardano.

          / CBS News
        

Washington — A federal judge in Washington ruled Thursday that President Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board was unlawful and said she must be allowed to continue in her role.

In a 36-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, who sits on the U.S. District Court in Washington, said that the Constitution and past decisions make clear that Congress can limit the president's removal power. She ruled that the president's firing of Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB violated federal law that allows for a board member to be removed only for ""neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,"" and declared her termination void.

""Under our constitutional system, such checks, by design, guard against executive overreach and the risk such overreach would pose of autocracy,"" Howell wrote in a 36-page decision. ""An American president is not a king — not even an 'elected' one — and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute, but may be constrained in appropriate circumstances, as are present here.""

Howell, appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote that Mr. Trump ""seems intent on pushing the bounds of his office and exercising his power in a manner violative of clear statutory law to test how much the courts will accept the notion of a presidency that is supreme.""

Wilcox was nominated to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024. 

But soon after returning to a second term in the White House, Mr. Trump replaced Wilcox as chair and fired her from her position on the board in late January. While the National Labor Relations Act requires the president to remove a member ""upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,"" the email sent to Wilcox on behalf of the president stated that she and another board member have not ""been operating in a manner consistent with the objectives of my administration.""

Wilcox told CBS News last month that she was ""stunned"" when she received a letter from the White House firing her. 

""I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,"" Wilcox, 71, said. She swiftly challenged her firing in federal court.

In her decision, the judge noted that in the 90 years since the NLRB was founded, the president has never removed a member of its board.

""His attempt to do so here is blatantly illegal, and his constitutional arguments to excuse this illegal act are contrary to Supreme Court precedent and over a century of practice,"" she said.

The court found that a Supreme Court decision from 1935 binds the outcome of Wilcox's case. That case carved out an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers. The Supreme Court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections for multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.

""The 150-year history and tradition of multimember boards or commissions and 90-year precedent from the Supreme Court approving of removal protections for their officers dictates the same outcome for the NLRB here,"" Howell wrote.

She added that ""nothing in the Constitution or the historical development of the removal power has suggested the president's removal power is absolute.""

""The president does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,"" the judge found.

Howell criticized Mr. Trump for portraying himself as a king — pointing to a social media post from the White House last month that featured an illustration of the president wearing a crown, along with the headline ""long live the king"" — and said that he misunderstands the role of Article II of the Constitution, which lays out the scope of the president's powers.

""At issue in this case, is the president's insistence that he has authority to fire whomever he wants within the Executive branch, overriding any congressionally mandated law in his way,"" she wrote. ""Luckily, the Framers, anticipating such a power grab, vested in Article III, not Article II, the power to interpret the law, including resolving conflicts about congressional checks on presidential authority. The president's interpretation of the scope of his constitutional power — or, more aptly, his aspiration — is flat wrong.""

The decision from Howell sets the case on a path to the Supreme Court and could lead it to overturn the 1935 decision in the case known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States. Sarah Harris, the acting solicitor general, wrote in a letter to Congress last month that the Trump administration believes that certain for-cause removal restrictions for multi-member commissions are unconstitutional and would urge the Supreme Court to overturn its precedent.

The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years chipped away at that 90-year-old ruling and reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will. Most notably in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure of a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance was unconstitutional.

Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have already indicated that they believe the Supreme Court should reverse Humphrey's Executor.

""The decision in Humphrey's Executor poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people,"" Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to its 2020 decision on the CFPB, which was joined by Gorsuch.

Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, said that in a future case, he ""would repudiate what is left of this erroneous precedent.""

Ryan Wedding is wanted on multiple federal charges, including murder.

The U.S. Department of State is offering a $10 million reward for the capture of a former Olympic snowboarder accused of running a major transnational drug trafficking organization and orchestrating multiple murders, authorities announced Thursday.

Ryan Wedding, 43, a Canadian national, has also been added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office revealed Thursday.

Wedding is wanted for allegedly running a drug trafficking network ""that routinely shipped hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia, through Mexico and Southern California, to Canada and other locations in the United States, and for orchestrating multiple murders and an attempted murder in furtherance of these drug crimes,"" the FBI said in a press release.

He was indicted last year in Los Angeles federal court on multiple federal charges, including running a continuing criminal enterprise, committing murder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise and assorted drug crimes, the FBI said.

He and his alleged second-in-command, 34-year-old Canadian Andrew Clark, are accused of conspiring to move hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Mexico to the Los Angeles area, where it was stored in stash houses before being transported to Canada and U.S. cities in long-haul semi-trucks, authorities said.

Wedding and Clark are also accused of ordering the murders of multiple people in Canada to achieve the organization's aims, the FBI said.

Clark was arrested in Mexico last year by Mexican authorities and was among the 29 fugitives who were extradited to the U.S. from Mexico last week, while Wedding's whereabouts remain unknown, the FBI said.

""Wedding went from shredding powder on the slopes at the Olympics to distributing powder cocaine on the streets of U.S. cities and in his native Canada,"" Akil Davis, the assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, said in a statement on Thursday. ""The alleged murders of his competitors make Wedding a very dangerous man, and his addition to the list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, coupled with a major reward offer by the State Department, will make the public our partner so that we can catch up with him before he puts anyone else in danger.""

The State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs' $10 million reward for information leading to Wedding's arrest and/or conviction was authorized by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the FBI said.

The reward is in addition to a $50,000 reward already offered by the FBI for information leading to Wedding's apprehension, arrest and extradition, the agency said.

Wedding competed for Canada in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where he placed 24th in the parallel giant slalom, before allegedly running the billion-dollar cocaine operation from Mexico for more than a dozen years, officials said.

He is believed to reside in Mexico but investigators have not ruled out his presence elsewhere, including in the U.S., Canada, Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala or Costa Rica. His aliases include ""El Jefe,"" ""Giant,"" ""Public Enemy,"" ""James Conrad King"" and ""Jesse King,"" the FBI said.

If convicted of murder and attempted murder charges, he faces a mandatory minimum penalty of life in federal prison, the DOJ said. The continuing criminal enterprise charges also carry a mandatory minimum penalty of life in federal prison.

Trump Administration

Auto tariff pause: The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would allow carmakers to escape the tariffs imposed on all goods from Canada and Mexico for one month. The announcement came a day after President Trump imposed blanket 25 percent tariffs on all products entering the United States from those countries. The reprieve came after the president spoke with top officials at General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis. Read more ›

More V.A. cuts planned: The Veterans Affairs Department is planning to reduce its work force by more than 80,000 people, a major escalation of the downsizing efforts at the department that have already prompted pushback from Democrats and some Republicans. In announcing the cuts, Doug Collins, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, said that health care services and benefits would not be cut. Meanwhile, a judge ordered that nearly 6,000 Agriculture Department workers be reinstated.

Foreign aid ruling: The Supreme Court rejected Mr. Trump’s emergency request to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid, saying a lower court judge “should clarify what obligations the government must fulfill.” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the three liberal justices in a 5-to-4 vote. The case focuses on the U.S. Agency for International Development and aid the administration halted on Mr. Trump’s first day in office. Read more ›

In a Pentagon ceremony on Friday morning, Timothy C. Parlatore, a former naval officer who has been Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s personal lawyer for the past eight years, will be directly commissioned as a Navy commander in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps as a reservist.

Mr. Parlatore confirmed his plans in an interview on Wednesday evening, and said he will be assigned to a reserve unit that works for the secretary of defense’s office.

During his periods of reserve duty in uniform, Mr. Parlatore intends to focus on improving how the military’s uniformed lawyers are trained. When he returns to civilian life between his reserve obligations, he will continue to run his private practice.

In 2019, Mr. Parlatore successfully defended Eddie Gallagher, a SEAL accused of first-degree murder in the death of a captive ISIS fighter as well as the attempted murder of civilians in Iraq. That case brought Mr. Parlatore to President Trump’s attention, and he has appeared frequently on Fox News to discuss his defense of military clients.

A 2002 U.S. Naval Academy graduate, Mr. Parlatore served aboard the cruiser U.S.S. Normandy in Norfolk, Va., before taking an early release from active duty in 2005 to attend law school. While building his legal practice, he served as the officer in charge of a security detachment in the Bronx as lieutenant in the reserves, and was honorably discharged in 2013.

A federal appeals court cleared the way on Wednesday for the Trump administration to remove Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, from his position, lifting a lower court’s order that had allowed the federal watchdog lawyer to remain.

In a brief order on Wednesday evening, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the government had succeeded in arguing that an order keeping Mr. Dellinger in place should be lifted.

The ruling effectively dealt the Trump administration the upper hand in the struggle over Mr. Dellinger’s fate. The Supreme Court could weigh in on whether Mr. Dellinger and other officials who play a similar role in the executive branch are subject to removal and replacement by the president.

Lower courts had previously sided with Mr. Dellinger and Cathy Harris, a government lawyer on the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that reviews actions by the Office of Personnel Management. Both lawyers received letters last month notifying them that they had been fired.

The Supreme Court appeared to be poised to step in on at least one of those cases to issue the final word on whether those positions, which were created by Congress and designed to have certain independence, could be shielded from efforts to control them.

The appeals court decision also came as Mr. Dellinger and Ms. Harris had recently intervened on behalf of federal workers challenging their termination as the Trump administration shrinks the federal work force. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Dellinger issued a statement urging all agencies to rescind any “unlawful terminations” of probationary workers. Last week, a federal judge ruled that guidance sent by the Office of Personnel Management directing those firings was unlawful.

Michelle Bercovici, a lawyer who represents federal employees in litigation before the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel, said in an email that efforts to remove Mr. Dellinger had potential to jeopardize his agency’s advocacy on behalf of federal workers.

“The idea that the independent, primary watchdog of the civil service can be replaced by political whim is deeply unsettling and his termination is a true threat to the integrity of the government,” she said.

The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would overhaul a $42 billion federal grant program aimed at expanding high-speed internet to the nation, including easing some rules that could benefit Elon Musk’s satellite internet service, Starlink.

The program will be revamped to “take a tech-neutral approach” in its distribution of funds to states, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. The program’s rules, which were created during the Biden administration, previously favored broadband lines made of fiber-optic cables attached to homes.

“The department is ripping out the Biden administration’s pointless requirements,” Mr. Lutnick said. The Commerce Department will also remove regulatory and other barriers that slow down construction and connection to households, he added.

Congress created the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program in 2021 to extend broadband to the most remote areas of the nation. The Commerce Department came up with standards and rules for states and territories applying for the funds — including the preference for fiber-optic broadband, which provides the fastest internet service speeds.

Mr. Musk, who is a close adviser to President Trump and helping to lead a government efficiency initiative, is chief executive of SpaceX, the rocket company that makes Starlink. Starlink uses low-altitude satellites to beam internet service to dishes anywhere on the planet and then to devices. It serves nearly five million subscribers worldwide and was used by emergency responders late last year in North Carolina when communications networks shut down after a hurricane.

The Commerce Department’s internet program has not yet disbursed any funds, and Republicans have used it as an example of a program that was slowed down by red tape.

Some have accused the Biden administration of unfairly blocking Starlink from the grants and say the satellite service can immediately serve some of the most remote areas of the nation.

In 2023, the Federal Communications Commission rejected Starlink’s application for almost $900 million in subsidies in a separate rural broadband program, saying the company failed to show it could meet service requirements for the funding.

Brendan Carr, then a Republican F.C.C. commissioner and now chairman of the agency, opposed that decision and said the action had put the F.C.C. on a “growing list of administrative agencies that are taking action against Elon Musk’s businesses.”

Mr. Musk’s business interests — which also include the electric-car maker Tesla and the social media company X — have prompted concerns about potential conflicts of interest as he makes important decisions in Washington.

On Wednesday, some public interest groups expressed concern that Mr. Lutnick’s plans to change the broadband program could directly benefit Mr. Musk.

“Fiber broadband is widely understood to be better than other internet options — like Starlink’s satellites — because it delivers significantly faster speeds,” said Drew Garner, a director of policy engagement for the nonprofit Benton Institute for Broadband & Society.

The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to requests for details on the plan. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.

A three-judge panel from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals lifted an injunction on Wednesday evening that had allowed Hampton Dellinger, the head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, to keep his job after attempts by the Trump administration to remove him. A lower court had found that Mr. Dellinger’s role should be insulated from political efforts to replace him. He will likely appeal to the Supreme Court.

The U.S. Capitol Police said the chief of staff to Speaker Mike Johnson was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving on Tuesday night after the top aide backed his car into a parked Capitol Police vehicle.

The arrest came soon after President Trump, with Mr. Johnson presiding behind him, finished delivering his first address to a joint session of Congress since returning to office.

“A driver backed into a parked vehicle last night around 11:40 p.m.,” a Capitol Police spokesman said in a statement. “We responded and arrested them for D.U.I.”

Mr. Johnson’s office confirmed on Wednesday that Hayden Haynes, the speaker’s chief of staff, was involved in an “encounter” with Capitol Police on Tuesday night, releasing a statement that indicated that he would continue to hold his powerful post.

“The speaker has known and worked closely with Hayden for nearly a decade and trusted him to serve as his chief of staff for his entire tenure in Congress,” Taylor Haulsee, Mr. Johnson’s spokesman, said in a statement about the arrest, which was reported earlier by NBC News. “Because of this and Hayden’s esteemed reputation among members and staff alike, the speaker has full faith and confidence in Hayden’s ability to lead the speaker’s office.”

Mr. Haynes was released with a citation, rather than taken to jail, and would have a court date “within the coming weeks,” according to the Capitol Police. Since drunken-driving cases in Washington, D.C., are prosecuted by the district’s attorney general rather than the U.S. district attorney’s office under the Justice Department, the Trump administration would have no apparent role in the case.

The National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit that has had bipartisan support over decades for its work promoting democracy abroad, is suing the U.S. government and cabinet officials for withholding $239 million in congressional appropriations.

Members of the group’s board, which includes current and former Republican and Democratic lawmakers, said the organization filed the lawsuit on Wednesday afternoon as a last resort because it had been unable to get the State Department to restart the flow of money.

The group is also asking a court to prevent the government from withholding any future funds appropriated by Congress.

The group has had to put about 75 percent of its staff on unpaid leave, and about 1,800 grant projects have received no money since late January, after President Trump signed an executive order freezing all foreign aid.

In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, the group argues that its money from Congress is not foreign aid and does not fall under the purview of the State Department, which manages the transfer of funds, or any other executive branch agency. Withholding the funding, the board members say, is illegal.

Peter Roskam, a former Republican congressman from Illinois who chairs the nonprofit, said the board voted on Tuesday to go to court.

“We’d be delighted to learn that this was just an oversight and someone just forgot to hit the send button,” he said in an interview on Wednesday, minutes before the lawsuit was filed. “But clearly that’s not what’s going on.”

The endowment’s plight is emblematic of the colossal shift in foreign policy that is taking place in the second Trump administration, as the president tries to move the government away from work aimed at strengthening values-based alliances, democracy and human rights toward a more nakedly transactional and nationalistic approach.

Mr. Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the House of Representatives voted to impeach him for a second time because of his incitement of a riot at the Capitol against lawmakers certifying Mr. Biden’s win.

Some senior administration officials have adopted language, including phrases once common among progressive critics of the U.S. government, about the downside of American projects that seek to extend influence across societies abroad, calling such programs “nation-building” and attempts at “regime change.”

Representatives for the White House, the State Department and the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.

Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to Mr. Trump, posted scathing criticism of the National Endowment for Democracy online last month, saying without providing evidence that it was “RIFE with CORRUPTION!!” “That evil organization needs to be dissolved,” he wrote, using the same conspiratorial language he has employed to describe the U.S. Agency for International Development, which Mr. Musk has helped dismantle.

Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican who is Mr. Trump’s pick for ambassador to the United Nations, was on the National Endowment for Democracy board until she had to step down to prepare for Senate confirmation for her new job. Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, is currently on the board.

Mr. Trump’s “America First” policy has also been brought into sharp relief in recent weeks by his criticism of democratic Ukraine in its defensive fight against Russia; his imposing of high tariffs on two allies, Canada and Mexico; his insistence on taking mineral-rich Greenland from Denmark, another ally; and his decision to cut off almost all U.S. foreign aid, which strategists have seen as an important component of American soft power.

The grants the National Endowment for Democracy gives out are focused on promoting democracy, free speech and religious freedoms in more than 100 countries and territories, including ones that the first Trump administration and the Biden administration considered rivals or adversaries — China, Russia, Belarus, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela and Cuba.

The grants fund projects such as the development of software that allows citizens to view banned websites and efforts to support independent journalism.

One recipient, China Labor Watch, a New York-based group with overseas offices, monitors the coerced labor and trafficking of Chinese workers. Its founder, Li Qiang, said in an interview that he had not received $150,000 of National Endowment for Democracy funds he had been expecting this year, and that most funding directly from the State Department was still frozen. He has had to lay off workers or put them on unpaid leave.

Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator representing Florida, said the Trump administration’s unwillingness to release funding for organizations that support overseas dissidents was an affront to exiles from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. “That entire group of people are politically active,” he said. “Many have been strong supporters of the president.”

In Venezuela, National Endowment for Democracy grants support independent groups that monitor elections and help provide legal defense to dissidents targeted by the autocratic government.

Authoritarian governments, including those of China and Russia, have denounced the work of the endowment over many years.

The lawsuit noted that the sudden halt in funding further endangers grant recipients living under a hostile government: “The freezing of the endowment’s funds poses special risk to partners operating in highly authoritarian contexts, as the sudden interruption in support may expose their operations and staff as endowment grantees.”

The group traces its origins to a speech by President Ronald Reagan to the British Parliament in 1982. He vowed that “the march of freedom and democracy” would “leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash-heap of history.” Congress passed a law establishing the National Endowment for Democracy the following year.

The endowment gives funding to several sister nonprofits, notably the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. Those groups are also ending programs because of the funding freeze. Several Senate allies of Mr. Trump, including Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, sit on the International Republican Institute board.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a defendant in the lawsuit, is a former board member.

The Republican group’s website says it has had to disable its operations to save on expenses, but a page aims to remind people of the work that it does: “Dictators are afraid of their own people. Helping citizens have a voice in their country is at the heart of what I.R.I. does.”

Last November, a post on the group’s X social media account, which is now defunct, congratulated Mr. Rubio on being picked to be Mr. Trump’s secretary of state and called him a “leading champion of freedom.”

David Super, a professor who studies administrative law at Georgetown University, said the National Endowment for Democracy’s case had some similarities to a lawsuit filed by contracting companies for U.S.A.I.D. The Trump administration also froze that agency’s funds. In both cases, Mr. Super said, Congress had passed “clear, mandatory authorizing and appropriations statutes.” Withholding money from the endowment, he said, “is clearly violating both laws.”

Bradley J. Bondi, brother of Attorney General Pam Bondi, has announced his candidacy to lead the bar association in Washington at a time when the group might be asked to consider accusations that political appointees at the Justice Department violated professional or ethical norms.

Mr. Bondi, a partner at Paul Hastings, a global white-collar criminal defense firm with offices in Washington, threw his hat in the ring in late February, according to a roster of candidates posted on the association’s website.

The three-year position of president at the 118,000-member association is unpaid. The role does not extend to controlling disbarments and other disciplinary actions, which are handled by a board of professional responsibility that is appointed and overseen by a court, according to the association’s bylaws.

But his candidacy comes at a time when Ms. Bondi, like many other Trump appointees, is quashing internal dissent and seeking retribution against President Trump’s perceived enemies in ways that have challenged norms of prosecutorial independence from politics.

The D.C. Bar, a mandatory body to which every lawyer practicing in Washington, D.C., is required to register, oversees disciplinary actions, such as when it acted to disbar former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York for promoting lies about the 2020 election.

It could soon become a venue to resolve complaints about the conduct of other Trump allies. Former prosecutors and Democrats are considering filing complaints against department officials over what they claim are efforts to inject politics into prosecutorial decision making, particularly at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington.

The D.C. Bar’s election period starts next month and ends in early June. Mr. Bondi’s opponent is Diane A. Seltzer, a Maryland-based lawyer who runs a small firm specializing in employment law. She has been far more active in the bar association than Mr. Bondi.

Mr. Bondi, 51, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Bondi, a former top staff member at the Securities and Exchange Commission, was already a well-known and deeply connected defense lawyer in Washington before his sister became attorney general. But his professional life has, in recent years, intersected with people in her orbit — including Mr. Trump’s business associates and Elon Musk.

He represented Tesla Inc. in a 2018 settlement with the S.E.C. over Mr. Musk’s social media posts about taking the company private. Six years later, Trump transition officials considered Mr. Bondi as a candidate to run the commission, but opted for Paul Atkins, whom Mr. Bondi has described as a close friend.

Last year, Mr. Bondi’s practice group at Paul Hastings was hired to represent Miami-based Digital World Acquisition Corp., in its merger negotiations with Mr. Trump’s media company.

Ms. Bondi later reported owning nearly $3 million in Trump Media shares after the parent company of Truth Social went public a year ago, according to financial disclosures.

In January, a group of investors seeking to buy TikTok enlisted Mr. Bondi to prepare a bid. Mr. Trump later reversed President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ban on the Chinese social media app.

Shortly before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Bondi signed on to represent Carolina Amesty, a former Republican state legislator in Florida charged by federal prosecutors with stealing $122,000 in pandemic relief aid, according to court filings.

Mr. Bondi has given more than $25,000 to political committees in support of Mr. Trump since 2020, according to federal campaign finance records. But he does not seem to share Mr. Trump’s determination to roll back diversity and inclusion efforts, a cause enthusiastically championed by his sister.

In 2021, Mr. Bondi set aside $100,000 to create the “Bradley J. Bondi Diversity and Inclusion Endowed Scholarship” at the University of Florida College of Law, his alma mater.

Congressional memo

After the 2004 elections, a Republican president, newly returned to office, decided the political moment was right to overhaul Social Security, making it more like private retirement plans in a bid to prevent it from going bankrupt in the future. Two years and a bruising political fight later, Democrats took back the House and Senate from Republicans.

Democrats now believe history may be about to repeat itself.

Elon Musk, the multibillionaire overseeing the Trump administration effort to drastically shrink government, has derided the nation’s most popular federal program as a sketchy pyramid scheme while pushing to close offices and eliminate thousands of jobs of those who administer the program. In doing so, he has touched a topic that has traditionally been known as the third rail of American politics. And Democrats, who increasingly regard Mr. Musk as a more opportune political target than even President Trump himself, have rushed to highlight what they consider to be a major political blunder.

“They don’t learn,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said of Republicans as his party pounced on the issue. “Their biggest mistake was going after Social Security when George Bush was president. And now they are doing it again.”

Illustrating the emphasis Democrats intend to put on the subject, Senator Elissa Slotkin, the Michigan Democrat who delivered her party’s rebuttal to Mr. Trump’s congressional address on Tuesday night, hit on Social Security as well, using it to cast doubt on the president’s vows not to touch the federal retirement program.

“The president claims he won’t, but Elon Musk just called Social Security the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” she said in her remarks, quoting a social media post by Mr. Musk.

Democrats were already pressing Republicans on potential cuts to Medicaid, the government health coverage program for lower-income Americans, but they view threats to Social Security as having broader resonance.

Congressional Republicans respond that Democrats are distorting the Trump administration’s — and their — position on Social Security and that they are simply trying to bolster the finances of the program to guarantee that it won’t run out of money, allowing future generations, like past ones, to get the money they paid in.

“We need to make sure that Social Security is strengthened and saved for the future so that everyone who’s paid in can get it,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Senate Republican.

Social Security has long been the political backbone of the Democratic Party. For years, Democrats have capitalized on the slightest hint of any attempt to dismantle or privatize it, as they did when President George W. Bush pushed the idea in 2005, much to the detriment of his party’s midterm election fortunes.

The issue is so volatile that when Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, put forward a policy agenda during the 2022 midterm elections that would have theoretically required the program to expire and be re-evaluated, he was immediately repudiated by Republican leaders and eventually had to disavow his own plan.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly emphasized that he has no plans to tinker with Social Security or Medicare. But Democrats see something afoot with Mr. Musk’s derogatory comments and Mr. Trump’s claims that the program is riddled with fraud.

Despite multiple reviews that have found Social Security to be one of the better-run federal programs with a record of never missing payments, Mr. Musk has characterized the program as riddled with fraud and waste.

Mr. Trump emphasized that theme in Tuesday night’s address, saying that millions of obviously long-dead beneficiaries remain on the Social Security rolls. But the claim he and Mr. Musk make that benefits still flow to those people has been widely debunked. The agency says that it is a data recording problem, and has reported that just under 90,000 people 99 years or older received Social Security benefits in December — slightly more than the 85,000 Americans over the age of 100 recorded by the Census Bureau.

Still, Democrats see the focus by Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump on erroneous claims of fraud as laying the groundwork for a benefit review that could affect those lawfully receiving monthly benefits as Republicans search for ways to offset the cost of hugely expensive tax cuts.

Democrats say an equal threat to the program are plans to reduce the work force that had already shrunk, including an effort to pare down as many as 7,000 employees while consolidating regional offices and ending the leases on dozens of field offices around the country. They say the loss of personnel and the shuttering of offices would be tantamount to denying benefits to applicants who would face long waits to talk to advisers or to receive their assistance.

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said such delays would break the inherent promise of Social Security that Americans can collect what they contributed.

“Part of that promise means being able to get on the phone with an actual human being without having to wait on hold for an hour or more, visit an in-office person to help you get your benefits without having to jump through hoops or drive hundreds of miles,” Ms. Murray said. “But Trump and Elon are decimating the Social Security Administration and without adequate staff at the agency, there will be people who cannot get their benefits period.”

Some Republicans also expressed concern about how cuts could affect the level of service their constituents receive.

“I do know that it is a whole lot easier to work your way through Social Security benefits if you’re doing it in person with somebody who is well trained in how the system works,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota. “Trying to do any of that stuff online is much more difficult.”

But Mr. Rounds also credited Mr. Musk with bringing attention to the fiscal condition of Social Security, which is in such dire financial trouble that benefit cuts could come within a decade if nothing changes.

“He’s at least ringing the alarm that the rest of us have tried to do,” said Mr. Rounds, who added that obvious fixes were available.

Multiple ideas are circulating to stabilize the program, such as lifting the current $176,100 cap on the amount of pay that is taxed for Social Security.

“If Congress eliminated the payroll tax cap for individuals with annual income in the millions of dollars — an amount Elon Musk makes every two hours — and collected the money they are illegally evading in taxes, Social Security would be fully funded for decades,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee.

But no one on Capitol Hill is talking seriously about raising that cap any time soon. For now, the push by Mr. Musk to shrink the agency and the beneficiary rolls will guarantee that Social Security remains at the center of the clash over federal spending in the coming months and next year’s elections.

The Senate on Wednesday confirmed President Trump’s criminal defense attorney Todd Blanche to take the No. 2 position at the Justice Department, where he has vowed to end the kind of investigations and prosecutions that led to indictments against his client.

Mr. Blanche’s nomination to be the deputy attorney general, with oversight of the F.B.I.; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and other federal law enforcement agencies, passed 52 to 46 in a mostly party-line vote.

A former federal prosecutor in New York, Mr. Blanche was in private practice as a defense lawyer when he agreed to take on Mr. Trump as a client, assembling and managing a legal team to defend him against four separate indictments.

He was Mr. Trump’s attorney in his New York State trial last year on charges of falsifying business records. Mr. Trump was convicted of all 34 counts, but he and his lawyers, including Mr. Blanche, have denounced the case as a misuse of prosecutorial power.

Mr. Blanche carried that argument, and his anger, into his confirmation hearing last month. He told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was still “frustrated” by what he called the unfair treatment of his client by judges and prosecutors. “That’s power, and that’s power that’s corrupted,” he said.

Mr. Blanche is the most prominent of several lawyers who have represented Mr. Trump in private practice who are now poised to take senior positions within the Justice Department. Democrats have raised concerns that their elevation to those roles will create inherent ethical conflicts, but Mr. Blanche and the other Trump lawyers have downplayed such concerns.

At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Blanche confirmed that his “attorney-client relationship with President Trump remains,” but added that he “will not violate my ethical obligations.”

He also discounted any suggestion that he might be put in a difficult position by the president, who had a contentious relationship with Justice Department leaders during his first term.

“I don’t think President Trump is going to ask me to do anything illegal or immoral,” Mr. Blanche said. “I say that with experience and firsthand knowledge.”

Reporting from the Capitol

Elon Musk arrived on Wednesday at Senate Republicans’ weekly luncheon on Capitol Hill ready to field questions about the work he is doing for President Trump at the Department of Government Efficiency, the office he formed that has taken a hatchet to the federal bureaucracy with no input from Congress.

They had plenty.

Republican senators have raised few public complaints about Mr. Musk as he has undertaken mass firings across the government without consulting or informing them. But during the nearly two-hour closed-door meeting, the senators gently questioned him about how they might share feedback, minimize blowback from their constituents and, perhaps, eventually get to vote on the cuts he is making.

At one point during the largely friendly exchange, Mr. Musk, who made no presentation of his own, shared his personal phone number with senators and encouraged them to reach out directly with any concerns.

“We’re getting feedback, and we want to respond to our constituents — how do we work most effectively to do that?” Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota said after the meeting, in characterizing the tenor of his colleagues’ questions.

Other Republicans said they were simply trying to figure out how they could help Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump succeed.

“There was just a general discussion about how we can make his cuts permanent,” said Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana. “There was general discussion about how we, as senators, can do a better job of explaining clearly what he’s doing.”

The gathering highlighted the conundrum that DOGE’s slash-and-burn approach has created for a number of Republican lawmakers. Many of them genuinely believe the federal government and work force should be scaled back, and most are exceedingly reluctant to criticize Mr. Trump or Mr. Musk, who has a penchant for using his social media platform X to unleash a barrage of abuse against his critics, including Republican lawmakers.

But they are also facing intense pushback from constituents at home affected by sprawling cuts and layoffs.

In some cases, that has fueled an awkward two-step for Republicans, who have simultaneously praised the work DOGE is doing while also quietly seeking exemptions and special consideration for funding that helps their own constituents.

“People were eager to have more feedback opportunities,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who praised Mr. Musk’s efforts on the Senate floor ahead of the meeting.

Mr. Musk took a largely deferential tone toward senators, according to lawmakers who attended. When one senator stood and asked whom to contact with questions about the group’s efforts, one of Mr. Musk’s senior advisers volunteered her contact information. Mr. Musk interjected and said senators could contact him directly, a person who witnessed the exchange said.

While he told senators a major target was waste at the Pentagon — typically a place where Senate Republicans have refused to entertain spending cuts — he made a point of relaying an anecdote that Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, had shared with him. In recounting that story, which he has previously discussed, he said Ms. Collins gave the Navy money for more submarines, but no new submarines were produced.

Senators said they were interested in trying to codify the cuts Mr. Musk’s group has already targeted — a move that would endorse DOGE’s actions while also reclaiming Congress’s power of the purse.

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky suggested that lawmakers ultimately should vote on the cuts DOGE has ordered using the recission process, which allows the president to ask Congress to cancel certain funds lawmakers have appropriated.

Mr. Paul suggested that the Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday in which a majority of justices rejected Mr. Trump’s emergency request to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid indicated that using the recission process would be more fruitful than unilateral attempts by the executive branch to halt funding.

“This is a bigger argument than just one person,” Mr. Paul said in an interview.

He added: “Either the cuts and all the great things I think Elon is finding evaporate — they’re ephemeral — or we put them into a rescission package, they send them back to us, and we vote up or down on getting rid of them.”

Mr. Musk appeared supportive of the idea, according to several senators who attended.

“He said at one point, ‘You guys are going to have to act here to make any of this permanent,’” Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said.

Mr. Musk also briefed House Republicans at the Capitol later on Wednesday night, in another closed-door meeting that lasted roughly two hours. The message lawmakers sent him, according to Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina: “Speed up, don’t slow down.”

Reporting from Washington

The Supreme Court’s Wednesday ruling that the Trump administration must heed a lower court’s order to release frozen foreign aid was a welcome but confusing development for humanitarian and development organizations around the world, as they waited to see if thousands of canceled contracts would be restarted.

For weeks, the Trump administration has worked to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, the federal agency chiefly responsible for disbursing foreign aid.

Thousands of nongovernmental groups and companies that once partnered with it have been in limbo since the administration canceled over 90 percent of contracts, neutered the agency’s payments system and reneged on promises to pay for work already completed.

The organizations that brought the lawsuit have insisted that the court’s ruling ought to force the Trump administration to restore all foreign aid funding. But the administration has been adamant that it was within its rights to decimate the agency.

Here’s where things stand, and how this court order is expected to play out.

President Trump has argued that some U.S.A.I.D. programs were counter to American interests, too “woke” and too expensive. On the first day of his second term, he signed an executive order to pause all foreign aid for 90 days, pending a review of programs to determine whether they aligned with his foreign policy objectives.

The administration has stated in its court filings that the review was “largely completed,” after it announced its decision last week to terminate funding for about 5,800 contracts. Those contracts comprised over 90 percent of U.S.A.I.D.’s remaining caseload. On Wednesday, however, Pete Marocco, the State Department official who has been overseeing the cuts to the agency, told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the review was in its early stages.

The total funding allotted to U.S.A.I.D. programs before the cuts amounted to less than 1 percent of the overall federal budget.

At this point, extremely little.

Shortly after Mr. Trump issued his executive order, Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, allowed programs providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance to avoid the 90-day freeze and review.

But in practice, almost all of the programs that had received waivers were unable to access funds to continue operating. Even a program to help contain an Ebola outbreak in Uganda was unable to access the money it needed.

In recent days, a trickle of organizations received notice that their contract termination notices had been reversed. Among the revived contracts was one to procure H.I.V. medicines and manage supply chains to ship those drugs to countries with high rates of infection. A program to spray long-acting insecticide inside the homes of people in areas of Kenya and Uganda with some of the highest rates of malaria infection in the world was also permitted to resume, until April 30.

But the changes in status have been scattered and erratic. According to Tom Hart, the head of InterAction, a U.S.-based alliance of international nongovernmental aid organizations, some groups whose contracts were canceled were notified that they had been reinstated and then canceled again.

And nearly none of the reversals of terminations have come with restored funding, obliging partners to front the funds through corporate lines of credit and other sources, if they wish to resume their work.

This is the million — or really, billion — dollar question.

The Supreme Court’s one-paragraph order kicked the matter of determining how much foreign aid had to be restored back to Judge Amir H. Ali of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. It was his order to release the funding that the Trump administration had appealed to the Supreme Court. The administration’s broad cancellation of contracts happened after Judge Ali’s order — and it is not clear if the Supreme Court’s ruling could force the administration to restore all the contracts it canceled.

Democrats on Capitol Hill, who see the cuts to U.S.A.I.D. as flouting the will of Congress, which created the agency, insist that the ruling is absolute.

“They’re defying the constitutional rules of Congress. Are they also going to defy the constitutional obligations by the Supreme Court?” asked Representative Julie Elizabeth Johnson, Democrat of Texas, after members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee met with Mr. Marocco on Wednesday.

But the Trump administration has insisted that it has the authority, separate from the president’s executive order, to end programs that it deems counter to U.S. interests. And Republican allies insist the court could not take that power away.

“We don’t interpret that the court should read that in that way,” said Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and chairman of the foreign affairs panel. “We’re going to continue to fight it.”

A variety of lawsuits challenging the cuts to the development agency have been working their way through the courts. Wednesday’s ruling was in a case initially brought by the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Journalism Development Network, challenging the administration’s aid freeze as organizations that had been promised those funds.

But a parallel suit from unions representing U.S.A.I.D. employees was not able to stop the Trump administration from laying off the agency’s contractors and putting the vast majority of direct hires on leave, as part of a plan to reduce the agency’s staffing from about 10,000 to mere hundreds of staff members deemed “essential.”

Without the majority of its staff, it is unclear how the agency would administer programs if they were restored.

Judge Ali will hold a hearing on Thursday to consider whether to turn his temporary restraining order largely lifting the administration’s freeze into a more muscular judicial command, a preliminary injunction. He has said that he intends to issue his ruling “with full dispatch.”

The temporary order is set to expire on Monday or when Judge Ali rules on the motion for a preliminary injunction, whichever comes sooner.

Should he grant the injunction, the administration will doubtless appeal again, first to a federal appeals court in Washington and then, if need be, to the Supreme Court.

In the meantime, Mr. Marocco also told lawmakers Wednesday that his staff was planning criminal referrals against individuals the administration believes misused foreign aid funds, according to people familiar with the closed-door meeting.

Judge orders reinstatement of Gwynne Wilcox to National Labor Relations Board after her removal by US president

A federal court ruled that Donald Trump’s abrupt firing of a former senior official at the top US labor watchdog was illegal, and ordered that she be reinstated.

Gwynne Wilcox was the first member of the National Labor Relations Board to be removed by a US president since the board’s inception in 1935.

The framers of the US constitution “made clear that no one in our system of government was meant to be king – the President included – and not just in name only”, the judge Beryl A Howell, wrote in the ruling.

Howell presided over the hearing held on Wednesday on a motion for summary judgment in the District of Columbia. “The President does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,” she wrote.

“A president who touts an image of himself as a ‘king’ or a ‘dictator,’ perhaps as his vision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the US Constitution,” wrote Howell.

Article II of the US Constitution outlines the executive powers and responsibilities of the president. Howell continued, “in our constitutional order, the president is tasked to be a conscientious custodian of the law, albeit an energetic one, to take care of effectuating his enumerated duties, including the laws enacted by the Congress and as interpreted by the Judiciary”.

Wilcox filed the lawsuit early last month, alleging her removal was a “blatant violation” of the National Labor Relations Act, which stipulates that members of the board can only be removed for negligence or misconduct. Her removal left the board with only two members, lacking the quorum of at least three members required to rule on cases.

“I’m ready to get back to work,” said Wilcox after the hearing in a speech outside the courthouse today. “It’s not just about me, but I’m glad to be the face of this fight.”

Her attorney, Deepak Gupta, noted this was the beginning of a long fight.

Wilcox was confirmed by the Senate in September 2023, and set to serve until August 2028. She sought a declaratory judgment ruling her removal unlawful and an injunction to permit her to complete her appointed term.

The White House has defended her removal, and that of the NLRB general counsel, claiming that “these were far-left appointees with radical records of upending longstanding labor law, and they have no place as senior appointees in the Trump administration”.

During the hearing, Howell noted that in court, the Trump administration claimed the law prohibiting removal of board members was unconstitutional. Similar arguments have been made in recent lawsuits against the NLRB by SpaceX, Amazon and other employers in response to labor law enforcement actions pursued against the corporations.

Howell explained the US supreme court precedent of Humphrey’s Executor, a 1935 case in which the court ruled that a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission had been unlawfully removed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Former NLRB chairs and labor leaders criticized the removal of Wilcox, claiming it violated that precedent set by the supreme court, undermined the independence of the NLRB and in effect halted federal labor law enforcement in the US.

The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, held a rally in support of Wilcox outside the courthouse during Wednesday’s hearing.

“A week after taking office, President Trump effectively shut down the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and jeopardized the NLRB’s independence by illegally firing Wilcox, the first Black woman to serve on the Board,” said the AFL-CIO.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Five Democratic state Treasurers called for an end to the trade war with Canada and Mexico and warned impending tariffs will have detrimental impacts on everyday Americans.

State Treasurers Say No to Trade War

Democratic state treasurers from five states called for an immediate end to President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war with Canada and Mexico.

Speaking on a Zoom call on Thursday, the treasurers from Illinois, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon as well as Minnesota’s state auditor said the tariffs will have a detrimental effect on everyday consumers.

“The Trump trade wars are like a kid who stole a pickup and is doing donuts on your lawn. Even if he eventually gets that thing turned in the right direction, he still has wrecked your yard by the time he gets out,” said Minnesota’s state auditor Julie Blaha.

The warning comes just hours after Trump walked back the 25% tariff he placed on Mexican goods on Tuesday, writing in a social media post on Thursday, an exemption will be given to most goods for one month.

Cecelia Smith-SchoenwalderMarch 6, 2025



The exemption lasts until April 2 and will apply to goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

The agreement allows goods to move between the three countries without tariffs if they are made entirely in North America or are substantially changed in North America if they are made of parts from other countries. For larger items like cars, 75% of their content has to be from North America.

It is unclear at this time whether goods from Canada will be included as a 25% tariff was also placed on Canadian goods.

Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs called the trade war unnecessary and labeled it a Trump tax, adding that Americans will pay the price.

“We're going to see higher prices on a wide range of products: vegetables, meat, cell phones, cars. Those are starters, gasoline as well,” he said. “All of it is a Trump tax on American workers. If you're already struggling, this will add to your financial burden.”

Colorado State Treasurer David Young warned that the tariffs would have damaging effects for Coloradans if left unchecked, saying both Mexico and Canada are two of the state’s top trade partners and generate almost $10 billion.

“A tariff standoff will directly harm Colorado's cornerstone industries: agriculture, aerospace and advanced manufacturing. Without markets to sell to, we can expect companies to shutter,” Young said.

Oregon State Treasurer Elizabeth Steiner also underscored how her state would be impacted, saying China, Mexico and Canada all account for more than $15 billion a year in exports.

She said the tariffs threaten to further increase the cost of housing construction, making it harder for people to afford homes and threatening jobs in the construction industry.

“In turn, tariff price hikes are likely to make it harder for Oregon businesses to sell products that are integral to our state economy, such as computer chips and other electronics, agricultural products, machinery and other equipment,” Steiner said. “How are families and businesses supposed to plan if draconian tariffs keep getting announced, then delayed, then reimposed, then delayed? Maybe they're on some things and maybe not on others.”

Trump’s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration is a vocal critic of the medical establishment.

What to Know About Trump’s FDA Pick

Bill Clark|CQ-Roll Call, Inc|Getty Images

Dr. Marty Makary, nominee to be commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), appears before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for his confirmation hearing on Thursday, March 6, 2025, in Washington, D.C.




Trump’s pick to lead the FDA appears likely to gain Senate confirmation. 
He expressed a willingness to work with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to “Make America Healthy Again.”
Makary faced questions about a recently canceled FDA committee meeting as well as mifepristone, a pill used in medication abortions.
























Senators on Thursday pressed President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration on the agency’s recent cancellation of a vaccine advisory committee meeting as well as his policy plans for mifepristone, a pill used in medication abortions.

Martin Makary, a surgeon and public policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, expressed a willingness to work with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during his confirmation hearing. Kennedy, one of Trump’s most controversial Cabinet picks, has long eyed the FDA for reform, previously saying that “entire departments” within the FDA “have to go.”

If confirmed, Makary will lead the agency tasked with ensuring the safety and efficacy of food, drugs, medical devices and cosmetics. His confirmation is likely. Despite holding a very narrow 53-47 margin in the upper chamber, Republicans have maintained enough unity to successfully approve Trump’s slate of picks so far.

Makary would take over the agency shortly after the Trump administration fired hundreds of employees, including medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to hire some of them back.

Cecelia Smith-SchoenwalderMarch 5, 2025



Here is what to know about Makary and his goals at the FDA:

Makary is a surgical oncologist and a health care researcher who serves as the chief of islet transplant surgery at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Medicine. He has served at the World Health Organization’s Patient Safety Program and is a member of the National Academy of Medicine.

Makary has been a vocal critic of the medical establishment. While expressing support for universal masking and vaccines early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary later spoke out against vaccine mandates and prolonged school closures, and he was quoted as saying the federal government was the “greatest perpetrator of misinformation” about COVID-19.

""COVID has given us a clear-eyed look at a broken Food and Drug Administration that's mired in politics and red tape,"" he wrote in an October 2021 commentary published by Fox News. ""Americans can now see why medical advances often move at turtle speed. We need fresh leadership at the FDA to change the culture at the agency and promote scientific advancement, not hinder it.""

READ: 



Makary said his goals at the FDA would be very clear: “More cures and meaningful treatments for Americans, including diagnostics, healthy food for children and rebuilding the public trust.”

Makary said in his written testimony that he wants to create a “smarter FDA that works for all Americans.” He credited Trump and Kennedy for a “generational opportunity to usher in radical transparency and to facilitate more cures, meaningful treatments and diagnostics to empower people to take care of their health.”

“If confirmed, I hope to ensure the FDA holds to the gold standard of trusted science, transparency, and common sense to rebuild public trust and ‘Make America Healthy Again,’” he said, referencing a movement championed by Kennedy.

But some senators pushed Makary to distance himself from Kennedy and his previous controversial remarks on vaccines. Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado asked Makary if he’d be willing to be a “more enthusiastic supporter” of vaccinations.

“Vaccines save lives,” Makary responded. “I do believe that any child who dies of a vaccine-preventable illness is a tragedy in the modern era.”

One of the first questions senators asked Makary during his confirmation hearing on Thursday was for his view on the recent move by the FDA to cancel its annual meeting of members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee that was scheduled for March 13, where they recommend which influenza strains should be included in next flu season’s vaccine.

The meeting cancellation marked the second disruption involving a vaccine advisory group since Kennedy became HHS head. Last month, a meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was postponed.

While Makary said he would reconvene the advisory committee, he did not commit to rescheduling the canceled advisory meeting on selecting a flu vaccine, saying he would “reevaluate” the situation. He added that the committee had for years just followed World Health Organization recommendations.

Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana pushed back on Makary’s claim, pointing out the flu-strain recommendations from the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Program are based on surveillance of flu activity in the Southern Hemisphere.

“My understanding, though, is that since these (flu) strains typically begin like in Australia or China, it isn’t so much as a rubber stamp but as much as recognizing what you’re seeing because that’s what’s coming to us,” Cassidy said.

Cecelia Smith-SchoenwalderFeb. 28, 2025



When Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state asked what he planned to evaluate to determine whether to reconvene the advisory committee’s meeting on flu vaccine, Makary said he would work with the director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to evaluate which topics they felt were necessary for the advisory committee to meet.

“In conjunction with the center director of the biologics center, I would reevaluate which topics deserve a convening of the advisory committee members on VRBPAC and which ones may not require convening,” Makary said.

Mifepristone is a hot topic that Democrats are keeping a close eye on during the Trump administration.

The FDA approved mifepristone, a pill used along with one other drug in most medication abortions in the U.S., more than 20 years ago. Anti-abortion groups hope the Trump administration implements restrictions on the pill, such as a requirement to see a doctor in person before gaining access to the medication – effectively ending telehealth as an option.

Makary heard many questions about mifepristone during his hearing. But he was noncommittal on the topic, saying – much like Kennedy did at his own hearing – that he would take a look at the data.

“I have no preconceived plans on mifepristone policy except to take a solid, hard look at the data and to meet with the professional career scientists who have reviewed the data at the FDA and to build an expert coalition to review the ongoing data, which is required to be collected as a part of the REMS program – the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy,” Makary said.

The U.S.-Ukraine negotiations are all about achieving peace – and finding economic opportunity, experts say.

Ukraine’s Critical Minerals, Explained

Photo by Arsen Dzodzaiev|Anadolu via Getty Images

A view of the Zavalivskyi Graphite Plant, a Ukrainian enterprise specializing in the extraction of graphite ore and its processing for industrial needs in Zavallya, Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine on Feb. 28, 2025.




Talks over a potential U.S.-Ukraine agreement centered on access to revenues associated with Ukraine’s minerals recently stalled, a deal is still possible.
It’s not certain that Ukraine has any of the 17 rare earth elements, but the country does have other resources potentially of interest to President Donald Trump.
The deal could come with long-term economic opportunities and act as a blueprint for similar agreements with other mineral-rich countries, analysts say.




Critical minerals are all the rage right now.

Ever since President Donald Trump indicated he wanted access to Ukraine’s natural resources industry in exchange for U.S. aid amid the country’s war with Russia – an idea originally floated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a way to help fund the military effort – much has been said and written about critical minerals and rare earths. And the conversation is persisting even after an Oval Office blow-up between the two presidents last week threatened to kill the deal.

During his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said he will take “historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.” He also read aloud a letter from Zelenskyy himself, which noted Ukraine is “ready to sign” the minerals agreement “at any time that is convenient.”

Aneeta Mathur-Ashton March 5, 2025



Whether the deal comes to fruition is not a certainty. But as negotiations previously stood, the bilateral agreement would establish a “reconstruction investment fund” owned jointly by the two countries. Ukraine would contribute 50% of “all revenues earned from the future monetization of all Ukrainian government-owned natural resource assets into the fund,” including mineral deposits, oil, natural gas and other relevant infrastructure, according to a breakdown by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based nonprofit research organization.

“We are in an era of transactional foreign policy,” says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at CSIS and co-author of the article about the deal.

Here’s what to know about Ukraine’s minerals and why Trump is so focused on them.

First of all, Baskaran says, they should not be conflated with critical minerals – a term covering a wider range of resources. Rare earths make up a group of 17 elements that aren’t actually that rare but are “extremely difficult and expensive to extract and separate.” They are “really important” for national security because they’re in virtually every type of defense technology, such as warships, tanks, munitions, satellites and lasers. Rare earths also are found in advanced semiconductors, wind turbines and even an electric vehicle’s motor, she says.

While China, for instance, is the world’s largest producer of rare earths, the U.S. has a limited supply and wants “to start sourcing from elsewhere,” Baskaran adds. Enter Ukraine.

The catch: It’s unclear which rare earth elements Ukraine has access to, if any. Baskaran notes in an opinion piece published by The New York Times that there is no modern mapping of the country’s rare earth deposits, with the most recent surveys believed to have been conducted decades ago by the Soviet Union. Those surveys are not only old, but “not robust at all,” adds Morgan Bazilian, a professor and director of the Payne Institute for Public Policy at the Colorado School of Mines.

“The media and even parts of the administration are using the term incorrectly,” he says, referring to rare earth elements. “The point is that rare earths are not really and should not be the focus of any Ukraine deal. The country itself, I don’t believe, has ever produced rare earth.”

MORE: 



Ukraine does have other valuable commodities that don’t fall specifically in the rare earth element bucket but the U.S. still identifies as critical, such as graphite and titanium, according to Baskaran. The country also has produced manganese and has the “potential for reserves” of uranium and lithium, Bazilian says.

And the U.S. isn’t the only country interested in Ukraine’s minerals. France has been negotiating with Kyiv for months over mineral rights. Unlike the Trump deal, the French are not framing it as payback for assistance provided but as a revenue stream for the cash-strapped nation to secure resources as it continues to defend itself from Russian aggression.

In fact, long-time analyst Paul Goble suggested in his “Window on Eurasia” blog shortly after the Russian invasion that one of President Vladimir Putin's motivations was to secure Ukraine’s rare earth minerals and later in an analysis for the Jamestown Foundation tied it to a plan by Moscow to help China corner the global market on the precious resources.

On one hand, it’s a lever that can be pulled to help put Ukraine and Russia on the path to peace, and Baskaran says “ending war is in everyone’s interest.” It’s also, though, a way for Trump to “get something out of” the process – even if it’s really a long-term play. From Ukraine’s perspective, she adds, there is a lot of upside with the “potential economic recovery and investment” tied to the deal.

“The economic opportunities for these things matter a great deal more than where they sit in the earth’s crust,” Bazilian says, while adding there must come the “understanding that standing up a mining sector in a war-torn country is extremely difficult.”



The unfolding U.S.-Ukraine minerals talks, even if a deal is not finalized, could act as a blueprint for similar transactional negotiations with other countries as well. Officials from Congo recently pitched the U.S. on providing access to the country’s own critical minerals in exchange for security assistance amid its conflict with Rwanda. And Trump’s interest in taking over Greenland, a Danish territory, is reportedly rooted at least in part in its mineral deposits.

But the minerals craze also could be just a phase.

“I don’t think that they will stay at this level of political prioritization,” Bazilian says. “Nothing does.”

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested he may make it official U.S. policy that the U.S. won’t come to the aid of NATO members that don’t meet the alliance’s defence spending target if attacked, questioning whether those allies would do the same for America.

Trump has long complained the U.S. pays far more for defence than the rest of the alliance, and has called on members to increase their spending or risk not getting U.S. aid under NATO’s commitment to collective defence.

Asked if he would make that official U.S. policy, Trump replied: “I think it’s common sense, right? If they don’t pay I’m not going to defend them, no.”

He then justified his position by questioning if allies would defend the U.S. in the event of a future attack on America.

“You know, if the United States was in trouble, and we called them and said, ‘We have a problem, France, we have a problem … do you think they’re going to come and defend us? They’re supposed to. I’m not so sure,” he said.

The collective defence provisions of the NATO Treaty under Article 5 have been invoked only once in the alliance’s 75-year history: when the U.S. was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001.

At the time, the invocation was done by NATO leadership without a U.S. request, and led to limited allied military support in the leadup to American military operations against al-Qaida in the Middle East.

Trump, as he has done multiple times before, recalled he made a similar threat of withholding U.S. aid for “delinquent” members to NATO leaders directly during his first term as president. He has claimed that threat led to more members boosting their defence spending and hitting the two per cent spending target.

NATO leaders, as well as former U.S. president Joe Biden, have said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was behind the spending surge.

NBC News reported earlier Thursday that Trump was considering changes to U.S. policy toward NATO that would include prioritizing military exercises with members that meet their spending commitments, and withholding aid to members that don’t. Trump did not deny the report in the Oval Office.

The U.S. has long complained that Canada and a small number of NATO members still aren’t paying at least two per cent of GDP on defence, more than a decade after the alliance set that threshold. Canada spent around 1.3 per cent of GDP on defence last year.

The federal government has said it has a plan to hit the two per cent target by 2032 but may also speed up that timeline. Experts have told Global News it would be extremely difficult and take multiple hard spending and budget decisions to boost defence spending quickly and maintain it for years to come.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Thursday that Trump has made both the United States’ and his personal commitment to NATO clear.

“The transatlantic partnership remains the bedrock of our alliance,” Rutte added during a press conference held alongside Polish president Andrzej Duda in Brussels.

Trump’s nominee for NATO ambassador, Matt Whitaker, similarly told senators during his confirmation hearing this week that the U.S. commitment to NATO is “ironclad.” He said his primary objective if confirmed to the position would be to push Trump’s calls for greater defence spending and burden sharing from European members.

French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said Thursday that France is sharing intelligence with Ukraine, a move that followed the United States saying it was cutting off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine.

The move comes as European Union leaders gathered Thursday in Brussels, along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for a summit to discuss boosting defense spending and bolstering pledges of support for Ukraine in its battle against Russia’s invasion.

French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the talks that EU members would ""take decisive steps forward,"" while he expressed concerns about shifts in U.S. support for Ukraine under new President Donald Trump.

""The future of Europe does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow,"" Macron said.

Trump earlier in the week ordered the U.S. to suspend military aid to Kyiv’s fighters after his contentious meeting last week with Zelenskyy at the White House.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that the United States had also, for the moment, ended sharing its intelligence with Kyiv, although it could be short-lived after Zelenskyy said the exchanges with Trump in the Oval Office had been ""regrettable"" and that Ukraine was ready for peace talks with Russia.

""I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause [that prompted Ukraine's president to respond], I think will go away,"" Ratcliffe told the Fox Business Network.

""I think we'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have to push back on the aggression that's there, but to put the world in a better place for these peace negotiations to move forward,"" he said.

Since the start of the war in 2022, the United States has provided Ukraine with significant intelligence, including critical information its military needs for targeting Russian forces.

Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, told reporters Wednesday that the U.S. ""had taken a step back"" and that the administration was ""reviewing all aspects"" of its intelligence relationship with Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Waltz told CBS News that the U.S. is moving quickly to start peace negotiations to end the war and sign a mineral rights deal with Kyiv.

""I think we're going to see movement in very short order,"" Waltz said.

He said Trump officials will meet with Ukrainian officials as they conduct shuttle diplomacy with Russia.

""I have literally just been on the phone with my counterpart, the Ukrainian national security adviser, talking about times, locations, delegations,"" Waltz said.

Reaching a peace deal could prove difficult. Ukraine has long demanded a restoration of its internationally recognized 2014 borders before Moscow unilaterally seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Overall, Russia now holds about a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including much of eastern Ukraine, and has vowed to not return any of it to the Kyiv government.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Siemens plans to invest $285 million in manufacturing in the United States, the tech company said Thursday, including two new facilities in California and Texas.

The U.S. is the largest market for the company. The recent investments in the Siemens' U.S. manufacturing footprint and the planned acquisition of Altair, a Michigan-based software company, mark more than $10 billion in investment in the U.S.

“We believe in the innovation and strength of America’s industry. That’s why Siemens has invested over $90 billion in the country in the last 20 years. This year’s investment will bring this number to over $100 billion,"" Roland Busch, president and CEO of Siemens AG, said in a statement. “We are bringing more jobs, more technology and a boost to America’s AI capabilities.”

Siemens’ announcement comes as chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it plans to invest an additional $100 billion in the U.S., on top of $65 billion in investments the company had previously said it would make. That investment will be for three more chip manufacturing plants, along with two packaging facilities, in Arizona.

Siemens said it plans to open two manufacturing facilities for electrical products in Fort Worth, Texas, and Pomona, Calif. The company said it expects its latest investment to create more than 900 skilled manufacturing jobs, with the equipment produced in those factories supporting the U.S. commercial, industrial and construction sectors. The move will also allow the company to power AI data centers.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), shared details of a Pakistani national Syed Rizvi who arrived ""illegally"" in the US and was sent back on February 25.

In an X post shared on Thursday evening, the FBI said that it partnered with agencies across America to ""remove a Pakistani national identified as a national security priority.""

“The #FBI is partnering with agencies nationwide to support immigration enforcement operations. Learn how @FBIDallas, @ICEgov, and @ERODallas worked together to remove a Pakistani national identified as a national security priority.”

The statement issued by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), in this regard read, ""U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Dallas removed an illegally present Pakistani national identified as a national security priority to his home country Feb 25.""

ICE Dallas shared the details of the Pakistani national.

""Syed Rizvi, 56, a Pakistani national was ordered removed from the U.S. after being identified by U.S. intelligence sources as a national security priority, designated as removable per the Immigration and Nationality Act.""

It noted that Rizvi was residing in Dallas, Texas without authorization prior to his removal. ""ERO Dallas arrested Rizvi Jan. 31, following a routine traffic stop. He was ordered removed by an immigration judge Jan. 24. Rizvi entered the United States legally Sep.20, 2017 near the New York port of entry and he violated the terms of his admission"", the statement said.

Enforcement and Removals Operations Dallas Field Office acting Director Josh Johnson said, ""Illegal aliens suspected or known to have ties to organizations that threaten public safety will not find refuge in the US.""

He also added, ""Our most important priority is to arrest and remove those who pose an imminent danger to the citizens of the U.S.""

The details of Rizvi's deportation comes after FBI Director Kash Patel made a bold statement, reaffirming the US government's commitment to tracking down terrorists worldwide.

Patel's declaration came after a successful operation at Dulles airfield, where FBI personnel, along with DOJ and CIA partners, apprehended a terrorist wanted for the Afghanistan Abbey Gate murders in 2021.

Patel had said in a post on X, ""To terrorists around the world responsible for harming Americans: We will hunt the ends of the earth and find you.""

In the unforgiving expanse of the Arctic Circle, U.S., Finnish and other allied forces are transforming this frozen landscape into a proving ground for one of the most challenging combat environments on the planet.

Soldiers from the U.S. 11th Airborne Division, based in Alaska and known as America's cold weather warriors, are engaged in an Arctic war game alongside Finland's military. This collaboration aims to refine tactics and coordination as the global scramble for Arctic power intensifies.

Colonel Ari Mure of the Finnish Army, who is directing the exercise, outlines the core scenario.

""Finland is in trouble. We are at war. We need help. And Western countries are helping us,"" he explains, setting the stage for this critical training operation.

For U.S. soldiers like Lieutenant David Bucklin, leading a platoon in the 11th Airborne Division, these exercises offer invaluable learning opportunities. 

""My unit, Charlie Company, we're a light dismounted asset designed to strike deep,"" says Bucklin. ""Training with the Finns is always an awesome opportunity; their fluid movement and structure are something we aim to learn from.""

The Pentagon understands the strategic importance of mastering Arctic warfare. 

""It really does take a special kind of soldier and special training to be able to deal with an environment like that,"" explains Colonel Christopher Brawley, commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 11th Airborne Division. He emphasizes the brutal conditions, comparing operations at -40°F to the challenges of operating in space, where even the slightest error or exposure can be deadly.

He says they're preparing for this scenario: an adversary deciding to invade the Arctic Circle to claim for itself resource-rich terrain protected by international law. 

""That would trigger us to counter that competition,"" Colonel Brawley said.

Colonel Brawley also highlights the U.S. military's new Cold Weather All-Terrain Vehicle (CAT-V), describing it as a ""game changer"" for over-snow mobility in Arctic operations. The CAT-V was airlifted to Finland on a C-17 cargo plane, marking its first foreign deployment.

As the Arctic region becomes a pivotal strategic priority, the 11th Airborne Division is spearheading efforts to secure U.S. interests in the area. Colonel Brawley affirms the division is receiving more resources, including the CAT-V, to enhance its Arctic capabilities — an advantage not fully matched by adversaries.

This high-stakes training in Northern Finland underscores the urgency and complexity of preparing for potential conflicts in the Arctic. The soldiers' ability to adapt and thrive in such extreme conditions is crucial as nations increasingly vie for control over the resource-rich Arctic Circle.

Stay tuned for a coming episode of the Scripps News series, ""In the Shadows with Jason Bellini,"" focusing on Arctic warriors.","{'href': 'https://www.kristv.com', 'title': 'KRIS 6 News Corpus Christi'}"

U.S. President Donald Trump is making the race for critical minerals a key part of his agenda — and Canada’s rich reserves are a prime target for his ambitions.

Dozens of minerals are being increasingly traded around the world for technologies such as smartphones, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, as well as modern military equipment.

For years, the U.S. has been trying to reduce its reliance on China for those minerals, turning to like-minded producers like Canada.

“Canada has strategic reserves the U.S. doesn’t have a lot of,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical mineral studies program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a U.S. think tank.

Trump is now looking to accelerate that shift.

On Tuesday, he told a joint session of Congress he will be signing new executive orders this week that will “dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the U.S.A.”

But Trump is also pushing mineral-rich countries to join his cause — even by threatening their sovereignty.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told business leaders last month, in comments caught on a hot mic, that Trump’s repeated threats to annex Canada and make it the 51st U.S. state are “very real” because of the desire to control Canada’s critical minerals.

The White House hasn’t denied those ambitions, and Trump has talked openly about acquiring Greenland for its own mineral deposits, citing national security.

Trump is also pushing Ukraine to sign an economic agreement that would give the U.S. access to its critical minerals to ensure American backing in peace talks with Russia.

The agreement has yet to be sealed following a blow-up in the Oval Office last week between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had travelled to Washington to sign the deal.

Jose W. Fernandez, the former undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and environment who helped craft the Biden administration’s critical minerals strategy, said Trump’s “colonial” tactics are running counter to developing the positive trade relationships the U.S. needs.

“Deals are done … by two willing parties, and companies and countries don’t typically like to have a gun to their heads when they do a transaction,” he told Global News.

The Canadian government’s critical minerals strategy released in late 2022 identified 31 materials it classified as “critical.”

Potash — a key export to the U.S. used in fertilizers — aluminum, uranium and titanium are included in the list.

Six minerals — lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements — are particularly key and hold “the most significant potential for Canadian economic growth,” the government said at the time.

Those minerals are the ones most frequently found in sought-after components like rechargeable batteries and motors for EVs, as well as smartphones, solar panels, telecommunications and consumer electronics such as televisions.

The rise in artificial intelligence over the past two years has further increased demand for copper to power data centres and internet connectivity.

Canada has one of the world’s largest reserves of rare earth elements — elements Trump has frequently mentioned — and is a top global supplier of nickel, cobalt and lithium.

Although Canada exports far more critical minerals than it imports, according to Natural Resources Canada, a report last month from the Center for Strategic & International Studies found the U.S. imports between 50 and 100 per cent of 41 out of 50 critical minerals listed by the U.S. Geological Survey.

China has come to dominate the critical minerals industry, not just through its own vast reserves but also by buying controlling stakes in mining companies in Canada and other countries home to those minerals. At least 60 per cent of worldwide production is controlled by China.

“China has repeatedly shown its willingness to weaponize these minerals” through export restrictions and bans on several materials over the past two years, the CSIS report said, underscoring the need to reduce reliance.

“If they cut off supply of these critical minerals to North America, then that really creates a huge problem for the U.S. and for us, because we wouldn’t be able to produce any of this essential equipment as well as critical technology.”

Both Trump, during his first term, and Biden issued executive orders to strengthen and secure critical minerals supply chains in an effort to move away from China.

In 2022, when Fernandez was overseeing the U.S. State Department’s creation of the 15-member Minerals Security Partnership to broaden the critical minerals supply chain, he says Canada was the first country he reached out to.

That partnership led to investments in Canada and other mineral-rich member countries, as well as dialogue with a sister forum of 15 other producer nations — including Ukraine and Greenland.

“In my experience with producing countries, countries with a lot of resources — not just Canada, but Argentina, Chile, the Congo, Serbia, others — what they want is investment, and they want the right investment,” he said.

“They want investment that will benefit their people and will comply with their laws. No one’s looking to establish a colonial relationship.”

A separate report from CSIS said Canada would be a key critical minerals ally for the U.S., due to its more substantial mining and refining sectors and favourable business environment.

“While fears of a trade war have rattled U.S.-Canada relations, cooperation between the two countries remains essential to safeguard North American prosperity in the face of rising threats,” the report said.

In the wake of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico, Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Wednesday suggested U.S. reliance on nickel from Ontario, among other critical minerals, could be exploited in retaliation — including cutting off exports.

“Our key area — I’m telling you, it’s a key area — is those critical minerals,” Ford said. “That’s our linchpin, right there.”

At the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada convention in Toronto — one of the largest mining conferences in the Western Hemisphere — stakeholders said Canada should invest in boosting critical mineral production and diversifying its own supply chains.

“We have critical minerals in our country, and they’re just sitting there waiting for us to mine. This is our time.”

'Bar Rescue' host Jon Taffer weighs in on restaurants filing for bankruptcy and his show being renewed for its tenth season.

On the Border Mexican Grill & Cantina filed for bankruptcy protection this week as it struggled to compete in the macroeconomic environment. 

The Tex-Mex chain, owned by Argonne Capital Group, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia earlier this week after reportedly shuttering 40 locations. According to its bankruptcy filing, the company operates 80 locations in the U.S. and internationally. 

Like its rivals, the company said it has seen a decline in traffic in recent years, struggled to retain workers and faced growing costs as minimum wages rose, according to The Associated Press. 

FOX Business reached out to Argonne Capital Group for comment. 

RED LOBSTER IS BACK; CEO PLOTS FUTURE FOR SEAFOOD CHAIN

It's the latest in a growing number of major restaurant chains that have filed for protection in bankruptcy court after struggling to manage the heavy debt it accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic. It won't be the last, either, according to bankruptcy attorney Daniel Gielchinsky, who projected there will likely be more restaurants filing for protection over the coming years.

TGI Friday's, Denny's, Ruby Tuesday, Rubio's Coastal Grill and Red Lobster have filed for protection in bankruptcy court in recent years, with Hooters of America potentially joining the list. The company is considering filing for bankruptcy as a means of restructuring the restaurant chain and tackling its debt, sources recently told Bloomberg.   

The industry expected consumer spending at restaurants to return to pre-pandemic levels once things returned to normal. But the quick-service sector started facing slowing traffic in back-to-back quarters as inflation-wary consumers continued to eat at home more often.

HOOTERS LOOKING AT POSSIBLE BANKRUPTCY FILING

""Customers never came back in full force"" due to changes in their habits and spending ability, which meant top-line revenue never rebounded and debt-ridden restaurants were unable to repay those loans, according to Gielchinsky. 

Some companies that didn't file for bankruptcy significantly reduced their footprint to position themselves better in the current environment and drive traffic customers back to their restaurants. 

Red Robin announced as recently as this week that it is also considering closing 70 locations once their lease expires as it attempts to turn around its operations.

The company plans to sell three properties during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The sale of those locations is expected to generate $5.8 million, which the company anticipates will be used in part to repay its debt.

While financial results for fiscal 2024 ""fell well below"" the company’s original expectations, CEO G.J. Hart said the company has made ""substantial improvements to the guest experience"" to try and drive traffic back to its restaurants.

Economic data releases and earnings

After sampling an economic cocktail of inflation and slowing growth stirred up first by tariff uncertainty and now by actual tariffs, hints of another unsavory concept are wafting through: stagflation.

The Wall Street Journal is talking about it. Bloomberg is talking about it. And so is CNBC. Even bringing up the word is an indicator in and of itself, feeding a cycle of expectations and altered behavior.

Fresh data flashing weakness has reinforced the souring perception of the economy: Companies have eased up on hiring, and manufacturing activity has slowed. Commentary and modeling from market observers have also taken a turn. A risk of recession is back in the conversation. And Wall Street, fresh off the president’s joint address to Congress, is eying S&P 5,500 as well as S&P 6,000.

Stagflation's ominous specter — of lifeless growth and higher prices — is especially concerning because of the limited range of tools available to wrangle it. And as Apollo (our parent company's parent company) chief economist Torsten Sløk pointed out in a note to clients, ""A trade war, by definition, is a stagflation shock: Higher prices and lower sales.""

In the later phase of the Biden era, the Federal Reserve implemented generationally high rates in an effort to trample inflation. And to the delight of investors, it finally cut them at the end of last year, not as a rescue raft, but in the face of a resilient economy that had stayed solid as inflation moderated — a textbook soft landing.

In the new Trump context, Wall Street sees rate cuts arriving not with applause for vanquished inflation, but as a salve to reverse an economic slowdown and stave off a deteriorating labor market.

What, then, about nagging inflation, nagging even more as companies raise prices due to tariffs?

The Fed has delayed rate cuts this year because price increases aren't slowing fast enough. Chair Jerome Powell’s dual mandate is to maintain maximum employment and keep prices stable. But the stagflation brought on by tariffs — higher costs, fewer jobs — puts the Fed in a jam. The next round of cuts might ease the potential growth problem while exacerbating the pricing one.

Trump's second electoral victory primed the American electorate to connect pricing pressures with political leadership. Will relief come from the White House?

The president's economic advisers have already suggested that some sort of tariff compromise with Mexico and Canada could arrive soon. But Trump made plain during his speech that he will implement a whole new array of tariffs next month on friend and foe alike. The tariffs may go, but tariff uncertainty isn't going anywhere.

The nebulous goal seems to be a full rewrite of US participation in global trade to make ""America rich again."" Even if, as Trump said, ""There'll be a little disturbance,"" noting that ""we're okay with that.""

For investors eyeing a Fed likely fighting with one hand tied behind its back and a White House promising disruption, where should investor optimism come from? The confusion and uncertainty around US tariff policy might worsen, feeding into expectations of higher prices that can be self-fulfilling — and conservative spending and hiring.

How American businesses and consumers perceive coming price hikes can be just as influential as the prices themselves. Worrying about stagflation is like an incantation. It might not be here right now, but grasping for the words might be enough.

BREAKING: Futures Rise After Market Sell-Off



Broadcom (AVGO) late Thursday beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter and forecast sales above views for the current period. AVGO stock rose in extended trading.

The fabless chipmaker and infrastructure software provider earned an adjusted $1.60 a share on sales of $14.92 billion in the quarter ended Feb. 2. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $1.51 a share on sales of $14.62 billion in fiscal Q1. On a year-over-year basis, Broadcom earnings increased 45% while sales advanced 25%.

For the current quarter ending May 4, Broadcom forecast revenue of $14.9 billion, up 19% year over year. Wall Street was modeling $14.71 billion in sales in the fiscal second quarter.

Artificial intelligence chips and infrastructure software drove Broadcom's better-than-expected results, Chief Executive Hock Tan said in a press release.

""Q1 AI revenue grew 77% year over year to $4.1 billion and infrastructure software revenue grew 47% year over year to $6.7 billion,"" Tan said.

He added, ""We expect continued strength in AI semiconductor revenue of $4.4 billion in Q2, as hyperscale partners continue to invest in AI XPUs and connectivity solutions for AI data centers.""

Palo Alto, Calif.-based Broadcom makes custom AI server chips for Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) and TikTok owner ByteDance. Broadcom also reportedly has won custom AI chip projects with Apple (AAPL) and OpenAI.

In addition to application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), Broadcom makes networking and wireless connectivity products and owns virtualization software firm VMware.

In after-hours trading on the stock market today, AVGO stock jumped more than 8% to 194.69. During the regular session Thursday, AVGO stock sank 6.3% to close at 179.45.

Year to date through Thursday's close, Broadcom stock is down 22.6%.

Meanwhile, AVGO stock is on the IBD Tech Leaders list.

The temporary move expanded a carve-out issued for automakers a day earlier.

President Donald Trump on Thursday paused tariffs on some products from Mexico and Canada, temporarily withdrawing major portions of a policy issued two days earlier.

The one-month exemption will lift tariffs for all Canadian and Mexican goods compliant with United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a free trade agreement, White House officials told ABC News.

Roughly 50% of imports from Mexico comply with USMCA, and 38% of imports from Canada comply with USMCA. Motor vehicles and auto accessories make up a good portion of the of USMCA-compliant trade, the officials added.

Despite pausing tariffs on a large number of goods from Canada and Mexico, Trump said on Thursday afternoon he is still sticking with his plan to issue tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum products starting next week.

""We're not looking at that,"" he said at the White House when asked about a pause on those tariffs.

The easing of tariffs on some Mexican goods came after a conversation between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said Thursday in a post on Truth Social.

""Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!"" Trump said.

Minutes later, Sheinbaum reciprocated in similar fashion.

""We had an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results, within the framework of respect for our sovereignties,"" Sheinbaum said in a post on X.

Trump made the announcement soon after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Thursday morning that a one-month delay of tariffs on Mexico and Canada would likely apply to all products compliant with the USMCA.

Trump negotiated the USMCA during his first term, signing the agreement with Canada and Mexico in 2018.

""That which is part of President Trump's deal with Canada and Mexico [is] likely to get an exemption from these tariffs,"" Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday morning.

Despite the effort to ease some tariffs, stocks dropped on Thursday as fallout from the policy continued to roil markets.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 425 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 2.6%.

The selloff erased some of the market gains delivered a day earlier after Trump gave U.S. automakers a one-month reprieve from the tariffs. Duties on a host of other goods remained in place, however.

The U.S. earlier this week slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariffs on imports from China. The fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China last month.

The one-month delay in auto tariffs triggered a rally for shares of U.S. carmakers on Wednesday, but the largest companies in the sector turned down on Thursday.

Shares of Ford ticked down 0.4%, while General Motors fell 2.6%. Stellantis -- the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep -- saw its stock price fall 1%.

Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Elon Musk, tumbled 5.5% on Thursday.

The exemptions on automobiles from the president's tariffs were a one-time thing, Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday.

Trump said he told the automakers, ""'That's it.'""

The president added there would be some disruption resulting from the tariffs, but he brushed them off saying it would be ""short-term"" and adding that the tariffs have to be done.

""They'll always be a little short-term interruption. I don't think it's going to be big, but the countries and companies that have been ripping us aren't particularly happy with what I'm doing. But the United States will be very happy. And, you know, our farmers are going to be very happy,"" Trump said.

The tariffs were expected to pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada.

The American Automotive Policy Council, or AAPC, a trade group that represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, praised the one-month tariff exemption.

""American Automakers Ford, GM and Stellantis applaud President Trump for recognizing that vehicles and parts that meet the high US and regional USMCA content requirements should be exempt from these tariffs,"" AAPC President Matt Blunt told ABC News in a statement.

Michelle Stoddart and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.

What if the key to economic success isn’t just supporting entrepreneurs but thinking like one? 

Communities focus on attracting high-growth companies, but the real advantage comes when they adopt the same mindset as the innovators they seek to attract.

Legendary basketball coach John Wooden wisely noted, “Don’t mistake activity for achievement.” Entrepreneurs embody this principle. They don’t measure success by how many meetings they attend or how many pitches they make. Instead, they define bold visions, set clear milestones and track tangible progress. When something isn’t working, they adjust. Their success depends not on effort alone but on measurable results.

Economic development organizations and the communities they serve should adopt a similar approach. Often, there’s a focus on reporting past activities like companies recruited, jobs promised and capital invested without setting long-term outcome goals or assessing whether these efforts are the best way to strengthen the local economy. Key questions to consider include: Is household wealth increasing? How does our economy compare to peer communities? Are we positioned for future economic success? These are the real measures of economic health.

Venture capitalist John Doerr advocates for objectives and key results, a framework employed by leading innovative companies around the world. The concept is straightforward: set ambitious, measurable goals and adjust based on outcomes, not activities. Entrepreneurs thrive using this model and communities can, too.

Embracing this mindset is essential. Economic development must be as agile as the businesses it supports. By setting clear goals, tracking progress, and adjusting as needed, communities can move from activity to real achievement. Those that think like entrepreneurs won’t just attract innovators — they’ll become centers of innovation themselves.

John Moore is a principal with Momenteum Strategies, an Upstate-based consulting firm specializing in helping communities and their economic development organizations build thriving, impactful innovation ecosystems.

Watch CBS News


Updated on:  March 6, 2025 / 7:12 PM EST
          / AP
        

Walgreens Boots Alliance says it has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners as the struggling retailer looks to turn itself around after years of losing money. 

Walgreens said Thursday that Sycamore will pay $11.45 per share, giving the deal an equity value just under $10 billion. Shareholders could eventually receive up to another $3 per share under certain conditions. 

A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street's reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927. 

Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations. 

The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.

The company also said last August that it was reviewing a U.S. health care operation it had expanded aggressively, and it might sell all or part of its VillageMD clinic business. That announcement came less than two years after the company said it would spend billions to expand it. 

Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said. 

Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement. 

Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.

Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.

""Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,"" the analyst wrote. ""Without cash flow, none of the value cases work.""

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.

The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Remaining publicly traded drugstore operators include the nation's largest, CVS Health Corp., and retailers like Walmart and the grocer Kroger that run pharmacies at many of their locations.

Bundles of asparagus at a Nogales grocery store are among the fresh produce that are imported from Mexico. Local produce importers have been bracing for potential U.S. tariffs on all Mexican goods, which could impact their operations.

Two days after he implemented a 25 percent tariff on Mexican imports, President Donald Trump announced Thursday morning that the tariffs would be put on hold through April 2.

The temporary reprieve applies to all imports that fall under the parameters of the United State-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

AI agents, advanced software programs that act autonomously to perform specific tasks without human assistance, have become the latest buzzword in tech and business.

Nvidia's Vice President of AI Software, Kari Briski, told Entrepreneur that AI agents will change how we think about our daily tasks, from writing code and research papers to managing calendars and payroll.

""I think agents will transform the way we work,"" Briski said.

Kari Briski.

According to a Franklin Templeton 2025 technology outlook paper, AI agents have a variety of practical use cases for everyday life, from acting as tutors to planning meals to booking travel. In business, they can automatically ask and respond to customer questions by looking up answers in internal documents.

Meanwhile, companies from Salesforce to Nvidia have introduced their own AI agents with the intention of helping workers and customers make their lives easier.

But how does the technology actually help businesses?

Briski said that entrepreneurs and founders who want to start their own companies could tap into AI agents to write code and build business plans. Agents can even act as a ""sparring partner"" to brainstorm ideas or think through a situation.

""If you've ever noticed that you're a little bit more productive when you can spar off somebody, agents can provide that to help you be more productive,"" Briski said. ""Instead of having to go seek out an expert who might not have time, [it's] able to iterate now.""

Briski also noted that AI writing code has come a long way. In the past, the tech was focused on code completion, where AI finishes a line of code as programmers type it out. Now, AI agents write full programs on their own, making software developers ""10 times more productive,"" she says. This frees up time for the developer to focus on their system architecture, product, and end-user experience.

The technology can also help employees research markets faster by surfing the web, finding sources, and writing thorough research papers based on a prompt — complete with citations to the web sources they consulted to craft the paper.

Competitor OpenAI, for example, demonstrated its ChatGPT deep research agent earlier this year, which can create detailed reports with nearly 30 sources in about 10 minutes. OpenAI relies on Nvidia chips to power its AI products, though it is working on developing its own AI chips by the end of the year.

Briski noted that over the past two years, Nvidia's technology has saved ServiceNow, a cloud-based platform that helps businesses create and automate workflows, over 400,000 hours of human labor.

""AI agents offer complex decision-making capabilities and the ability to interact with and influence the environment,"" Briski said.

Nvidia did not disclose how much its software for enterprises to make AI agents costs, but IT support company Transputec estimates that the technology can cost anywhere from $0.99 per conversation for simpler tasks to $30 per hour for more complex ones.

Salesforce AI agents are priced at $2 per conversation and can be used for tasks like customer service and employee support. OpenAI is reportedly preparing PhD-level AI agents priced between $2,000 and $20,000 monthly. The company's ChatGPT Pro paid plan with deep research capabilities costs $200 per month.

""AI agents that are available as a service start off very expensive because they've got very big infrastructures and services,"" Briski said.

Still, the high price tag hasn't stopped companies from using AI agents. Accenture, Datastax, and Oracle all use Nvidia's AI to build agents for their companies.

Maine’s outgoing Marine Resources Commissioner Pat Keliher is sounding the alarm about the potential impacts newly-imposed tariffs on Canadian imports could soon have on Maine’s multi-billion dollar lobstering industry.

“The lobster industry in Maine and Canada has long-standing cooperative trade relations,” Keliher said in a statement provided to Spectrum News. “Those relations are critical to the health of the lobster industry on both sides of the border. Here in Maine, the lobster industry is a multi-billion dollar industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs and is the primary economic engine for our coastal economy.”

The reaction follows President Donald Trump’s initial tariffs against Canada and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. imports.

Keliher says U.S. tariffs on Canadian lobster will likely lower boat prices — the amount fishermen are paid at the dock for their catch — as dealers absorb the extra cost. 

“A reduced boat price resulting from the tariff will compound the economic challenges they already face from increasing fuel and bait costs,” said Keliher. “And will undermine their already stretched bottom lines.”

He also warns the tariffs will be “felt by everyone in the supply chain” — threatening the availability of Maine’s working waterfronts and the economic stability of Maine’s coastal communities.

“In addition to the financial burden this tariff will place on the Maine lobster industry, there will be other costs as well,” said Keliher. “The availability of working waterfront, which is already extremely limited, will be further eroded by the damage caused to Maine’s lobster industry.

Canada has not yet issued retaliatory tariffs on U.S. Lobster, but if they do Keliher says it will have devastating impacts. 

“If Canada responds with retaliatory tariffs on Maine lobster and other seafood, making our products more expensive and less competitive in the Canadian marketplace,” said Keliher. “It will further weaken the economic stability of Maine’s critically important seafood industry.”","{'href': 'https://spectrumlocalnews.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News'}"

PFLUGERVILLE, Texas — Like any devoted pet owner, Shemeka Clark loved her two dogs: Bella, a Shih Tzu and Pepper, a Maltese. For two years - when needed - she would board her dogs at Rafa's Paw House on Winter Wren Way in Pflugerville. 

""We really didn't have any issues,"" Clark said. ""We wouldn't have continued using them if we did have issues.""

On the day before Thanksgiving 2024, Clark received a text from the dog sitters, saying Pepper ran out the front door and they were searching for her. 

It was not until Clark arrived at their home when she says the pet sitter made a troubling revelation. 

""That's when he says, 'We found Pepper, and he paused. And we're looking like ... and he's like 'She's in this bag.',"" Clark recalled. ""And I just like broke down crying. No kind of accountability, no kind of apology. No, only thing he said was, 'I tried to tell you, I tried to tell you.'""

Clark says she did not take the bag home that day and instead hired a pet crematory service to pick up Pepper's body. Clark then reported the incident to the Travis County Sheriff's Office. 

According to an incident report, a deputy asked the dog sitters if they were running a kennel or had licenses. One of the pet sitters advised that they had been watching some dogs for the Thanksgiving holiday. 

The male sitter said they live in a neighborhood with a homeowner's association that does not allow businesses to be run out of their homes. 

The report also noted: ""The Homeowners Association has acted and informed the family that if they continue operating their dog-sitting business in violation of neighborhood rules, they could lose their house.""

Malu Guimaraes says she worked at Rafa's Paw House from May to July 2024. KVUE spoke with her and her mother Paula. 

Guimaraes said the two dogs died after being left in a hot garage without proper food or water. An incident report from July includes allegations matching her story.

Guimaraes says what she experienced still haunts her. 

""I can't see any dog or any animal sleep that my heart just ... I start to cry,"" Malu said. 

KVUE reviewed call logs from the Travis County Sheriff's Office regarding complaints about Rafa's Paw House from January 2022 to December 2024. 

There were at least three incidents of callers alleging their dogs had died. Two of the incidents were reported in July 2024. 

KVUE made multiple attempts to call and email Rafa's Paw House over the last few months. In January, KVUE got a hold of one of the sitters on the phone, who then said the business had closed. He also said KVUE would have to speak to his lawyer, but did not provide a phone number for an attorney and proceeded to disconnect the call. 

In a text message Thursday, the other pet sitter wrote in part: ""Any pet's untimely death is a tragedy for a family. And our thoughts and prayers go out for any family that has ever lost a pet.""

As Clark contemplates her next moves without her precious Pepper, what she now wants is justice. 

""Pepper didn't deserve to die the way she did. And I feel like I failed,"" Clark said. 

KVUE also reached out to the HOA management company that presides over the area where Rafa's was, but after several phone calls and emails, there was no response. 

According to the reports, animal cruelty charges were not filed by the Travis County Sheriff's Office, which is why KVUE is not naming the pet sitters. 

The report also showed that Clark was advised to pursue the case in civil court, but she said she is not sure which route to take. ","{'href': 'https://www.kvue.com', 'title': 'KVUE.com'}"

      Walgreens’s almost centurylong run as a public company is coming to an end. The embattled drugstore chain has struck a deal to be taken private by Sycamore Partners in one of the biggest leveraged buyouts in recent memory.


     
      Sycamore has agreed to pay $11.45 a share in cash for Walgreens Boots Alliance, representing an equity value of around $10 billion and 29% above where the stock was trading last year. Shareholders could also receive up to an additional $3 a share down the road, based on proceeds from selling the company’s primary-care assets.


     
      The total value of the deal, including debt and the potential future payouts, would be almost $24 billion. The companies expect the deal to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.


     
      The sale is the culmination of a decade of struggles for a historic American retailer with thousands of pharmacies that are fixtures on neighborhood street corners. The market value of Walgreens Boots Alliance surpassed $100 billion in 2015 but had been battered in recent years. Walgreens originally went public in 1927.


     
      The company’s new owners will now have the chance to fix the business out of the public eye.


     
      “Going private is going to let us be more focused, more nimble, more long-term in our decision-making, in the context of the challenges that we continue to face,"" said Chief Executive Tim Wentworth. “That gives us both the time and the ability to focus in a way to transform Walgreens.""


     
      Wentworth, who took over as Walgreens CEO in October 2023, had embarked on a turnaround effort. The company has said it plans to shed around 1,200 stores over three years.


     
      But its shares had generally continued to languish, with investors skeptical about the long-term growth prospects of a company built around the difficult retail-pharmacy business.


     
      Wentworth said the deal is a good one for shareholders and allows them to avoid the risk as the company works to change its trajectory.


The retail strugglesFixing the company won’t be easy.

     
      Walgreens had failed to stay ahead of forces reshaping retail and healthcare, including the rise of e-commerce and the growing power of the drug-industry players known as pharmacy-benefit managers, which negotiate pricing with pharmacies and manufacturers.

     
      While Amazon.com and others stole business from the front of the Walgreens stores, pharmacy-benefit managers squeezed margins on the prescriptions dispensed at the back of the stores.

     
      The combined assault made the stand-alone retail pharmacy business a tough sell to investors. When the company cut its longstanding dividend, investors grew even more frustrated.

     
      Stefano Pessina, a veteran dealmaker, merged Alliance Boots with Walgreens in 2014 in a bid to cement a global pharmacy behemoth. The combined company was still built on retail pharmacy, though.

     
      Walgreens missed on an attempt to connect with a health insurer, the strategy pursued by rival CVS Health. A later plunge into primary-care clinics also failed to turn the tide.

     
      Pessina stepped down as Walgreens’s CEO in 2021 and remains chairman and the biggest individual shareholder, with about a 17% stake in the company. As part of the deal with Sycamore, Pessina has agreed to roll his stake entirely back into the business and maintain a significant ownership.

     
      Wentworth launched a strategic review after he took over. The new CEO said the takeaway was that retail pharmacy was central, but it needed to change.

     
      Wentworth said Sycamore, which has a long history in the retail business, was the right partner because it brings expertise and a record of overseeing turnarounds. The company will remain based in the Chicago area.

     
      Walgreens had failed to stay ahead of forces reshaping retail and healthcare

A big bite for SycamoreThe Wall Street Journal first reported in mid-December that Sycamore was in talks for a deal and earlier this week reported that talks were advanced.

     
      The transaction would rank among the largest leveraged buyouts globally in the past decade, at a time when there have been fewer such big deals with public-company valuations and interest rates remaining elevated.

     
      The deal also includes a so-called go-shop period for Walgreens to solicit other potential suitors for 35 days.

     
      Sycamore is a retail specialist but has never tried as big a deal as Walgreens, which will test its strategies. The firm has been discussing splitting up the company’s business divisions and financing them individually, according to people familiar with the matter. It is a playbook Sycamore has followed in the past, including when it bought office-retailer Staples in 2017 have been sitting on the sidelines and waiting on an M&A rebound. There weren’t any deals announced in the U.S. in February that cleared $10 billion. It was the first month without such a deal since January 2023, according to data provider LSEG.

     
      Centerview Partners served as Walgreens’s lead banker, and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis was the company’s legal adviser. UBS Investment Bank was the lead banker to Sycamore, with Davis, Polk & Wardwell acting as legal counsel. Morgan Stanley also advised Walgreens, and Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citi and Wells Fargo also helped advise Sycamore.

""This lawsuit is an affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact,"" writes Thomas Riney, a lawyer for CBS, in the filing.


							By 

	Winston Cho



	Without a settlement in sight, Paramount Global is looking to dismiss President Trump’s lawsuit against its CBS News unit from a federal court in Texas, which has become a hot spot for legal battles advancing conservative legal causes.


	CBS is incorporated in New York, but Trump’s legal team chose to sue in the Northern District of Texas, prompting concerns that he’s cherry-picking judges by filing the lawsuit at a court where a sympathetic judge is likely to oversee the case. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who’s overseeing the litigation, was nominated to his position by Trump in 2017 and has been a member of the Federalist Society since 2012. In his five years on the bench, he’s issued rulings to block Biden-era rules regarding immigration, health care and discrimination. He’s the only judge in the Amarillo division of the court, making it a near certainty that he’s assigned cases filed at that location.

	“This lawsuit is an affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact,” writes Thomas Riney, a lawyer for CBS, in the filing. Trump seeks to “punish a news organization for constitutionally protected editorial judgments they do not like.”


	Last month, Trump revised his lawsuit to add Republican U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, his former doctor who lives in Texas, as a plaintiff to keep the case in Texas federal court. The case revolves around allegations that CBS News aired a “heavily tampered interview” with former Vice President Kamala Harris to help her in the election by editing certain answers in a way that misled consumers. This manipulation of the interview, Trump alleged, constitutes a violation of Texas’ consumer protection law covering deceptive advertising and the unfair competition prong of the Lanham Act, a trademark law.


	In Thursday’s filing, CBS argues that the inclusion of Jackson in the lawsuit is a “vain effort to manufacture a connection to this District.” It stresses that Jackson has spent the majority of the last decade based in Washington, D.C. and that the complaint doesn’t sufficiently allege that he watched or suffered an injury from the 60 Minutes segment at the center of the legal battle in the state.


	CBS also says that the lawsuit doesn’t belong in Texas because the 60 Minutes segment, which was focused on the national presidential election, didn’t target Texans more than residents of other states.

	











	“The interview of Vice President Kamala Harris, excerpts of which aired on Face the Nation and 60 Minutes, was not filmed, edited, or produced in Texas, nor was Texas in any way the subject of the interview,” the filing states. “If this district has personal jurisdiction merely because CBS programs are broadcast nationwide, so too does every district court in the country. That is not the law.”


	If the lawsuit isn’t dismissed, CBS claims that it should be moved to federal court in New York.

US President Donald Trump said Thursday he planned to visit Saudi Arabia, suggesting a deal for major investment from the kingdom that has become the key venue for US diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine.

Trump, asked if he would meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia, confirmed his intention to visit the oil-rich Gulf nation but suggested that business was the main motive. 

""I'm going to Saudi Arabia,"" Trump told reporters, without mentioning a date.

""I said, I'll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies, (spreading) the purchase over a four-year period, of a trillion dollars,"" he said, referring to the duration of his presidency.

""They've agreed to do that, so I'm going to be going there.""

Trump, who has yet to travel overseas since returning to the White House, made Saudi Arabia his first foreign destination after he took office in 2017.

He said recently that he decided to visit Saudi Arabia rather than Britain on his first trip in 2017 because the Arab kingdom promised to buy $450 billion worth of US products.

Trump has forged close business ties with Saudi Arabia, with the Trump Organization in December announcing a Trump Tower in Jeddah.

In his last term, Trump boasted of shielding Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from consequences over the killing of US-based Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, with the president citing the importance of Saudi purchases of US weapons.

Former president Joe Biden initially vowed to make the crown prince a ""pariah"" due to human rights but his administration later courted Saudi Arabia, including with a draft defense agreement, as it sought to encourage it to recognize Israel.

The Trump administration has vowed to move full-speed with trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to normalize with Israel, in what would be a landmark step as the kingdom is home to Islam's two holiest sites.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Delaware approves $30.2 million taxpayer-funded grant for Merck to build in state,https://www.delawareonline.com/story/money/business/2025/03/06/merck-manufacturing-facility-delaware-council-development-finance-grant/81358137007/,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 10:13:22 GMT","

Pharmaceutical giant Merck received a $30.2 million grant from the state in an effort to sway the company to build its $900 million manufacturing facility in the Wilmington area.

The taxpayer-funded grant is the highest amount that has been doled out to a company since Bloom Energy’s approval in 2011.

Merck & Co. has not confirmed whether or not it will choose Delaware as its place to expand, but business leaders in Delaware are optimistic about what the potential move could mean for the state.

Merck & Co. is a global health care company that specializes in the production and distribution of vaccines, pharmaceuticals and animal health care products.

Merck has been looking for a location to set up their newest manufacturing facility, which will produce drug substances and products with a targeted operational start date of 2030.

According to plans shared with Delaware Online/The News Journal via a Freedom of Information Act request, the company is considering constructing a $900 million multi-building complex for labs, manufacturing and distribution operations at the Chestnut Run Innovation and Science Park near Greenville.

Under the conservative estimates listed in the plans, the facility would bring roughly 375 full-time jobs to the area.

The company is reportedly still considering other locations, but is bound by nondisclosure agreements to reveal more about the other possibilities, as reported by the Delaware Business Times.

If Merck chooses the Delaware site, the company would be locked into a 20-year lease at the CRISP campus.

This wouldn’t be Merck’s first venture into the First State, however. The company already has an animal health facility in Millsboro.

The Delaware Council on Development Finance unanimously approved the grant application on Monday, Feb. 24.

The grant was divided into $4.7 million worth in job performance grants and $25.5 million in capital expenditure grants. The performance grants are dispersed after the company makes its investments into the facility and workforce.

Although nothing is promised yet, Michael Fleming, president and CEO of the Delaware Bioscience Association, remains optimistic and said that this deal could cement Delaware as a winner in the area in terms of attracting industrial and scientific investment.

“This new facility would be a tremendous boost for and validation of the growth and momentum of our dynamic life science industry,” Fleming said. “We look forward to welcoming Merck and applaud their interest in strengthening U.S. manufacturing and our supply chain right here in Delaware.

Susan Colby, senior manager of communications for the Delaware Prosperity Partnership echoed that the move would boost Delaware’s portfolio.

“This project would reinforce Delaware’s standing in the global biopharmaceutical ecosystem, and we are excited by the potential opportunities it would provide Delaware residents and businesses,” Colby said.  

As for what Merck has to say about the grant, Ned Ehrbar, associate director of Merck’s global media relations kept it vague, stating via email: Merck is considering Delaware as a potential location to develop a new commercialization and launch facility.

The CRISP campus, located at 984 Centre Road just outside of Greenville, has long been a mainstay in the state’s evolving life sciences investment.

Formerly a site for DuPont research, the 164-acre site was purchased by MRA Group in 2021 with hopes of transforming the site into the leading campus for Delaware’s life science laboratories and research facilities.

Amenities for the campus will include a hotel, childcare and fitness centers, an outdoor amphitheater and accommodations for restaurants.  

Chemical manufacturing company Solenis expanded its research and development facilities into the CRISP campus in late 2022 and precision oncology company Prelude Therapeutics cut the ribbon on their new headquarters at CRISP in February, 2024. DuPont is also leasing 190,000 square-feet of space at its former space.

Last month, the developer group broke ground on the Marriott Residence Inn, which will feature 127 rooms with both short- and long-term stay options, food services, a full-service bar, meeting spaces and outdoor patios

MRA Group declined to comment on the recently approved grant for Merck.

Awarding these grants worth tens of millions of dollars involves a process that is relatively new, with various “checks and balances” in place, but limited transparency at times.  

The Delaware Economic Development Authority was created by the General Assembly under former Gov. John Carney, intended to promote economic activity in Delaware. It is chaired by CJ Bell, the director of the Delaware Division of Small Business.

The Council on Development Finance is an advisor to the Delaware Economic Development Authority, and is responsible for conducting public hearings before the authority issues any financial support to potential projects.

The Delaware Prosperity Partnership, a nonprofit state economic development agency, often vets applications or potential investment opportunities and brings them to the Council. As previously reported by DelawareOnline, since DPP is not technically a part of the state government, it is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.

In the seven years of its existence, the Council on Development Finance has approved every Strategic Funds application that has been brought to it by the Delaware Prosperity Partnership.

The $30 million grant offered to Merck will be reimbursed after the company makes its investment – in this case, a nearly $1 billion one.

In 2021, the Council on Development Finance approved $19 million for WuXi AppTec, a Shanghai-based company that develops and manufactures drugs for pharmaceutical clients, to build its manufacturing campus near Middletown’s Amazon fulfillment center.

Gov. Matt Meyer has gone on record against these types of taxpayer-funded grants, announcing during a Delaware State Chamber of Commerce annual dinner that his administration will see “the use of cash assistance de-emphasized,” as reported by Spotlight Delaware.

Meyer’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the most recent grant funding.

Australian shares fell to its lowest close in more than six months.

The ASX 200 and the All Ordinaries index both ended Monday's session 1.8 per cent lower, wiping off about $50 billion in market value.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index fell 1.8 per cent, or by 146.5 points, to 7948.2 at close - the worst fall for the Australian indices since September last year.

The index is down more than 7.5 per cent from its all time high of 8,615.2 on February 14, and has fallen for four straight sessions amid uncertainty over US trade policy announcements.

The Australian dollar was 1.7 per cent stronger against the greenback for the week, buying 63.06 US cents.

Embattled casino group Star Entertainment will stay alive, for now, after securing a $53 million lifeline in return for selling its 50 per cent stake in the new Brisbane casino.

Star has been in talks with the owners of the other half of Brisbane's Queen's Wharf development — Hong Kong investors Far East Consortium International and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises — since mid-February.

On Friday afternoon, Far East Consortium confirmed a deal had been struck, in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Under the deal, in return for Star Entertainment's 50 per cent stake in the Queen's Wharf precinct, it will acquire the Hong Kong parties' two-thirds stake in the Gold Coast project.

It's known that rebuilding efforts from natural disasters positively impact GDP (i.e. bump it up) since the recovery expenses are counted but the losses are not. Are there any estimates for the net effect on GDP of natural disasters like cyclones or floods?

- Charles

Thanks for the question Charles.

From time to time the ABS measures natural disasters such as droughts, cyclones, floods and storms with the associated impacts reflected in economic statistics.

As it notes on its website, ""these events will have had an impact on all aspects of the Australian economy to varying degrees"".

Sometimes the impact is identifiable in ABS's various statistical releases after the event.

Sometimes, the modelling looks at the impact of one-off large scale disasters like cyclones. So that could very well happen in the coming months.

The Insurance Council also often puts out detailed reports on the economic impacts of natural disasters.

We will keep an eye out for any reports and report them for you over the coming weeks and months.

In the meantime, you could listen to this podcast re Why Cyclone Alfred could boost the next GDP figure.

Star Entertainment will receive a $53 million payment, in an asset swap deal with its Hong Kong investors Far East Consortium International and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises.

Under the deal, Star will sell its 50 per cent stake in its Queen's Wharf precinct in Brisbane to the two parties and, in turn, acquire the parties' 66.67 per cent stake in the Gold Coast project in Queensland, Far East confirmed a short time ago.

Star has yet to issue a statement to the stock exchange — we'll keep you updated when it does

National credit card debt hit $18 billion in January 2025 — the highest level of debt accruing interest since August 2021.

The Reserve Bank's credit card statistics showed credit card debt accruing interest rose by $172 million (up 1 per cent) in January.

It is the fourth consecutive month credit card debt has risen (excluding commercial cards).

Canstar analysis of RBA figures shows credit card debt attracting interest charges has risen every January since 2015.

Australians are paying $9.2 million in interest charges per day on a collective credit card debt of $18.02 billion, at the average interest rate of 18.71 per cent.

""That's money that could be far better spent on groceries, rent or mortgage repayments.,"" Canstar's Sally Tindall said.

The total value of credit card transactions rose by $21 million in January compared to the previous month.

Overall, spending on both debit and personal credit cards rose by $207 million in the month and $3.1 billion compared to the same time one year ago.

Canstar analysis of RBA credit card statistics and in-house survey data shows that of those with credit card debt, the average amount owing is estimated to be $4,420.

Costco Wholesale would consider making changes to its international supply chain if tariffs from US President Donald Trump lead to big price hikes, chief executive Ron Vachris said on a conference call.

The membership-only retailer missed Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit, but beat expectations on revenue.

Mr Vachris said while it was difficult to predict the impact of tariffs, about a third of Costco's sales in the US are imported from other countries and less than half of those are items coming from China, Mexico and Canada.

Costco could mix up its supply chain if tariffs prove painful, he said, and source from countries not exposed to them.

""As far as the tariffs go on the grocery items, our buyers deal with those like they would any other cost increase,"" he said.

""Sometimes the margins are much tighter in those categories, but they [buyers] are prepared to work closely with the suppliers and see how efficient we can bring goods to market - is there anything we can mitigate in those categories.

""The tariffs are very fluid right now. So it's hard to really give any predictions on what we can do, but we are prepared, our people are very well equipped to lower prices and defer any cost increase that come our way.""

Costco currently operates 897 warehouses, including 617 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, seven in China, five in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand and Sweden.

The retail giant's second-quarter revenue increased to $US63.72 billion, from $US58.44 billion during the same quarter in fiscal 2024.

Net sales for the quarter rose 9.1 per cent to $US62.53 billion, compared to $US57.33 billion in the year-ago period.

Membership fees for the quarter hit $US1.19 billion, up from $US1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2024, with the company reporting 78.4 million paid memberships and 140.6 million total cardholders.

Worldwide, Costco’s membership renewal rate came in at 90.5 per cent, an increase of 0.1 per cent from last quarter.

Canadian dairy giant Saputo has sold Tasmanian cheesemaker King Island Dairy's facilities and brand to a new Australian owner.

The sale comes after more than a year on the market and the threat of closure hanging over it.

The dairy giant did not name those involved in the new entity but said it was being led by ""two experienced Australian businessmen with supply chain and manufacturing expertise"".

According to the corporate watchdog ASIC the entity was registered on March 3 this year, and lists Melbourne businessmen Nicholas Dobromilsky and Graeme Wilson as its directors.

""The buyer will make their own announcement in the coming days,"" Saputo said.

Why is ASX gradually falling since Trump is putting Tariffs on certain countries & why is this affecting my superannuation?

- Michael Langley 

Hi Michael,

While Australia isn't directly targeted by these new tariffs, economists have been warning for weeks that that a full-blown trade war could see global trade slow.

Let's not forget China remains our largest trading partner. If its economy takes a hit, so likely, will ours.

A trade war will especially impact Australia's resource exports — iron ore, coal, and natural gas - which are crucial to our economy.

A full-blown trade war could also impact the direction of local interest rates and the Aussie dollar — which has already faced much volatility.

And it knocks about investor confidence, which could see a more rocky sharemarket and a hit to your super savings.

In summary, it just makes the landscape more volatile and uncertain. Let's hope the worst isn't yet to come!

Hi Nassim . US government says it will only increase bitcoin reserve by “forfeiture”. How does that work when there is no physical coin?

- Phillip

Great question Phillip.

It isn't really clear how such a reserve would work or how it would benefit American taxpayers.

As noted, White House-appointed 'AI and Crypto Czar' David Sacks revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump signed an executive order to establish a ""strategic Bitcoin"".

Sacks said the US government will have a strategy to maximise the value of its holdings in such a reserve, but he didn't offer details as to how.

With the RBA's easing cycle now underway, and with underlying inflation continuing to moderate, more interest rate cuts are likely but homeowners may need to wait a little longer in the year, says Bendigo Bank's chief economist David Robertson.

""Market pricing now matches our forecast of two more rate cuts, taking the cash rate down to around 3.6 per cent by year-end,"" Mr Robertson said in an economic note released on Friday.

""We continue to expect a relatively shallow easing cycle, and agree with the RBA that it would be foolish to rely on an April 1 cut (when they next meet), however the next quarterly CPI data out on April 30 should reveal more evidence that inflation is slowing, allowing a second rate cut on May 20.

""Our base case forecasts centre on a steady improvement in GDP growth in 2025 and cost of living pressures subsiding as inflation moderates, further helped by RBA rate cuts and last year's tax cuts, but the global backdrop remains as unpredictable as ever.""

He said with US tariffs now in force, the global outlook looked ""increasingly opaque"".

""US tariffs on trade with Canada, Mexico and China have just commenced, and beyond the uncertainty of what other tariffs will be imposed (and whether Australia will be exempted from them) the geopolitical landscape is remarkably complex and fast-moving, Mr Robertson said.

""Any global forecasts need to consider upside and downside scenarios, including the indirect impact of trade tensions on our largest trade partner China.

""Chinese fiscal support and targeted stimulus measures have proved successful so far and more policy support is expected, while exchange rates are also likely to play their part in offsetting tariffs.""

""But the further down the horizon we look, the more opaque the outlook becomes, and stock markets are also looking more cautious as the broader impact of tariffs takes shape.""

The price of Bitcoin plummeted on Friday after the US government signalled it would not acquire additional cryptocurrencies for its strategic reserve beyond its current holdings.

US President Donald Trump had sent the crypto world into a craze declaring during his reelection campaign that he would make America the the ""crypto capital of the world.""

He's also spent the past few months talking up a government strategic reserve that would hold bitcoin, ethereum as well as some other coins.

But White House-appointed 'AI and Crypto Czar' David Sacks revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin.

According to Sacks, the US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve, instead keeping it as a store of value. He likened the reserve to a ""digital Fort Knox"" for the cryptocurrency often referred to as ""digital gold.""

The reserve will be funded with Bitcoin owned by the federal government, obtained through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.

The executive order creates a US digital asset stockpile but the US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve.

The government will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

As a result Bitcoin slumped below $US85,000 on Friday. It's still trading down more than 3 per cent at US$87,042.06.

My colleague David Chau did a nice read in December on the promises Trump's been making on crypto and what a strategic reserve actually means. You can read that here:

Household spending rose 0.4 per cent in January, driven by Aussies spending more on areas including doctors visits and travel.

This follows a 0.2 per cent rise in December and a 0.8 per cent rise in November, according to seasonally adjusted figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

But nominal household spending slowed sharply to 2.9 per cent over the year to January, the slowest rate since September 24.

ABS head of business statistics Robert Ewing said that while spending on goods pushed up overall spending in late 2024, a 1.5 per cent rise for services drove the January growth.

In this category, health had the largest rise (+2.5 per cent), as households spent more on doctor and hospital visits.

Transport spending rose 1.1 per cent, driven by air and sea transport, as households booked in their travel plans for the year ahead.

Spending on the operation of vehicles, including petrol and motor vehicle repairs, also contributed to the rise.

But lower spending on new vehicle purchases reduced overall growth in household spending.

Also partly offsetting these rises were 1.5 per cent falls for furnishings and household equipment and clothing and footwear.

Overall goods spending fell 0.6 per cent in January, after rising for three months in a row.

Mr Ewing said the fall comes after households took advantage of promotional activity like Black Friday sales, which drove strong goods spending at the end of 2024.

The Albanese government recently introduced changes to ensure that telecommunication providers who are caught breaching industry codes will no longer be warned before being slapped with new multi-million dollar fines.

The changes allow the Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) to take direct and immediate enforcement against telcos that have breached their obligations to customers.

Currently, ACMA must respond to breaches of co-developed industry codes with a direction to comply before taking enforcement action with fines capped at $250,000.

The Albanese government's proposed change would allow ACMA to take enforcement action immediately and seek fines of up to $10 million for industry code breaches.

But a group of 22 consumer advocates known as the Fair Call Coalition has written to ACMA urging the regulator to refuse to register the Telecommunications Consumer Protections (TCP) Code and instead support direct regulation of Australia's telco industry.

Consumer Action Law Centre CEO Stephanie Tonkin said the telco industry's self-regulating code ""has manifestly failed to protect consumers, especially those who are in vulnerable situations"".

""It is out of step with community expectations and other essential services sectors like energy,"" Ms Tonkin said.

Ms Tonkin acknowledged that Communications Minister Michelle Rowland had taken some welcome steps in strengthening the ACMA's enforcement powers but said ""the time has come to turn the page on the Code"".

""We continue to hear from callers to our frontlines of egregious examples of telco mis-selling and harm due to poor sales practices and credit assessment requirements,"" she said.

""The low standard of consumer protections in many areas of the Code has not changed and its time this Code was thrown in the bin and direct regulation implemented.""

Peter Gartlan, co-CEO of Financial Counselling Australia, added that everyone needs access to telecommunications services and said consumers aren't getting adequate protection.

""A self-regulating code just doesn't cut it,"" Mr Gartland said.

Tony Sycamore from IG has circulated a note that highlights how dire the price action has been on the stock market in recent weeks.

Here's what he's written:

""The horrific price action in the ASX200 has continued today, slipping below 8,000 for the first time in almost six months.

""This week's fall has seen the correction in the ASX200 from its 8615 high deepen to approximately 7.25%, a move that has unfolded in just four weeks. 

And he continues:

The falls this week have been driven by several factors, including US trade policy uncertainty at a time when fears of a looming US recession are rising. Locally, the falls have been exacerbated by more weakness in the big banks and worsened after BHP, RIO, South32, and energy giant Woodside all traded ex-dividend.

If the break below the psychologically important 8000 level is confirmed at the close of business today, it would open the way for the sell-off to extend towards 7600. A pullback to 7600 would be an 11% correction from the February 8615 high.

As for a potential catalyst for a turnaround in the ASX200, there isn't a clear one currently. US trade and tariff policy appears likely to remain volatile, and the upcoming Federal Election adds to the uncertainty, with the possibility of a hung parliament.

Mr Sycamore circulated that note 20 minutes ago. When he wrote it, the ASX200 index was trading at 7,996 points having lost 98 points (-1.22%).

But as I write, the ASX200 index is lower again, at 7,977 points (-1.45%).

Embattled casino operator Star Entertainment says it has been unable to reach a deal with Hong Kong investors to buy its stake in Brisbane's Queen's Wharf development.

Yesterday, there were media reports that Star was ""on the brink"" of inking a deal with its joint venture partners Chow Tai Fook and Far East Consortium, to buy its 50 per cent interest in the development.

This morning Star confirmed it has been in discussions, as it flagged in mid-February, but said it has been ""unable to reach an agreement"" to date.

The European Central Bank has cut interest rates as expected on Thursday and kept the door ajar to more, even as a looming trade war with the US and plans to boost military spending drive Europe's biggest economic policy upheaval in decades.

ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters in Frankfurt “we have huge uncertainty. Some people have used the adjective phenomenal uncertainty and we debated as to whether it was high, high and rising.”

Easing for the sixth time since June, the ECB lowered its deposit rate to 2.5% in a nod to slowing inflation and faltering growth, and said that rates were still restricting growth, even if less so than in the past.

That wording suggests that more rate cuts may be coming as the bank has long declared that restriction is no longer necessary while inflation, at 2.4% last month, is safely heading back to its 2% target this year.

The ECB lowered its 2025 economic growth forecast for the fourth straight time on Thursday, putting expansion in 2025 at just 0.9, only slightly above the 0.7% pace recorded last year.

Inflation was meanwhile seen at 2.3% this year, above the 2.1% seen three months ago.

The Australian share market is off to a gloomy start on Friday.

The ASX 200 index lost 81 points or 1 per cent to 8,014, by 10:15am AEDT.

Ten out of the 11 sectors are in the red, with basic materials (+0.1pc) the only sector that's bucking the trend.

Real estate (-1.8pc), financials (-1.7pc) and tech (-1.5pc) led the losses in the first 15 minutes of trade.

Shares of wealth manager Insignia rose 12% to $4.76, as Bain Capital and CC Capital raised their respective takeover bids to $3.34 billion, marking a pivotal moment in an escalating bidding war.

Shares of Star Entertainment were still suspended.

Here are the top and bottom movers at the open.

Insignia Financial has granted two key suiters access to its books after both Bain Capital and CC Capital raised their respective takeover bids to $3.34 billion, marking a pivotal moment in an escalating bidding war.

Insignia said on Friday the two firms now vying for control of one of Australia's largest wealth management firms had increased their per-share offers to $5 each — an 8.7% premium over their previous $4.60 bids.

Bain, best known in Australia for acquiring Virgin Australia out of administration, and CC Capital, a Wall Street-based private equity firm, now appear to have the upper hand after investment giant Brookfield entered the contest last month with a matching bid.

Insignia, formerly known as IOOF, oversees approximately $327 billion in client assets, making it the third-largest player in Australia's superannuation sector. 

Australia's publicly traded wealth management firms are drawing interest from investors attracted to the country's thriving pension system.

The embattled casino operator Star Entertainment seems to have lost a major shareholder.

The company posted a statement on the stock exchange last night, saying it's become aware that State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries ceased to be a substantial shareholder on 4 March 2025.

""The Company’s Constitution, as well as certain agreements entered into with Liquor and Gaming New South Wales and the Queensland Office of Liquor and Gaming Regulation, contain restrictions prohibiting an individual from having a voting power of more than 10% in the Company,"" Star said in an ASX announcement.

""The Company may refuse to register any transfer of shares which would contravene these shareholding restrictions or require divestiture of the shares that cause an individual to exceed the shareholding restrictions.""

Shares in Star Entertainment have been suspended since Monday because it failed to report half-yearly profit results to the ASX by last Friday's deadline.

The company previously said that it couldn't finalise the results unless it received a substantial cash injection to stave off financial collapse.

The Australian Financial Review reported yesterday that Hong Kong investors have offered $50 million in exchange for the Brisbane casino and the rest of its Queensland operation.

So how did Star get here? Watch this short explainer video.

It may seem counterintuitive, but scientists are investigating a potent neurotoxin found in pufferfish known as tetrodotoxin to relieve lingering, hard-to-treat pain in the skin known as chronic subcutaneous pain.

“The main challenge is [controlling] its toxicity,” explained Chao Zhao at the University of Alabama. This is because even a small dose of a couple of milligrams can be lethal. But Zhao and his team have come up with a solution in the form of a marker pen.

“Our pen is designed to control the dose with great precision, ensuring that only a tiny, safe amount reaches the skin,” he said. “This way, we can take advantage of tetrodotoxin’s strong pain-relieving effects while minimizing risks.”

Though still proof-of-concept, the team are confident that their “simplified approach to a difficult problem” will lay the foundation for more studies, and, if found safe and effective, this research could be extended to human trials.



The idea of using marker pen to safely deliver tetrodotoxin came to Zhao giving a lecture, during which he was writing on a whiteboard.

“A marker pen stores water-based ink in a sponge core and delivers a consistent amount through capillary action,” explained Zhao. “If we replace the ink with an aqueous tetrodotoxin solution, the pen could continuously release a precise, controlled amount of tetrodotoxin — potentially at the nanogram level, far below the toxic threshold.”

Tetrodotoxin works by blocking electrical signaling along nerves with a potency estimated to be 1,000 times that of standard local anesthetics, and 3,000 times stronger than morphine for pain relief.

But this is a double-edged sword because while potent, it is also extremely toxic. 

The problem is that current therapies including topical creams and anesthetic injections, only work well for moderate pain but do not help severe long-term pain. This is because they are not powerful enough, their effects are short lived or the way they work does not treat the root of the problem. 

Zhao explained that unlike conventional pain medications that broadly act on pain pathways, such as opioids, tetrodotoxin specifically blocks the channels that allow transmission of pain.

“By silencing these channels, tetrodotoxin can effectively prevent the continuous and excessive firing of sensory neurons that drive postherpetic neuralgia pain,” he said. “In 2020, my father developed postherpetic neuralgia [after a bout of shingles]. He tried almost all commercially available creams and patches to relieve the pain. Witnessing his suffering inspired me to develop a more potent and effective method to treat postherpetic neuralgia and other severe skin pain conditions.”

Zhao says that, in addition to its superior potency, tetrodotoxin has several advantages over commonly used anesthetics such as bupivacaine and lidocaine. For example, it does not cause muscle cell breakdown or permanent nerve damage, nor does it cross the blood–brain barrier, reducing the risk of addiction. Unlike conventional local anesthetics, it also does not affect cardiac cells or normal heart function.



To create their pens, Zhao and his team filled commercially available felt tip marker pens with a very small dose of tetrodotoxin mixed with other compounds to improve skin permeability.

In animal studies, the team found that just 900 nanograms of tetrodotoxin caused complete relief from pain for 4 hours, and reduced pain for approximately 11 hours. Importantly, there was no toxicity observed or damage to muscles or nerves.

This isn’t the first time tetrodotoxin has been explored, in fact, human trials in cancer patients demonstrated pain relief but also found side effects. Concerns about safety including toxicity, the drug delivery system, and logistical challenges of storage and transportation have hindered its progression as a pain killer in clinical practice.

Getting the delivery system right is essential if therapeutics are to be developed. Considering the high risk, the team say they would take safety precautions to minimize toxicity to humans. For example, if the pen was damaged and tetrodotoxin leaked out.

“To prevent any risk of human poisoning from environmental exposure to tetrodotoxin, the amount of tetrodotoxin  in each marker pen will be kept below the minimum oral dose known to cause acute toxicity in humans. This amount is considered safe for practical use, as it is significantly lower than both the lethal dose and the dose that causes noticeable symptoms in human,” explained Zhao.

The team say because their application is topical, a much lower dose is generally needed in these cases, compared to what was tested in previous trials, where it was given as injections and therefore increasing the risk of the toxin entering the bloodstream.

Further preclinical studies will determine whether tetrodotoxin, delivered via the marker pen system, can successfully translate into a safe and effective treatment for patients.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Siemens plans to invest $285 million in manufacturing in the United States, the tech company said Thursday, including two new facilities in California and Texas.

The U.S. is the largest market for the company. The recent investments in the Siemens' U.S. manufacturing footprint and the planned acquisition of Altair, a Michigan-based software company, mark more than $10 billion in investment in the U.S.

“We believe in the innovation and strength of America’s industry. That’s why Siemens has invested over $90 billion in the country in the last 20 years. This year’s investment will bring this number to over $100 billion,"" Roland Busch, president and CEO of Siemens AG, said in a statement. “We are bringing more jobs, more technology and a boost to America’s AI capabilities.”

Siemens’ announcement comes as chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it plans to invest an additional $100 billion in the U.S., on top of $65 billion in investments the company had previously said it would make. That investment will be for three more chip manufacturing plants, along with two packaging facilities, in Arizona.

Siemens said it plans to open two manufacturing facilities for electrical products in Fort Worth, Texas, and Pomona, Calif. The company said it expects its latest investment to create more than 900 skilled manufacturing jobs, with the equipment produced in those factories supporting the U.S. commercial, industrial and construction sectors. The move will also allow the company to power AI data centers.

Sometimes, life lessons are hard. Other times, they’ll get you 50 bucks.

East Carolina University student Jacob Reinger learned the latter during the Technology Summit on Tuesday in the Main Campus Student Center. Reinger received a $50 gift card from presenter Andrew Griffin, a channel solutions engineer with Verkada, a security technology company.

“He was talking about needing to jump on opportunities and then he went silent,” Reinger said. “He said he had something for us, and he held it out and waited for someone to come up and grab it. It took me about 13 seconds to figure out what it was. I figured someone in the front row would pick it up. I’m in row seven, and I just ran out and grabbed it.”

Created by student organizations in the College of Business and Department of Computer Science, the summit focused on career paths and opportunities — or in Reinger’s case, an opportunity for $50. It’s a lesson the sophomore information and cybersecurity technology major from Wilmington won’t soon forget.

“Show up and take the opportunity,” he said.

Griffin said the gift card lesson was one he experienced as a student at ECU. With bachelor’s and master’s degrees in information and cybersecurity technology, he believes the gift card provides an important lesson for students entering the job market.

“The whole purpose is an exercise: The opportunity is there, and it’s up to you to take it,” Griffin said. “It doesn’t matter if there are instructions. It doesn’t matter if you’re unsure. It’s a matter of having confidence, going up there knowing that you might be embarrassed, get nervous or even look like a fool, but you took the opportunity that no one else did.”

Griffin was among five presenters at the event, which also included panel discussions with industry representatives about career exploration as well as emerging roles in technology.

Robert Daigle, global artificial intelligence business director at Lenovo who holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the College of Business, told students that a career path is far from a straight line. After all, he thought he was going to be a police officer or in a band when he was young.

“No way on my radar was working in artificial intelligence,” he said.

He cited a survey that noted most people would work 12 jobs in their lifetimes and that 92 million jobs would be displaced with 170 million new jobs as technology continues to change the employment landscape.

“You’re preparing for jobs and careers that don’t exist today. … Being flexible and having an openness to change is more important now than ever,” he told students.

Daigle also said students should not chase a job just because it pays a lot.

“Stay true to your values and let them guide you,” he said. “Our satisfaction is more than just a title and salary.”

He told students to build their own personal brand, mix specialized skills with general ones, continue lifelong learning, leverage technology as a competitive advantage and be curious.

“Approach your career as an exploration,” Daigle said. “The possibilities are endless.”

Lucas Murray, a junior accounting major from Oxford, is looking to work with an accounting firm in the future, but an internship is on his immediate horizon. He said Daigle’s thoughts on career flexibility and changes didn’t worry him.

“It’s exciting. I’ve already had three jobs,” Murray said. “I just have to trust the process. Some companies aren’t hiring, but as long as you stay on your path and get that degree, there should be opportunities for everybody.”

Shweta Kumar, a senior computer science major and biology minor from Cary, said she could relate to Daigle.

“He only graduated in 2010 and now in 2025, 15 years, and he’s already in a top company like Lenovo,” she said. “We’re able to see what we can do in 15 years and how we can make it.”

Kumar attended the event with Marian Sousan, a senior computer science major from Greenville. As someone deciding between a job in software development or graduate school, Sousan enjoyed Daigle’s perspective.

“I think it really calmed the current anxieties that a lot of students have about the job market,” she said. “He gave us a lot of hope, essentially, for being able to transition to jobs so easily.”

The Technology Summit is in its second year, and Sousan attended last year as well.

“I think it’s really important because it brings in a lot of interesting speakers, a lot of whom have emerged from ECU,” she said. “It really gives us a lot of perspective on how students today can jumpstart their own careers.”","{'href': 'https://news.ecu.edu', 'title': 'ECU News Services'}"

In 1946, the Polish cargo ship SS Kielce, loaded with munitions, sank about four miles off the coast of England. Its attempted salvage in 1967 resulted in an explosion equivalent to an earthquake measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale.

Nobody was injured that time, but others haven’t been so lucky. Over 110 people have died from unexploded ordinance (UXO) dumped in the North Sea since 1945.

A study reported in Marine Technology News this week investigated another risk such munitions pose. The south-western Baltic Sea has about 3,000 kilograms of dissolved toxic chemicals released from unexploded ordnance, according to the study by the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. Unexploded ordnance contains toxic substances such as TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene), RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), and DNB (1,3-dinitrobenzene), which are released into the seawater when the metal casings corrode.

The contamination is expected to increase over time as metal casings continue to corrode, releasing more and more toxic compounds - a process projected to continue for at least 800 years.

Two EU-funded projects began last year to help mitigate the threat of the estimated 1.6 million tonnes of dumped munitions in European seas. The project teams aim to advance robotics, 3D imaging and AI support for the detection and classification of UXO.

The ordinance ranges from single bullets to ammunition boxes to 500 kg bombs, and a pilot clearance project undertaken by contractors, SeaTerra, Eggers Kampfmittelbergung and Hansataucher, involves deck cranes equipped with a variety of grapples to remove ordnance boxes, a crawler equipped with a robotic arm to place small artillery shells in underwater baskets and ROVs with divers on standby.

The latest issue of Marine Technology Reporter magazine includes an in-depth look at crawler technology. Written by David R. Strachan, defense analyst and founder of Strikepod Systems, it looks at the US Navy’s development of an underwater crawler whose range of missions will include explosive ordnance disposal.

Teledyne Marine joined forces with Maritime Robotics and DEEP to survey DEEP's quarry lake, affectionately referred to as Loch Lye, in the Wye Valley.

The team deployed the latest survey equipment mounted on a Maritime Robotics Otter Pro vessel, including a Teledyne RESON SeaBat T51 (800 kHz) multi beam sonar with integrated inertial navigation, paired with a Teledyne Valeport SWiFT profiler. 

Loch Lyr serves as the centerpiece of the DEEP campus, a facility spanning 50 acres. The former National Dive Center offers environment for testing subsea equipment, developing methodologies, and training personnel in controlled conditions. The lock stretches 500 meters in length, up to 125 meters in width, and plunges to 80 meters deep.

The SeaBat T51's controls were tailored for autonomous operations to map the quarry, while the SWiFT profiler complemented the system by providing critical environmental data, such as temperature, sound velocity, and depth, to correct multibeam readings. An onboard winch enabled remote deployment, and near real-time profiler data was accessible via smartphone for immediate quality control.

The electric Otter Pro vessel, launched via crane, operated both locally and remotely. During surveyor breaks, operators in Norway controlled the vessel through satellite communications, leveraging its onboard cameras and collision avoidance radar to navigate autonomously. The survey produced high-quality data, covering nearly the entire body of water in a single pass.

AI-aided pilot program will take a hybrid approach to dubbing in which localization professionals collaborate with AI to ensure quality control


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.


Amazon Prime announced this week that it is testing a new AI process for translating foreign languages for closed captioning in its programming.

The initiative, designed to “make its vast streaming library accessible to even more customers,” targets dubbing on licensed movies and series that would not have been dubbed otherwise, the company said. Starting this week, AI-aided dubbing in English and Latin American Spanish will be available initially on 12 licensed movies and series, including titles such as El Cid: La Leyenda, Mi Mamá Lora, and Long Lost.

The AI-aided pilot program will take a hybrid approach to dubbing in which localization professionals collaborate with AI to ensure quality control. “AI-aided processes like this one, which incorporate the right amount of human expertise, can enable localization for titles that would not otherwise be accessible to customers,” the company said in its blog.

“At Prime Video, we believe in improving customers’ experience with practical and useful AI innovation,” said Raf Soltanovich, VP of technology at Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. “AI-aided dubbing is only available on titles that do not have dubbing support, and we are eager to explore a new way to make series and movies more accessible and enjoyable.”

Using AI to translate closed captions has become among the most popular uses of AI in media production; Microsoft announced an AI-powered translator for closed captioning on its Edge browser last year and the Sinclair Broadcast Group just announced last month that it is testing AI translated subtitling in real time.

It's also being tested on NextGen TV as well. Public Media Venture Group (PMVG) announced in December that it is now providing real-time translation of closed captioning from English to Spanish on PMVG’s NextGen TV (ATSC 3.0) test bed station in Cookeville, Tennessee.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=technology+news,Inside the White House’s new media strategy to promote Trump as ‘KING’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/06/trump-white-house-media-social-influencers/,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:02:56 GMT","

The Trump administration has transformed its traditional press shop into a rapid-response influencer operation, and “they’re all offense, all the time.”

When actress Selena Gomez posted an Instagram video in January in which she cried about the Trump administration’s deportations of children, the viral clip threatened to stoke nationwide unease over the policy’s human impact.

But the White House digital strategy team had a plan. They dispatched videographers to interview the mothers of children killed by undocumented immigrants. They put President Donald Trump’s face on a Valentine’s Day card reading: “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally and we’ll deport you.”

And they mimicked a style of video popular for its meditative soundscapes, known as ASMR, with a presentation that featured the rattling handcuff chains of a deportation flight. Gomez deleted her video shortly after posting, without specifying why. The Trump team’s video has been viewed more than 100 million times.

The effort was part of a new administration strategy to transform the traditional White House press shop into a rapid-response influencer operation, disseminating messages directly to Americans through the memes, TikToks and podcasts where millions now get their news.

After years of working to undermine mainstream outlets and neutralize critical reporting, Trump’s allies are now pushing a parallel information universe of social media feeds and right-wing firebrands to sell the country on his expansionist approach to presidential power.

For the Trump team, that has involved aggressively confronting critics like Gomez, not just to “reframe the narrative” but to drown them out, said Kaelan Dorr, a deputy assistant to the president who runs the digital team.

“We thought it was necessary to provide pushback in the harshest, most forceful way possible,” he said. “And through that, we had a viral hit on our hands.”

Stephen K. Bannon, a senior White House aide during Trump’s first term and the host of the “War Room” podcast, said the White House has reimagined itself as a “major information content provider.” What Trump does “is the action, and we just happen to be one of the distributors,” he said.

“Rapid-response communications are normally defensive,” he said. “They’re all offense, all the time.”

The White House’s rapid-response account posted 207 times to X on Tuesday, the day of Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress, or nearly nine posts an hour, including Trump sound bites, supporter interviews and Democrat-slamming memes and attack lines. When a Fox News analyst called Trump “the political colossus of our time,” the team got the clip cut, captioned and posted online within 11 minutes.

In press rooms, the administration is welcoming friendly “new media” podcasters, X users and YouTubers to deliver what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt calls “news-related content” to their millions of followers.

And on social media, the White House is firing off talking points across every platform in a bid to win online attention and reach viewers who have tuned out the traditional press. In an X post, communications director Steven Cheung described their goal: “FULL SPECTRUM DOMINANCE.”

The administration has produced news-style reports trumpeting Trump’s successes and put them in email newsletters and Leavitt-narrated “MAGA Minute” video segments; soon, they’ll be delivered via text.

The team has worked to humanize the president with picturesque postcards of a White House snowfall and behind-the-scenes videos from the Oval Office — where a New York Post showing the president’s mug shot hangs framed just outside the door. But the digital team has also gone for shock factor, posting a photo of chained men shuffling onto a transport jet (“Deportation Flights Have Begun”) and a portrait of Trump with a golden crown (“LONG LIVE THE KING”).

The president has appointed influential social media figures across the federal government — like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Kash Patel — who amplify his messages with their own marketing pushes. Trump has also fired off attention-getting posts of his own, including an AI-generated video transforming the war-torn Gaza Strip into a gilded Trump beach resort, in line with his call to forcibly remove millions of people from Palestinian land.

The administration’s brash campaign-style tactics are designed to stand out on a crowded internet and speak to voters that officials believe are hungry for aggressive action.

“Even the tagline we’ve been using — ‘America is back’ — is very much saying: ‘We’re here. We’re in your face.’ It’s irreverent. It’s unapologetic,” said Dorr, 32. (A veteran of both Trump campaigns, Dorr also worked as a “head of engagement” at Gettr, the right-wing social network run by Jason Miller.)

The posts have shocked and repulsed the left, leading Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats to say on X: “To find joy and entertainment in this is truly vile.” But the Trump team has been emboldened to go even further by the millions who have watched, shared and followed the accounts since Trump’s inauguration. Half of the White House’s Instagram views have come from non-followers, Dorr said, a sign that the team’s messages are gaining traction beyond Trump’s base.

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said in a statement that the approach is built to reach audiences without the media’s help and to broadcast Trump’s “America First message far and wide.”

But this model of messaging could supercharge the presidential bully pulpit until it shifts Americans’ perception of events, according to experts who study propaganda and the press. Like Trump’s moves to shore up loyalty in Congress and remake the judiciary, the strategy is designed to weaken his opponents and dismantle checks against executive power.

Undermining the accountability mission of the Fourth Estate and building a viral pipeline of state media helps the administration — and future ones — stifle dissent, said Anya Schiffrin, a senior lecturer at Columbia University’s School for International and Public Affairs.

And by replacing dispassionate observers with partisan cheerleaders, political leaders are elevating a class of messengers incentivized to defend their decisions, no matter the seriousness or scale. Every policy maneuver could turn into a meme.

Said Renee Hobbs, a communications professor at the University of Rhode Island: “It’s an effort to replace the mainstream press with a partisan press” that will function as the new “purveyors of reality.”

Though members of the digital team serve on the front lines of what the White House calls the “most transparent administration” in history, Trump officials requested that their identities remain anonymous, citing personnel policy and concern over public backlash.

The team is made up of roughly a dozen employees — people mostly in their 20s and 30s from outside politics — who work out of the White House and are given wide leeway to craft content. By removing layers of bureaucracy before publishing, the team avoids the “analysis paralysis” of other messaging shops, Dorr said.

And members are expected to move at internet speed. When a federal judge declined to block the White House from banning the Associated Press from certain news events, the team raced to declare “VICTORY” in graphics that members slapped across White House TVs and social accounts.

They “have the buy-in from the [Trump] team to go out there and be unapologetic in our pursuit of advancing the administration’s goals,” Dorr said, “with the ferocity and the quickness and the pointedness” the White House demands.

For its rapid-response account, the White House employs video producers and editors, known as clippers, to create and post short videos on the fly. The role was first popularized by political activists looking to highlight opponents’ gaffes on the campaign trail, but Trump’s clippers often promote his moments, hoping to make them go viral in real time.

On Friday, within minutes of Trump and Vice President JD Vance’s fiery confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the White House accounts blasted out video of major punch lines, meme-ready photos and images of the American flag. “This is going to be great television,” Trump said as reporters filed out of the Oval Office.

The approach seems to be resonating online: Trump’s first Cabinet meeting, which was live-streamed and featured billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, has more than 6 million views on X. “Trump is literally overwhelming them with information” in a way that is “changing the nature of the presidency,” Bannon said. “How many young men under 30 years old would ever watch two seconds of a Cabinet meeting?”

That fast-twitch model has spread beyond the White House, including to the Defense Department, which this month launched a rapid-response account to praise Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, grapple with senators and declare that “REAL journalism is dead.” But it has also helped seed major advertising campaigns to reach viewers beyond the web.

Kristi L. Noem, head of the Department of Homeland Security, has posted videos of herself in a flak jacket at the southern border and on immigration raids, including one on Tuesday at an apartment complex in Northern Virginia.

Footage from the raids is used in an international TV and digital ad blitz that warns undocumented immigrants to leave the country or be hunted down. At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Noem said the ads had a budget of up to $200 million and had been personally requested by Trump.

“We’re not going to let the media tell this story,” Noem recalled Trump saying, as was first reported by Rolling Stone. “We’re going to run a marketing campaign to make sure the American people know the truth.”

As the administration has expanded its marketing arm, it has also worked to uproot the classic structure of the White House press corps. In her first briefing, Leavitt called on “podcasters, social media influencers and content creators” to apply for credentialed access to a briefing room long filled by legacy news outlets. More than 12,000 have since applied, according to the White House, and several have been ushered to exclusive new-media seats near the podium.

Administration officials have said the change reflects a fundamental shift in American culture, as journalists compete for relevance with a new generation of influencers who speak to audiences of millions online.

But virtually all of the new-media creators have come from right-wing outlets friendly to the Trump cause. The Breitbart writer Matt Boyle asked whether the White House would continue its “breakneck” pace. (Yes, Leavitt said.) The pro-Trump podcaster John Ashbrook asked whether the media was “out of touch” about the border. (Yes, Leavitt said.) And John Stoll, the head of news at Musk’s X, asked about the White House’s “confidence” in going “toe-to-toe with Vladimir Putin.” (Very confident, national security adviser Michael Waltz said.)

“The Trump White House is loyal, and they are loyal to people who stood with them,” podcaster Dan Bongino said while toasting Rumble chief Chris Pavlovski’s moment in the new-media spotlight. (Days later, Bongino was named deputy director of the FBI.)

Some of the new-media figures have eagerly promoted Trump’s domestic agenda. A few hours after podcaster Sage Steele asked about the importance of passing a law to ban transgender women and girls from women’s sports, she stood behind Trump as he signed an executive order on the same issue.

Other Trump-boosting creators have joined the administration outright, like the “Dear America” podcast host Graham Allen, newly hired as the Defense Department’s digital media director. Brenden Dilley, a pro-Trump meme maker, said of the news, “There’s going to be nobody left doing podcasts soon because the top people are all going to work for the government.”

Friendliness between the White House and its messengers of choice is nothing new, including during the first Trump term, when right-wing provocateurs like Mike Cernovich and blogs like Gateway Pundit held credentials alongside the legacy press.

But back then, the traditional press corps set the tone, Bannon said. The softer questions during Trump’s recent Cabinet meeting, he said, made the first term’s briefings look like “hand-to-hand combat.”

Today “the powerful media is the ecosystem of the right,” Bannon said, “while the mainstream media [is] suffering layoffs.”

The right-wing media figures embraced by the Trump administration have often returned the favor. After the banning of the AP, Brian Glenn — a correspondent for the pro-Trump media network Real America’s Voice and the boyfriend of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) — was given the rare opportunity to question Trump in the Oval Office. A few days later, he posted a selfie with Trump on X that read: “So much accomplished, and we’re still under a month in office.”

So much accomplished, and we’re still under a month in office. 🇺🇸#PresidentsDay pic.twitter.com/ni7SPriZwb

For those working closely with Trump’s public-relations infrastructure, the first weeks have marked a huge opportunity for exclusive content. Benny Johnson, a Tampa-based MAGA influencer who calls himself the “Front Seat to the Golden Era,” got to interview Vance last month, then headed to the Capitol, where he live-streamed a friendly chat with two Republican senators before they voted to confirm Patel as FBI director.

“First time in history we’ll have the stream going from the senator’s office. This is amazing,” Johnson said on stream.

The night before, Johnson had posted a video of himself stopping to rejoice outside the shuttered offices of the U.S. Agency for International Development, once the world’s largest provider of food aid. “Destroy the idols of the conquered church, right?” he said with a laugh. “Desecrate their idols. Look at this. There it is. Blacked out. It’s gone.”

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, marking a major shift in U.S. digital asset policy.

White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, wrote in a post on X that the reserve will be funded exclusively with bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases, ensuring that taxpayers bear no financial burden.

According to estimates, the U.S. government controls approximately 200,000 bitcoin, though no full audit has ever been conducted. Trump's order mandates a comprehensive accounting of federal digital asset holdings and prohibits the sale of bitcoin from the reserve, positioning it as a permanent store of value.

Additionally, the order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, managed by the Treasury Department, to hold other confiscated cryptocurrencies.

Many crypto investors who have supported Trump raised concerns over the weekend after the president said in a post on Truth Social that in addition to bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana's SOL token, and Cardano's ADA coin would be part of a strategic crypto reserve.

""I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve,"" bitcoin billionaire Tyler Winklevoss wrote. ""Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar and that digital asset is bitcoin.""

SOL, ether and bitcoin all fell around 5% late Thursday, while ADA plunged nearly 12%.

Ahead of the announcement, Castle Island Venture's Nic Carter told CNBC that the U.S. committing to a bitcoin-only reserve would ""ratify bitcoin as a global asset of consequence, somewhere in the realm of gold.""

""The U.S. is clearly the most important nation in the world, and so their stamp of approval really does a lot for bitcoin,"" Carter said, noting that including any digital currencies other that bitcoin would have made it look like another speculative fund.

Ryan Gilbert, a fintech investor, said the move will send a strong message to institutions that bitcoin is here to stay. He said the decision would further distinguish bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies.

""There's been many folks out there for the past decade and a half that have said bitcoin is the way to go, ignore the other tokens,"" Gilbert said. ""I do think it will help bitcoin as a token, as an asset, separate itself from all the others as far as the debate is concerned.""

But Gilbert said the U.S. has to be cautious in how it manages the reserve.

""What we don't want to see is the U.S. actively trading bitcoin,"" he said. ""A reserve should be a long-term store of value, not something that introduces market-moving speculation.""

Sacks praised the decision, calling it a milestone in making the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the world."" He previously noted that the U.S. lost over $17 billion in potential value by selling seized bitcoin prematurely.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will oversee further policy development, with a focus on budget-neutral acquisition strategies for bitcoin, according to Sacks.

Cryptocurrency falls as much as 6 percent as lack of plans for government purchases disappoints investors.

United States President Donald Trump’s executive order to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a stockpile of other digital assets has failed to impress crypto markets, with Bitcoin’s value plummeting following the announcement.

Bitcoin fell as much as 6 percent following Trump’s order on Thursday, which did not include plans for the government to actively buy Bitcoin.

After dropping as low as $84,900, the cryptocurrency was trading at about $87,700 as of 05:00 GMT.

In a statement announcing the order, Trump’s crypto tsar David Sacks said the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and “Digital Asset Stockpile” would be capitalised with assets forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings.

“This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,” Sacks said on X.

“It is estimated that the US government owns about 200,000 Bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. (executive order) directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings.”

Sacks said the order also called for the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce to develop “budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional Bitcoin” provided they are at no cost to the US taxpayer.

Trump’s order came after he repeatedly flagged plans to establish a cryptocurrency stockpile or reserve as part of his pledge to turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet”.

 



 

Some crypto enthusiasts, however, were less than impressed.

Shayan Salehi, a German tech entrepreneur, described the announcement that the government would not acquire additional assets as “famous words than can unleash a bear market”.

“Market muted,” Spencer Hakimian, the founder of New York-based Tolou Capital Management, said in a post on X alongside a screenshot of a graph showing Bitcoin’s fall.

Hakimian said the plan was “very underwhelming”.

“They will not currently buy any new Bitcoin unless they can do it in a revenue-neutral way. Nothing the federal government does is revenue neutral,” he said.

The US owns an estimated 200,000 Bitcoin seized during criminal and civil forfeiture.

Sacks suggested the reserve would function like a “digital Fort Knox” by helping Bitcoin retain its value.

“Premature sales of Bitcoin have already cost US taxpayers over $17bn in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings,” he said.

In addition to a Bitcoin reserve, Sacks said a separate stockpile would be established for “digital assets other than Bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings”.

That stockpile could include tokens such as ether, XRP, Solana and Cardano – assets named by Trump earlier this week in a social media post detailing his plans for a cryptocurrency reserve.

The value of Bitcoin soared after Trump was elected in November, hitting a record peak of $109,071 in mid-January.

The president’s support for cryptocurrency has come under scrutiny, as his family has amassed billions of dollars in crypto wealth, including through a Trump meme coin launched in January.

Critics of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have warned that the assets have no intrinsic value and likened their rise to a Ponzi scheme.

President Trump is holding the first crypto summit at the White House Friday, featuring investors, CEOs and founders of crypto companies. Many in that world also hope Trump spells out a clearer path involving little regulation in the future, while Trump says he will announce the details of a new crypto reserve for the federal government. Paul Solman reports.

Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.

Amna Nawaz:

President Trump is holding the first crypto summit at the White House tomorrow, featuring investors, CEOs and founders of crypto companies.

Many in that world also hope that Trump spells out a clearer path involving little regulation in the future. And Trump says he will announce the details of a new crypto reserve for the federal government.

Geoff Bennett:

Estimates vary widely, but surveys have found anywhere from 7 to 28 percent of U.S. adults invest in crypto. The market's total value is estimated around $3 trillion at the moment.

There are also real concerns about the stability of crypto and similar digital assets and whether President Trump has potential conflicts of interest.

Our Paul Solman breaks it down for us.

Paul Solman:

Let's start with some basics. A cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is a bit of computer code, really just a unique string of dozens of characters that identifies your ownership of some strictly digital asset, existing only in what my mother disparagingly called cyberspace.

Neha Narula, MIT Digital Currency Initiative:

So, that's really different than most of the other assets that we think about in the world. Bitcoin itself is classified as a commodity, like things like gold, but those commodities have a real-world analog component. There's gold sitting in a vault somewhere. There's a bar or there's a coin.

Bitcoin's purely digital, digital first.

Paul Solman:

When I first covered cryptocurrency back in 2013, one Bitcoin was worth about $125, five years later, more than $7,000. Now a whole Bitcoin is selling near $90,000. So what's its appeal?

Vic Laranja, Crypto Content Creator:

If I want to send money to somebody, it has to pass through multiple institutions to get to them. With crypto, I don't need to wait. The money is liquid. You can have it instantly. It's almost free to send it, and that is innovation. It's just better.

Paul Solman:

And Bitcoin is supposed to be even scarcer than gold, as there's an absolute limit to the supply, unlike government currencies like the dollar, which can suffer inflation, and in cases like Germany in 1923 and Zimbabwe and Venezuela more recently, hyperinflation.

Plus, all transactions are publicly displayed on something called a blockchain, tracked on every computer that uses the software.

Neha Narula:

Another huge component of whether or not something is a good store of value is whether people believe in it, whether they have decided it's a good store of value. So it's kind of got these dual sides. You need to have certain properties that we can talk about pretty rationally, but then there's this narrative component.

Paul Solman:

One part of the narrative, Bitcoin will gradually replace currencies like the dollar as a form of payment, but given the volatility of its value:

Zeke Faux, Author, ""Number Go Up"": If you're talking to anyone who's saying that Bitcoin is going to be used for payments, that's kind of a fringe idea. Most Bitcoiners now just stick to the idea that the price will go up forever, and that we will all get rich.

Paul Solman:

OK, that's a digital asset like Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and now thousands of others. But what about meme coins in general and the Trump coin in particular?

Molly White, Crypto Researcher and Software Engineer: Meme coins are crypto assets that are themed around a specific idea or sometimes a person. Generally, there is no business behind a meme coin project. There's no sort of greater purpose, but they are used as vehicles for speculation.

Paul Solman:

Meme coins have become very popular of late. One of the most well-known is Dogecoin, long-hyped by Elon Musk. It's based on a Shiba Inu dog meme and has had enduring value, but most meme coins don't.

Molly White:

The asset is worth whatever you can sell it for and you better try to do it quick before it goes to zero.

Vic Laranja:

There are over five million meme coins; 99 percent of them go to zero.

Paul Solman:

It's a game. The goal, get in early and hope that, to use the old Wall Street expression, a greater fool will come along and pay a higher price.

Vic Laranja:

We call it vaporware. There's no promise or utility with a meme coin, other than the connection to the idea.

Paul Solman:

In January, President Trump announced his own meme coin.

Molly White:

The Trump Token was one of the biggest meme coins that we have ever seen launched. President Trump, just before his inauguration, launched a meme coin themed around himself. Shortly after, his wife launched a meme coin called Melania Token, which came a couple days later.

Paul Solman:

What happened when the Trump meme coin came out on the market?

Vic Laranja:

Insanity. It was one of the craziest nights I have ever experienced in crypto ever. Like, it was nuts, because no one believed that it was real. Everyone thought it was a scam. Everyone thought that his account was hacked.

Paul Solman:

But the Trump coin was real, one billion of them to be released over three years. Two hundred million were released to the market. The coin's creators own the remaining 800 million.

Vic Laranja:

I was like, OK, I'm going to put a little bit of money into this, because if I'm wrong, that's going to suck. And this is the amount of money that I'm OK with just completely losing.

Paul Solman:

In fact, Laranja says he made a little money on his Trump coin bet. But if you invested late, you sure didn't.

Zeke Faux:

A small number of people got in early and profited from this Trump coin. The majority of people who bought the coin ended up losing money. And they can see this because you can track transactions on the blockchain.

Paul Solman:

Hundreds of thousands of crypto accounts lost money on the bet, amounting to billions in cumulative losses.

Meanwhile, the Trump-affiliated creators of the coin made some $100 million in fees alone, plus presumably profits from the coin itself.

Molly White:

About 80 percent of the token supply was allocated to Trump and Trump entities. And so, based on the token price, he potentially makes quite a lot of money off of that token.

Paul Solman:

But to some in the crypto community, the Trump coin's downside is more that it's a gateway to scamming.

Vic Laranja:

Because he basically opened the floodgates for people to scam without being scared of it. People in the space call it crime season. That's what started. Crime season started.

Paul Solman:

Now, President Trump's views on crypto have evolved. In 2021, he called Bitcoin a scam. But with the Biden administration tough on crypto in general, supporters began to back Trump and his reelection bid.

Zeke Faux:

David Bailey, who runs ""Bitcoin"" magazine, which is the organizer of the annual Bitcoin conference that draws thousands of Bitcoiners from around the world, he got together a group of a few dozen of the top Bitcoin investors and got them to agree to donate the maximum amount to Trump, which, if you count all the committees and everything, is $844,600 each.

Paul Solman:

Trump's pledge?

Donald Trump, President of the United States: The United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.

(Cheering)

Paul Solman:

In part by overhauling regulations.

Zeke Faux:

And, so far, he's taken a number of steps in that direction. SEC has been dropping investigations and lawsuits against a number of crypto companies. One of the SEC lawyers who took the lead on some of these crypto enforcement actions has been punished by being transferred to the I.T. department.

I mean, there's a huge conflict of interest here. Trump has his own crypto businesses, and his administration is now deciding an entirely new set of rules that are going to govern this industry.

Paul Solman:

Trump's also planning a U.S. crypto strategic reserve to include Bitcoin and other tokens, which could boost the value of the president's own crypto ventures, of which there are several.

Molly White:

So it started with him launching several NFT projects that were themed around him. He also is a major beneficiary of a company called World Liberty Financial, which is a crypto-based project that plans to launch some sort of a crypto application in the near future. He receives something like 75 percent of the proceeds from that project.

His TRUTH Social platform, which he owns, has been talking about launching a crypto segment, where they would allow for crypto trading. They have spoken about holding crypto assets themselves. So he has very deep involvement in the crypto world these days.

Paul Solman:

And that raises another issue.

Molly White:

Members of the government are not supposed to receive money from people who are trying to influence policy, and these new crypto projects provide a very direct way for such people to do so, often in ways that can be a little bit more challenging to trace than, say, a bank transfer.

Paul Solman:

If, that is, anyone is trying to trace them at all.

David Yaffe-Bellany covers the cryptocurrency industry.

On the night of Feb. 21, Ben Zhou, the chief executive of the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, logged on to his computer to approve what appeared to be a routine transaction. His company was moving a large amount of Ether, a popular digital currency, from one account to another.

Thirty minutes later, Mr. Zhou got a call from Bybit’s chief financial officer. In a trembling voice, the executive told Mr. Zhou that their system had been hacked.

“All of the Ethereum is gone,” he said.

When Mr. Zhou approved the transaction, he had inadvertently handed control of an account to hackers backed by the North Korean government, according to the F.B.I. They stole $1.5 billion in cryptocurrencies, the largest heist in the industry’s history.

To pull off the astonishing breach, the hackers exploited a simple flaw in Bybit’s security: its reliance on a free software product. They penetrated Bybit by manipulating a publicly available system that the exchange used to safeguard hundreds of millions of dollars in customer deposits. For years, Bybit had relied on the storage software, developed by a technology provider called Safe, even as other security firms sold more specialized tools for businesses.

The hack sent crypto markets into a free fall and undermined confidence in the industry at a crucial time. Under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, industry executives are lobbying for new U.S. laws and regulations that would make it easier for people to pour their savings into digital currencies. On Friday, the White House is scheduled to host a “crypto summit” with President Trump and top industry officials.

Crypto security experts said they were troubled by what the heist revealed about Bybit’s safety protocols. The losses were “completely preventable,” one security firm wrote in an analysis of the breach, arguing that it “should not have happened.”

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a strategic reserve for Bitcoin, making the US one of the few countries in the world to create a national stockpile of blockchain assets.

The reserve will hold cryptocurrency forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings, White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks said in a post on X.

The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset.

Trump - who just four years ago said Bitcoin ""seems like a scam"" - now says he plans to make the US ""the Crypto Capital of the World"".

Further details are expected when the president is due to host the first crypto summit at the White House on Friday.

It is unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.

Sacks said the stockpile would serve as ""a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency"", drawing comparison to a Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets.

Trump's order also creates a digital assets stockpile for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin that have been forfeited. 

It directs a full accounting of the federal government's crypto reserves, which Sacks said are estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (£13.6bn) at today's prices.

It was unclear how the new stockpile would benefit Americans, but Sacks said it ""will not cost taxpayers a dime"".

His implication that the US government would not buy Bitcoin led prices of the world's largest cryptocurrency to fall by more than 5%.

Some countries maintain strategic reserves of national assets to diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risk.

The US also keeps a petroleum reserve. Canada has a maple syrup reserve.

Earlier this week, Trump revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he said he would like included in the strategic reserve.

The market prices of the five coins he named - Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano -  swiftly jumped after that announcement.

Trump aggressively courted the crypto community during his presidential campaign. Former US President Joe Biden led a crackdown on crypto, citing concerns about fraud.

Syed spent 20 years in prison for the murder of his ex-girlfriend, but the podcast helped free him.

A powerful winter storm has hit parts of the US midwest with strong winds and heavy snow.

Gavin Newsom faces a backlash from within his party as he agrees with a conservative activist on the cultural issue.

The eight Starship test flight from Elon Musk's private space company did result in another successful catch of the rocket booster.

The video apparently satirising a proposal to ""take over"" the Gaza Strip was shared by the US president on social media.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday establishing a government reserve of bitcoin, a key marker in the cryptocurrency’s journey towards possible mainstream acceptance. 

Under Trump’s new order, the U.S. government will retain the estimated 200,000 bitcoin it’s already seized in criminal and civil proceedings, according to Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks. 

“The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,’” Sacks said on social media. 

The executive order calls for a “full accounting” of the government’s bitcoin holdings, which Sacks said have never been fully audited. He added that the U.S. government has previously sold off about 195,000 bitcoin over the last decade for $366 million. He said those bitcoins would be worth about $17 billion if the government hadn’t sold them.

Sacks said the order allows for the Treasury and Commerce Departments “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin.”

Once a skeptic who said a few years ago that bitcoin “ seems like a scam,” Trump has embraced digital currencies and leaned into his unofficial role as the “ crypto president ” in ways that can both help the crypto industry and enrich himself and his family. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, who felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last year’s election. 

Establishing a bitcoin reserve was one of several crypto-related promises Trump made on the campaign trail last year. Trump is also pushing Congress to pass industry-friendly legislation, and under his administration the Securities and Exchange Commission has started dropping enforcement actions it had taken against some major crypto companies. On Friday, Trump is set to host many key industry leaders at a White House “Crypto Summit.”




Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by an anonymous person or persons, bitcoin has blossomed from an experiment by libertarian cryptography enthusiasts into an asset with a market cap of about $1.7 trillion. While it hasn’t taken off as a way to pay for everyday things, bitcoin has found popularity as a store of value that’s not controlled by banks, governments or other powerful entities. 

Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, a built-in scarcity that supporters say makes it a great hedge against inflation. Critics have long said bitcoin lacks any inherent value, but it’s so far defied naysayers with remarkable price increases. Some supporters of a strategic bitcoin reserve said it could one day help pay off the U.S. national debt.

Crypto prices soared after Trump’s victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!” on social media.

But prices have since cooled off. Trump’s executive order did not equate to an immediate price spike for bitcoin, which was trading around $86,000 shortly after his announcement. 

The executive order also creates a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” where the government will hold seized cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. On Sunday, Trump sent crypto prices on a short-lived surge after a surprise announcement that he wanted the government to hold lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana and cardano.

Cryptocurrencies fell Thursday night after President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a strategic bitcoin reserve for the United States and, separately, a ""digital asset stockpile.""

The price of bitcoin was last lower by 3% at $87,586.86, according to Coin Metrics. Shortly after the news broke, it fell to as low as $84,688.13.

Earlier losses in other coins – specifically those that rallied at the beginning of the week after Trump said they would be included in the strategy – also eased. Ether was down 2%, trading at $2,184.08. XRP and Solana's SOL token retreated 1% and 3%, respectively. Cardano's ADA token tumbled 13%.

White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks detailed in a post on X that the bitcoin reserve will include bitcoin already owned by the U.S. government that it seized from past law enforcement actions – a move, he emphasized, that will ""not cost taxpayers a dime."" The U.S. currently owns more than 198,000 bitcoins worth about $17 billion, according to Arkham.

The stockpile of other coins will include ""digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings."" Sacks said the government will not acquire additional assets for it ""beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings."" Arkham data shows the U.S. government owns about 56 ether tokens worth almost $119 million. It does not list XRP or the Solana or Cardano tokens.

Investors initially dumped their coins at the notion of the U.S. having no immediate planned purchases of bitcoin, per the order, against the backdrop of major weakness in equities.

""It is good news, but not what the market wanted in the short term,"" said Steven Lubka, head of private clients and family offices at Swan Bitcoin. ""People were hoping for near-term buy pressure.""

Sacks did point out that the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop ""budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers,"" and that there's no plan to accumulate additional assets for the crypto stockpile beyond what's already been obtained by the government.

The announcement came days after Trump teased new details on the highly anticipated bitcoin reserve that had become one of his biggest promises to the crypto industry on his campaign trail, and on the eve of the first White House Crypto Summit.

The crypto market has been rocked this week by the tariff war and inflation concerns, which have largely overshadowed the speculative excitement around the bitcoin reserve. JPMorgan on Wednesday said it doesn't expect a big move higher in crypto in the near term, given the broader economic uncertainty and weakening demand.

Bitcoin briefly returned to the key $90,000 level earlier this week and is now hovering just below it. Investors and analysts have warned that until bitcoin can meaningfully hold above it, it's at risk of a bigger pullback toward $70,000.

The first-of-its-kind reserve would be anchored by a stash of Bitcoin the government already owns, estimated to be worth billions of dollars, the White House’s crypto czar said.

By David Yaffe-Bellany

David Yaffe-Bellany reports on the cryptocurrency industry.

President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to create a national stockpile of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, an adviser said, an audacious idea that has been widely criticized as a scheme to enrich crypto investors.

The basis of the stockpile will be a stash of Bitcoin, estimated to be worth as much as $17 billion, that the United States has seized in legal cases over the years, according to a summary of the order posted on social media by David Sacks, the White House’s crypto and A.I. policy czar.

The order also calls for federal agencies to develop “budget-neutral strategies” to buy more Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, as long as those purchases do not generate extra costs for taxpayers.

“This Executive Order underscores President Trump’s commitment to making the U.S. the ‘crypto capital of the world,’” Mr. Sacks wrote in his post. He said the United States would not sell any Bitcoin in the reserve, which he likened to “a digital Fort Knox.”

Since Mr. Trump took office in January, his administration has moved rapidly to elevate the crypto industry, a volatile sector that had battled with federal regulators for years. The Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped lawsuits against two of the biggest U.S. crypto companies and halted investigations into several others. And on Friday, Mr. Trump is scheduled to host crypto executives at the White House for a first-of-its-kind “crypto summit.”

Mr. Trump has a personal stake in the success of the crypto industry, creating conflicts of interests that have raised alarms with government ethics experts. Last year, he started a business, World Liberty Financial, that offers a cryptocurrency called WLFI. Just days before his inauguration, he also began selling a so-called memecoin — a type of cryptocurrency tied to an online joke or a celebrity figure.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cryptocurrency+news,Texas Senate passes bill that would establish state crypto reserve,https://www.keranews.org/texas-news/2025-03-06/bitcoin-texas-crypto-reserve,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:00:00 GMT","

The Texas Senate on Thursday passed a measure that would establish a state-controlled cryptocurrency reserve. The move comes just days after President Donald Trump announced plans to create a U.S. crypto strategic reserve.

Senate Bill 21, authored by Republican Sen. Charles Schwertner of Georgetown, would allow the state comptroller to buy, hold and manage Bitcoin and other digital assets as “a hedge against inflation and economic volatility.” The reserve would be funded through legislative appropriations and donations from private citizens and corporations.

The bill would also create a committee to provide investment recommendations for which cryptocurrency to buy to the comptroller. If signed into law, Texas would become the first U.S. state to create its own cryptocurrency reserve.

“This bill will allow Texas to diversify our investment approach, participate competitively in the evolving digital, financial economy and leverage the benefits of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Schwertner said.

Schwertner says his proposed crypto reserve would be subject to regular third-party audits, the findings of which would be released in a report to the state legislature every other year.

The bill passed out of the Senate with 25 legislators in favor and five against. It now heads to the Texas House for consideration.

Before passing, the proposed bill led to a heated debate between Schwertner and Democratic Sen. Roland Gutierrez of San Antonio, who raised concerns about Bitcoin’s volatility and the potential risks associated with allocating state funds to cryptocurrency.

“When the economy is down, Bitcoin is down, and the fluctuations on this stuff is insanity,” Gutierrez said. “We have so many real concerns in this state, and so many of our citizens that’re asking for real help, and the last thing that we need to do is go benefit some techno bro.”

Gutierrez argued that the use of crypto was “completely unregulated” — a claim that Schwertner pushed back on, saying cryptocurrency was regulated by blockchain technology, which is essentially a digital ledger that records transactions. Schwertner added that a blockchain is decentralized, meaning the data it’s not owned or operated by one single entity.

“In some ways, it is more accountable because it has that decentralized nature,” Schwertner said. However, Gutierrez was not convinced.

“All I’ve heard is it’s a blockchain and it’s a computer, it’s an algorithm,” Gutierrez asked. “We’re supposed to allow that algorithm, that computer and … some crypto bros to regulate themselves?”

Despite Gutierrez’s continued pushback, the bill was fast-tracked out of the Senate by a majority of lawmakers who moved to skip a third reading of the bill, which is the last step before a proposed law can move onto the next chamber for discussion.

Gov. Greg Abbott has previously expressed interest in making Texas a hub for the use of crypto. On Sunday. Trump announced a proposed national crypto reserve, signaling a significant federal endorsement of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano.","{'href': 'https://www.keranews.org', 'title': 'KERA News'}"

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, continuing his administration's embrace of the cryptocurrency industry.

The announcement came on the eve of a Crypto Summit Trump is scheduled to host Friday at the White House with industry leaders.

""Just as it is in our country's interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity,"" the order states.

The bitcoin in the reserve will come from assets held by the U.S. Department of Treasury that were seized in court proceedings or paid in civil penalties to executive agencies.

David Sacks, the White House czar for cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, posted on X that the U.S. has roughly 200,000 Bitcoin but ""there has never been a complete audit."" He added that the order requires ""a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings.""

Sacks called the Reserve ""a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency."" The executive order describes Bitcoin as ""digital gold.""

The Digital Asset Stockpile also will come from assets seized in court proceedings.

The executive order directs the Treasury and Commerce secretaries to work on ""strategies"" for acquiring additional bitcoin that are ""budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers.""

Trump signed an executive order in January creating the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets and charged it with investigating the creation of the Stockpile.""

In a pair of social media posts Sunday, Trump mentioned five different cryptocurrencies that would be included in the stockpile, causing their values to spike.

Trump promoted cryptocurrencies on the campaign trail, telling a crowd gathered in Nashville in July for the Bitcoin Conference that he wanted to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet and bitcoin superpower of the world.” He has promised favorable regulation of the industry, which supported his campaign.

Trump also has a financial stake in the industry, launching a pair of cryptocurrency tokens and owning 60% of the crypto platform World Liberty Financial.

Sacks, a prominent tech investor, posted on X recently that he sold all of his cryptocurrency prior to Trump taking office.

President Joe Biden's administration clashed with the volatile cryptocurrency industry over regulations, and brought enforcement actions against some crypto companies.

Trump is ushering in a more friendly approach to the industry. He has suggested a bitcoin reserve would keep the U.S. at the forefront on cryptocurrency.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo, filed legislation aimed at creating a bitcoin reserve. While acknowledging concerns about its volatility, she said it could help pay down the national debt and boost the U.S. dollar.

“While there may be short-term volatility, over the long term a bitcoin reserve like this will serve as an important and stable store of value,” Lummis wrote in a letter published in The Wall Street Journal.

President Donald Trump has directed his administration to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve to hold the assets that have been seized by the government, and he's additionally called for a crypto stockpile of other types of assets.

At this point, all of the assets contemplated by the order would be those seized in civil or criminal forfeitures. The bitcoin will be stored for long-term value in what was termed a ""digital Fort Knox.""

""The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings,"" said David Sacks, Trump's crypto czar, in a statement posted on social media site X.

In a video showing the president signing the order, Trump says about establishing the reserve, ""Made the promise, right?""

The order has also nudged government officials to seek ways to add more bitcoin to the reserve, as long as it doesn't harm the federal budget.

""The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers,"" Sacks said.

The assets for the non-bitcoin stockpile will be any crypto that the government otherwise seizes. Sacks didn't highlight any particular asset names in that category, despite some being recently named by the president.

Presidential orders don't necessarily have the same legal authority as acts of Congress, so it remains unclear how Trump's administration will approach the particulars of the order, which hadn't yet been made public Thursday night. It's also unclear what the total value of the current U.S. crypto holdings may be. 

Bitcoin fell nearly 5% to $85,000 in the minutes following the order, perhaps over disappointment the reserve consists of tokens already held by the government, but — for now — includes no new buys.

Ethereum's (ETH), Ripple's (XRP), Cardano's (ADA), and Solana's (SOL) are all lower by 4%-8% over the past hour as the order allows for no fresh government purchases of those tokens.

The executive order announcement was made on the eve of the White House's industry summit, in which leaders from across the crypto spectrum are set to discuss policy matters with members of Trump's administration. The president had been expected to announce crypto reserve details before or during that event. 

“Establishing a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile is a huge moment for both crypto and American leadership on the global stage,"" said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital, one of the business leaders set to attend the roundtable.

Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer for Bitwise Asset Management, said in a post that the move to set up a bitcoin reserve reduces the chance the government can ever try to outlaw the asset, and it ""dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic bitcoin reserves.""

But Charles Edwards, founder of Bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, called it the ""most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week,"" arguing that without a buying plan, the strategy is a ""pig in lipstick.""

US President Donald Trump has inked an executive order for a strategic bitcoin reserve and a digital asset stockpile.

The bitcoin reserve would be funded with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset proceedings, according to the executive order on Thursday.

The news was first announced on X by entrepreneur David Sacks who is the artificial intelligence and crypto czar at the White House. He said that because of the way the reserve is funded, creating it ""will not cost taxpayers a dime.""

The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce can develop ""budget-neutral"" strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin — as long as there are no incremental costs on American taxpayers, according to the executive order.

""Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve,"" according to the executive order.

It added that the US government currently holds a ""significant"" amount"" of bitcoin, but has not implemented a policy to maximize the cryptocurrency's ""strategic position as a unique store of value"" in the global financial system.

""Just as it is in our country's interest to thoughtfully manage national ownership and control of any other resource, our Nation must harness, not limit, the power of digital assets for our prosperity,"" it added.

The White House added in a fact sheet that premature sales of bitcoin have ""cost US taxpayers over $17 billion.""

""Taking affirmative steps to centralize ownership, control, and management of these assets within the Federal government will ensure proper oversight, accurate tracking, and a cohesive approach to managing the government's cryptocurrency holdings,"" it added.

Sacks said the US government owns an estimated 200,000 bitcoins.

""The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called 'digital gold,'"" Sacks wrote.

Bitcoin was trading around $87,500 at 9:49  p.m. ET. It was flat over 1 hour and 4.4% down over 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has been under pressure recently on broader risk-off sentiment. Bitcoin is still higher than on election day, when the price was around $68,000.

The US will also establish a digital asset stockpile made up of other digital assets owned by the Treasury Department that were forfeited in criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, according to the executive order. There are also no plans to acquire additional assets beyond those from forfeiture proceedings.

Before this presidential campaign, Trump took a tough stance on crypto.

In 2019, he described the digital assets as ""highly volatile and based on thin air"" and highlighted their role in the drug trade.

However, he embraced crypto in his last presidential campaign and called himself the ""crypto president."" The new administration is ending Biden-era investigations into cryptocurrency-associated companies, among other measures.

 Bitcoin's price tumbled after US President Donald Trump made a pledge not to sell any of the government’s current Bitcoin holdings but made no firm commitment to buy more. 

Bitcoin plunged approximately 6% after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

Market participants had hoped the government would announce a plan to buy more Bitcoin (BTC), but Trump’s crypto tsar David Sacks said on X it would only use the Bitcoin it already holds from criminal cases — though it will look to develop “budget-neutral” strategies to acquire additional Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin dropped about 6%, falling from $90,400 to $84,979, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Bitcoin has slightly recovered since, trading at $86,460 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap

Trading resource account The Kobeissi Letter said the reason for the Bitcoin price drop was there was “no explanation on how the reserve will be funded aside from Bitcoin already held by the US.”

Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) also fell on the news after Sacks confirmed that there will be a “US Digital Asset Stockpile,” but also only consist of digital assets forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings. 

“The government will not acquire additional assets for the Stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings,” Sacks said.

In the first hour after Sacks’ announcement, Ether had dropped 4%, XRP fell 7%, Solana had fallen 5.14%, and Cardano had slid 9.19%.

While it may not be the most optimistic announcement for the industry, some were surprised that Bitcoin’s price plunged after the announcement.

Electric Capital CEO Avichal said in an X post shortly after, “Who the hell sells the news of a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve?!”

Echoing a similar sentiment, pseudonymous crypto trader Ash Crypto said in an X post, “THIS IS NOT BUY THE RUMOR SELL THE NEWS EVENT, EVERY COUNTRY WILL FOLLOW SOON AND BITCOIN IS GOING TO $250,000+”

Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter added, “This market is way off. The ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ will have “additional bitcoin” acquisitions.” 

Other participants agree that it is a positive step that will only bolster greater adoption of Bitcoin.

Say what you will about the Department of Government Efficiency, but there are some ways that the Trump administration has significantly cut down on bloat. For example, it used to take at least a little digging to identify if a President was favor-trading and self-dealing. Now it seems like it just happens out in the open. So streamlined!

To that end, cryptocurrency analysis platform Nansen AI reported that World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance protocol that is operated primarily by President Trump’s three sons, purchased $25 million in cryptocurrencies including $10 million in Ethereum, $10 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and $1.5 million in of MOVE. That move comes just one day before President Trump will host the White House Crypto Summit on Friday. The company also announced Thursday that it was entering a “strategic reserve deal” with layer-1 blockchain project SUI, which caused a significant uptick in the value of the coin.

Now, to be fair, it doesn’t exactly take a genius to place a bet that the cryptocurrency market might spike in response to the hype generated by the White House Crypto Summit—just like when Trump announced a “Crypto Strategic Reserve,” it resulted in prices spiking. The crypto market, if nothing else, is extremely predictable in that it will react to hype.

But also, Trump’s kids run the company, and World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff (the son of billionaire Trump buddy Steve Witkoff) is one of the “industry leaders” invited to the summit. And that’s a whole lot of posturing to be doing right before an event that will almost certainly generate a bunch of hype, if not actual policy announcements that could cause the crypto market to surge again.

And it’d be silly to ignore the fact that World Liberty Financial has at least seemingly served as a platform for currying favor with the President via lining his kids’ pockets.

Justin Sun, a Chinese national and founder of the cryptocurrency TRON, was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023 for allegedly committing fraud and manipulating the price of his cryptocurrency. The SEC asked for a stay in the case shortly after Sun purchased $75 million worth of tokens from World Liberty Financial and joined the company as an advisor. Convenient!  Earlier this year, Reuters reported that several people who bought significant holdings of World Liberty tokens said a primary appeal was having a connection with Trump. Interesting! Also, World Liberty Financial is set up in such a way that the Trump family can lay claim to 75% of the net revenue. Very normal!

People have rightfully skewered Nancy Pelosi for her incredibly successful stock trading history, to the point where you can now ride the coattails of her trades that tend to overperform the market. It might be time to start doing the same thing by watching the crypto activity of World Liberty Financial. They sure seem to know something.

Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda discusses the halt in probes into crypto firms, regulation, China's presence in U.S. markets and efforts for technology independence.

President Trump, late Thursday, signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Crypto Czar David Sachs celebrated the move via a post on X. 

""The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,"" he wrote. ""It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.’"" 

Sachs, a Silicon Valley and pro-crypto veteran who will be shaping future policy around digital assets, reiterated his criticism of prior administrations for what he deemed as dropping the ball on bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value. 

""Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings,"" he also noted. 

Sachs also outlined how other digital currencies may be used. 

""IN ADDITION, the Executive Order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, consisting of digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings.""

The move comes on the eve of a Friday roundtable with members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets in what is being billed as a ""Digital Asset Summit.""

Attendees at Friday's meeting include the following crypto leaders, while more may be added:

Last Sunday, ahead of the meeting, Trump advanced his plans for a strategic reserve for cryptocurrencies, posting on Truth Social: 

""A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!.""

Trump's moves to support the crypto industry have drawn concern from some conservatives

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, a day before meeting with executives from the cryptocurrency industry at the White House.

The reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, the White House crypto czar, billionaire David Sacks, said in a post on social media platform X.

Attendees at Friday's White House crypto summit expect the event to serve as a stage for Trump to formally announce his plans to build a strategic reserve containing bitcoin and four other cryptocurrencies.

Earlier this week, Trump announced the names of five digital assets he expects to include in this reserve, spiking the market value of each. The five are bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano, the president said.

It is not clear how such a reserve would work or how it would benefit taxpayers.

Trump's moves to support the crypto industry, which spent millions backing him and other Republicans in the November elections, have drawn concern from some conservatives and crypto backers over giveaways to an already wealthy community and delegitimizing the digital currency industry.

Proponents argue that a reserve would help taxpayers benefit from crypto's price growth.

The president's support for the crypto industry has also sparked conflict-of-interest concerns. Trump's family has launched cryptocurrency meme coins, and the president also holds a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform.

His aides have said Trump has handed over control of his business ventures, which are being reviewed by outside ethics lawyers.

 A US strategic Bitcoin reserve “dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic Bitcoin reserves,” says Bitwise's Matt Hougan. 

A strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States reduces the possibility that the government will ever “ban” the cryptocurrency and could encourage many more nations to adopt Bitcoin, according to crypto observers. 

On March 7, US President Donald Trump signed an order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a digital asset stockpile. 

White House crypto czar David Sacks said that the reserve would be capitalized with “Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings,” estimated at around 200,000 BTC. This apparently disappointed traders, as it led to an immediate 6% fall in the price of Bitcoin. 

However, many say the markets may have it wrong, and the news should be viewed as bullish.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said one of the impacts of a US strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve (SBR) is that it “dramatically reduces the likelihood the US government will someday ‘ban’ Bitcoin.”

In November, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis suggested that Bitcoin could one day force the federal government to balance its budget. 

“A legal prohibition against Bitcoin can restore unique implementation of permanent primary deficits, and so can a tax on Bitcoin,” it said at the time. 

Source: Matt Hougan

The US Bitcoin reserve also dramatically increases the chances that other nations will establish Bitcoin reserves and accelerates the speed at which other nations will consider establishing them, said Hougan, as it creates a short window for them to “front-run” potential Bitcoin buying by the US. 

The US is the global leader in nation-state Bitcoin holdings, with 207,189 BTC worth around $18 billion at current prices, according to BitBO. China is estimated to come in second with an estimated 194,000 BTC, followed by the United Kingdom, holding 61,000 Bitcoin. 

El Salvador is the only country to have designated BTC as legal tender. It is still accumulating and currently holds 6,103 BTC worth around $534 million, according to the nation’s Bitcoin Office.

“I expect many of the G20 to take notice and eventually follow America’s leadership,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. 

Hougan also opined that a US Bitcoin strategic reserve makes it much harder for institutions such as agencies like the International Monetary Fund “to position Bitcoin as somehow dangerous or inappropriate to hold.”

The IMF has been against sovereign nations, such as El Salvador, investing in BTC. On March 3, the IMF approved a funding program with El Salvador for $1.4 billion on the condition that it downgraded its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. 

The memorandum of understanding indicated a condition of “no voluntary accumulation of BTC by the public sector in El Salvador.”

Bitwise head of research Ryan Rasmussen continued with the notion, saying that the end game was never “the US government buys all of the world’s Bitcoin.”.

He listed what the US SBR means: “Other countries will buy BTC, wealth managers have no excuse, financial institutions have no excuse, pensions and endowments have no excuse, fear of the US selling is gone, the US will likely buy more, likelihood of states buying just went up, and the probability the government outlaws Bitcoin is definitively zero.”

The co-founder and CEO at Lightspark, David Marcus, simply said, “This is a balanced outcome and the right decision for now,” adding he was “happy reason has prevailed.”

Meanwhile, crypto lawyer John Deaton points out that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick “have been directed by the POTUS to find ‘budget neutral’ ways to acquire BTC.”

It was only a year ago that regulators approved the first US spot Bitcoin ETF, added ETF Store President Nate Geraci.

Bitcoin is currently rebounding, having reached $88,000 at the time of writing.

Bitcoin (BTC) price extends its decline, trading around $87,000 on Friday after falling more than 7% so far this week. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices followed in BTC’s footsteps and declined nearly 15% and 16%, respectively, despite Trump signing an executive order to create the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on Thursday. 

Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it…

Bitcoin price faced rejection around the $95,000 level on Sunday and declined 8.54% the next day. However, on Tuesday, BTC dipped below the daily support level at $85,000 but bounced and closed above it. This daily level roughly coincides with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,843, making it a key support zone. At the time of writing on Friday, it trades down, finding support around the 200-day EMA at $85,843.

If BTC breaks below the 200-day EMA and closes below $85,000, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 41, which points downwards after rejecting from its neutral level of 50 earlier this week, indicating bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator coils around each other, suggesting indecisiveness among the traders.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if the $85,000 level holds as support, BTC could extend the recovery to retest its Sunday high of $95,000.

Ethereum price found support around its $2,125 level on Saturday and rose 13.56%, closing above its daily resistance of $2,359 the next day. However, ETH erased its recent gains on Monday but found support around its $2,125 level the next day and recovered 3.65% by Wednesday. At the time of writing on Friday, it declines and approaches its $2,125 support level.

If ETH declines and closes below $2,125, it could extend the decline to retest its weekly support level of $1,905.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 35 after rejecting around its neutral level of 50 on Sunday, indicating bearish momentum. At the same time, its MACD also showed a bearish crossover last week, suggesting a downward trend.



ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if the $2,125 level holds as support and ETH continues its recovery, it could extend the rally to retest its next resistance level at $3,000.

Ripple price was rejected around its key psychological level of $3 on Sunday, and it declined 18.79% the next day. However, it found support on Tuesday and bounced off its 100-day EMA at $2.31, recovering 8.63% until Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, it declines slightly down around $2.48.

If the 100-day EMA at $2.31 holds, XRP could extend the recovery to retest its psychological level of $3. A firm close above this level could extend an additional rally to retest its January 16 high of $3.40.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 49 and remains flat around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among traders. The RSI must move above its neutral level for the recovery to be sustained.



XRP/USDT daily chart

However, if XRP fails to find support at the 100-day EMA and closes below, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Bitcoin price extends its decline, trading around $87,000 on Friday after falling more than 7% so far this week. Ethereum and Ripple prices declined nearly 15% and 16% respectively despite Trump signing an executive order to create the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on Thursday.

Litecoin price dipped below the $100 mark on Thursday, losing 22% in the past week as markets reacted to updates to US trade tariffs and speculation surrounding White House Crypto Summit to be held on Friday.

Bitcoin price dipped 5% to hit $85,000 on Monday as skittish sentiment around US Trade policy and Non-Farm Payrolls data introduced fresh volatility ahead of the White House Crypto Summit. However, a recent Bitcoin Strategic reserve announcement from Trump's Crypto Czar David Sacks could spark more gains. 

AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks confirmed on Thursday President Trump's executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and a list of key crypto industry figures attending the White House Crypto Summit.

Bitcoin (BTC) price extends its decline and trades below $80,000 at the time of writing on Friday, falling over 15% so far this week. This price correction wiped $660 billion of market capitalization from the overall crypto market and saw $3.68 billion in total liquidations this week.

 US President Donald Trump could issue an executive order as soon as March 7 to create a reserve for the country to buy Bitcoin, Bloomberg reports. 

Update (March 6, 11:40 pm UTC): This article has been updated to add an X post from Charles Gasparino and information on US government crypto holdings.

Update (March 7, 12:31 am UTC): US President Donald Trump has since signed an executive order establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” on March 7.

US President Donald Trump could reportedly sign an executive order to create a Bitcoin reserve during the White House Crypto Summit on March 7.

Such a reserve would be expected to buy more Bitcoin (BTC), in comparison to the US hanging on to the BTC it already owns through criminal seizures, Bloomberg reported on March 6, citing people familiar with the matter.

However, there’s a range of options for several potential crypto-related executive actions being considered. Trump could also announce that the US will stop selling crypto it has seized and use it to seed a national crypto stockpile.

One possible proposal could also affect the tax treatment of crypto, which may need review and approval from Congress.

Trump’s possible actions are still under discussion and might not happen or change, Bloomberg reported.

Trump signed an executive order in January creating a working group under White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks to evaluate “the creation of a strategic national digital assets stockpile.”

On March 2, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that the crypto reserve would include XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). He later added Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) would be “the heart” of the reserve.

Meanwhile, Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino said in a March 6 X post that his sources said the White House was preparing to soon further clarify details of the crypto reserve.

“My guess is it will address the funding mechanism, ie, the potential roadblock for buying digital coins [with] taxpayer money (they would need congressional approval, which is next to impossible),” Gasparino said.

Gasparino said another way to potentially fund crypto purchases would be to use Trump’s idea of a sovereign wealth fund, which he signed an executive order to explore creating last month.

He added, as Bloomberg reported, that the White House could look to fund the plan initially with crypto seized in criminal cases.

The US government is holding around $18.28 billion worth of seized crypto, with 198,109 BTC worth $17.87 billion making up the bulk of its holdings, according to Arkham Intelligence.

Two things can be true regarding the ACC's settlement this week of the crippling lawsuits brought by Florida State and Clemson: the resolution provides long-desired security and solidarity for a conference that looked to be ripped apart by those schools' saber rattling ... and it also provides a blueprint detailing how college sports could be ripped apart. 

In settling the suits, the ACC rather dramatically stratified itself. There are clear dividing lines not unlike society itself (upper, middle and lower class). Without disrespecting anyone, we'll leave it to the reader to figure out those classes. Just understand this is what Florida State and Clemson wanted -- recognition that they are bigger brands and have more invested in football than other member schools. 

That's not necessarily a bad thing. One, that economic recognition kept the conference together. Also, it's been done before. In realignment, the Big 12 and Big Ten welcomed new members who agreed to take fractions of a full share to join. The ACC itself took SMU when the school agreed to take no media rights revenue for nine years. Stanford and Cal took 30% shares to be able to play major college football when the Pac-12 fell apart. 

In fact, the Pac-12 broke apart, in part, because everyone was receiving equal shares. (Well, that and the doomed Pac-12 Network and league president asleep at the wheel.) Ask USC and UCLA, which simmered for years over that fact. 

So what's the big deal in the ACC? If it wasn't already, now the conference has established itself as the clear No. 3 among the Power Four. Any arrangement that keeps the league out of court is a win. 

Going forward, 40% of ACC revenue will be distributed between the 14 legacy schools and 60% will be set aside for winning bonuses and those high-achievers in TV ratings. 

But look deeper. There is disparity in what is a significant reorganization of revenue. While schools achieving bonuses by winning championships could earn $30 million more in a given year, others will get $7 million less.

Every school in the conference walked into this agreement with their eyes wide open. What they didn't see (or admit) is a troubling future – a different future in a parallel universe. 

It is a universe in which only a portion of the 134 FBS schools survive to call themselves FBS schools. A new ecosystem of ""haves"" is already being created on a national scale. 

You should remember the Super League and Project Rudy that were largely dismissed by the power commissioners when the proposals came out last year. Both of their models would reduce the highest level of college football to 70-80 schools with centralized governance. That centralized governance and outside investment would unlock billions that have been tied up in separate conference media rights deals over the years. 

Essentially, that would mean less loyalty to the SEC, Big Ten, ACC and Big 12 and more loyalty to whoever is running that combo of 70-80 schools. 

It would also cause a lot of people to alter their career paths. Greg Sankey (SEC commissioner) and Tony Pettiti (Big Ten commissioner) might be out of a job in that model. 

The Super League folks were so brash in their roll out, CBS Sports asked one of their members last year about the prospects of the SEC and Big Ten commissioners role in a new college football landscape. 

""We'd buy them out,"" that person said, more than half seriously.

Without saying it, the conferences -- not just the ACC -- are saying it: the breakaway that has long been discussed is taking place before our eyes. There is going to be a day when the likes of Alabama wakes up and asks itself, ""Exactly why is Vanderbilt making the same money as us?"" Same for Ohio State and, say, Purdue.

In the ACC, FSU, Clemson, Miami and North Carolina are the biggest brands. The new revenue sharing plan is merely a formal recognition. Whether they have a similar wake-up call is not the issue.

This eventual awakening represents the ongoing consolidation of the sport. Realignment has claimed the Pac-12. It has also empowered the 34 schools that make up the SEC and Big Ten. Nothing of consequence happens in college athletics happens without their say-so.   

Whether those conferences would cede power for the greater good -- meaning more money -- has yet to be determined. 

But that money is becoming available. The Super League would be backed by private equity. Third-party investment in college athletics is already about to blow up in a big way, so dismissing the Super League/Project Rudy because of its funding plan doesn't make sense. 

The Big 12 considered a private equity infusion of as much as a $1 billion, CBS Sports first reported last year. The Big Ten is reportedly looking at a private equity investment. Since at least last summer, American Conference commissioner Tim Pernetti has been bullish publicly on considering outside investment in his conference. 

""I'm encouraged because everybody is out there doing it,"" Pernetti told CBS Sports of investment opportunities in the sport. ""It's great. Not only is investment important but the expertise that comes with that investment is important.""

Consider all of it a reflection of media rights revenue economics. Eighty percent of any media rights deal is based on a conference's football value. Inside that, the value of any conference is held by the top three or four teams. 

Do the math, for the ACC and the sport. The blueprint then is already in place for roll out (more or less) by about 2030 when the current media rights deals (except the ACC) all expire.

In the ACC, there's Florida State, Clemson, Miami, North Carolina. There's your four. Three of them are football schools. The other (North Carolina) is trying to become one having already spent about $15 million to hire Bill Belichick and his staff. 

Think of that as investment in whatever college football looks like in 2030. Kansas is doing the same thing, spending $400 million on its Gateway Project. Northwestern is spending $800 million to basically build a new Ryan Field. 

When Rutgers was invited to the Big Ten in 2012, it borrowed massively against future earnings to make up an athletic deficit. It will get its first full Big Ten share in 2027, 15 years after joining the league. It didn't have a choice if it wanted to be in the big time. 

In a romantic way, think of those investments as love letters to the game, or whoever eventually will be running the game. Those who don't want to be left behind. 

This is not to say those schools are going to leave anytime soon because that would be going against what the ACC finalized this week. It is to say those ACC powers have options when The Big One hits. The Big One -- as is becoming increasingly evident -- is already hitting. 

That is, a separation of the top football-playing schools. 

And as a Power Four administrator told me this week: It's not going to be 2030 before ""they have that fight."" It's going to be sooner. 

It's time to think a different way. Networks thought nothing of cherry picking the best brands that led to the Pac-12's demise. One day soon, conference logos could mean nothing. A centralized economy means more for everyone. See the NFL. 

We can see that now. The economics are showing us the path. The SEC and Big Ten are virtue signaling with their desire for automatic qualifiers in the College Football Playoff. Short of that, it looks like the two powerhouse leagues will create more, better content by playing each other in nonconference games. They already have voting control of the structure and format of the CFP beginning in 2026. 

They're doing it because they can. They're doing it because the rest of FBS can't, or won't. 

In a perfect world, the Big 12 and ACC would merge and at least pose more of a threat to the SEC and Big Ten. Or maybe that eventually happens on its own as part of Super League economics. 

Consolidation used to mean they were coming for your league. In the future it could mean the game is coming for your alma mater.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,California's Gavin Newsom says trans athletes in female sports 'deeply unfair',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz03ye4j8rzo,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 01:18:16 GMT","

California Governor Gavin Newsom has broken with many elected Democrats by saying he thinks it is ""deeply unfair"" to allow transgender women and girls to compete in female sports.

Newsom,  a potential 2028 presidential contender who leads one of the most liberal states in the US and has long been a trailblazer on LGBT rights, made the comments on his new podcast. 

""I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that,"" Newsom told conservative figure Charlie Kirk. ""It is an issue of fairness, it's deeply unfair. We've got to own that. We've got to acknowledge it."" 

Newsom's change of tone comes amid a debate within his party over the extent to which cultural factors played a role in their resounding defeat in November, when Republicans won the White House and both chambers of Congress.

A number of Democrats quickly denounced the governor's comments. 

""We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks,"" a statement from California's LGBT legislative caucus read.  

On the debut episode of the governor's podcast, This is Gavin Newsom, his first guest was a pro-Trump activist whose Turning Point USA organisation advocates for conservative ideas on liberal-leaning college campuses. 

The two discussed why Democratic nominee Kamala Harris lost to President Donald Trump, and Newsom said his party was being politically ""crushed"" on transgender issues.

The governor referred to a viral Trump campaign ad that had the tagline: ""Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.""

""It was devastating,"" Newsom said. ""And she didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating.""

Kirk argued that Democrats were out of touch with everyday Americans because of broad support within the party for transgender athletes competing in sports, which he said was unfair. 

""I revere sports,"" said Newsom. ""So, the issue of fairness is completely legit.""

The governor added: ""The way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well.""

Former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called Newsom's remarks about trans athletes ""disgusting"".

Pramila Jayapal, a left-wing Democrat representing a district in the north-western state of Washington, told Politico that her party should not ""take the bait and give into their anti-trans people rhetoric"". 

But one moderate Democratic lawmaker agreed. 

Seth Moulton, of Massachusetts, told Politico that Newsom was correct and polling shows it. 

""More and more are willing to say what they've probably always thought - and that's a good thing,"" he said. 

According to an opinion survey in January by the New York Times/Ipsos, almost all Republicans and nearly seven in 10 Democrats oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women's sports.

Throughout his career, Newsom has positioned himself to the left of his party on LGBT rights.

He made headlines in 2004 as San Francisco mayor when he ordered the city clerk to issue same-sex marriage licences, which at the time wasn't allowed under state or federal law. 

Newsom made the state the first sanctuary for transgender youth and protected school curriculums that included LGBT history.

Last year he signed legislation that made California the first state to bar school districts from requiring staff to notify parents if their child changed gender identity.

The reserve will hold cryptocurrency forfeited to the government in criminal or civil proceedings, said the White House.

It is unclear what the deal would mean for Boots and its UK operations.

Syed spent 20 years in prison for the murder of his ex-girlfriend, but the podcast helped free him.

A powerful winter storm has hit parts of the US midwest with strong winds and heavy snow.

The eight Starship test flight from Elon Musk's private space company did result in another successful catch of the rocket booster.

The 'Outnumbered' panel discussed the House vote to censure Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, after he interrupted President Donald Trump during his address to Congress. 

Nike debuted its first Super Bowl commercial in 27 years last month, and while a star-studded female lineup of athletes was involved, the ad received criticism for the company’s stance on supporting transgender athletes competing in women’s sports. 

Caitlin Clark, Sabrina Ionescu, JuJu Watkins, Sha’Carri Richardson, Jordan Chiles and other stars from various sports were in the one-minute ad that had different language with the same theme. 

The slogans included ""You can’t flex, so flex,"" ""You can’t fill a stadium, so fill that stadium,"" ""You can’t be emotional, so be emotional"" and ""You can’t win, so win.""

XX-XY Athletics, the athletic brand whose goal is to support female athletes by defending safety and fairness in women’s sports and keeping biological males out of women’s and girls sports, released a video of several athletes reacting to Nike’s ad. 

Powerlifter April Hutchinson, who was suspended from the Canadian Powerlifting Union for two years for speaking out against a trans athlete entering competitions in women’s categories, took exception to the part of Nike’s ad about flexing. 

""I’ve never been told that I can’t flex or can’t do this or that,"" Hutchinson said.

NIKE, NFL WOMEN'S SPORTS SUPER BOWL COMMERCIALS DRAW BACKLASH AMID NATIONAL TRANS ATHLETE CONTROVERSIES

University of Nevada women’s volleyball captain Sia Liilii, who, among many teammates, fought against her school’s decision to play against trans athlete Blaire Fleming and the San Jose State Spartans last season, felt Nike was missing the mark. 

""That Nike ad kinda represented old feminism. I don’t think anyone is telling women in sports they can’t champion their sport,"" Liilii explained.

""Fake feminism,"" ""pretending to care about women"" and ""Nike is ignoring the real problem"" were lines used by other athletes in the video. 

The ""real problem"" is the main point of what XX-XY Athletics was getting across in its video response to Nike. 

Sia Liilii tells her story in IW Features' ""Hold the Line."" (IW Features)

""Women can flex, be confident, be emotional, fill stadiums. And win. But what can’t they do? Speak. On one subject in particular: protecting women’s sports,"" an XX-XY Athletics press release said. 

""’Just Do It’ – that’s your slogan, isn’t it Nike? Just do it. Stand up for women. It’s the easiest thing in the world to do,"" sports civil rights advocate Riley Gaines said, ending the video.

When the Nike ad came out, Jennifer Sey, a former U.S. gymnast and founder/CEO of XX-XY Athletics, quickly called out Nike on X. 

""You’re so full of it. The only thing female athletes are told they can’t do is stand up for the integrity of their sports, for keeping men out of women’s sports. Literally, that’s the only thing,"" Sey wrote in response to the commercial on X. 

Michele Tafoya, the veteran sports broadcaster and journalist, also took exception to it.

""Nike is too late to this party. And they’re stuck in stereotypical language from about 25 years ago,"" Tafoya wrote, later adding, ""What a waste of ad dollars."" 

President Donald Trump fulfilled his campaign promise of protecting women’s sports, signing the ""No Men in Women’s Sports"" executive order Feb. 5. While some states complied and the NCAA revised its own trans athlete policy, states like Minnesota have rejected changes to their policies.

Democratic California governor faces backlash after saying trans women playing in female sports was ‘deeply unfair’

Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California believed to be eyeing a run for president in 2028, is facing fierce backlash from LGBTQ+ rights advocates after his suggestion that the participation of transgender women and girls in female sports was “deeply unfair”.

In the inaugural episode of his podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, the governor hosted conservative political activist and Maga darling Charlie Kirk. The co-founder and executive director of the rightwing Turning Point USA, a Phoenix-based organization that operates on school campuses, told Newsom: “You, right now, should come out and be like: ‘You know what? The young man who’s about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports – that shouldn’t happen.’ You, as the governor, should step out and say: ‘No.’”

The governor responded: “I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that … it’s deeply unfair.”

Members of his own party in California quickly condemned the comments.

“We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks,” assembly member Chris Ward and senator Caroline Menjivar, of the California legislative LGBTQ+ caucus, said in a statement. “All students deserve the academic and health benefits of sports activity, and until Donald Trump began obsessing about it, playing on a team consistent with one’s gender has not been a problem since the standard was passed in 2013.”

California law has long protected trans youth’s rights to participate in school activities that match their gender.

The governor’s remarks also earned him scorn from national LGBTQ+ rights leaders, with the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president, Kelley Robinson, saying in a statement: “History doesn’t remember those who waver – it remembers those who refuse to back down.”

Newsom’s comments saw him agreeing with one of the central anti-trans talking points of Republicans and rightwing activists, who have fueled moral panics about trans women in public spaces and trans youth healthcare in recent years. Out of more than 500,000 college athletes, there are fewer than 10 who are trans and out, officials recently said.

Proponents of anti-trans restrictions for K-12 students have often struggled to find examples of trans girls playing in school sports.

The few openly trans athletes who are in the public eye have faced intense harassment and scrutiny. Civil rights advocates argue that for youth, their ability to play sports that align with their gender is a matter of basic dignity and equal protection under the law.

Izzy Gardon, the governor’s communications director, said in a statement on Thursday evening: “The governor rejects the right wing’s cynical attempt to weaponize this debate as an excuse to vilify individual kids.” His office earlier pointed out that in the podcast, the governor noted the high rates of suicide and anxiety among trans people, saying: “The way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with. So, both things I can hold in my hand.”

Bamby Salcedo, a longtime Los Angeles-based activist and president of the TransLatin@ Coalition, said it was devastating to hear Newsom fail to even correct Kirk when he appeared to be referring to trans women as men.

“For someone who says he is supportive of our communities to come out and say these awful things, he’s using us as political pawns,” she said.

“Denying the opportunity for young people to participate in sports is denying them the opportunity to be who they fully are. It is really damaging.”

Scott Wiener, a state senator and proponent of trans rights, said in an interview that he considered Newsom a longtime ally of LGBTQ+ people and that it had been “brutal” to hear the governor’s comments. He noted there has been a “decades-long strategic plan by the right wing to demonize trans people”, adding: “They’ve done it very methodically. It’s disgusting, but it’s had some success.”

Trans youth in the public eye have faced national ridicule, Wiener noted: “If they’re out as trans, they’re so courageous and they’re putting themselves at risk. It’s really important for people who know better to have their backs.”

Wiener, who has introduced legislation to strengthen the state’s trans refuge law, said Newsom has had a good track record on trans civil rights bills, and he hoped that wouldn’t change.

State assemblymember Alex Lee, another LGBTQ+ caucus member, said Newsom’s remarks were “shocking and offensive” and that it would hurt his future ambitions: “Throwing trans people under the bus will alienate lots of people who are LGBTQ+ and allies across the nation … If you’re running to be a Republican nominee, this is a great strategy. But if you want to run as a Democrat and someone who is pro-human rights, this is a terrible look.”

Some California Republicans were dubious of Newsom, a longtime champion of LGBTQ+ rights who drew national attention when, as the mayor of San Francisco, he defied state law and began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

“This is stunning,” the California assemblymember Bill Essayli wrote on X. “Talk is cheap @GavinNewsom. Why don’t you support my bill AB 844 to reverse CA’s law allowing boys to compete in girls sports? You’re the Governor, not a commentator!”

Donald Trump made the issue of trans women in sports a central pillar of his campaign and as president has tried to erase trans and non-binary Americans from public life.

He signed an executive order declaring that the federal government would only recognize two sexes, male and female, and another titled Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports, which threatens to withhold federal funds from schools that do not comply. Meanwhile, the US state department has ordered officials worldwide to deny visas to transgender athletes attempting to come to the US for sports competitions, including the Olympics, which Los Angeles will host in 2028.

During his joint speech to Congress this week, the president spotlighted the story of a volleyball player who was injured by a trans athlete on the opposing team and threatened to pull federal funding from any school that defied his executive order.

Earlier this week, Senate Democrats banded together to block a Republican bill that would have barred transgender women and girls from playing on female sports teams.

“What Republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other and distract people from what they’re actually doing,” the senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat of Hawaii, said in a floor speech during debate over the bill on Monday. Instead of addressing the most pressing issues of the day, such as rising grocery costs and a growing measles outbreak, Schatz said, Republicans were instead focused on an issue that was “totally irrelevant to 99.9% of all people across the country”.

Since Kamala Harris’s 2024 loss, Democrats have been embroiled in a debate over what went wrong, ostensibly the reason for the governor’s podcast in which he will “talk directly with people I disagree with”. Desperate for answers, some Democrats have pointed to the party’s support for trans rights as a reason for their defeat.

In the interview, Newsom conceded Trump’s signature campaign ad – “Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you” – was both “brutal” and effective.

“She didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating,” the governor told Kirk.

“It’s not just that this was like the Willie Horton ad of the 2024 [cycle]. It wasn’t just like Lee Atwater brilliance. It’s that it reflected truth that the voters felt,” Kirk said. “Yeah, I appreciate that,” Newsom interjected, as Kirk continued: “Because voters felt as if their country was slipping away.”

As Democrats search for a way out of the political wilderness, and grapple with their position on the issue, LGBTQ+ rights advocates are warning the party not to play into Republicans’ hands.

“Our message to [Governor] Newsom and all leaders across the country is simple,” Robinson, of the Human Rights Campaign said. “The path to 2028 isn’t paved with the betrayal of vulnerable communities – it’s built on the courage to stand up for what’s right and do the hard work to actually help the American people.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Stephen A. Smith has become a fixture on ESPN’s airwaves, and that won’t be changing anytime soon.

Smith, a former newspaper beat reporter who rose to fame by pioneering the art of the sports debate show, has agreed with ESPN on a new five-year, $100 million contract, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC. 

ESPN declined to comment to NBC News on the contract deal, which was first reported by The Athletic. 

As one of the network’s most well-known and most-used on-air talents, Smith has wide-reaching influence and leeway to opine on a variety of topics including the NBA, as part of ESPN’s pregame show.

He will continue to appear on “First Take,” the morning debate show, but according to The Athletic, will no longer be a figurehead of the NBA pregame show next season, and will be allowed to scale back other ESPN appearances, too. CNBC has not confirmed any changes in his role at ESPN.

That could mean more opportunities for Smith to appear on shows not on ESPN and to discuss topics away from sports even more frequently. In recent years Smith has regularly expanded his scope to politics on his own show, and even appeared on Fox News. He has been floated as a possible presidential candidate in 2028.

He downplayed the suggestion on NBC’s “The Tonight Show” on Wednesday.

“I’m saying, wait a minute now, I don’t want to do this,” Smith told host Jimmy Fallon. “But the fact that they’re talking about me this way, I must say, I approve this message.”

LAKE PLACID — In football, this would be a five-touchdown lead. In basketball, the subs would be in. In boxing, someone might consider throwing a towel.

Matt Weston of Britain has a lead of 0.89 seconds at the halfway point of the world skeleton championships, after he cruised through his first two runs on Thursday. He will try to finish off the title with two more runs at Mount Van Hoevenberg on Friday, with Kimberley Bos of the Netherlands the leader at the midpoint of the women’s skeleton race.

Weston’s 0.89-second lead might not sound like much. But in a sliding sport, where races are often decided by hundredths of a second, it’s an eternity.

“On his day, he’s nearly unbeatable,” said British teammate Marcus Wyatt, who was in second place.

Sure enough, Thursday was Weston’s day. Friday might be his day as well; only two runs separate the two-time defending World Cup overall champion from his second world title. Only an enormous mistake would cost Weston the crown at this point.

“It’s not a bad day,” Weston said. “But I’ve had enough experience now racing four heats over two days to know I can’t take my foot off the gas. … There’s more in there.”

Germany has the third and fourth spots in the men’s race, with Axel Jungk (1:50.03) and Christopher Grotheer (1:50.05). Realistically, Wyatt, Jungk and Grotheer are all racing for the silver medal now on a track that might play host to the Olympic races next winter if a facility being built in Italy isn’t finished in time.

A pair of Chinese sliders — Yin Zheng and Chen Wenhao — are fifth and sixth, followed by Austin Florian of the U.S. in seventh and Vladyslav Heraskevych of Ukraine eighth. Florian tied a 9-year-old start record at Mount Van Hoevenberg with a push of 4.70 seconds at the top of the ramp.

“I knew it had it in me,” Florian said. “I was just wondering when it was going to come out.”

Bos leads at women’s midway point

–

To illustrate how much of a gap 0.89 seconds usually is in sliding, consider the difference between the men’s and women’s races.

There’s an 0.89-second gap between first and second in the men’s race — and there’s an 0.89-second gap between first and 14th place in the women’s race. Bos leads with a time of 1:50.87, with Anna Fernstaedt of the Czech Republic second (1:51.06) and defending world champion Hallie Clarke of Canada (1:51.09) third.

“This is really cool,” Bos said. “And it’s really close, which is the best racing.”

Daniel Barefoot of the United States begins his first run Thursday in the men's four-heat skeleton competition at the iBSF World Championships in Lake Placid. Barefoot is in 14th place in a men's field of 29 sleds with the final two runs scheduled for today. (Provided photo — Lou Reuter)

The top U.S. slider is tied for fourth; Mystique Ro finished her two runs in 1:51.20, the same time as Nicole Rocha Silveira of Brazil. And Clarke — who is only 20 — is within striking distance of becoming the third woman to win back-to-back world titles.

“I’m really proud of myself for being able to calm my nerves down because there’s a different amount of pressure that comes with trying to defend a title versus just going into a world championships,” Clarke said. “But I’m really happy with my second run. I made some corrections from my first and I’m really relying on that experience from last year to guide me through this.”

The Associated Press

All-Pro edge rusher Trey Hendrickson, who led the NFL in sacks this past season, received permission from the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday to seek a trade, two people with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press.

The people spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss personnel moves.

ESPN first reported Hendrickson received permission to seek a trade after receiving a statement from the Bengals star.

“It’s been an honor and a privilege to represent Cincinnati over the last four years,” Hendrickson said in the statement. “I love this city and organization. I appreciate the privilege of now being allowed to explore my options.”

Hendrickson had 17.5 sacks last season for the second straight year. His 57 sacks since joining the Bengals in 2021 are third-most in the league over the past four seasons. He signed with Cincinnati after four seasons with New Orleans.

Hendrickson requested a trade last year before the NFL Draft, but the Bengals did not grant the request. With wide receivers Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins also due for large extensions, trying to sign all three was going to be a large undertaking, even though Bengals director of player personnel Duke Tobin reiterated last week at the NFL scouting combine that it could be possible.

“We have a lot of really good football players, fantastic football players. And we’re fortunate to be in a position where we can fit them all in. We’ve managed our cap well,” Tobin said. “We want a high payroll and low dead money, so the people that are in Cincinnati playing for us can get all the money.”

More cuts

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The Jacksonville Jaguars are releasing two-time Pro Bowl tight end Evan Engram and returner/receiver Devin Duvernay. 

The moves are part of an offensive makeover under new coach Liam Coen.They also are dumping journeyman cornerback Ronald Darby, who is coming off arguably the worst season in his 10-year professional career. The Jaguars notified all three players of the pending cuts Thursday, according to a person familiar with the process. 

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the moves won’t be official until the new league year begins next week.

Texans trade for WR

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The Jacksonville Jaguars found a trade partner — a division rival, no less — for receiver Christian Kirk before officially releasing him. 

A person familiar with the move says the Jaguars agreed to trade Kirk to AFC South opponent Houston for a seventh-round draft pick in 2026. 

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither side confirmed the deal, which won’t be official until the new league year begins Wednesday. The Texans were looking for a slot receiver after Tank Dell underwent a second knee surgery earlier this week.

Deal reworked

Deshaun Watson’s contract has been reworked again by the Cleveland Browns as the team looks to clear salary cap space with the new league year less than one week away. 

A person with knowledge of the move tells The Associated Press the latest restructuring of the quarterback’s contract will clear nearly $36 million in cap space for the Browns. 

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not announced the move, which was first reported by ESPN. 

The Browns were nearly $22 million over the cap before restructuring Watson’s deal. It is the second time in three months that Watson’s contract was reworked.

WVU’s JJ Quinerly leaps in for a layup against Kansas State during their regular season game on Feb. 17, a 70-57 WVU win. The two teams will meet Friday in the first round of the Big 12 Tournament.

Regardless of what happens at the T-Mobile Center today, no one on the 16th-ranked WVU women’s basketball team is going to be sweating it out on Selection Sunday.

The Mountaineers (23-6), seeded fourth in the Big 12 tournament, had long ago secured a spot in the NCAAs.

That doesn’t exactly mean WVU has nothing to play for at noon today when it faces fifth-seeded Kansas State (26-6).

“Some teams have to win it to get into the NCAA tournament. Other teams probably know they’re in, but need seed lines for the NCAA tournament,” WVU head coach Mark Kellogg said. “There’s still a ton going into it.”

The only bubble WVU finds itself on is whether or not it gets selected as one of the 16 regional hosts for the first two rounds of the NCAAs.

“I believe we may have to win the whole tournament to become a host,” WVU guard J.J. Quinerly said. “I think that’s a possibility for us.”

“I don’t know if we’re going to get a chance to host or not,” added Kellogg. “If we go win three (at the Big 12 tournament), that maybe puts us in the ballpark.”

The Mountaineers would have a much better argument with a second win this season against the Wildcats, who knocked off UCF 80-65 on Thursday to advance to the quarterfinals.

WVU, meanwhile has been resting and preparing, the result of earning a double-bye. WVU’s double-bye, in part was earned, because it beat Kansas State in the regular season 70-57.

“It was good for our kids, a good opportunity for us,” Kellogg said. “But only if you take advantage of it.”

K-State is ranked 20th in the AP Top 25, but is No. 9 in the NCAA’s NET rankings. WVU is ranked 11th in the NET, meaning this could be an opportunity to move into the top 10 and essentially closer to being a host school for the opening rounds.

The pregame news will center around Wildcats’ 6-foot-6 center Ayoka Lee.

She sat out the first meeting against WVU this season recovering from a fractured foot. She tried to return on Feb. 22 against Kansas, but still felt discomfort.

K-State head coach Jeff Mittie said going into the Big 12 tourney that Lee would be held out and not play again until the NCAA tournament.

So far, that’s been true. Lee did not play against UCF on Thursday.

Whether or not Mittie continues to hold Lee out remains to be seen.

For WVU, it becomes a question of how far has the program come under Kellogg in his second season.

Quinerly is in her final season and WVU has not advanced past the Big 12 quarterfinal round since playing Baylor in the title game in 2021, the year before Quinerly arrived on campus.

“I’ve said I definitely want to do something special here before I leave,” Quinerly said. “Hopefully we’ll get the chance to do it this year.”

To do it, the Mountaineers will need more production other than just Quinerly, who is averaging 34.5 points per game over the final two games of the regular season.

“We need to get (Sydney) Shaw and Kyah (Watson) going again,” Kellogg said. “We’re going to need them. When you’re talking about tournaments and potentially playing three games in three days, you need your full roster to produce and stay involved.”

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - The South Dakota State Women’s Basketball Team had their first game of the Summit League Tournament on Thursday, but it was a former SDSU star that has been creating conversation among fans.

Former Jackrabbit Myah Selland was not just beloved for her play on the court, but also for her efforts off the court.

As the co-founder of the non-profit Her Turn, which seeks to empower and provide more opportunities for girls and young women in sports, she felt compelled to post her thoughts on social media about the efforts to “protect women’s sports” through legislation.

Myah Selland has always been passionate about involvement in women’s sports, especially the game she’s known for.

Now she finds herself at a Jackrabbit game in the stands for the first time since graduating, part of a crowd that supported her during every play.

Selland is still involved in sports and while she has her platform as a role model to many young girls in the state, she wants to leave her mark.

She opened up about what she believes will help women’s sports more than barring transgender athletes like recent legislation in Congress.

“Women’s sports right now is in an unbelievable spot. We have a lot of great momentum and so it’s disappointing to kind of see it used in a way to marginalize a different community,” Selland said.

Selland said that transgender athletes make up a fraction of the women’s sports landscape and that exclusion would do more harm than good.

“There’s a lot of really good science and policy and research about how we can make this really, really fair for our trans athletes and for our cisgender athletes and so that’s the kind of conversation that I think we should be having around it,” Selland said.

Selland pointed to other avenues where the public can lift up girls in sports. She said showing up, investing in media coverage and creating more opportunities for girls to get involved will make a difference.

She also hopes the government will rethink the effort to eliminate the Department of Education.

“That’s the enforcing body for Title IX. Our Title IX regulations protect our girls in sports, so if we eliminate the body that enforces those regulations, that is a threat to girls sports,” Selland said.

While she has received some disappointing comments or direct messages since her post, she has been overwhelmed by the respectful, thoughtful and productive conversation.

“It seems to be a hard topic, it’s very divisive, it’s very partisan and it doesn’t have to be. I think just the overwhelming responses to it kind of speaks that we’re a lot closer than our leaders want us to feel,” Selland expressed.

Selland also has concerns about how policing body types might be invasive and online harassment could increase. 

She hopes the momentum of the discourse surrounding women’s sports continues and she’s grateful for how the state of South Dakota supports their female athletes.

Canfield’s Jake DeLisio, center, splits a double team by Warrensville Heights’ Wayne Chappell, left, and Noah Chambers during the second quarter of Thursday’s regional semifinal match.

CANTON — The Canfield boys basketball team was within striking distance. But it didn’t have enough firepower to pull out a win Thursday night.

The Cardinals returned to the regional semifinals, and they drew a familiar face in Warrensville Heights, who the Cardinals bested in the same round last year. This time around, however, the Tigers came out with a 50-40 win at Canton Memorial Fieldhouse.

“I couldn’t ask them to play one ounce harder than they did. Absolutely gave every ounce of energy and focus that they had,” Canfield head coach Andy Vlajkovich said. “… I thought we executed some good things, it just came down to putting the ball in the basket. We had looks, good looks, from players and good shots, and the ball didn’t go in.”

A short 6-0 run gave the Cardinals the lead and held a 12-9 advantage at the end of the first quarter.

Warrensville Heights started the second with nine straight points, part of a 12-0 run from the end of the opening quarter. A 3-pointer by Zyaire Chaney extended the Tigers’ lead to 18-12, forcing Canfield to call a timeout with 4:52 left in the half.

The Cardinals battled their way back and cut the deficit to 23-22, but a dunk as time expired by Wayne Chappell pushed Warrensville Heights’ halftime lead to 25-22.

“We fouled (at the end of) the first quarter intentionally with 2.6 (seconds left), which is exactly what we wanted to do. And they heave a prayer three … you play for that,” Vlajkovich said. “Then in the second quarter, I personally, got a little tentative on the fouling. The last time we fouled, they banged a three. So we don’t foul, we step uphill and they lob dunk it. … Some of that’s a little bit of bad luck to be honest with you.”

The Tigers’ talent started to make a difference in the third. They increased their lead to 38-28 after a steal and fastbreak layup with just under three minutes left in the quarter.

Warrensville Heights led 39-32, and the Cardinals had eight minutes to keep their season alive. However, the offense never manifested for the Cardinals. They went 2-for-11 shooting, and one more thunderous dunk by Chappell closed the game.

Canfield’s Jake DeLisio led all scorers with 18 points. Ben Weaver and Nick Lavanty both had seven points.

The loss brought an end to Vlajkovich’s first season coaching the Cardinals. Despite the new coaching staff, the Cards put together another deep playoff run.

Seven seniors helped make the transition easier. The seniors were Drew Shapiro, Ray McCune, Nic Folsom, Angelo DeLucia, Weaver, DeLisio and Lavanty.

“This senior class, all seven of them, has set a precedent for what it means to play basketball at Canfield,” Vlajkovich said. “It’s been the hardest working, most committed seven kids you could possibly ask for. They go 11 months a year with each other. They’re totally committed to each other, to the program. Personally, myself and the staff are forever indebted to the class of ’25. They’ve set the standard for what it means to play at Canfield.”

The senior class compiled three straight seasons of 20 or more wins. They also had a nice resume of playoff performances, and they made some memories on the hardwood this winter.

“I feel like it was a tremendous season,” DeLisio said. “Came to practice every single day just hungrier and hungrier. Obviously our main goal was to get to state, obviously we fell short. But I’m so proud of our team, and proud of what we did this year.”

If one possession could define an entire basketball game, it happened late in the first half Thursday evening at Jamestown Community College.

No. 2 Pine Valley pulled within seven points of No. 3 Panama with just over a minute remaining in the first half of their Section VI Class D semifinal at the Physical Education Complex.

Panama missed a 3-point attempt and a defensive rebound would’ve given Pine Valley an opportunity to pull even closer in the final minute of the second quarter.

But Panama grabbed the offensive rebound.

Then, another Panama 3-point attempt missed.

But Panama senior Kaitlyn Horton came down with another offensive rebound and scored while getting fouled to make it 27-18 with 1:07 remaining.

Horton missed the free throw, but Panama came down with two more offensive rebounds during the possession before sophomore Jessica Lyon made a 3-pointer and was fouled. Lyon’s free throw made it 31-18 with 47 seconds left in the half.

The six-point possession gave Panama a 31-18 halftime lead and Pine Valley never got closer than that 13-point deficit the entire second half as Panama won 60-42.

“Basketball is not a flat game, it’s a roller-coaster. We’re going to have our ups, we’re going to have our downs, that’s just the way the game goes,” Panama head coach Nicole Peterson said. “The girls have really learned to adapt to that and understand that.”

“The keys to the game were rebounding and defense,” Pine Valley head coach Cody Troutman said. ” … In that little stretch, we didn’t do either one, and that’s why they built on their lead.”

Horton led Panama with 21 points, eight rebounds and four assists, while junior Kiera Loberg added 19 points, six rebounds and four assists.

“Kaitlyn Horton can play in the post, she can come out and hit the 3, we can put her on a guard defensively,” Peterson said. “Her versatility is key.”

Panama led 15-4 following the first quarter after eighth-grader McKenna Kolstee’s 3-pointer at the buzzer. Pine Valley turned the ball over seven times in the period.

“If we weren’t going to be strong with the ball, we were going to be in trouble. They were so aggressive,” Troutman said. ” … They put it on us. It wasn’t just one player of ours, we all struggled.”

Pine Valley cut its deficit to nine midway through the second quarter and then, after a Panama turnover, a bucket from Pine Valley senior Paige Hohl pulled her team within seven.

After a pair of Lyon free throws, Pine Valley sophomore Sandy Ivett scored to make it a seven-point game again before Panama’s six-point possession.

“Having Jess Lyon step up and play the role that we all know she is capable of playing,” Peterson said of Lyon, “it really changes the game.”

Pine Valley turned the ball over 12 times, leading to 11 Panama points during the first half.

“Brooke Warner is a huge, huge part of this team. She doesn’t score the most points on the team, but you don’t win a game just by putting the ball in the hoop,” Peterson said of her top defensive guard. ” … Brooke Warner plays fantastic defense; having her on our side is just tremendous.”

Loberg scored 11 points during the third quarter as Panama’s lead grew to 18 heading into the final eight minutes.

Senior Danielle West led Pine Valley with 19 points and 10 rebounds.

“Danielle West is what Pine Valley used to be. She will go down as one of the greats. … She needs to hold her head high,” Troutman said. “People might not know, she was playing on a really injured foot. She fought through all year long and for her to do what she did at the end proves how hard that girl works.”

Now Panama — the New York State Sportswriters Association’s 19th-ranked Class D team — will have to deal with No. 1 Sherman for the third time this season Saturday at noon in the Class D final back at JCC. The Wildcats are the NYSSWA’s fourth-ranked Class D team. They beat Panama 74-34 on Dec. 17 and 58-52 on Jan. 27.

“Sherman’s always a threat. They have a fantastic coach and a great program,” Peterson said. ” … We respect them and we are anticipating a really good game.”

NOTES: Lyon had 11 points and eight rebounds for Panama, which shot 23 of 62 from the field, including 2 of 18 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 11 times. … Hohl scored 9 points and senior Danica Farnham had seven rebounds for Pine Valley, which shot 17 of 51 from the field, including 4 of 18 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 20 times.

Warren G. Harding’s Davion Herron goes up for a layup during the Raiders’ regional semifinal loss to Massillon Perry on Thursday.


AKRON — Warren G. Harding’s season came to a shocking and climactic end Thursday evening when Massillon Perry’s Luke Wolf hit a miraculous, off-balance 3-pointer just before the final buzzer.

Wolf’s shot went in with a second to go in the Division II regional semifinal at Akron sunk the Raiders 52-51 and officially eliminated them from the postseason.

“This is the most painful [loss of my career],” Harding coach Keelyn Franklin said. “This is the most emotional, because I just saw the fire and I saw the fight and we didn’t complain. They just pushed through. We deserved to win that game, and Perry did also. It’s just one of those games where it sucks that somebody has to lose.”

Franklin had spent a few minutes talking with his team about their defensive gameplan, primarily in regards to Wolf, who had scored 28 points, moments before the eventual game-winner.

“When I saw [Wolf] taking the ball out, that’s why we called a timeout — to see what their alignment was going to be, so we could adjust,” Franklin said. “I knew with him taking the ball out that he would come back to the ball. So we wanted to switch everything and get out and try to deny him from catching it or push him out as far as we could.”

After inbounding the ball to Drake Jacobsen with 3.7 seconds remaining, Wolf, as Franklin predicted, immediately got the ball back. After catching it, Wolf immediately rose and fired a shot over the outstretched hand of Myles Miller. Despite the stellar plan and tight defense, Wolf’s shot swished through the net, giving Perry a one-point lead with one second left on the clock.

Franklin had used his final timeout to set up the Raiders’ defense, though, leaving him helpless to stop the clock before Perry’s win became official.

The buzzer sounded, and the Panthers rushed onto the floor to celebrate, while the Raiders were left stunned.

“They put themselves in position to go to a regional final,” Franklin said of his team, “and a prayer goes in. Sometimes that’s life; you give it your all, and it just doesn’t work out.”

The sting of Thursday’s loss may also, in part, be due to the feeling of one-sided officiating.

In the second half, the Panthers shot 14 free throws, including eight in the fourth quarter. Harding had three foul shots entering the fourth and took the majority of its free throws after Perry began intentionally fouling, which allowed the Raiders to finish with six free-throw attempts in the quarter and nine on the night.

“We had to play through a lot of contact that I thought wasn’t getting called [for us] that they called for them,” said Franklin, who fell to his hands and knees after a foul on Davion Herron in the fourth. “They lived at the free-throw line in that second half, and I think the game was called a lot closer in that second half.”

The free throws kept Perry, which had led by as many as 8 points in the second quarter, hanging around despite an offensive lull.

Wolf ended the Panthers’ field-goal drought — they had not made one in more than three minutes — with a 3-pointer very similar to his game-winner. With 33 seconds left, Wolf’s shot pulled Perry within one.

Jeremy Sampson, who had made both of his foul shots moments earlier to give the Raiders a 4-point lead, split his free throws with 24.5 seconds remaining.

A missed Wolf 3-pointer with under 10 seconds to go led to a mad scramble for the loose ball under the Panthers’ basket and an eventual jump ball, setting the stage for Wolf to break the Raiders’ hearts.

Thursday’s game was never separated by double digits, as the teams traded baskets for most of the first quarter, and despite Harding struggling offensively in the second quarter, the Panthers, who led by 6 at halftime, failed to pull away.

In the third quarter, Harding evened the game with a flurry of steals and fast-break points, including a few emphatic dunks.

“We were able to kind of lock in in that second half defensively and do some things to kind of get them out of rhythm,” Franklin said.

Senior star Chaz Coleman, who gave the Raiders energy with several dunks and 9 rebounds Thursday, led Harding with 18 points. Miller, who had 13 points, joined Coleman as the only Raiders to score in double figures.

With the loss, Harding ends the season with a 19-5 record.

“It’s one to remember,” Franklin said of the season. “First time we’ve been conference champs in maybe eight years; first regional regional trip in nine years; we had the conference player of the year; we had five kids make all-conference. This has been an amazing year. I told the guys, this has been the most fun that I’ve had coaching period, and I told them thank you.

“Obviously, you wish you could go a couple more games and we can get to Dayton, but sometimes that’s the way the cookie crumbles. You learn from it. You get stronger and tougher and you build resilience, and you move on with your life and you learn.”

Sherman’s defense shined in the first quarter Thursday evening at Jamestown Community College.

The Wildcats offense caught up in the second quarter.

Added together, Class D’s No. 1 seed in Section VI coasted to a 50-11 semifinal victory over No. 5 Clymer at the Physical Education Complex.

Freshman Emmersen Crawford led Sherman with 11 points, while seniors Kelsey Wagner and Teagan Gratto each added 10.

The Wildcats got off to a slow start offensively, shooting just 3 of 13 from the field, including 1 of 8 from 3-point range, in the opening eight minutes. But that didn’t matter much because they went up 12-1 on a Gratto 3-pointer with 1:29 left in the period.

“Teagan has just been playing with a different energy lately,” Sherman head coach Emily Eckwahl said. “It’s just that fire that comes out of seniors late in the season. Now is as good a time as any for it.”

At the other end, the Pirates turned the ball over 11 times and didn’t record a field goal until junior Lilly Johnson’s bucket with exactly a minute left.

“We always rely on our defense to get our offense going,” Eckwahl said. “The girls have been working really, really hard the last three weeks on fine tuning the things that we do to be able to do them better.”

Sherman’s offense did in fact get going in the second quarter. Crawford scored on back-to-back trips before freshman Beya Oehlbeck and sophomore Madison Emory both hit a pair of 3-pointers, and Wagner added another during what turned out to be a 19-0 run.

“The girls were moving the ball to the open shooter. They were playing really unselfishly,” Eckwahl said. “With our balanced attack, that’s what we need to do: find the one who is open, and they did.”

Ava Nyweide’s basket with 11 seconds remaining was Clymer’s only field goal of the second quarter and the Wildcats led 33-5 at halftime.

Sherman won the second half 17-6 with the outcome already decided.

The Wildcats will take on No. 3 Panama in Saturday’s title game at noon back at JCC. Sherman won two previous meetings this year, 74-34 on Dec. 17 in Panama and 58-52 on Jan. 27 in Sherman.

“They are certainly a familiar foe. I’m sure they’ll give us their best game,” Eckwahl said of the Panthers. “We just have to be ready to show up and play our best ball.”

NOTES: Crawford had six rebounds and six steals; Gratto had five rebounds and four steals; and Wagner had four steals and four assists for Sherman, which shot 16 of 46 from the field, including 8 of 27 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 18 times. … Johnson had 6 points for Clymer, which shot 4 of 25 from the field, including 0 of 8 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 35 times.

PARKERSURG — The Parkersburg High School wrestling trio of senior Jesse Showalter and sophomores Stephen Myers and Dominic Way had no issues Thursday night during the opening round of the 78th annual West Virginia state wrestling tournament being held inside Huntington’s Marshall Health Network Arena.

Showalter, who bumped up to 175 pounds, is hoping to reach his first state final, Myers is eyeing his second state crown while Way is just excited to have a chance to win the Class AAA title at 138 after missing regionals a year ago.

Although the PHS grapplers did their best to convince head coach Matt Littleton to dye his hair, that didn’t transpire.

“He’s got a real nice draw to make a finals run. He really put himself in a really good position going up to 175,” coach Littleton said of Showalter, who placed fourth at 120 as a freshman and took third at 150 as a junior.

“We beat the Murphy kid from University at state duals and came into the region the fourth seed and upset the one, and then obviously avenged our only loss at 175 in the finals with the kid from (Cabell) Midland, so I think he’s got himself in a good spot to really make a run at this thing.”

“You can’t take anything lightly,” said Showalter. “I just know I got to go out there and wrestle how I know how to and keep the pace up.”

When asked about the blonde hair issue the senior replied “just this week we all decided, all the qualifiers that are going to state, to bleach our hair, so all of our 11 guys who’ve made it got bleached hair.

“We tried to get him, too. We got a deal with him that he’s going to dye his beard after states. We got to get the job done first. I can tell you that. Senior season, it’s been fun. It’s been a ride. Four years goes by fast. It goes by quick, but senior year has been fun and the growth that we’ve had is amazing. I’m glad to be a part of this team.”

Showalter said he’s currently undecided about his future, but would consider wrestling at the next level if the right offer came along.

“It’s fun,” the Big Red added of being in the matroom. “You get to come in here and you get to compete. Different types of levels, different styles. It’s all fun.

“You got kids that can beat up on you. You got kids that you’re going to have a grind with. It’s all fun. We all come out smiling at the end. We all just enjoy it.”

That would depend on the day of the week because Myers, who went 40-1 en route to last year’s 126-pound crown, was sporting a gash above his brow inflicted by Way that had to be glued.

“Funny story,” quipped Myers, who is 42-6 and favored to win 132, of going blonde. “We were eating lunch and Dom was scrolling on Instagram and he came up across, I think it was Iowa State, and they all had bleach hair.

“Dom was like ‘I think that would be pretty cool’ so I said no. I was like I’m not doing it. I’m not doing it. Next thing you know here I am with bleach hair. I was the last person to do it though. They really had to convince me to do it.”

Myers doesn’t need to be convinced that hard work pays off even though this season started slower than he wanted.

“At the beginning of the season, all of December, it was very hard. I went to Ironman, Powerade and those are top tournaments in the country,” Myers said. “After those it was basically just like another match to me really. It’s West Virginia. There’s nothing compared to those out of state tournaments like that.

“It’s more of a motivational thing. That’s what keeps me pushing to try and achieve my next goal is what I like to tell myself. Just those losses, it means, like I have my Ironman medal in my locker right now and I always look at it everyday, so that pushes me to drive to the next level.”

Way, who also has six defeats on his record, knows he has to stay on top of his game.

“I went through a lot last year. This year is going to be a lot different. I got a target on my back,” admitted Way, who added of not competing in last year’s regional “it took a lot out of me. I went a few months, just it was really hard, but it drove me to wrestle harder and work harder in the room and just be a better wrestler all around. I feel like I had a lot of pressure on me last year and not being able to wrestle it really just opened my eyes to I just got to take advantage of what I can.

“I didn’t like it for a while. It took me a while to really get back in the groove and wrestling really well. I really think we got a good team. We got a good shot to win it. I think we’re fully capable of going out there and winning no matter what everyone else thinks. We’re down a guy. University is down a guy. I think we just got to show up and wrestle to the best of our ability and we’ll be able to win that title.”

Way pointed out “we’ve had a tough season this year. I’ve pinned and tech’d everyone I’ve won this year. I’ve lost six matches this year. I had a bad tournament and lost two. The other four losses all came to nationally-ranked wrestlers. That tournament really pushed me forward showing me where I was at with some of those guys and it drove me to work harder and get better at wrestling.

“Just getting better and really close to those guys so it’s coming up in this freestyle season going to the nationals and going to Super 32 and all these big tournaments, and just going out there and prove myself, get ready for college and get on the map.”

No matter what transpires during the final two days in Huntington, Showalter just wants to give it his best and try to go out in style.

“I’d say mostly the experience,” the senior responded when asked what he cherished most about being a Big Red. “You got all the alumni that come in and talk to you and hope you do just as good them or better. It’s just a great experience to know that you have a lot of people that cheer you on and want you to do great.”

Myers understands that quite well and he plans to just continue doing his thing.

“”It’s definitely gone by fast,” Myers said of his prep mat career nearing its midpoint. “I definitely have a lot of memories in the past two years. All the trips and just all the experiments and side quests that me and this team had. Our brotherhood, it’s just unmatched.

“We all love each other. We’re just brothers. It’s just a grind we always have together and we always stick with it and we always have each other’s backs. From there, that’s just how we win stuff and we always bring each other up.”

YSU’s Nico Galette reacts to a made second half three-pointer, he scored 22 points to help guide the Penguins past Purdue Fort Wayne 72-67 in the Horizon League tournament.

YOUNGSTOWN — For most of the first half on Thursday night, Youngstown State couldn’t buy a basket, especially from beyond the arc. 

As a result, the Penguins needed their defense to carry them in their Horizon League tournament quarterfinal matchup against Purdue Fort Wayne. 

YSU held a high-scoring Mastodons team to 37.1% shooting and survived a scare late in the second half to hold off Purdue Fort Wayne 72-67 at Zidian Family Arena.

“I thought the two things in the first half that kept us in the game was our offensive rebounding and our ability to guard them,” head coach Ethan Faulkner said. “I thought that was a critical component to keeping us in the game when offensively we weren’t playing very well in the first half. A lot of times, when it gets to this moment, and there’s so much on the line, you’re just pressing. 

“We made some good adjustments at halftime, and our guys really went out and executed much better in the second half.”

In his first season as head coach, Faulkner has helped the Penguins advance to the Horizon League tournament semifinals in Indianapolis for the third time in program history.

The win was YSU’s 20th of the season, which marks the first time in program history that the Penguins have posted three consecutive 20-win seasons. 

“It’s special for me, and it’s special for our group,” Faulkner said. “I told our guys, you’re fighting for one more game, you’re fighting for one more practice, fighting to be together for one more week. I thought we competed at a really high level, and this is the time of year where you’re going to take everybody’s best shot, and they’re going to take our best shot.”

It took YSU three minutes to make its first basket, and the Penguins had managed to score just three points over the first seven minutes.

Even though YSU started 0-for-17 from three, the Penguins’ defense kept the Mastodons close. YSU went on a 10-1 run during the latter stages of the first half to get itself back in it as the two teams went into halftime tied 26-26.

“We pride ourselves on how we play on the defensive side of the ball,” fifth-year Nico Galette said. “Us going into the half tied 26-26 in a low-scoring game, that means we were getting stops, so we weren’t upset with that.”

The Penguins felt slighted by how the Horizon League awards shook out on Monday, and carried a chip on their shoulder coming into Thursday’s game, especially Galette. 

Despite YSU’s slow start, he carried the Penguins’ offense into the second half, finishing with his eighth double-double of the season with 22 points and 10 rebounds.

Following Galette’s start, fellow fifth-year Ty Harper came alive in the second half, scoring 16 of his 20 points after halftime. At one point during a three or four minute stretch, Harper scored 11 straight points for the Penguins. 

“I was just staying aggressive,” Harper said. “I feel like in the (second) half, I really came out trying to just put pressure on the defense and not settle for threes a lot. That really opened up everything else for me. So then, sticking with the process, staying the course and just believing in my teammates because my teammates believed in me.”

After YSU had grown its lead to its largest of the game (15) with four minutes left, things started getting nervy for the Penguins, as PFW made one last effort to save its season. 

The Mastodons started pressing and trapping, and in the blink of an eye, YSU’s lead had shrunk all the way to six as Purdue Fort Wayne went on a 9-0 run. 

The Penguins didn’t make a single field goal over the final five minutes, so they had to rely on free throws and their defense to close things out. 

The Mastodons cut the lead all the way to one with about eight seconds left, but Cris Carroll made four straight free throws to seal the deal for the Penguins. 

“We threw the ball to them more than we threw it to ourselves the last three or four minutes. Then obviously they were fouling, so they weren’t really giving us a chance to make field goals late in the game,” Faulkner said. “We gotta handle that better. We didn’t handle the pressure at the end of the game well, and it’s on us to make sure that we get them ready to go for the next time.”

Now, YSU will face Cleveland State on Monday night at 9:30 p.m. in the Horizon League semifinals at Corteva Coliseum in Indianapolis. The Vikings defeated Northern Kentucky 68-63 on Thursday in their semifinal.

San Francisco State University announced Thursday that three athletic programs will be disbanded at the end of the school year, as the school's athletics program faces a major deficit.

In a letter to the campus community, school president Lynn Mahoney said baseball, men's soccer and women's indoor track and field would be eliminated. 

""I recognize this decision is particularly painful for the student-athletes it impacts, their families and their coaches – not to mention the countless alumni and supporters of these three teams,"" the university president said.

Mahoney said the decision was made after the school's Athletics Task Force recommended reducing the number of teams. 

According to a report by the task force, the athletics department is $1.2 million in debt in its scholarships account. Along with the shortfall, Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed a 7.95% reduction to the California State University budget, amounting to $375.2 million.

""Sadly, though, we must take this important step to give our athletics program an opportunity for long-term sustainability,"" Mahoney went on to say.

In the middle of their season, with four home games scheduled this weekend, the baseball team found out Thursday their program will cease to exist at the end of this school year. 

""Caught us all off guard. We kind of had an idea going in but we knew that there were some financial problems at the school but yeah it was tough, tough news for everybody,"" said Derek Laferriere, who plays catcher. 

            He says the team found out their sport was getting axed through the statement sent by the university's president. 

""Tugged on the heart strings a lot because we wanted to fight for this program. We wanted to kind of see if we could keep it going, fundraise, do something to help the team,"" said Laferriere. 

Head baseball coach Tony Schifano has been in the job for 10 years and helped improve the team from a mediocre squad to one that went to the NCAA Division II Regionals last year. 

""It was building the program from the ground level and here we are. Last year we were really close. We have a wonderful team this year, we received votes in the top 25 in the country this week,"" he said. 

Schifano said the end of this program is a huge blow but one he's telling his players is something they'll all get through together. 

""There's no doubt in my mind they'll get through this. I tell them every day I said there's bad things that are going to happen in your life and you're going to have to find a way to overcome it and here's one early in your life that's thrown at you,"" said Schifano. 

            The coach said he plans to work with every eligible player on his team to help them transfer to another program next year if they so choose. 

            For Derek that's not an option. This is his senior year. 

            His goal now, to get his team as far into the postseason as possible, hopefully all the way to the College World Series. 

""Knowing that this is the last year the Gators Baseball team is going to be around, so use it as fuel, try and make the best of the season and finish on top for the program,"" said Laferriere.

Mahoney said 44 student-athletes would be impacted. Students who decide to stay at San Francisco State would continue to have their scholarships honored, while students who wish to continue playing would receive assistance to transfer to another institution.

The cuts to athletics at San Francisco State comes after officials at Sonoma State University announced the elimination of its entire intercollegiate athletics program as part of several cost-cutting measures to address a nearly $24 million budget deficit.

Freshman Mikayla Blakes during Vanderbilt's home game against Butler, Nov. 17, 2024

Efficient shooting, playoff grit and aggressive rebounding earned Vanderbilt a quarterfinal berth in this year’s SEC Women’s Basketball Tournament. Khamil Pierre finished with a strong double-double, while star freshman Mikayla Blakes and senior Iyana Moore combined for more than half of the team's 84 points on Thursday.  

Vanderbilt swept Tennessee this year with two close wins, a refreshing reboot to the cross-state rivalry after years of dominance by the Lady Vols. The Commodores have risen as a nationally competitive program under coach Shea Ralph, now in her fourth season at Vanderbilt, and the team boasts two of the country’s best young stars in sophomore Pierre and freshman Blakes. Both are WNBA prospects with several more years of college eligibility. Vanderbilt now eyes a Friday quarterfinal against perennial powerhouse University of South Carolina and a second straight March Madness berth.

Dores defend SEC honor with multidimensional 72-68 win over Columbia

Senior Moore showed veteran poise against Tennessee, stepping up on an otherwise lukewarm shooting day from Blakes. Moore was last year's go-to scorer, a role that shifted to make room for Blakes this season, and carried the Commodores through tight second and third quarters. Pierre’s defensive intensity earned her double-digit rebounds and three early steals, but landed her in foul trouble, limiting her minutes. After a scoring blitz from Blakes and big hits from Moore, who shot a perfect 4-4 from the three-point arc, Vanderbilt led by 15 going into the final quarter. Despite a few late turnovers from Pierre and Blakes, Vanderbilt controlled the paint and sank its free throws, fending off a push from Tennessee to secure the 84-76 win.

Vanderbilt came into the game with a few distractions. Blakes earned a second team All-American nod from The Athletic and all-SEC honors earlier this week. Her quick college success — including two conference games with more than 50 points — vaulted her into the women’s basketball stratosphere. Her scoring has broken records, but Blakes has also demonstrated an elite ability to draw fouls and clock assists, two more subtle stamps on the game. Conference awards ignored Pierre altogether, who finished in the SEC’s top five in points, rebounds, steals and double-doubles. 

The snub prompted a statement from Ralph, who won nearly every type of formal recognition as a college point guard. She had the tough communications task of simultaneously defending her player’s honor and minimizing the importance of individual awards.

The Brentwood resident will lead the league’s most exciting team — and she’ll do it much closer to home

“She is having an all-SEC-type season and is putting up numbers that are among the best in the nation,” says Ralph in a statement posted on Instagram. “With that being said, we know she is one of the best players in the country. We don’t need awards and recognition from outside of our program to validate Khamil’s talent.”

Pierre is one of five finalists for the Cheryl Miller Award, which recognizes the nation’s top small forward. Blakes too is short-listed for the Ann Meyers Drysdale Award, a positional honor for the nation’s top shooting guard.

The Commodores’ real roster drama will come down to Vanderbilt’s ability to keep its young talent. Pierre and Blakes could have their pick of top programs, and transfer offers will likely come with generous pay packages. A 2021 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court paved the way for today’s ""name, image and likeness"" era, which enables college athletes to make money while in school, refiguring the landscape for top athletes.

Vanderbilt routes money to student-athletes via the Anchor Impact Fund, a nonprofit that reported more than $2 million in revenue in 2023. Vanderbilt isn’t subject to the same fiscal oversight as public universities, freeing up money to go where boosters choose — but successful football and men’s basketball seasons this year will likely pull resources in multiple directions.

For now, the Commodores have set the stage for an exciting March.

HUNTINGTON — Defending Class AAA state champion University had a strong opening night here Thursday at the 78th annual West Virginia State wrestling tournament inside Marshall Health Network Arena as the Hawks amassed 41.5 points to take the early lead ahead of Woodrow Wilson (36), Parkersburg (33.5), Fairmont Senior (32) and Parkersburg South (25.5).

The Big Reds of head coach Matt Littleton won nine of their 13 matches via fall and that included 106-pound sophomore Seth Drennen opening the state tournament with a 15-second mat slapper versus Jefferson’s Evan Sarna.

While the Big Reds had wins by pin thanks to Stephen Myers (132), Dominic Way (138), Kayden McDonald (144), Lars Cooper (150), Cyler Marks (165) and 175-pounder Jesse Showalter, PHS also watched 113-pounder Austin Carrodus avenge an earlier season loss to St. Albans’ Alonzo Long thanks to an 8-2 decision, and 126-pound freshman Colston Skeen registered a technical fall in his first match at state.

Parkersburg South managed seven wins and five of those were by pin, which included senior 175-pounder Cole Middleton, who could square off against Showalter in tonight’s semifinals.

Coach Shaun Smith’s Patriots also had victories by fall thanks to Aaydin King (132), Reese Kelley (138), Asa Yost (157) and heavyweight Cole Middleton. Brycen Arthur breezed into the quarterfinals via technical fall while 126-pound teammate Coleton Hill won by decision.

In the Class AA team race, Williamstown finished with 29 points and trails Point Pleasant’s 32.5, but the ‘Jackets are ahead of Oak Glen (28), Ripley (26) and fifth-place Independence (24).

Williamstown freshman Dutch Sandy improved to 31-1 following a first-period pin as the Yellowjackets went 8-3 and also received wins by fall from Aiden Meeks (113), Cole Smith (126), Wesley Freed (132) and 175-pounder Evan Turner. ‘Jacket heavyweight Thad Trent won by decision while teammates Nick Ellison (106) and Kipp Freed won via technical falls.

Ripley head coach Matt Smith’s Vikings sent eight to state and went unscathed with Terry Osborne (113), Ethan Kay (157), Cooper Durst (190) and heavyweight Carter Neal picking up wins by fall. The Vikings received a pair of major decisions from Mason Philyaw (144) and Garrett Brown (150) white 120-pounder TL Koontz and 126-pounder Kendrick Durst advanced by decision.

In the two-team race for supremacy in single-A, Cameron and Braxton County were knotted at 22 apiece while East Hardy was third with 11 points with Midland Trail and Greenbrier West checking in tied for fifth with eight points.

Braxton County opened up with a 6-2 effort as head man Sterling Beane watched Connor Tallamy (113), Sailor McKinney (126), Luke Kelly (132), Paxton Smith (150) and 175-pounder Eliah Moore record pins. Eagle 138-pounder Bradyn Morris advanced to the quarterfinals by decision.

In all, there were eight head-to-head matches on Thursday involving area wrestlers from the Mid-Ohio Valley.

At 120, Sandy’s pin came against Magnolia’s Dominic Harper and in the same class St. Marys freshman Kyle Bullman pinned Ravenswood’s Jerry Rhodes.

Kelly’s mat slapper for the Eagles came against St. Marys’ Ayden Powell. 

At 144, Clay County’s Blake Coleman pinned Williamstown’s Tyler Newlon while at 150 Ripley’s Garrett Brown picked up a 12-1 major decision victory versus Gideon Winfrey of Tyler Consolidated.

The other head-to-head matches saw Kipp Freed collect his 17-0 tech against Doddridge County’s Noah Wekseth, Ripley’s Cooper Durst sticking Magnolia’s Eden Harlan at 190 and Wahama 215-pounder Jake Roberts losing via fall to Roane County’s Lane Watson.

Ravenswood won two of its seven matches with the triumphs coming via a decision by 132-pounder Linkin Andrick as well as a tech fall victory by 165-pounder Trenton Bush.

Aside from Watson, Roane County also had pins from Wattson Nichols (126) and Mack Webb (157). Raider 175-pound Wyatt Nichols stayed in the championship brackets after a win via decision.

Tyler Consolidated senior Branson Winfrey, who won via fall, was the only Silver Knight to taste victory in four chances. South Harrison also advanced a quartet, but only Maddox Lewis at 120 by fall and Zane Harlow at 165 by tech fall emerged victorious.

Also winning their opening matches at state were Doddridge County’s Trey McDonough (113, md) and Tristan Swiger (138, pin), Wahama’s Seth Ohlinger (190, pin), Gilmer County’s Dallas Goodrich (106, pin) and Calhoun County’s one-man team of sophomore Reese Schoolcraft, who improved to 43-7 following a 19-second pin of Independence’s Carter Dickens.

Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule (center) celebrates after a pass reception was confirmed by review against UCLA on Nov. 2, 2024, during the first half of a gam in Lincoln, Neb. 

The Associated Press

LINCOLN, Neb. — Nebraska’s spring football game, which dates to the 1920s and has been played annually since 1950, will be replaced with skills competitions and 7-on-7 games at Memorial Stadium on April 26, the school announced Thursday.

Coach Matt Rhule had said five weeks ago he highly doubted a spring game would be played because of his concerns about other teams scouting players in the scrimmage and possibly poaching them through the transfer portal.

The skills competitions will be similar to the NFL’s Pro Bowl games. In addition to those and the 7-on-7 games, former players will participate in various competitions and there will be a women’s flag football exhibition.

Tickets are $10 for adults. For an additional $50, fans can take a one-hour tour of the Osborne Legacy Complex football building.

As part of the Husker Games, as the event is called, Nebraska also will host a women’s soccer exhibition against Wyoming and spring volleyball match against Kansas.

While spring football games remain popular and a big draw at some programs, schools in recent years have started to move away from traditional scrimmages because of smaller rosters and the risk of player injuries. Nebraska, Texas, Ohio State and Southern California are among programs ending the tradition this year.

From Mirror, wire reports

SARASOTA, Fla. — The Pittsburgh Pirates scored four runs over the final two innings Thursday night to beat the Baltimore Orioles, 9-5, in Grapefruit League action.

Endy Rodriguez went 3-for-3 with an RBI to raise his average to .417 for Pittsburgh (8-5) this spring. Tsung Che-Cheng singled in his only at bat and is 5-for-7 in the spring.Jason Delay led the Pirates with three RBIs. Liover Peguero homered for the Pirates in a game the Bucs out-hit the O’s, 11-8.

Starter Paul Skenes worked three innings, giving up four hits, two runs, both earned, with two walks and three strikeouts. He threw 63 pitches, 38 for strikes. Kyle Nicolas struck out two in one inning of work and got the win for his effort.

Spring notes: The Pirates reassigned pitchers Bubba Chandler and Hunter Barco to their minor league camp, meaning there are 62 players remaining in big-league camp. … Pittsburgh hosts Philadelphia today in a game that will be televised both on MLB Network and SportsNet Pittsburgh. Jared Jones is expected to start for the Pirates while Cristofer Sanchez will go for the Phillies.

Wounded Yankees

TAMPA, Fla. — Yankees pitcher Luis Gil will be sidelined for at least three months because of his lat strain and designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton would have surgery on his elbows only as a last resort, according to general manager Brian Cashman. 

Infielder DJ LeMahieu told reporters he has a grade 1 or 2 left calf strain and will be sidelined for several weeks in his fifth straight injury-hampered season. Gil, the reigning AL Rookie of the Year, cut short a bullpen session last Friday because of tightness in his pitching shoulder and the 26-year-old right-hander went to New York for a MRI that revealed a high-grade lat strain.

How about pitching?

GOODYEAR, Ariz. — Tyler Naquin agreed to a minor league contract with the Cleveland Guardians, who intend for him to switch positions from the outfield to the pitcher’s mound. 

The Guardians said Naquin had reported to spring training camp and will be working out as a right-handed pitcher. Naquin, who turns 34 on April 24, played in the major leagues from 2016-23 and was in the outfield for every one of his 511 regular-season games with Cleveland, Cincinnati, the New York Mets and the Chicago White Sox.

Sanderson

UNIVERSITY PARK — After a 15-0 regular season in which the No. 1 Penn State wrestling team was rarely challenged, the upcoming Big Ten Wrestling Championships may be much the same.

The Big Ten released the tournament pre-seeds, as voted on by the conference coaches, on Wednesday and the numbers paint a bleak picture for anyone not in a blue and white singlet on Saturday and Sunday in Welsh-Ryan Arena in Evanston, Illinois.

Penn State received five No. 1 pre-seeds: Beau Bartlett (141), Shayne Van Ness (149), Mitchell Mesenbrink (165), Levin Haines (174) and Carter Starocci (184). Three Nittany Lions are seeded second: Tyler Kasak (157), Josh Barr (197) and Greg Kerkvliet (285). Luke Lilledahl (125) and Braeden Davis (133) earned fourth seeds.

If those 10 Nittany Lions wrestle to their pre-seeds, or even three spots below them, all of them would earn NCAA tournament bids. Despite the prestige of a Big Ten championship, this tournament is just a means to an end for Penn State.

“The conference tournament really is about preparing for the national tournament,” coach Cael Sanderson said at the team’s media day earlier this week. “We just try to keep that mentality consistent, and it seems to help our guys peak at the right times.”

The Big Ten Conference earned a bounty of automatic qualifiers for the NCAA Championships, 87. The lowest amount is seven at 141 pounds. Every other weight was accorded at least eight and three weights have 10. Weight-by-weight, the allocations are as follows: 125 (9), 133 (10), 141 (7), 149 (8), 157 (8), 165 (9), 174 (8), 184 (8), 197 (10), 285 (10).

Three Nittany Lions — Bartlett, Starocci and Kerkvliet — are embarking on their last postseason journey. For Bartlett, at least, the anticipation is palpable.

“I’m really excited. This will be my last Big Ten Tournament. So, just a lot of energy. I’m gonna try to let it build through the week and not go like 100 miles an hour today,” he said. “It’s gonna be really, really hard not to do that.”

What won’t be hard to do is change the approach Penn State has operated with all season. It’s best summarized as follows — if the Nittany Lions wrestle the way they have all year, then the rest will take care of itself.

“We don’t really have a lot of say in who you’re going to face or not face. So, it’s just you prepare and go do what you do,” Sanderson said.

“I mean, we try not to adapt or adjust or worry too much about our opponents. And that’s our philosophy throughout the year. It’s the philosophy in the offseason. And so, you know, we don’t change a whole lot when it comes to the way we approach competition.”

Mesenbrink seems to take that approach to the extreme.

“I’m gonna be honest; I don’t even look at the bracket. Minutes before my bout I (ask) Coach Casey or Coach Cael or Coach Cody, ‘hey, could you tell me my bout number?’ he said.

“Because I don’t really even do it in my eyes. Whoever steps out there, look at their lead leg and then go. So, I think that’s the fun part about it. Yeah, there’s, ‘I wish I could wrestle this guy and this guy,’ but honestly, just whoever steps out there, that’s the battle at hand that I really enjoy.”

The tournament gets under way at 11 a.m. Saturday with Session I, which includes the first round, quarterfinals and consolations. Session II, which starts at 6 p.m., includes consolation matches and then, at 8 p.m., the semifinals.

The championships continue at 1 p.m. Sunday with consolation semifinals and seventh-place bouts. Finally, at 5:30 p.m., the championship, third- and fifth-place matches will be contested in Session IV. The Big Ten Network will televise all of Session I, the semifinals and all of Session IV.

Barring an utter collapse, Penn State shouldn’t be challenged in the team race. Instead, the Nittany Lions will be competing against history.

The team set a program record of 170.5 team points in winning the 2024 team title. Beyond that, Iowa has set the standard for domination in a single Big Ten tournament. The Hawkeyes accumulated 200 points in 1983, establishing the largest winning margin, 118.5, in tournament history. That year Iowa walked away with nine conference champions. 

Could Penn State challenge those marks? While most would consider it unlikely, there is a school of thought that nothing is out of reach for this pride of Nittany Lions.

Sanderson sounded pretty confident that his Nittany Lions would repeat the history they’ve built under the 16th-year coach.

“I think we’re good. I mean, we’ve got a great team, and they’re excited to wrestle. They love to compete. We’re happy, we’re healthy, we’re grateful, and so just go see what we can do,” he said.

“Our guys have always competed really well in the postseason, and I think they have a lot of confidence in that. And there won’t be an exception this year. Our guys are going to go wrestle great, and they’re going to wrestle well at the Big Tens, and they’re going to wrestle even better at the nationals. It’s going to be fun.”

Northern Bedford's Raegan Snider, top, holds down Norwin's Karsyn Champion after scorig a takedown in the opening period of their 155-pound first round bout Tursday in Hershey. Snuder won 6-2 to reach today's quarterfinals.

HERSHEY — Northern Bedford senior Raegan Snider felt healthier on Thursday than she did last Saturday at the Central Regional Tournament.

Snider earned a 6-2 win over Norwin’s Karsyn Champion at 155 pounds in the first round of the second girls PIAA Championships on the first day at the Giant Center.

Less than a week ago, Snider was sick in her stomach. She was able to reach the regional finals against Chestnut Ridge freshman star Juliet Alt, but she used all of her injury timeouts because she was throwing up and injury-defaulted.

“Last week, I was ready to go,” Snider said. “I even missed a field trip because I went to practice. Then I woke up Saturday morning, and I felt so sick to my stomach. I knew it wasn’t just nerves. I threw up about five times on Saturday.

“My parents didn’t want me to wrestle my finals match, but I wanted to try at least just to see. It’s my senior year. I feel much better this week.”

Snider started to feel better Monday or Tuesday after getting an IV to rehydrate her. On Thursday, Snider took Champion down in the first period, but she gave up a reversal in the second period.

The score remained 3-2 until she powered behind Champion with 49 seconds left in the bout. Snider rode the rest of the way for the win.

“It feels good to get the first round done,” Snider said. “I wasn’t as dominant as I wanted to be, but a win is a win. I wasn’t freaking out, but I felt like I was a little nervous because it was the first round. Not them I’m expected to win this year, but it’s my last year and I want to get a state title.

“I was never down, but I didn’t like how close it was. To get that last takedown, I felt a lot better.”

“I think there’s still a little bit of sickness,” Northern Bedford coach Zach Clark said. “I think we’re getting rid of it. I think we’re at the end of it. I think there is a little bit there that’s causing a little bit of weakness, little bit of tiredness, but we’re going to keep battling through it.”

Snider (28-5) will wrestle Avon Grove’s Kaitlynn Arnold in the quarterfinals. Arnold (7-4), a Southeast Regional fourth-placer, advanced with an 11-6 upset win over Gettysburg’s South-Central champ Adrianna Bowling (22-3). 

Snider, a returning state third-placer, has her eye on the finals, where she could get another shot at Alt (28-2), who pinned Hickory’s Trinity Webster in 2:24. Alt wrestle’s 26-1 Olivya Kroop of Emmaus in the quarterfinals.

“I hope it’s me and Juliet again,” she said. “I’d say it’s about a 95 percent chance. There would have to be a big upset for one of us to not make it.”

Wrestling resumes for the girls at 11:45 a.m. on Friday with the quarterfinals. The second round of consolations will follow. The semifinals are at 7 p.m. Thursday, and a third round of consolations will follow.

It was a rough preliminary round for the other two Northern Bedford wrestlers, Kaylee Ebersole and Ava Helsel.

Regional 100-pound champion Kaylee Ebersole lost by technical fall to Parkland’s Ella Hesener, 21-5, but she rebounded in the consolations to pin Shaler Area’s Blythe Letters in 2:47. 

Ebersole (23-7) will wrestle a quarterfinal loser today.

Helsel, the regional third-placer at 112, was pinned by Easton’s Morgan Hyland in 1:34 in the first round. She stayed alive by taking Canon-McMillan’s Malia Ramos down in overtime to win, 4-1.

Helsel will also wrestle at quarterfinal loser.

“I’m going to be honest. I think all of our girls were a little flat today,” Clark said. “I’m not sure it was nerves or having to sit around and wait all day. Hopefully we come back tomorrow being a little more energized.”

Chestnut Ridge returning state champion Violette Lasure, sister of Alt, opened with a 38-second pin at 148. Bedford’s Mylah Steinbuch (235) advanced to the quarterfinals with a pin of Canon-McMillan’s London Ellis in 48 seconds.

Philipsburg-Osceola’s Charli Hunt (136) earned a 10-2 major decision of Boiling Springs’ Amanda Delavan.

Ridge’s Kalea Day (136), and Bedford’s Noelle Murray (190) were eliminated.

PITTBURGH — Paul Skenes has been in the major leagues for less than a year.

A piece of the Pittsburgh Pirates ace — well, OK, a piece of the jersey that Skenes donned during his first start last May — could be ready to join some elite company.

A one-of-a-kind autographed baseball card featuring a patch of the No. 30 jersey Skenes donned during his big league debut is heading to auction on Thursday. The card’s journey over the last few months has generated the kind of buzz typically reserved for iconic collectibles featuring Hall of Famers Honus Wagner, Mickey Mantle and Ken Griffey Jr.

The Skenes card the added advantage those cards did not: It happened to come along in an age when social media can amplify everything.

“The coverage on this just in my opinion is so much bigger,” Fanatics Collect CEO Nick Bell said. “I really can’t remember one similar to it to be frank. It’s pretty exceptional.”

Fanatics Collect, which is running the two-week auction that closes on March 20, isn’t estimating (at least publicly anyway) what the card might fetch, though Bell expects “a very significant sale.”

A combination of the 22-year-old Skenes’ burgeoning stardom, the considerable reach of his girlfriend, LSU gymnast/influencer Livvy Dunne and a head-turning offer the Pirates made in hopes of securing the card — including season tickets behind home plate at PNC Park for 30 years — has made it the rare collectible that’s generated interest from collectors and noncollectors alike.

“The amount of interest we’ve got in this card right now is kind of pretty unprecedented, honestly,” Bell said.

The card was claimed by an 11-year-old in the Los Angeles area in a pack he received as part of a Christmas present. He declined the Pirates’ offer and instead turned over the card to Fanatics Collect, which has given it the “white glove” service for the last two months.

Skenes, who briefly reunited with the card at the Super Bowl, said he’s surprised at the attention it’s received.

“I never would have imagined how much hype there was around it, which is cool,” he said.

Then again, hype seems to follow the reigning National League Rookie of the Year around. Bell attributed it Skenes’ X factor.

“He’s obviously kind of broken through into the world of popular culture with his relationship with Livvy, etc.,” Bell said. “And I think the story behind this card itself is just incredible.”

Demand for anything Skenes-related has been high since his senior year at LSU in 2023. A 2023 card featuring Skenes fetched $63,000 last August.

There is no reserve on the card, meaning you probably can put in a $20 bid if you want. Just don’t expect it to stick.

“It just really has captured the imagination,” Bell said. “And I think it goes from being a truly innovative product. You have a great athlete with a huge career ahead of them and an incredible story to go along with it.”

Fanatics Collect plans to donate any of its proceeds from the eventual sale to the LA Fire Relief Fund.

She's been a decades-long champion for women in sports.  

And she made history right here at CBS News Colorado.

Marcia Neville -- the first woman to cover sports on Denver TV -- will be honored this year by Sportswomen of Colorado.  

""I don't think there's any better spokesperson for Sportswomen of Colorado than Marcia,"" said Coach Tanya Haave, who leads Roadrunners women's basketball at Metropolitan State University of Denver. ""She's been involved with the organization since its inception."" 

In fact, Marcia Neville has championed Sportswomen of Colorado since 1986, nearly 40 of its 51 years.

Herself a Sportswomen of Colorado Sportswoman of the Year, Tanya says the organization is unique in the country, celebrating female athletes, creating community.

""It inspires young women, which in itself is just, this is huge. You just can't put a put a value on that. I think it's just invaluable,"" said Tanya. ""We women, we have to stay together, stick together, and promote each other, and nobody does a better job of that than Marcia Neville.""

We know her for swooping in from the skies via helicopter to elevate the stories of high school athletes. Marcia is in the Colorado High School Activities Association Hall of Fame.

And for more than a decade, she hosted Colorado Sportswomen - right here, the show devoted exclusively to girls and women in sports.

""The comebacks, the trailblazers, the pioneers, the women who've done this for years, the young girls who are achieving above and beyond, setting new records,"" said Marcia. ""They're stories that continue to be important, and they need to be told."" 

Never an athlete herself, Marcia says her passion for sports started at home, her mom Barbara Neville loved the NFL.

""This woman, God rest her soul, could spot a hold faster than anyone I ever knew,"" said Marcia. 

She will receive the Dorothy Mauk Pioneer Award, named in honor of the Denver Post reporter who was the first ever female sportswriter for a major daily US newspaper.

""To receive an award named for someone who has such a huge impact. Really, really, is such an honor,"" said Marcia.

On courts across the state there are rich stories of grit and determination. Girls and women in sports have come far, and we have Marcia Neville to thank for having us all take notice.

""The ability to be strong, confident, competitive women, and be encouraged to do that,"" said Marcia. ""It's just grown incrementally over the years, and it's such a powerful thing to see when you've watched it kind of along the way.""

CBS Colorado sports anchor Romi Bean will emcee the Sportswomen of Colorado awards celebration this Sunday.

The NFL's franchise tag deadline has come and gone, which puts the focus on free agency, which officially opens at 4 p.m. ET on March 12. Deals can be made before that though as the so-called legal tampering period begins at noon ET on March 10. But plenty of action is already underway as teams are cutting veterans, re-signing stars and shopping for potential trades.

Here's everything you need to know as teams across the league continue to make moves this offseason.

Kansas City Chiefs OL Trey Smith

Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins

This marks the fewest players tagged in a year since 1994, per ESPN.

The Dallas Cowboys worked out a four-year, $80 million deal with defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who reportedly would have been place on the tag if a deal couldn't be reached.

Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, meanwhile, seemed like a straightforward candidate for the tag, so that he and the Vikings could buy more time in trying to work out a longer-term deal. But the $40.2 million number for QBs on the tag (see below) was reportedly too high for the Vikings, and would have limited their ability to build out the rest of the roster.

Shortly after the Jaguars traded receiver Christian Kirk to the Texans and letting wideouts Josh Reynolds and Devin Duvernay go, the team is reportedly releasing tight end Evan Engram.

And another: The #Jaguars informed two-time Pro Bowl TE Evan Engram they’re releasing him, per source. pic.twitter.com/2EtH6owJ9Q

— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) March 6, 2025

Releasing Engram will save Jacksonville $5.98 million in salary cap space, according to ESPN's Michael DiRocco.

Engram, 30, was limited to nine games last season due to hamstring and shoulder injuries. He caught 47 passes (on 64 targets) for 365 yards and one touchdown. The 2024-25 campaign was his third with the Jaguars after playing his first five NFL seasons with the Giants.

Additionally, the Jaguars released cornerback Ronald Darby on Thursday. Jacksonville now has $60 million in salary cap space, according to Spotrac.

The Commanders are bringing back leading tackler Bobby Wagner on a one-year contract, according to several reports. The deal could be worth up to $9.5 million with $8 million guaranteed, reports NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Wagner, 34, led Washington with 132 tackles last season, a performance that earned him second-team All-Pro honors and his 10th Pro Bowl selection. The Commanders had the fourth-ranked defense in the NFC, allowing an average of 327.9 yards per game.

The 2024-25 season was Wagner's first with the Commanders after 11 with the Seahawks (who drafted him in the second round in 2012) and one with the Rams. He's averaged 155 tackles during his 13-year NFL career with 2.9 sacks and eight tackles for loss.

A day after reports that the Jaguars planned to release Christian Kirk, they end up striking a deal to trade him to Houston for a reported 2026 7th-round draft pick.

DeVito, 26, has played 12 games in two seasons with the New York Giants. He has 1,358 passing yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions in his NFL career.

I'm told Tommy DeVito will sign his exclusive rights free agent (ERFA) tender at some point this weekend, per sources. So the Giants will officially have one quarterback on their roster as Joe Schoen has suggested when the NFL negotiating period of free agency begins Monday.

Hendrickson led the NFL with 17.5 sacks in 2024 and he's entering the final year of his contract.

He's a potentially huge trade chip for Cincinnati.

The Bengals have taken the rare step of granting All-Pro DE Trey Hendrickson permission to seek a trade. “It’s been an honor and privilege to represent Cincinnati over the last four years,” said Hendrickson, the NFL’s sack leader. “I love this city and organization. I appreciate… pic.twitter.com/7P7Hbe2Y9e

Hargrave, 32, has played nine NFL seasons with the Steelers, Eagles and 49ers. He has 380 career tackles and 45.5 sacks.

He played only three games during the 2024 season after suffering a partially torn right triceps, which required season-ending surgery.

49ers have informed defensive tackle Javon Hargrave that he will be released on the first day of the league year next week, per source. Hargrave will be a free agent. pic.twitter.com/7d3LFBTrhq

The Cleveland Browns were nearly $22 million over the salary cap before this move.

Watson has two years left on his five-year, $230 million contract signed in 2022. He is owed $46 million in 2025 and 2026.

The Browns have restructured the contract of QB Deshaun Watson, creating nearly $36M in 2025 cap space.

The Seahawks appear to be setting a high bar for what they want in return for DK Metcalf.

The 27-year-old receiver requested a trade from the team on Wednesday and according to The Athletic, the Seahawks want a first and third-round pick in return.

Will a team actually meet that asking price? You can at least understand why the Seahawks are asking for a first-round pick. In 2022, the Chiefs traded Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins for the No. 29 pick in the draft along with a second-round pick, a fourth-round pick and two 2023 picks. The Dolphins then made Hill the highest-paid receiver in the NFL at the time with a contract extension.

A week before Hill was traded, the Raiders traded a first-round pick and a second-round pick to the Packers for Davante Adams.

Like Hill, Metcalf will get a contract extension from a team that trades for him. He's in the last year of his current deal with a cap number over $30 million. That number would very likely go down for the 2025 season with an extension.

Joey Bosa's time with the Los Angeles Chargers is officially over. The team opted to release the star pass rusher on Wednesday night. He had been with them since the team selected him with the No. 3 overall pick in 2016, when they were still located in San Diego.

Bosa had 22 total tackles and five sacks last season. The move will free up more than $25 million in cap space.

Per source, Dolphins LB Bradley Chubb has agreed to a restructured contract. After signing a 5-year $110M extension in 2022, he was owed a $19.45M base salary this year and represented a $28.6 million cap hit in 2025. Now, Miami gets some breathing room before free agency opens

The Cleveland Browns got some welcome good news on Wednesday.

Joel Bitonio is coming back. The five-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowl guard is returning to Cleveland for his 12th NFL season. The Browns announced Bitonio's decision.

Bitonio was unclear at the conclusion of last season if he would return in 2025.

""I really want to decompress and feel it out and give myself a chance to rest the mind and the body and see where we're at,"" Bitonio said on Jan. 5, per the Browns. ""The burden of playing in this league is tough. As an offensive lineman, you have to be fully committed. You're playing 55 to 85 snaps every game. I think I got close to almost 1,200 snaps this year on offense. And that's a big commitment.""

Bitonio, 33, has played his entire career in Cleveland and has made the Pro Bowl after each of the past seven seasons. He'll play next season on the last year of a three-year, $48 million contract.

Could the trade of Joe Thuney lead to the Chiefs adding a marquee left tackle?

According to the Athletic, Kansas City is preparing to make a run at signing Baltimore Ravens left tackle Ronnie Stanley when free agency opens. The Chiefs cleared $16 million in cap space earlier Wednesday when they agreed to trade Thuney to the Chicago Bears for a fourth-round pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.

New story. Joe Thuney did everything the Chiefs asked of him — & more.What’s next for the Chiefs?They plan to sign Trey Smith to an extension & acquire a new left tackle, targeting Ronnie Stanley.https://t.co/1cKzfqMDbu

— Nate Taylor (@ByNateTaylor) March 5, 2025

An All-Pro guard, Thuney played left tackle for the Chiefs in the final weeks of the regular season and throughout the playoffs as the Chiefs struggled to find suitable play on the outside. The team signed former Arizona Cardinals LT D.J. Humphries late in the season, but Humphries strained a hamstring during his first game with the team and didn't start during the postseason.

Stanley, who turns 31 on March 18 and is one of the top free agents set to hit the open market, played in all 19 of the Ravens' regular season and playoff games this year and made his second Pro Bowl. It was the first time Stanley had played a full regular season in his entire career after playing seven regular-season games combined in 2020 and 2021 after he was a first-team All-Pro selection in 2019.

Baun had a breakout season in his first year with the Philadelphia Eagles. The 28-year-old Wisconsin product recorded 150 total tackles, 11 for loss and 3.5 sacks during the 2024 season.

Christian Kirk spent the past three seasons in Jacksonville. He played eight games in 2024, making 27 catches for 379 yards and one touchdown.

He was set to make $15.5 million in 2025 with no guaranteed money left on his deal. The Jaguars will end up saving $10.37 million with Kirk's release and will eat $13.65 million in dead money, per Over The Cap.

The Las Vegas Raiders announced on Wednesday that they have signed Pro Bowl defensive end Maxx Crosby to a multi-year extension.

Per ESPN, the extension is for three years and $106.5 million with $91.5 in guaranteed money, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history in terms of annual salary ($35.5 million). Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson was previously the highest-paid non-quarterback with a four-year, $140 million contract that pays him $35 million per year.

Longtime kicker Mason Crosby has announced his retirement, the Green Bay Packers announced.

Crosby spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons in Green Bay after being a 2007 sixth-round pick out of Colorado. He played the most total games and most consecutive games in franchise history (258) and was part of their Super Bowl XLV winning team. He is also the Packers' leader in career points (1,918), field goals (395), 50-yard field goals (43) and extra points (733).

Only two players in NFL history have played 250-plus regular-season games and scored 1,900-plus points with a single team: Crosby and Detroit Lions kicker Jason Hanson.

Crosby last played in 2023 when he appeared in three games with the New York Giants.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Coby White scored a career-high 44 points for the Chicago Bulls in a 125-123 win over the Orlando Magic on Thursday night. The Magic have lost five straight games and seven of their past 10, dropping their record to 29-35.

Orlando had a chance to tie or win the game with 12 seconds remaining in regulation. But Paolo Banchero missed a 3-pointer and Wendell Carter Jr. grabbed the offensive rebound. However, his dunk that would have tied the score came after the buzzer.

With that skid, Orlando is now the No. 9 seed in the Eastern Conference standings. The Magic will still likely be among the bottom four seeds to participate in the NBA play-in tournament. But finishing as the No. 9 or 10 team means playing an extra game to win the eighth seed. Being the No. 7 or 8 team means one win would automatically make them the seventh seed in the playoffs.

The next few games don't look much easier for Orlando with a five-game road trip that includes matchups against the Milwaukee Bucks (36-25), Houston Rockets (37-25), Minnesota Timberwolves (35-29) and NBA-best Cleveland Cavaliers (52-10).

Banchero and Cole Anthony each scored 20 for the Magic, followed by 19 from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Franz Wagner's 18 points.

""It's a funk and we've gotta fight our way out of it,"" Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said afterward. ""And so our ability to go on the road, regroup, reset our mind and how, what we need to do and band together on the road and continue to fight.""

White's scoring outburst came with a variety of dunks, drives to the basket and deep 3-pointers. He shot 16-of-28 from the floor, making 7-of-15 from long range. He hit what turned out to be the game-winning shot with 1:28 left in the fourth quarter. Neither team scored for the rest of the game.

""Besides the scoring part of it, the leadership, the voice was great,"" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said of White's performance, via the Chicago Sun-Times.

""Even when we would get a little frustrated, because it was a very physical game, [White] just kept messaging the guys, ‘Just focus on what we can control,'"" he added. ""Even just coming down the stretch, I thought he was a great calming force for our guys and just stayed in it.""

Josh Giddey nearly added a triple-double for Chicago, compiling 19 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists, while Tre Jones scored 20.

The win was only the third in the Bulls' past 12 games, but the win over Orlando could provide a preview of what could be a play-in matchup between the two teams as the Bulls sit 10th in the East.

Chicago's upcoming schedule looks more favorable with games against the Miami Heat (29-32), Brooklyn Nets (21-40), Utah Jazz (15-47) and Phoenix Suns (29-33). But an upcoming six-game road trip includes matchups with the Los Angeles Lakers (39-21), Denver Nuggets (40-22) and Sacramento Kings (32-29).","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Arlene Karika-Thompson was walking away from the baseball diamond when the sound of a metal bat rang throughout the complex. 

Thinking one of the baseball teams just recorded a hit, Karika-Thompson retrieved a lawn chair from her car and hurried back. When she settled into her chair, she noticed her 10-year-old son on the bench. Moments later, he returned to the game and was hit by a runner. Visibly shaken, her son was removed. 

Not thinking anything was out of the ordinary, she drove her son home and promptly put him to bed since it was a late-night game. The next morning, things took a turn for the worse. 

“He was rubbing his eyes and then said, ‘I can’t see,'” Karika-Thompson said. 

She rushed him to the hospital, where she learned he had a skull fracture.

She soon pieced together that her son had been hit in the head with a metal bat while warming up to go into the game as a pitcher. The force of the strike had not only knocked her son unconscious, but also resulted in a traumatic brain injury, affecting his brain function.

“My son lost everything — memory, vision, taste, smell,” Karika-Thompson said. “I had three doctors tell me I was lucky that he survived the night. It was a long journey.”

With the injury taking place in 1995, there was a lack of research and resources for treating traumatic brain injuries, commonly referred to as TBIs. Additionally, there weren’t many concussion protocols for kids playing youth sports. 

Her son eventually succumbed to his traumatic brain injury in 2019, nearly 25 years after the accident. 

Karika-Thompson, who left her career as a teacher to become a re-entry specialist at the Brain Injury Association of Colorado, wonders whether her son’s outcome would have been different if the injury took place today.

“Nobody told me what had happened, and there was no protocol,” Karika-Thompson said.

A lot has changed since Karika-Thompson’s son died.

Over the past two decades, the medical community has grasped a better understanding of brain injuries, leading to expansive research on the topic. The advancement in knowledge has led the sports industry — including major sports organizations, like the NFL and NHL — to look at head injuries through a new lens. 

The NFL started to place an emphasis on brain injuries when Mike Webster became the first player to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, also called CTE, a neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated head injuries. A Boston University study examined the brains of 376 deceased former NFL players. Out of the nearly 400 former athletes, 345 had CTE (92%). 

The staggering statistic led the NFL to alter kickoffs in an attempt to reduce the amount of full-speed tackles. It also now issues penalties if a player lowers their helmet while tackling, a change made in 2022 to help reduce concussions. 

The NHL has made similar changes, such as implementing “Rule 48,” which prohibits direct hits to the lateral side of the head. Like the NFL, the NHL has also bolstered its concussion protocol standards by requiring mandatory evaluations when players hit their heads and the removal of players if an athlete shows symptoms of a concussion. 

Changes are trickling down to youth sports and other recreational sports to help reduce TBI incident rates. 

Vail-Summit Physical Therapy certified brain injury specialist Melissa Volkert said experts in the field of TBIs periodically release a statement on the best practices regarding concussion protocols once they reach a consensus.

“We have modeled our return-to-sport and our return-to-play guidelines on this most recent research in 2022,” Volkert said. 

One of the biggest deviations from the previous concussion protocols are the guidelines on activity. Although most of the general public believes the best way to heal from a concussion is to sleep, limit screen time and have no physical activity, current research encourages light activity within 24-48 hours of the injury.

The evening will kick off with a reception with appetizers. Then athlete and coach Stephanie Zavilla will take the stage to share her personal experience of a traumatic brain injury. The evening will wrap up with a panel discussion on the topic followed by an audience Q&A.

“We are actually encouraging early return to physical activity,” Volkert said. “… Around 24-48 hours after your injury, you can do 15-20 minutes of light aerobic exercise, which this article says is about 55% of your max heart rate.”

These changes in concussion protocols have had an overall positive effect on the mental health of brain injury patients. CommonSpirit pediatric Dr. Dana Barnett said the old guidelines often did damage to the psyche of patients, especially in younger patients. 

“With the guidelines changing, it has been nicer because I think it allows somebody to feel like they are making more progress than being more isolated than they previously used to be,” Barnett said. “They can start progressing back to learning and activities of daily living and even physical activity.”

The exercise shouldn’t be taxing to the patient. Light activity allows blood to circulate through the body and jumpstart the healing process. Volkert points out that there is a fine line between light physical activity and pushing it too much.

“We do not want people to go too hard,” Volkert said. “We are not asking people to sprint right away or jog. This is like light walking.”

The process of going through the return-to-activity protocols looks different for everyone, but there is a heavy emphasis on backing off when symptoms arise both mentally and physically. 

For example, if a student is trying to complete a school assignment on the computer, but they can only go 15 minutes before getting a headache, Barnett would recommend the patient complete the assignment in chunks.

Once a brain injury patient is able to withstand regular activities and light aerobic exercise, they can begin moderate sport-specific exercises. This might look like doing walk-through drills for a football player or skating lightly for a hockey player. 

If symptoms are not triggered by the increase in stress and activity, athletes can then move to heavy, noncontact activity, such as sprinting or regular weight-lifting routines. Once athletes make their way through that checkpoint, they will be cleared by a doctor for full-contact practice. If all continues to go well, health care workers will then clear the athlete for competition. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each step in the return-to-sport guidelines typically takes a minimum of 24 hours to complete, meaning that most concussed individuals will be sidelined for at least a week. The vast majority of athletes with head injuries are sitting on the sidelines longer than in previous years. According to an analysis published by the British Journal of Sports Medicine, high school and college football players in the late ’90s and early 2000s were returning to play just three days, on average, after getting a concussion. 

Health care workers are especially worried about adolescent patients getting multiple concussions. With the brains of school-age children still actively developing well into early adulthood, a history of concussion poses the risk of long-term cognitive damage.

It is because of the development of children’s brains that more stringent return-to-activity guidelines have been introduced over the past decade.

“That’s why you end up with these crazy, strict protocols because they are kids and are not really looking out for themselves,” Middle Park Health trauma medical director and ER Dr. Michelle Lupica said. “And that’s normal.”

With so many student athletes often being driven and wanting to return to a full workload as soon as possible, Barnett tries to highlight the importance of taking it slow to her patients.

“The biggest one is probably second impact syndrome, where the brain is literally just not healed and then you go and injure it again,” Barnett said. “This can lead to severe or fatal neurologic outcomes. That is going to be the biggest one.”

Growing up in the early 2000s, it was common for Salomon-sponsored skier Drew Petersen to see some of his favorite snowsports athletes without a helmet as they flew off a cliff or performed a rail slide in the streets.

Whether out for a day on the slopes or in a video uploaded to YouTube, it is common to see athletes of all ages not sporting a helmet while attempting a jaw-dropping trick. While the stigma around wearing a helmet has changed in the past 10 years or so, Petersen attests there is still plenty of work to be done.

“It really doesn’t look that cool to not wear a helmet,” Petersen said. “Helmets look cool now. … I pretty adamantly believe and profess — and I think it’s the ground swell opinion — that wearing a helmet is cool.”

According to a 2012 study of national bicycle helmet use, 42% of children ages 5-17 always wore a helmet. Helmet use saw a decrease among lower-income households, non-White populations, Hispanic populations and children 10-14 years of age. Adult helmet use was also associated with an increase in child helmet use. 

A 2022 study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics reports that the most often cited reasons for not wearing a helmet include cost, discomfort and lack of belief that it is necessary to prevent an injury.

In terms of the effectiveness of helmets, five studies from different countries concluded that wearing a helmet decreased the risk of head, brain and severe injury by 63% to 85% for all ages of bicyclists. 

Petersen credits the helmet he was wearing for saving his life in both of his skiing accidents. Although the helmet failed to prevent a traumatic brain injury, Petersen does not think he would be alive today if he did not have a helmet strapped to his head.  

It is because of his accidents, and others he has witnessed in the snowsports industry, that Petersen is an outspoken advocate for helmet use. 

“I think when I was younger, I didn’t realize the influence or significance that I could have on what kids think is cool,” Petersen said. “Now I do, and I am going to use that for good and for trying to help others stay safe.”

Stephanie Zavilla, the director of sports performance at the Winter Park Competition Center, has seen a steady trend of adolescent athletes growing more serious about brain safety and wearing a helmet. 

“I think for the most part kids understand,” Zavilla said. “Of course there is going to be disappointment if they are going to have to be pulled from a competition or they do not get to train. By and large, when we explain the ‘why,’ athletes are pretty on board.” 

U.S. Ski and Snowboard and the USA Snowboard and Freeski Association have seen an advancement in helmet rules over the past decade. 

“They have taken it really seriously and made sure that helmets have to have certain specs,” Zavilla said. “I have been to a lot of competitions where they make sure the helmet is the one they recommended with the FIS label. We also did a whole education seminar with our coaches this year that highlighted the benefit of MIPS technology.”

Multidirectional Impact Protection System, or MIPS for short, is a design used by many companies to enhance the safety of helmets by reducing the risk of rotational impacts. While many of the helmets on the market today utilize the protection system, there are still helmets that continue to lack the technology.

With young athletes taking influence from a wide range of people, Petersen implores every community member to do their part in setting the standard of wearing a helmet.

“Culturally, we have to all realize that we are role models to those kids,” Petersen said. “It doesn’t have to be a professional skier. Like the guy who is ripping under the chair at A-Basin every day, kids look up to him as well as the cool people in the lift line. Those people should be wearing helmets, as well.”

Although there were very few concussion protocols in place when her son was playing baseball, Karika-Thompson is encouraged to see how far the science and research has advanced.

She credits these improvements to medical professionals and to the general public for gaining a more robust understanding of TBIs. 

With a better understanding of how each brain injury can have different effects, health care providers now have the expertise and knowledge to provide a proper treatment plan that is based on the individual’s history. 

According to professor and author David K. Menon at the University of Cambridge, large international collaborations have led to an improvement of understanding and care of traumatic brain injuries over the past decade. Menon recognizes that significant problems around brain injuries still remain and calls for more collaboration in order to improve patient outcomes.

Karika-Thompson also feels like health care workers now have a firm grasp of the domino effect traumatic brain injuries can have on an individual. 

“If you have an initial injury, you are three times greater to have a second injury,” Karika-Thompson said. “If you have a second injury, you are eight times greater to have a third injury. I can tell you from experience, those injuries can be as simple as bumping your head on a cupboard or getting whiplash.”

Above all, Karika-Thompson is grateful to see the drastic improvement in concussion protocols. Not only are the newest guidelines keeping people safe, but they are keeping kids like her son from being put back into a game after a significant head injury.

“It was terribly, terribly mishandled,” Karika-Thompson said. “But today, it is much better. He is why I do what I do. I want to serve people who have brain injuries and let them know they are not alone.”

Wheeling University’s Rachel Wilson (0) pulls down one of her 11 rebounds as she posted a double-double along with 20 points during Thursday afternoon’s Mountain East Conference Tournament quarterfinal game inside WesBanco Arena in downtown Wheeling. The Cardinals’ lost 58-49 to Glenville State.


WHEELING – The right side of the Mountain East Conference women’s tournament bracket was completely busted Thursday afternoon when No. 3 Wheeling University (17-12) was knocked off by sixth-seeded Glenville State, 58-49, before a sparse crowd inside WesBanco Arena.

That upset was preceded by No. 7 W.Va. State’s shocking second-seeded W.Va. Wesleyan, 61-58, in the opener of the doubleheader. The Pioneers (18-11) will now face the Yellow Jackets (18-12) at 2:30 Friday afternoon with a berth in Sunday’s championship finals.

“For us to have such a strong year, we end up being home for the tournament, it shows that we are moving in the right direction, just the number of freshmen we have costs us,” Wheeling University Head Coach Anna Kowalska said. “It was their first time playing here and to do well here you have to have been here before to know what it takes. Overall, I’m extremely proud of this team and how we competed this year, and we are excited to move forward and take steps in the right direction.” 

The youthful Cardinals shot 2-for-11 in the first quarter and fell behind 18-8. They basically played on even terms after that dreadful start as they outscored the Pioneers 41-40 over the final three quarters, but never led.

“We didn’t shoot very well to start,” Kowalska admitted. “I was worried about that a little because of our youth. They hadn’t played in an environment like this.”

They cut the first-quarter deficit by one at the half, 34-25, and drew even at 36 on an inside move by Rachel Wilson midway through the third quarter. However, a 9-3 run by the Pioneers to close out the quarter gave them a six-point cushion, 45-39, with a quarter remaining.

Wilson scored on a euro step through to make it 45-43 early in the fourth, but the Cardinals would get no closer as the Pioneers had an answer for every run.

“That’s what good teams do,” Kowalska said.

Wilson, a 6-2 redshirt junior from Georgia who was named all-MEC second team earlier in the week, led all scorers with 20 points and topped all rebounders with 11. Kenzie Dalton, a junior guard from Fort Frye who was selected the Defensive Player of the Year in the MEC, added 10 points, six rebounds and four steals.

Despite the loss, Kowalska was proud of the defense that her team played. Glenville State entered the contest ranked No. 1 in the conference and fourth nationally with a scoring average of 83.1 points a game. Wheeling was tops defensively, giving up just 61.8.

“I thought we played outstanding defense,” Kowalska said. “I’m not really sure what they were averaging but I know it was up there.”

The Cardinals were guilty of 23 turnovers, five more than the Pioneers, who held a 37-32 edge off the glass.

Jade Salters had a team-high 18 points for Glenville State. Nwando Okigbo added 15 while first-team all-MEC Tynasia Bunting had 10 points and eight rebounds.

DOUBLE DRIBBLES

– There are 11 players, one head coach and an assistant coach from Ohio Valley schools on MEC rosters, with four each playing for Wheeling or West Liberty. In addition to Dalton, other Cardinals were Rylee Knight (River), Ashley Shroades (Southern Local) and Jalynn Shapely (Frontier). The Hilltoppers were Sophie Abraham (Wheeling Park), Hope Bowman (Brooke), Regan Vinskovich (Union Local) and Jenna Riccardo (Beaver Local). The others include West Virginia State’s Shanley Woods (Wheeling Park), Fairmont State’s Natalie Daugherty (Wheeling Park) and West Virginia Wesleyan’s Kenzie Clutter (Cameron). The head coach is Frostburg State’s Jenna Eckleberry (Oak Glen) and the assistant is Fairmont State’s Josie Daugherty (Wheeling Park).

MINNEAPOLIS — Brainerd’s David Herath reached the finals in the Class 2A Diving State Prelims by placing 14th in the semifinals Thursday, March 6, at the University of Minnesota.

Herath stood in 13th place with 173.1 points after his first five dives in the preliminary round. He dropped to 14th after three dives in the semifinals with a score of 245.95.

Rosemount’s Lucas Gerten is atop the leaderboard with a 349.25.

“It’s tough scoring down here and I think David knew that going in,” Brainerd diving coach Dave Herath said. “His good dives, they really scored him well. He was solidly in the top 15 from the second dive on. I was very happy with that. It’s his first time at state with 32 divers and they cut 12 after the first five rounds. On his last dive, he overrotated a little bit and didn’t get the score he was looking for, but he’s a good spot for finals.”

David Herath will get three dives for finals Saturday, March 8. There were nerves headed into the preliminary round considering he was nursing a foot injury earlier in the week.

“He didn’t dive much until yesterday because Sunday morning the bottom of his foot was really hurting him, so we rested him a few days,” Dave Herath said. “I think that actually helped him. He was very calm. There was relief after he qualified to state.

“I’m pumped that his first time down here he gets to be diving in the finals. That’s quite an accomplishment. We have some very good divers in our state. It’s fun to see him holding his own against guys who are divers all year around. He has three very solid dives for finals and I could see him moving up.”

ASHEVILLE, N.C. (WLOS)  — Union nurses at Mission Hospital will hold a rally Thursday, March 6, after a recent death in the hospital's emergency room.



The National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United (NNOC/NNU) said the rally would highlight ""patient safety concerns and expose the life-threatening conditions patients face due to extreme short-staffing.""

This comes after Mission Hospital confirmed on Feb. 25 that a patient was found dead in a hospital bathroom. A spokesperson said one employee was terminated, and an investigation was launched.

""SUDDEN DEATH"" OF PATIENT AT MISSION HOSPITAL LEADS TO INVESTIGATION, EMPLOYEE FIRED

""We realize there are many questions that need to be answered, and we are examining every aspect of this incident,"" a previous statement from the hospital said, in part.

The incident prompted a press briefing from Reclaim HealthCare WNC, a regional healthcare coalition, during which several Mission nurses spoke about the recent patient death and what they call unsafe staffing.

""A patient who should have survived lost their life not because we weren't skilled enough, not because we didn't try, [but] because, in my opinion, we didn't have the staff to care for them,"" said Mission Hospital Emergency Department nurse Ashley Bunting. ""That's the reality of unsafe staffing. It could kill.""

As the Class of 2028 and the rest of BU settle into the heart of the second semester, I want to highlight the vital physical and mental health services available through Student Health Services (SHS). As a Student Health Ambassador and a senior in Sargent, take it from me—don’t wait until your fourth year to take advantage of SHS. Speaking from experience, I often invalidated how I was feeling, thinking my health was never “bad enough” to justify reaching out.

During my first year, I had no idea that appointments at SHS were free, aside from the costs of lab work, medications, and other treatments. I wish I had known this sooner, as it would have given me a space to talk to a healthcare provider about how I was feeling.

FYI: If you have questions about SHIP or health insurance, contact on-campus insurance resources. Insurance can be complicated—don’t be afraid to ask for help!

Even if SHS doesn’t provide a specific service, they can refer you to healthcare teams beyond BU. That said, let’s dive into what types of care you can get at SHS.

FYI: SHS is a confidential service with staff who genuinely want to hear your concerns and support you. Reaching out will not have any negative consequences.

BU provides many resources to support students’ health and wellness. Here are a few of my favorites:

This is just the beginning! I encourage everyone to explore these resources and maximize what BU offers. Remember, you should never hesitate to seek the support you deserve—BU provides a wealth of services designed to help you thrive.

Libraries are so much more than a place to get books. Now, thanks to the Libraries with Heart program, libraries in Central Florida are places where community members can keep an eye on one aspect of their health. A partnership between HCA Florida Healthcare, the American Heart Association and the Orange County Library system lets patrons 18 and up check out blood pressure monitoring kits. In 2024, the kits were checked out 459 times.

""We meet people where they are, and so we try to bring our community work to life in settings like the library,” said  Jimmy Clarity, vice president of community impact for the American Heart Association. “It’s a place where people gather and spend a lot of their time and can access resources. It’s not just about checking out library books anymore.”

Each branch of the library has at least two staff members who have been trained to teach patrons how to use the kits; the system also has outreach teams that go into the community to get the kits into the hands of those who might not be able to go to the library, or who are unaware that the program exists.

Libraries with Heart has also provided automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to every library in the system; a donation from UCF Lake Nona Hospital covered those, as well as the cost of training library staffers in CPR and AED use.

N.C. Sen. Benton Sawrey, R-Johnston, landed an influential role in his second term this session as co-chair of the Senate’s committees on healthcare.

He joined this week’s WUNC Politics Podcast to talk about his efforts to address the unusually high costs of healthcare in North Carolina, including a recent bill to limit insurance coverage mandates and some other proposals in the works for later this year.

This conversation has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

What do you see as the big priorities for the Senate on the healthcare front this year?

“It's going to all be about cost this year. There's some recent information that came out that showed that North Carolina ranked number 50 in the nation with respect to healthcare costs. We're paying the highest health premiums in the nation, which is particularly concerning considering how expensive healthcare is in the United States generally, and then not necessarily corresponding with outcome.

“We have parts of our state that are lagging behind the rest of the country with respect to infant mortality, maternal mortality, access to care, things like that. We need to really drill down and examine why we're paying so much and not getting the results that should come along with that.”

You co-sponsored a bill that already passed the Senate to get at the affordability issue, that would restrict government mandates on what insurance plans have to cover. What's the rationale behind going at it from that direction?

“That's not the only tool in the toolbox, that's one big piece of the puzzle here. What we've examined is that government mandates with insurance are having an effect on driving up costs. Anytime there's government intervention, it increases costs, increases regulation, increases obligation, and ultimately gets passed on to consumer and drives that up.”

Do you see other bills in the works?

“I think you'll see some (Certificate of Need) legislation that comes out this session. I think a complete CON repeal probably would not get across the finish line at this point, but there's definitely an opportunity, especially for (reducing regulatory handles to adding) major medical equipment pieces.

“I think you'll see a bill dropped on Collaborative Pharmacy Practice, where you can have certain qualified pharmacists practicing in a team-based setting with some of our physicians and other people. They can do medication management and help with that cost and access in some of our rural communities.”

Some of your counterparts on the House Health Committee have been discussing what might happen here in North Carolina if federal Medicaid funding gets cut. Have there been any preliminary discussions of what that might look like?

“We’re definitely having conversations about it. It's an issue that ultimately is not within our control as to what happens at the congressional level at this point.

“We have asked DHHS to discuss some contingencies and ideas about how they would address it if there are tweaks. At the $880 billion cut level that I think they're discussing, I believe the state share to North Carolina could potentially be about $27 billion, so it’s a big issue that would affect a lot of people in North Carolina.

""To keep (the Medicaid expansion) population in place, it would require commitment from the state of several billion more dollars that we don't have. So we would have to have some tough conversations about what that would look like in case that federal share was reduced.""

Sawrey also spoke about his bill to help disabled veterans afford homeownership, a new ""sports caucus"" and the upcoming budget season at the legislature. Listen to the full conversation on the WUNC Politics Podcast.

CHIPPEWA FALLS (WQOW) - Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers was in Chippewa Falls Thursday speaking with community leaders about healthcare in the Chippewa Valley.

Evers met with local healthcare representatives, mental healthcare workers, and other community members this afternoon to discuss the plans outlined in his proposed budget to support healthcare in rural communities and bring down costs.

Evers said that funding would be critical for area hospitals if the federal government cuts Medicaid funding.

""If they do to Medicaid what everybody fears, that's going to make it more difficult for everybody, whether you're in the hospitals that are open now or not. They're not going to be able to pay the bills,"" he said.

Evers' budget proposal will still have to go through the Republican controlled state legislature before any of that funding can be approved.

New Zealand Health Minister Simeon Brown has announced a new 24/7 telehealth service to expand access to primary care amid the overcrowding of emergency departments. 

The government will invest in the new service, which is expected to ""provide all New Zealanders with better access to video consultations with New Zealand-registered clinicians, such as GPs and nurse practitioners."" 

It will also enable GPs and nurses to issue prescriptions and make referrals for laboratory tests.

According to Te Whatu Ora, the 24/7 telehealth service is set for launch in July. 

THE LARGER CONTEXT

Minister Brown revealed the new digital healthcare service alongside the announcement of various initiatives to expand primary care access, including NZ$285 million ($163 million) investment in general practice over three years, placement of overseas doctors, and incentives for primary care providers to recruit nurses. 

""We are already investing record funding into healthcare, but many New Zealanders are still finding it too hard to get an appointment with their GP, which is putting pressure on our emergency departments,"" the Health minister noted. 

The upcoming launch of a new telehealth service also comes as New Zealand's Health Quality and Safety Commission recently concluded that telehealth has not yet proven to be a sustainable solution to care access in the country. In its investigation into the quality and safety implications of telehealth, the commission also found that the digital service never became popular in New Zealand in the first place, even during the pandemic. 

Prior to the release of the commission's report, the government had pulled funding for some free telehealth services, including COVID-19, as part of changes to the pandemic response and cost-cutting measures.

Healthcare issues in Arizona prisons led the ACLU to seek a receiver while agencies like NaphCare and the ADCRR are defending their actions. FOX 10's Justin Lum investigates.

PHOENIX - Advocates for inmates incarcerated by Arizona’s Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation, and Reentry say ADCRR doesn’t have what’s necessary to run a successful healthcare system, according to the ACLU’s motion for a receiver. 

Lawyers say NaphCare, the for-profit healthcare provider contracted by the state, remains ""woefully inadequate."" 

What they're saying:

""My whole neck – I’ve lost four inches in my height,"" said Mary Whatley over the phone. 

Whatley is incarcerated at the Perryville women’s prison, serving time for weapons misconduct. She’s having issues with what’s called the thecal sac – a protective sheath around the spinal cord – and she needs surgery.""I have to have this surgery or I’m going to be paralyzed, is what the nurse practitioners or providers here told me,"" said Whatley.

Mary Whatley 

She has a history of vertebrae fractures and neck trauma that causes numbness, tingling, and pain in both the neck and arms. Whatley doesn’t know when her next appointment will be.""And it’s not just me; there are other women here that need surgeries and care that they’re not getting,"" said Whatley.

There are more than 100 healthcare positions vacant, the ACLU says via its latest motion in the ongoing Jensen v. Thornell lawsuit.

""It’s a battle in here,"" said Erin Taylor. 

Taylor is another inmate at the Perryville Complex. She has brain cancer.""It’s very hard to get appointments,"" she said.In 2022, she had surgery to get some of the tumor removed. She says there was a long wait to receive radiation treatment.""For about 15 months, I asked for some aftercare. Radiation didn’t begin until July 2023,"" Taylor recalled.She also says there’s been miscommunication between the prison’s medical staff and her oncologist regarding how long her chemotherapy should last. 

Erin Taylor 

Dig deeper:

In the motion for a receiver to take over health care throughout the state’s prisons, ADCRR is accused of frequently using telehealth when it’s clinically inappropriate and dangerous. 

Due to a judge’s order to fix constitutional violations found at trial, court-appointed experts reviewed countless death reports that documented ""horrible care"" leading to ""unnecessary suffering and lost opportunities for treatment and cure"" - and ultimately death, per the ACLU. 

""The ways that those things are happening come through a few structural issues that we identified in our motion. One of these is extreme delays in people getting the care they need. Another one is a real difficulty getting people to specialty appointments."" 

As for the staffing shortage, Beall says there aren’t enough physicians providing care; instead, nurses who don’t have the same training,"" said Lauren Beall, an attorney for the ACLU of Arizona. 

Court expert reports say, ""NaphCare offered a paltry two-dollars-per-hour increase to physician salaries between December 2023 and July 2024 and has made none since.""

The other side:

A spokesperson for NaphCare says the provider is ""proud of our record of successfully recruiting and retaining healthcare staff to work in Arizona’s prisons"" and ""there are more healthcare professionals working in ADCRR prisons than ever before,"" also saying each of the nine state prisons has a full-time medical director with 13 additional physicians across the state and two more have been hired. 

There are openings for two full-time and one part-time physician. NaphCare also says pay rates compete with market rates. 

Meanwhile, ADCRR’s responses to court monitors’ reports cite challenges with changes through third-party vendors.""Passing the buck and saying, ‘you know this is NaphCare's responsibility’ is simply not an excuse, and it's not going to work for all of the people and all of the families of the people who are incarcerated,"" said Beall. 

We’ve also asked ADCRR about Erin Taylor and Mary Whatley’s alleged treatment delays. The department is prohibited from discussing inmates’ private and protected health information with third parties, but a spokesperson sent us the following statement:

Information for this story was provided by ADCRR, NaphCare, ACLU of Arizona, court documents and interviews with prisoners in Arizona prisons. The story was reported by FOX 10 Investigator Justin Lum from Phoenix.

In cooperation with

The people who can least afford healthcare are often among those who need healthcare the most. The correlation is only logical: The more one avoids the doctor, the sicker one gets. 

A 2024 survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers bears this out. The global professional-services organization found that 44% of consumers with significant health issues had recently put off seeking care due to financial concerns. And more than 6 in 10 regularly struggle to manage the cost of medications they need. 

“The challenge for consumers is difficult but not insurmountable,” PwC writes in commentary published March 4. “Health plans and health systems have an unprecedented opportunity to help make healthcare more affordable through artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced machine learning tools.”

PwC offers five pointers for healthcare leaders and workers looking to incorporate AI into cost-containment and patient-care strategies. 

AI can help identify high-risk patients in need of preventive care based on their medical history and demographics, PwC points out. “Early detection improves patient health before costly medical treatment is needed for serious or chronic disease.” More: 

‘Identifying issues early can empower patients to embrace healthy behaviors, manage risk factors such as high blood pressure or high blood sugar, avoid worsening conditions and live longer.’

AI can help lead to better patient diagnosis and treatment by analyzing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and providing personalized insights, the authors remind. “By considering the patient’s genetic makeup and contributing factors such as lifestyle and environment,” they add, “tailored treatments can address each patient’s individual needs and characteristics.” More:  

‘Such an approach can allow for more precise diagnoses, effective interventions and a potential reduction in expenditures before issues become critical.’ 

Researchers are using AI to help recruit patients to clinical trials who otherwise may be hard to find, PwC notes. “This AI-powered analysis enables researchers to reach out and recruit a wider and more diverse pool of trial participants.”  

‘Data that includes marginalized populations is crucial to developing useful algorithms to better address the needs of vulnerable populations.’ 

The World Economic Forum’s Digital Health Alliance recently published a report highlighting case studies and implementation models for community health workers who are helping patients manage diabetes and high blood pressure. As PwC shares, the report found “equipping community health workers with [AI and other] digital health tools can empower them to be more effective.” 

‘Notably, 6 of 10 digital health tools studied not only monitor care gaps but also alert providers, potentially offering a chance to intervene before a costly emergency room visit.’

AI is helping rural patients through tools like AI-driven smartphone apps that can assess symptoms, diagnose various medical issues and suggest personalized care, PwC writes. “Meanwhile sensory wearables can remotely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in patients with heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).” 

‘Remote monitoring brings down the cost of care by reducing the need for hospital admissions, emergency room visits and numerous follow-up appointments, particularly for patients with chronic conditions.’

“The tools to make healthcare more affordable and effective exist,” the authors write. “Let’s use them.”

Rep. Lindsey LaPointe (D-Chicago) spoke with reporters during a press conference in Springfield on March 6, 2025.



SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WAND) — A bill moving in Springfield could significantly improve access to mental health and substance use treatment.

Democrats and Republicans are pushing for a plan to require health insurance companies to cover medically-necessary out-of-network behavioral healthcare treatments as if they are in-network.

The proposal could also set minimum reimbursement rates for providers to properly compensate them for their services and encourage more specialists to join insurance networks.

""You deserve this. You had long deserved this,"" Rep. Lindsey LaPointe (D-Chicago) said Thursday. ""Behavioral healthcare is healthcare. We shouldn't treat it like some other, and it's just unacceptable for us to reimburse it at far lower rates.""

Sponsors said people already paying costly insurance premiums should be able to access the care outlined in their benefits instead of racking up debt for mental health services. 

House Bill 1085 passed out of the House Mental Health and Addiction Committee on a bipartisan 17-5 vote Thursday. The legislation currently has over 40 co-sponsors, and representatives could see the bill on the House floor as early as Tuesday. 

Identical legislation, Senate Bill 55, is also gaining significant support in the Senate. The proposal currently has nearly 30 co-sponsors. Sen. Karina Villa (D-West Chicago) told reporters she is committed to getting the plan passed out of both chambers this spring. As a former school social worker, Villa said this fight is personal.

""You have done nothing wrong. You have paid your premiums, and you deserve for your child to be able to go in and get help when they need it,"" Villa said. ""This bill is the most important bill regarding mental health that we can make sure to get across the finish line.""

This year’s HIMSS conference in Las Vegas, which wrapped on Thursday, allowed healthcare technology leaders from around the world to convene and share ideas. As always, the event came with a slew of news announcements.

Below are six notable announcements made during the conference.

Epic says its expanding beyond EHRs


					A new report from Relatient, A Data-Driven Guide to Patient Access Succes, highlights how focusing on data accuracy and relevance can enhance the performance of healthcare practices.				

Epic announced that it is developing an enterprise resource planning system for the healthcare industry — a move that puts the EHR giant into direct competition with companies like Oracle and Workday.

The company said the ERP system will enable aid decision makers with insights derived from financial, operational and clinical data.

Baxter releases wearable device to aid clinicians

Baxter debuted a wearable device that seeks to facilitate more efficient communication between care team members. 


					Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.				

The badge-like device is powered by Baxter’s AI assistant named Scotty.  While wearing the device, care team members can say things like “Hey Scotty, call a nurse for Patient A,” or “Hey Scotty, call my colleague so I can ask a question about this patient’s medication.”

Microsoft rolls out copilot

Microsoft launched its Dragon Copilott — an AI assistant with ambient listening technology, voice dictation and  generative AI capabilities.

The company said the tool will help clinicians with a range of tasks, such helping them gather data about a specific patient or condition, sending referral letters, and generating documentation following a patient encounter.

InterSystems launches new EHR 

InterSystems unveiled a new EHR system with AI features. The EHR, named IntelliCare, is designed for health systems in the midst of digital transformation, and it seeks to eliminate “the constraints of legacy systems,” the company said.

“By building an EHR solution with AI at its core, we’re helping healthcare providers focus on what matters: More face time with patients and less screen time,” said Don Woodlock, InterSystems’ head of global healthcare solutions.

Zoom announces clinician platform & AI companion

Zoom launched beta programs for a new platform called Zoom Workplace for Clinicians, as well as for a new AI companion. 

The new clinician platform, which will integrate with EHRs, seeks to reduce administrative burden for providers, primarily with its ambient scribe technology. The AI Companion, which will be sold as an add-on to the new platform, is designed to speed up administrative tasks like documentation, scheduling and care coordination.

Talkdesk debuts AI agents suite

Call center software company Talkdesk unveiled its AI agents for healthcare companies. These agents can do things like help patients schedule visits, access account information in the EHR and escalate to a live agent if a patient becomes upset.

Each healthcare customer will be able to customize these agents for their specific organization and desired use case, the company noted.

Athenahealth is partnering with Abridge to integrate the company’s enhanced note-taking technology into its platform for clinicians, as the market for ambient scribing is becoming more crowded.

Abridge offers ambient note-taking, which is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology that listens to a patient and doctor conversation and generates structured medical notes. After a review by the doctor, these notes are added directly to a patient’s electronic health record.

The note-taking tool is also multilingual; it can record the patient-doctor conversation in one language and write it up in another language.

“Writing notes is something that has been a pain point for physicians since time began,” Paul Brient, chief product officer at Athenahealth, said in an interview with PYMNTS. “Artificial intelligence has gotten to the point now where it can listen to a provider-patient conversation and generate a note for the physician.”

Physicians often spend hours of their personal time catching up on medical notes — a phenomenon the industry calls “pajama time.”

Abridge’s technology will be incorporated into athenaOne, which is Athenahealth’s flagship cloud-based electronic health record (EHR), practice management and revenue cycle management platform designed for outpatient care. 

Earlier this week, Microsoft unveiled an AI-powered assistant that combines advanced voice dictation and ambient listening with generative AI. Called Dragon Copilot, the tool converts doctor and patient conversations into clinical summaries that can be integrated into electronic health records.

Microsoft is using the technology from Nuance, which it acquired in 2022. Brient said Nuance used to be the only game in town about three to four years ago, but the field has gotten crowded now with 40 to 50 vendors. 

Athenahealth is one of the largest in this market, serving 160,000 providers or about 10% of U.S. healthcare providers, primarily in outpatient care.

Brient said the Abridge partnership represents one part of Athenahealth’s broader vision for AI in healthcare technology. The company is developing a platform where users get to customize their experience.

For example, Abridge is one of three note-taking services being offered on athenaOne. The other two are Suki and iScribe, and Athenahealth plans to add more. Brient wants to give physicians a choice on which note-taking service they want to use because everyone’s style is different.

Letting each physician in a practice choose the model that works best for them is a “much more flexible strategy,” he added. “We were pretty excited about the approach, and super excited to have Abridge join that approach.”

Athenahealth also has an app marketplace with more than 850 APIs for physicians to customize their tech experience.

Looking ahead, the arrival of generative and agentic AI can “dramatically change the clinician experience” in the realm of the electronic health record system, Brient said.

First, the note-taking AI can evolve into a technology that can pull out diagnoses from the patient-doctor conversation and even suggest medicine orders, shrinking the process into a single cognitive step, Brient said.

Second, Brient sees Athenahealth using AI to digitize outpatient documentation. Unlike in-patient hospital care, where everything is electronic, at clinics and other outpatient settings a lot of documents are in various forms: lab test faxes, medical forms, and the like.

“A lot of the data coming into the EHR is unstructured. We get a lot of faxes,” Brient said. “You’re dealing with a lot of vendors all over the place.”

He added that “the good thing about AI is it can actually read those faxes. It can pull all the data out and put them in discrete form,” or stored in a way for easy retrieval and analysis. So instead of the doctor having to read each individual lab test, AI can consolidate and analyze them.

Brient also sees AI making its revenue cycle management services more efficient. This includes managing billing, insurance claims and payments. “We can add agentic AI and the new LLMs [large language models] to do a lot of the work the humans are doing, which speeds it up.”

For example, a hospital gets a check from an insurance company but it doesn’t say for whom or why, Brient said. The hospital has to investigate by logging into the insurer’s web portal. AI agents can do that.

Another use case is to appeal coverage denials. An LLM can write an appeal letter that the AI agent can upload to the insurer’s portal. The human worker would click to submit the appeal.

Also, Brient sees AI taking over the communication between the doctor’s office and the patient — taking phone calls, scheduling appointments, refilling medication and the like.

AI will handle the routine tasks to help the human worker who might be overwhelmed trying to check people in and out of the clinic, he said. 

“Big health systems are already doing that, but most of our clients are small, independent practices,” Brient added. “So we’re helping them, over the next year, to start doing that.”

He said he met with a company that uses AI agents as “nurses,” not to directly provide care, but to perform follow-ups like calling the patient to remind them they still need to get a certain lab test for their surgery. Brient can see Athenahealth acting as a “virtual call center” for doctors’ offices.

Adoption could increase as costs continue to fall. Brient said the cost for note-taking has fallen from $2,000 a month per doctor in the early days to $100 to $400 — and prices still keep declining.

“People have long joked that Dr. Google plays a big role in people’s healthcare lives,” he said. “I can imagine that Dr. ChatGPT will start to play a big role in people’s healthcare lives, officially or unofficially.”

Last week, I testified before a joint session of the Senate and House Veterans’ Affairs Committees. While this is usually a forum for The American Legion to present legislative priorities, most questions from members of Congress were related to recent policy and personnel actions by the White House and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), including firings, contract cancellations, hiring freezes, return to work orders and voluntary resignations.

Billed as an effort to increase government efficiency, there has been growing concern in the veteran community these actions have had, and will continue to have, significant negative impacts on VA’s core missions. I understand these concerns and empathize with veterans who are anxious about the speed and justification for these changes. On Tuesday, a leaked internal memo outlined a process by which VA will conduct a department-wide personnel review by May 9 and publish a plan for Reduction-in-Force by the end of Fiscal Year 2025, “as required by [the Office of Management & Budget and the Office of Personnel Management].” This agency review could potentially lead to a further 83,000 job cuts, reducing total VA staff to 2019 levels.  

While The American Legion believes VA should be efficient and accountable for the veterans it serves, a 2019 staff posture does not take into consideration the increased demand for health care and benefits after passage of the PACT Act in 2022. With fewer employees, the VA’s ability to meet this demand would be called into question, and considering roughly 25% of federal employees are veterans themselves, up to 83,000 job cuts could put up to 20,000+ veterans out of work.

In Washington, D.C., The American Legion is consistently engaged on your behalf. As these cuts have the potential to threaten services our nation’s veterans earned and depend on, I promise our 1.6 million members — and all veterans — we are taking action. The American Legion will work to ensure the administration’s efforts to make VA more efficient do not result in unintended consequences for veterans. I ask all Legionnaires to be active in your peer support networks and Be the One to assist your fellow veterans and their families in need.

During our 2025 Washington Conference, we met with VA Secretary Doug Collins and senior personnel at VA’s internal agencies to communicate our priorities and concerns and ask for increased transparency related to the methodology and potential impacts of agency actions. We are committed to working with VA leadership to ensure your voice is heard.  Furthermore, we are actively communicating with members of Congress and will immediately raise the alarm when we see any mission-critical impacts to veterans.

That’s where you come in. Our voice in D.C. is only powerful if we hear from Legionnaires and communicate your message to policymakers. So if you or an immediate family member are personally impacted by recent or future government actions, I ask you to contact our Government Relations office and tell your story via The American Legion Impact Survey: https://www.votervoice.net/AmericanLegion/Surveys/12345/Respond.

Your voice is crucial to convey the human impact of these policies back to the White House and VA, advocating on your behalf. And in Congress, we will use your story to urge members of both parties to exercise oversight authority when necessary.

Additionally, The American Legion stands ready to assist veterans affected by job loss through job fairs and employment initiatives, emergency financial assistance and free claims processing – in the public or private sector.

Since The American Legion was founded, we have been a powerful voice to ensure our government lives up to Lincoln’s immortal promise to care for those who have borne the battle. We have never shied away from this responsibility. We won’t start now.

For God and Country,

National Commander

A story of determination, strength and generosity - all from a 12-year-old girl.

[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]

Arielle Urquhart will hop on a bike Saturday to raise money for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. It’s a cause close to her heart, spending months there after surviving a car crash that almost ended her young life.

Arielle toured WSB-TV, sitting in on one of our newscasts as a guest of Channel 2 Anchor Jorge Estevez and the rest of the team. She showed she is so curious and full of life, which was almost cut short.

Arielle and her mother were in a head-on collision on their way to school a little over four years ago, when she was just 7.

“It could have gone either way, and I am so grateful to be alive,” she said.

LINK: RIDE OF A LIFE TIME 2025 FUNDRAISER

Doctors at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta performed a lifesaving neck and spinal surgery. Arielle not only walked again, she would go on to compete in track.

Since then, she has become a “Miracle Kid” with the Children’s Miracle Network, donating her time to make care packages for others in the hospital.

Her work continues on a bike at Life Time Fitness, an athletic club that’s raising money for the Children’s Miracle Network with their signature “Ride of a Life Time Event.”

Instructors like Joshua Neal are grateful to be able to give back.

“To know that we are actually raising money to help these kids is just priceless, it is really is,” he said.

This effort means so much to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and to kids like Arielle, who thanks to the care she received gets to give back.

“I try to show them that this could be you,” she said. “You could get better. Just keep believing in yourself and keep pushing hard, and you can make it through.”

Arielle recovered from that neck surgery and a broken femur. It took her four months to walk again.

Now, she is a track star, a cheerleader and wants to pursue a modeling and acting career.

“I feel like I did get a second chance at life,” Arielle said.

Valued at a market cap of $84.8 billion, The Cigna Group CI is a global health company that has two growth platforms: Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare. The Bloomfield, Connecticut-based company provides insurance and related products and services.

Companies valued at $10 billion or more are generally classified as “large-cap” stocks, and Cigna Group fits this criterion perfectly. CI maintains sales capabilities in more than 30 markets and jurisdictions and has approximately 182 million customer relationships around the world that offer to solve diverse challenges across the healthcare system.

The multinational insurance company declined 16.4% from its 52-week high of 370.83. Over the last three months, Cigna Group stock has fallen 3.9%, lagging behind the iShares Global Healthcare ETF IXJ 3% rise during the same timeframe.

Over the last 52 weeks, Cigna Group shares have slipped 6.9%, while the IXJ has surged 3.2% in the same period. However, CI has gained 12.2% on a YTD basis, exceeding IXJ’s 9.6% increase. 

CI has been trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages since October last year with some recent fluctuations. 

Despite not meeting Wall Street expectations on Jan. 30, CI shares rose 3.9% the following day due to adjusted revenues, which improved by 28.4% year-over-year to $65.7 billion, beating the consensus mark. Additionally, the company also increased its quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $1.51 from fiscal 2025 onwards, boosting investor confidence. 

Moreover, in comparison, its rival, Elevance Health, Inc. ELV, performed weaker than CI. Shares of ELV increased 7.7% on a YTD basis. But, ELV has dipped 20.2% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind CI.

Due to CI’s strong price action on a YTD basis, analysts remain bullish about its prospects. Among the 22 analysts covering the stock, there is a consensus rating of “Strong Buy,” and it is currently trading below the mean price target of $365.24.

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and author of 'My Mother and I,' discusses how the Duchess of Sussex isn't going to be welcomed back across the pond anytime soon following her royal exit.

While Meghan Markle has been promoting her new Netflix show, ""With Love, Meghan,"" it appears that some viewers have no love for her.

On Thursday, Markle appeared on Drew Barrymore's talk show to discuss the lifestyle series, and to some, the interview wasn't easy to watch.

Towards the beginning of Markle's segment, Barrymore discussed her interview style, which has been described as very touchy: ""I like to connect… I'm such a warm person, and I love affection.""

MEGHAN MARKLE IN ‘DIRE’ SITUATION AMID REBRAND RIDICULE: EXPERT

Drew Barrymore admitted that she likes ""to connect"" with people during her interview with Meghan Markle. (""The Drew Barrymore Show""/CBS)

Markle, who didn't appear bothered by Barrymore's consistent closeness during the interview, responded, ""I just think it's really important, we've missed this human connection certainly after the pandemic and everything else, and we crave that… to really be able to hold and touch and embrace someone."" 

The interview was met with some harsh criticism. Several viewers weighed in on social media, with many of them slamming Markle, Barrymore or both for what some called a ""fake"" appearance.

""Drew Barrymore is just as false as Meghan,"" one user wrote on X. ""All that fake hugging of complete strangers is just so false.""

""Barrymore also out-hugged Markle. Doesn't Drew know that is supposed to be Meghan's thing!?"" another X user commented.

One viewer wrote, ""Meghan Markle has finally met her match. Drew is even more clingier (and cringier imo) than her.""

Another post read, ""Not sure who’s more insufferable, Meghan Markle or Drew. It’s a surprise that anyone can suffer through such inane garbage. And given all the crap Meghan Markle has received over her show for being so fake, Drew Barrymore was the worst option for a talk show.""

Others praised the interview, with one person commenting on the show's YouTube posting, ""I absolutely love Duchess Meghan & I've always been a Drew Barrymore fan, so I am loving this!""

""I am so glad that Drew had her on the show,"" another comment read. ""Genuine authenticity and a good heart will always prevail. Meghan's energy and positive attitude are infectious!""

One viewer commented, ""the fact that she continues to be joyful and happy in the face of all the hate is so encouraging. good on you meghan! keep going."" 

""I truly believe that the hate Meghan receives comes from jealousy. She is so classy, elegant and talented,"" another wrote. ""She is married to a prince and has two beautiful children. Her style and success are why I think people are ugly to her. I wish her the very best!""

Fox News Digital reached out to representatives for Barrymore and Markle for comment.

On Barrymore's show, Markle also spoke about her relationship with Prince Harry, whom Barrymore said she ""loved so much,"" despite never having met him.

""He's very lovable,"" Markle said with a smile. ""He's easy to love.""

Barrymore spoke highly of Harry before saying, ""I got to meet his mom when I was 7 years old,"" which Markle said she ""didn't know."" Barrymore told Markle that she had a photo with her upstairs that she wanted to share with her — which she did later in the show — of her presenting Princess Diana with an ""E.T."" doll.

""It was one of the most special moments of my life,"" Barrymore told her. ""I loved her so much, and I think the world of him, and he found you.""

Markle responded, ""Life is full of surprises. I did not expect to meet H [her nickname for Harry], and for this to be our love story, and I'm very lucky I am married to the funniest, sweetest, most charming… he's an amazing father. I count my blessings because I have him, and also because I have a partner who is so supportive of me.""

Markle also shared that she and Harry ""make it a point to date each other,"" saying that they have lunch together every day amid various business meetings.

""You find ways to show up for each other, and if that's the one thing that I can convey through the show, or through As Ever as a brand, I want people to know you can show up for each other, because you know how good it feels when someone shows up for you.""

The country music legend lost her husband of 60 years, Carl Dean, on Monday. He was 82.

The title of the song was inspired by a ""beautiful little girl"" Parton remembered seeing in the crowd while she was onstage one evening.

""She was probably 8 years old at the time,"" Parton told NPR. ""And she had this beautiful red hair, this beautiful skin, and beautiful green eyes. And she was looking up at me, holding, you know, for an autograph. And I said, 'Well, you're just the prettiest little thing I've ever seen.' I said, ‘What is your name?’ And she said, ‘Jolene.’

Ingrid Michaelson is sharing a story about an interaction she had with Taylor Swift about five years ago.

Earlier this week, the 45-year-old singer-songwriter opened up about the time she ran into the pop superstar while attending an awards show in 2019. Michaelson initially claimed in the video that it was the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) that year, but after a little sleuthing, the picture ""The Way I Am"" artist shared in her TikTok ""storytime"" was taken at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards.

""I was on the red carpet, like feeling myself,"" she began, mimicking the paparazzi and photographers calling out for her attention. ""Ingrid! Ingrid! Ingrid!""

""Then all of the sudden, it was like they were ushering me off [the carpet]...and I realized that Taylor Swift was coming. I look to my right, and there she is.""

Michaelson recalled how the ""I Can Do It With a Broken Heart"" songstress moved down the carpet, posing for countless photos before taking cover between some panels and her bodyguards.

The ""Keep Breathing"" singer went on, remembering thinking to herself, ""'Well I know her, we've hung out a couple of times,'"" Before actually making moves to get near the artist.

""So I went between the panels, literally running after this woman. And I go, 'Taylor! Taylor!' and of course she doesn't turn around, because why would she turn around hearing a random woman screaming her name.""

But that's not what was ""so pathetic,"" according to the artist, that came later when she proceeded to yell at the top of her lungs: ""Taylor! It's Ingrid!""

Luckily, that was enough to divert any amount of embarrassment Michaelson would have otherwise had to shake off, as it did grab Swift's attention.

""She did turn around and remembered me,"" Michaelson revealed.

""We took a picture,"" she added with a smile.

Michaelson's experience isn't oh-so unique, as several other Hollywood stars and the lucky few average Joes who've interacted with the pop star have all said pretty much the same thing: She's a delight!

A lawyer for actor Blake Lively wants a federal judge to prevent defendants including “It Ends With Us” costar Justin Baldoni from getting personal or intimate information about her or other celebrities as her sexual harassment lawsuit advances toward trial

Blake Lively's Lawyers Seek Tight Hold Over Release of Information in Lawsuit Against Justin Baldoni

NEW YORK (AP) — A lawyer for actor Blake Lively asked a federal judge Thursday to impose strict rules to prevent anyone associated with Justin Baldoni getting personal or intimate information about her or other celebrities while potential evidence is shared among attorneys as her sexual harassment claims against her costar in “It Ends With Us” proceeds toward trial.

Meryl Governski, representing Lively, told Judge Lewis J. Liman in a telephone conference that some materials must be shared only between lawyers to protect her client and others. The judge did not immediately rule.

Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and sought unspecified damages. Baldoni later countersued, accusing Lively and her husband, “Deadpool” actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.

Governski said some defendants in Lively's lawsuit filed in late December against Baldoni, his production company and others seemed to be operating on an unlimited budget as they “try to ruin the lives of Ms. Lively and her family.”

“There is an insatiable appetite for any information about this case, no matter how benign it is,” Governski said. “The defendants have bragged in text messages about being able to publish information without fingerprints.”

She said one category of information that needs to be kept between lawyers related to medical information, including mental health, and that “personal and intimate conversations with unrelated third parties” must be kept out of the public eye because — while the public relations value would be high — the evidentiary value would be “virtually nonexistent.”

Governski said there were “dozens and dozens of third parties” that would be identified by name in discovery materials, and “we think there is a significant chance of irreparable harm if marginally relevant information with high-profile individuals who are unrelated to the case fall into the wrong hands.”

Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni and his production company, scoffed at Governski's statements, saying the judge's proposed order to keep potential evidence in the case secret while it is shared between attorneys and their clients was sufficient.

Freedman said the case was similar to others, despite the fame of its litigants, and he should be able to discuss potential evidence with his clients to properly defend them.

“Frankly we see no difference because someone is a celebrity” as to how the case should proceed, he said.

Freedman said Lively's lawyers could request that certain sensitive materials, such as medical information related to her claims that she suffered emotional distress, be kept between lawyers when the issue arises.

“If they need greater protection and need our clients not to see something, they could make a specific showing,” he said.

The judge said he expects to rule soon. He noted there was a “presumption of public access” to the courts, and he cited the public's right to know how the court's resources are being used.

He has already warned lawyers to obey court rules about making public statements that could endanger a fair trial and suggested he could order a trial scheduled for March 9, 2026, to occur sooner if lawyers continued making fiery public comments.

“It Ends With Us,” an adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie’s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.

Lively became widely known after she appeared in the 2005 film “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.” She bolstered her stardom on the TV series “Gossip Girl” from 2007 to 2012 before starring in films including “The Town” and “The Shallows.”

Baldoni starred in the TV comedy “Jane the Virgin,” directed the 2019 film “Five Feet Apart” and wrote “Man Enough,” a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.

Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's legal teams battled over a proposed protective order during a 90-minute hearing Thursday.

The two parties have been arguing about how much protection and confidentiality is necessary in the case. Lively sued Baldoni in December for sexual harassment. However, Baldoni insisted in his lawsuit that Lively ""falsely"" accused him in an attempt to repair her reputation after the fallout around the movie's press tour after she took control of the film.

Lively's lawyers argued for an ""attorney's eyes only"" (AEO) designation for evidence in the case, seemingly pushing for text messages with ""high-profile individuals"" to be kept hidden from the public.

""There is a significant chance of irreparable harm if marginal conversations with high-profile individuals with no relevance to the case were to fall into wrong hands,"" Lively's lawyer, Meryl Conant Governski, argued during the hearing, insinuating a chance of texts leaking.

Governski claimed there are ""100 million reasons"" Baldoni's side may leak text messages due to public relations value.

Lively's team focused on examples of information that should be kept confidential, including security measures taken to protect the actress, her husband and their children. The lawyers argued there is no reason for anybody to know about the specific security measures the family has in place.

Justin Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said it was offensive to suggest the team would disregard a protective order from the court. The lawyer pushed back against the ""attorneys' eyes only"" designation, stating his concern Lively's legal team was shifting the burden to the defense.

Freedman also confirmed there is no intention to disclose any information regarding Lively's medical and psychological records.

Judge Lewis Liman noted if something relevant to the case was discussed, the defense should be able to discuss and use it. However, the judge did not make a decision on which protective order would be put in place during Thursday's hearing.

Lively and others who have spoken out in support of the actress have received ""violent"" messages, leading the ""Gossip Girl"" star to request ""heightened"" protections, according to a letter filed in court Feb. 20 and obtained by Fox News Digital.

""As detailed in Ms. Lively’s Amended Complaint, Ms. Lively, her family, other members of the cast, various fact witnesses, and individuals that have spoken out publicly in support of Ms. Lively have received violent, profane, sexist, and threatening communications,"" the filing said.

Baldoni's legal team filed a response to Lively's request for ""heightened protections"" and privacy in court ahead of Thursday's hearing.

""Given how actively the Lively Parties have publicized and litigated Ms. Lively’s claims in the media, we are surprised to now learn how vehemently she wants to prevent the public from accessing material and relevant evidence,"" the response says.

Baldoni's team emphasized its approval of the court's model protective order but noted having an ""attorneys' eyes only"" designation for discovery was ""not warranted.""

""Although the Lively Parties contend that the ability to designate information AEO is appropriate because the ‘litigation involves claims of sexual harassment in the workplace,’ … Ms. Lively has already publicized the alleged details of the so-called ‘harassment’ in her Amended Complaint spanning 138 pages and almost 500 paragraphs.""

Justin Baldoni’s father dissed Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds on Instagram in another installment of the ongoing Lively-Baldoni feud. Baldoni’s father Sam reposted a viral clip of a bulletin board that read “in a world full of Blakes and Ryans, be a Justin.” The board was decorated with red hearts, photos of Baldoni, and adjectives describing his character, like compassionate and empathetic. It included Baldoni’s quotes supporting women’s rights. Sam reposted it on Wednesday with a heart hand emoji but it was removed as of Thursday afternoon. The original video went viral on TikTok amid the contentious court battle between 37-year-old actress and 41-year-old director. Lively and Baldoni’s legal rift grew into a full-blown fight after the stars worked together on the set of It Ends With Us. Lively sued Baldoni and his production company in December alleging sexual harassment and a public smear campaign to “destroy” her reputation. The New York Times reported the investigation in an article headlined “‘We Can Bury Anyone’: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.” In response, Baldoni filed two lawsuits: a $250 million libel lawsuit against the Times and a $400 million lawsuit against Lively and her husband.","{'href': 'https://news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}"

""I’m really in the thick of it right now, so I’m all over the place,"" Paltrow said. ""But I noticed my symptoms are, like, pretty well under control unless, you know, in January when the fires were happening in L.A. I’ve used alcohol for its purpose.""

Prior to the L.A. fires, she said that she would barely drink alcohol, and if she did, it was once a week.

Back in January, Paltrow took to Instagram to share how devastated she was about the Palisades and Eaton fires that devastated the Pacific Palisades and Altadena communities.

""Our beloved Los Angeles … We are in deep grief for so many of our close friends who have lost everything,"" her caption began.

She also clarified that she and her family were safe. The actress is married to Brad Falchuk, and she shares two children, Apple and Moses, with her ex-husband, Chris Martin.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Paltrow sold her Brentwood home for $22 million the same month of the L.A. fires. The home was originally put on the market for $29.9 million in May 2024, but the price was lowered to $24.9 million in October. The outlet reported that Paltrow's home was threatened by the Palisades Fire but ultimately was not affected.

Twenty-nine people were killed in the Palisades and Eaton fires; 23,448 acres burned in the Palisades Fire and 6,833 businesses and homes were destroyed, according to Cal Fire.

On Sunday night’s episode of “The White Lotus,” Walton Goggins’ character Rick throws open the doors to cages containing a slither of snakes, resulting in another character being hospitalized for a snakebite.

In a serendipitous twist, however, Goggins was the one bit by one of those snakes in real life.

Goggins spun the tale on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Wednesday. (Content advisory: The full interview discusses mature themes.)

“As I was pulling the snake out, he didn’t want to come, right? So the snake turns around and he bit me,” Goggins explained.

Goggins added that he wished he could’ve played it cool, but his reaction was anything but.

“Oh my God I’ve been bit by a snake! Oh my God,” he screamed in a panicked voice.

Unlike the plot of the show, this snake was not venomous, though Goggins was taken to the hospital the next day as a precaution.

5 On Your Side at 10 p.m.

ST. LOUIS — St. Louis area residents will notice a pair of familiar faces on the 37th season premiere of the top-rated CBS competition reality show “The Amazing Race” on Wednesday, March 5. And if there was ever a team that could win the first-place million-dollar prize, it is St. Louis natives Jeff “Pops” Bailey and Jeff Bailey. This father-son duo will travel across the globe competing in what has been dubbed the “season of surprises.”

“I almost forgot we were being filmed,” Pops said. “Because we were in that mode to win – to get to where we were going and execute what we were doing – and it was a lot of fun.” 

Pops and Jeff Bailey are lumberjacks by trade, and each own a business. Pops, an alumnus of University City High School, has been in the business for 40 years and counting. His company Green Thumb Tree Service (GThumb) is in Creve Coeur and has offered pruning and tree removal service since 1988. 

“I told Pops maybe two years ago that we were going on ‘The Amazing Race,’” said Jeff.  “Pops has never even done an interview because he’s always been an entrepreneur, you know, so this was completely out of his wheelhouse.”

Jeff, who is 36 and a graduate of McCluer North, has a business called EconoTree Service. Located in Jamestown, the business offers pruning, removal, and drought care.

Jeff wanted to bring his dad on “The Amazing Race” to show off his physical skills. 

“My dad is 65 and he is in excellent shape,” said Jeff. “He’s what everybody wants to be at that age. As a kid for as long as I remember I had a chainsaw in my hands. I would be watching him climb trees and be amazed at what he was doing.”  

Jeff began watching “The Amazing Race” in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown. It was one of many shows he watched during that time – and just so happened to strike a chord with the rest of the family. He began watching it with his 12-year-old daughter Skylar. She became his “binging partner.”  He then told his father about the show. Pops took to it immediately. He also quickly took to the idea of competing with Jeff on the show. 

“I have my own business – and he has his – but sometimes we’ll collaborate on jobs,” Jeff said. “It’s been plenty of times where we’ll be on a job site together talking about ‘[The Amazing Race’ – so this is just another thing for us to bond over.”

The two would talk about the different challenges on the show whenever they got a chance. Once Pops agreed to be a part of the show, they began training immediately. Pops would carry plates on his head to increase his balance and agility and practiced little dance moves to dominate the performances to come. 

 Jeff sought counsel from close friend Ricky Hughes, creator of STL Run Crew, on the physical needs of the race like the correct shoes, and the mental needs like endurance. Jeff has been very fast since he was a child. He ran the 4×800 in the Junior Olympics when he was just 12 years old. “I didn’t really play any organized sports for that long because on the weekends and after school I was out working with Pops,” he said. 

Jeff noted the race is inherently physical but there is also a social aspect as well. “The social side of it is very important – it’s not just about doing challenges and getting from place to place,” Jeff said. “We’re lumberjacks with loud chainsaws around us all the time, so for us to go out there with 13 other teams and play a social game, make friends and allies, I’m very proud of how we were able to navigate that.”

This season racers will encounter a new twist called the “Fork in the Road.” It includes a trap during the first leg of the race in Hong Kong. The “Fork” will be encountered on their way to the Pit Stop. If racers choose the wrong direction, it may lead them to an elimination.

If Jeff and Pops are victorious, they won’t be the first St. Louisans to win “The Amazing Race.” St. Louis’ own Dr. Maya Warren and her partner Amy DeJong captured the title for season 25 in 2014.

They are looking forward to sharing their journey on “The Amazing Race” with the world.

“I’m just excited for our family to watch it,” Pops said. “I’m proud of our actions.”

 “One thing I think you’ll be able to see is we had fun with it,” Jeff added. “And we’re just a father and son that wanted to take this experience in.”

The 37th season premiere of “The Amazing Race” will air at 8:30 p.m. CST on CBS. Check local listings for channels. ","{'href': 'https://www.ksdk.com', 'title': 'KSDK.com'}"

Kim Kardashian recently drew attention to financial struggles she faced following her split from ex-husband Damon Thomas when she was just 21 years old. 

The SKIMS founder opened up about her post-divorce finances in the latest episode of The Kardashians on Hulu. The star praised her younger sister, Khloe Kardashian, for giving away her ""life savings"" so she could leave Thomas and find an apartment. 

The now 44-year-old pulled an all-nighter with Khloe to count the money, and they soon discovered they had $6,000, which was enough for her to set off on her own and leave the space she shared with the music producer, 10 years her senior. 

Khloe also commented on her selfless act, revealing that she didn't think twice about giving her sister the money.

""She was crying in my room. I was just like, 'OK, I have this Coke bottle. Let’s take what’s in here, go to the bank and cash it—and let's use this money for your divorce.' I gave her all that I got.""

According to E!News, Thomas and Kardashian wed in 2000 when Kim was just 19 years old and spent four years together before parting ways in 2004. Kim went on to tie the knot with basketball star Kris Humphries in 2011 and called it quits 72 days later. The mother-of-four married rapper Kanye West in 2014, with whom she shares children North, 11, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 5. The former pair ended their relationship in 2021.

All I See Is You streams on Lionsgate Play from March 7

The psychological drama All I See Is You, starring Blake Lively and Jason Clarke, is set to stream on Lionsgate Play on March 7. The film, directed by Marc Forster, explores the evolving dynamics of a marriage after a woman regains her eyesight, leading to unforeseen consequences. Originally released in 2017, the movie garnered attention for its unconventional storytelling and visual style. While it received mixed reviews, its psychological depth and performances have been points of discussion among viewers and critics.

The film will be available for streaming on Lionsgate Play from March 7. Viewers in India and select regions with access to the platform can watch it with a subscription. The addition of All I See Is You expands Lionsgate Play's collection of psychological dramas, offering audiences a chance to revisit the film.

The film follows Gina, played by Blake Lively, who has been blind since childhood but undergoes a cornea transplant that restores her vision. As she adapts to her new reality, the balance in her marriage to James, played by Jason Clarke, shifts dramatically. What initially seems like a joyous transformation soon reveals underlying insecurities and power struggles, leading to a tense psychological unraveling. The official trailer highlights the film's eerie atmosphere, shifting perspectives, and a slow-burning tension that builds throughout the story.

The film features Blake Lively as Gina and Jason Clarke as James in the lead roles. Supporting cast members include Ahna O'Reilly, Yvonne Strahovski, Wes Chatham, and Danny Huston. Directed by Marc Forster, the screenplay was co-written by Forster and Sean Conway. Cinematography was handled by Matthias Koenigswieser, while Marc Streitenfeld composed the music.

Despite the reception, the film remains a subject of discussion for its psychological themes and unique cinematography. Upon its release, All I See Is You earned just $678,150 against its $30 million budget. It has an average IMDb rating of 5.4 / 10.

A Tamil-language suspense thriller, Finder Project 1, directed by Vinoth Rajendran, follows the journey of two criminology students who establish a detective agency aimed at proving the innocence of wrongfully convicted individuals. The film, featuring Charle, Sendrayan, Vinoth Rajendran, and Dharani Reddy in key roles, delves into an investigative narrative inspired by real-life projects like the Innocence Project in the United States. With a gripping premise, the story unfolds as the detectives uncover the truth behind a case involving two men convicted of murder.

Scheduled for its digital premiere, Finder Project 1 will be available for streaming on Aha Tamil from March 7, 2025. The film, which initially hit theatres on April 19, 2024, received moderate attention for its intriguing storyline and investigative theme.

The trailer of Finder Project 1 offers a glimpse into the intense and methodical approach taken by the protagonists in solving a wrongful conviction case. The film's plot revolves around Peter, a fisherman played by Charle, and his brother-in-law Rayan, portrayed by Sendrayan, who are falsely accused of murdering a councillor. Lured by the promise of financial compensation and an early release, they accept the charges, only for Rayan to lose his life in prison. The detective duo, played by Vinoth Rajendran and Dharani Reddy, take up the case, navigating layers of deception and corruption to unearth the truth.

The film boasts an ensemble cast, with Charle portraying Peter and Sendrayan appearing as Raayan. The lineup includes director Vinoth Rajendran, Dharani Reddy, Nizhalgal Ravi as Dhayalan, Gopinath Shankar, Brana Abdulsalam, and Nazar Anver Raja. The project has been helmed by Vinoth Rajendran, who has taken on multiple roles, including writing the screenplay and dialogues. Baby Antony handled cinematography, while Surya Prasadh composed the music.

While performances and cinematography have been praised, audience response to the film's narrative execution varies. It has an IMDb rating of 6.1 / 10.

Pregnant players on the women’s tennis tour now can receive 12 months of paid maternity leave, and those who become parents via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption can get two months off with pay, under a program sponsored by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia and announced Thursday by the WTA.

“Independent contractors and self-employed individuals don’t typically have these kinds of maternity benefits provided and available to them. They have to go out and sort of figure out those benefits for themselves,” WTA CEO Portia Archer said. “This is really sort of novel and groundbreaking.”

More than 300 players are eligible for the fund, which is retroactive to Jan. 1. The WTA would not disclose how much money is involved.

The program — which the WTA touted as “the first time in women’s sports history that comprehensive maternity benefits are available to independent, self-employed athletes” — also provides grants for fertility treatments, including egg freezing and IVF.

It’s part of a wider trend: As women’s sports rise, there is an emphasis on meeting maternity and parental needs.




The WTA says 25 moms are active on tour; one, Tokyo Olympics gold medalist Belinda Bencic, won a title last month after returning from maternity leave in October.

More and more pros in tennis have returned to action after having children, including past No. 1-ranked players and Grand Slam title winners such as Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, Kim Clijsters, Caroline Wozniacki and Victoria Azarenka.

Azarenka — a member of the WTA Players’ Council, which Archer acknowledged played a key role in pushing for this fund — thinks these benefits will encourage lower-ranked or lower-earning athletes to take as much time off as they feel they need after becoming a parent, rather than worrying about losing out on income while not entering tournaments.

“That’s certainly one of the aims of the program: to provide the financial resources, the flexibility, the support, so that these athletes, regardless of where they’re ranked, but particularly those who earn less, will have that agency ... to decide when and how they want to start their families,” Archer said.

And, Azarenka said, this could lead some players to decide to become parents before retiring from the sport for good.

“Every feedback we’ve heard from players who are mothers — or who are not mothers — is like, ‘Wow, this is an incredible opportunity for us,’” said 2012 and ’13 Australian Open champion Azarenka, whose son, Leo, is 8. “I believe it’s really going to change the conversation in sports. But going beyond sports, it’s a global conversation, and I’m happy that we’re (part of it).”

Other steps the WTA has taken in recent years to benefit players include steering more women into coaching, implementing safeguarding, attempting to stem cyberbullying, and increasing prize money with an eye to pay that equals what men receive in the sport.

The Public Investment Fund, or PIF, became the WTA’s global partner last year, after much public debate — Hall of Famers Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova were among the critics — over questions about LGBTQ+ and women’s rights in Saudi Arabia.

The kingdom now hosts the season-ending WTA Finals and an ATP event for rising stars of men’s tennis. The PIF sponsors the WTA and ATP rankings.

“We wouldn’t have been able to provide the benefits were it not for this relationship and the funding that PIF provides,” Archer said.

In golf, which like tennis is an individual sport without guaranteed salaries, the LPGA introduced an updated maternity leave policy in 2019 that lets athletes have the same playing status when they return.

In soccer, both the NWSL and the U.S. women’s national team have collective bargaining agreements that allow for pregnancy leave and parental leave; the NWSL pays the full base salary while an athlete is pregnant.

In basketball, the WNBA’s CBA guarantees full pay during maternity leave.

For tennis, Azarenka said, the PIF WTA Maternity Fund Program is “just the beginning.”

“It’s an incredible beginning. Monumental change,” she said. “But I think we can look into how we can expand this fund for bigger, better things.”

Victoria Azarenka described the WTA's maternity fund as ""a meaningful shift in how we support women in tennis""

Female tennis players will receive paid maternity leave on the WTA Tour for the first time.

More than 320 players will be eligible for up to 12 months paid leave through a new maternity fund introduced by governing body, the Women's Tennis Association.

Everyone will receive the same amount, which has not been disclosed, irrespective of their ranking. And players will not have to repay the money if they later choose not to return to the sport.

Grants will also be made available for fertility treatment.

The maternity programme will be fully funded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is a global partner of the WTA Tour.  

Petra Kvitova and Belinda Bencic have both made their comeback from maternity leave in recent months.

Former world number one Victoria Azarenka, who gave birth to son Leo in 2016, told the BBC last year that it would be a ""huge win for women in general"" if the WTA was to introduce maternity pay.

Four-time major champion Naomi Osaka also spoke in support of maternity pay, saying it would be ""life-changing"".

""It's actually quite novel in a lot of ways,"" the WTA chief executive Portia Archer told BBC Sport.

""In women's professional sports, particularly sports where athletes are self-employed, this has never been something that has been provided.

""I think it will provide opportunities for our athletes to have [some] agency around when and how they choose to start or continue to build their families.

""It's available to players regardless of their ranking. Those who earn less will find this benefit particularly valuable.""

Players will have to compete in a minimum of eight WTA events in the previous 12 months (or a minimum of 24 in the previous 36 months) to be eligible.

Returning to the tour after maternity leave has become easier since the WTA changed the rules before the 2019 season.

New mothers are now be able to use their previous ranking to enter 12 tournaments over a three-year period from the birth of their child.

Since 2019, returning mothers with a special ranking high enough to be seeded have also had a guarantee they will not face a seeded player in the opening round of their first eight tournaments.

A seeding allows tournaments to ensure the world's best players do not meet in the early stages of competitions and instead play lower-ranked players in the opening rounds.

The WTA says 50 players have benefitted from the special ranking since it was introduced six years ago.

The WTA also offers access to a health team and taskforce, which includes physical assessments, mental health support and guidance on a staged return to play for new mothers and pregnant players.

A university tennis club has donated a ""big bag"" of used balls to a dog rehoming centre.

Ruby Pummell and Ed Ingles from the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich served-up the treat to the Dogs Trust in Snetterton.

The club said it was part of a drive to be more sustainable.

The Dogs Trust said its furry residents were having an ace time playing with their new toys.

""Donations like these are always greatly appreciated,"" the centre manager, Kelly Smith, said.

""Small comforts like tennis balls to play around with help us care for, entertain and engage with the dogs waiting for their forever homes.""

Tennis player, Ruby Pummell, who studies marketing and management at the UEA, said being a large club they go through balls ""very quickly"".

""We thought that by donating the balls to the Dogs Trust, not only would the balls be repurposed and gain a new lease of life, but we could also help them to save money on resources and give the dogs something new to play with,"" she added.

According to the United Nations, about 330 million tennis balls worldwide end up in landfill each year.

It is claimed they can take more than 400 years to decompose.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Kyrgios retires in Indian Wells return,https://www.atptour.com/en/news/kyrgios-indian-wells-2025-retire,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 03:43:29 GMT","

Nick Kyrgios retired from his first-round match at the BNP Paribas Open on Thursday, sending Botic van de Zandschulp through to the next round. The Dutchman led 7-6(7), 3-0 when Kyrgios could not continue due to a right wrist injury.


Van de Zandschulp will next meet five-time Indian Wells champion Novak Djokovic.

""I wasn't too confident that I was going to be able to play today, to be honest,"" Kyrgios said in his post-match press conference. ""Two days ago in practice I had to stop my practice because I felt pain in my wrist. I felt like it was okay to take the court. Just got progressively worse... started feeling sharp pain in my wrist.""


Kyrgios was making his sixth Indian Wells appearance and aiming for his first tour-level win since 2022 Tokyo. The 29-year-old, who held a set point in the opening-set tie-break, left the court visibly frustrated that he was unable to perform at his best level in the California desert. Kyrgios played with athletic tape wrapped around his right wrist, often flexing that area and grimacing in pain.

 

Explaining his emotional on-court reaction to the injury, Kyrgios said: “I guess this process has been probably one of the biggest challenges I've faced in my life. Reality, it's not too bad, but for my tennis career, it's by far the biggest. Just the amount of work that goes in when I go back home or when I'm not playing, it's not fun. I know that I can't really be doing any more to try and get back and play.

 “I guess it's just the amount of work I put in and I'm still having so much discomfort in my wrist. That's I guess why I got a bit emotional towards the end because it's one of my favourite tournaments. 

 “After Australian Open, all I did was rehab, train, and then try and get ready for this tournament. I was two days out of the tournament here and I was having a great training session, and literally the second-to-last point in my training session I hit a forehand, I felt a sharp pain, and I had to stop playing. 

 “We go back to the drawing board as a team, and we just try and figure out and navigate a way to just get through these matches. I would have loved to be able to finish that match even if I lose just as a building block, to say, okay, I went out there and was competing with a very good player, and I had chances and set points and breakpoints. So it's like these building blocks, but now if I'm not finishing matches that becomes a concern.” 

A two-time quarter-finalist in Indian Wells, Kyrgios underwent wrist surgery in September 2023. Excruciating pain made it difficult for him to do simple things like turn a doorknob or open a car door. An MRI showed a full rupture of the scapholunate ligament, which provides important stablisation for the wrist, similar to the role played by the ACL in the knee.



The former No. 13 player in the PIF ATP Rankings played just one match in 2023 and after 18 months from that outing, he opened this season by competing in Brisbane and at the Australian Open, falling short in both appearances.

Van de Zandschulp lost in Indian Wells qualifiying before receiving a lucky loser spot in the main draw. He will look to earn his first Lexus ATP Head2Head win against the 99-time tour-level titlist Djokovic, who claimed their lone meeting in 2022 (Astana).

Play has been suspended in all five evening matches in the BNP Paribas Open after rain started to fall for a second time Thursday evening.

Play was briefly stopped the first time in four of the five matches after rain started falling around 8:20 p.m. Thursday on the second day of main draw competition for men and women.

On Stadium 2, only a few sprinkles were falling so the match between Mariano Navone and 19-year-old American Learner Tien continued. Tien lost the first set 7-5.

After a 15-minute delay, action resumed on all courts.

But the rain returned around 8:45 p.m., and players on all five courts returned to the locker rooms.

Matches began at 11 a.m. Thursday under a mix of sun, clouds and gusty wind, but as the afternoon wore on the clouds looked more threatening.

A total of 33 singles matches and seven doubles matches were scheduled for Thursday. Thirty-four matches had already been completed, including one that carried over from late Wednesday because of rain.

The weather forecast calls for a 30% chance of showers continuing Thursday evening.

Sunshine is expected to return Friday and temperatures are expected to rise into the 70s on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.

Should Nike bring back the OG Hyperdunk?

This post contains references to products from one or more of our advertisers. We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.

One of the most iconic Nike Hyperdunk colorways of all time has returned… but on a tennis shoe. The Hyperdunk-inspired Vapor 12 Hypersmash just released in “United We Rise” makeup tributing the OG colorway Kobe Bryant made famous during the Beijing Olympics.

Those who watched the “Redeem Team” win gold need little overview, but to the uninitiated; the Hyperdunk was simply the shoe of the 2008 games. The Swoosh made Kobe Bryant the face of the model, and basically every Nike-sponsored country wore it throughout the Olympics. Designed by Eric Avar, it was the first shoe to feature Flywire tech and Lunarlon cushioning, thus creating a blueprint for Nike Basketball models for years to come.

Following a 2016 retro, the “United We Rise” colorway is stepping back into the spotlight through a Hyperdunk-inspired tennis model. The Vapor 12 Hypersmash tributes the iconic hoops shoe with Flywire cables and a similar TPU heel badge, taken with patriotic red, white, and blue in all the right places. Many hoopers have been clamoring for a Hyperdunk retro run, but this is probably the closest we’re getting (for now).

The Vapor 12 Hypersmash “United We Rise” is available now via the Nike website, commanding a $180 retail price. See official images below if you’re moved to cop some late 2000s nostalgia.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Indian Wells: Emma Raducanu loses in first WTA match since stalking incident in Dubai,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/ckgnjwgwjyzo,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 23:30:10 GMT","

Emma Raducanu has won only one of her past six WTA Tour matches

Emma Raducanu struggled in a testing Indian Wells wind as she was beaten on her first appearance since being targeted by a stalker during a match.

The 22-year-old Briton was unsure if she was going to even play in the California tournament following the incident at the Dubai Tennis Championships on 18 February, where she spotted a man who she had reported for what WTA officials described as ""exhibiting fixated behaviour"".

After deliberating whether to take an extended break from the WTA Tour, Raducanu decided to make the journey to Indian Wells - one of the biggest events outside of the four majors.

However, the world number 55 was out of sorts as she lost 6-3 6-2 to Japan's Moyuka Uchijima in the first round of the BNP Paribas Open.

""I didn't feel anxious about any of the scenarios that have happened recently,"" Raducanu told BBC Sport.

""I think I had a good preparation with good people around.""

Raducanu, who has been given increased security at the WTA event in California, walked on court with a solemn expression and glanced several times around the vast arena.

Throughout the match she showed little emotion and, unsurprisingly given the defeat, quickly left with a despondent look.

Later, speaking in her post-match news conference, she added: ""I didn't have what happened in Dubai in my head at all today.

""I think today was just a bit of a curveball. I guess it's just nice, I'm just going to move on.""

In tricky conditions created by a brisk wind in the Californian desert, Raducanu looked uncomfortable throughout as Uchijima adapted impressively.

The 2021 US Open champion made a host of errors to allow Uchijima, a tenacious opponent who continued to put balls back into court, to come out on top of the often scrappy rallies.

Raducanu faced break points in her opening six service games, a result of the pressure created by a lack of accuracy as she looked to be aggressive.

Five of those games ended in Raducanu losing serve as she trailed by a set and a break to the 52nd-ranked Uchijima.

The Briton cut a subdued figure after she could not convert any of three chances to break back for 3-3.

After Uchijima dug deep to hold, Raducanu did not win another point and trudged off court having lost for a sixth time in her nine matches this year.

Raducanu was watched from the stands by Slovakian coach Vladimir Platenik, who has linked up with the British number two on a trial basis.

Platenik, 49, was coaching New Zealand qualifier Lulu Sun when she beat Raducanu at Wimbledon last year, while he has also worked with top-10 players Dominika Cibulkova, Daria Kasatkina and Veronika Kudermetova.

When asked which areas of her game she wanted to work on with Platenik, Raducanu smiled and said ""everything"".

""I'll need to improve starting the point. That's a big part of tennis. I can do that a lot better,"" she added.

""I could improve being more aggressive and having a better quality of shot going forward into the court.

""I could improve every area of my game after today's performance.""

Shortly after Raducanu's exit, British number three Sonay Kartal did move into the second round, making the most of being given a 'lucky loser' spot having been beaten in qualifying.

Kartal, 23, won 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 against 38-year-old American qualifier Varvara Lepchenko and faces Brazilian 16th seed Beatriz Haddad Maia next.

In the men's draw, Jacob Fearnley was unable to set up an all-British clash with Jack Draper after losing to rising star Joao Fonseca.

Britain's Emma Raducanu was defeated in straight sets by Japan's Moyuka Uchijima in her first-round match at Indian Wells on Thursday.

It was Raducanu's first appearance since she was the target of ""fixated behaviour"" from a man during the Dubai Championships in February, with the man subsequently banned from all future WTA events ""pending a threat assessment"" and given a restraining order.

Having admitted prior to the event that she was unsure if she would complete at Indian Wells, Raducanu lost 3-6 2-6 to Uchijima as the pair battled through strong winds in the desert but the Brit ultimately was unable to put up a fight against her in-form opponent.

It is also the first time she teamed up with new coach Vladimir Platenik, after Nick Cavaday stood down for health reasons following the Australian Open, where Raducanu was heavily beaten by five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek in the third round.

However, Raducanu was unable to master the hot and windy conditions of the desert with Uchijima claiming four games in a row to take the first set 6-3.

The second set followed a similar tale, and after Raducanu was broken in the first game she was unable to gather momentum in her favour or challenge Uchijima's serve amid a lot of unforced errors.

Uchijima held her serve and won crucial points to inch slowly towards victory before ending the match with a hold to love for a 6-3 6-2 victory.

Uchijima will face USA's Coco Gauff in the next round, while Raducanu heads to prepare for the Miami Open.

Britain's Jacob Fearnley fell to a 2-6 6-1 3-6 defeat to Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca at Indian Wells.

World No 80 Fonseca rallied from a break down in the third set to beat the Brit during his tournament debut.

Fearnley was unable to find his rhythm during the opening set with Fonseca easing through, but the 23-year-old made a comeback in the second set to send the match to a decider.

Fearnley, who is ranked one spot below Fonseca, raced to a 3-1 lead in the third set before his Brazilian opponent took the final five points to book his place in the following round where he will meet another Brit, 13th seed Jack Draper.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Undercooked Emma Raducanu gone with the wind after first-round defeat at blustery Indian Wells,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2025/03/06/emma-raducanu-vs-moyuka-uchijima-live-score-indian-wells/,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 23:29:00 GMT","

Emma Raducanu admitted that she needs to improve every aspect of her game, after extending her dismal series of results with a 6-3, 6-2 defeat at the hands of unheralded Japanese player Moyuka Uchijima.

In all her interviews this week, Raducanu has insisted that her late call to fly out to Indian Wells had helped to put the recent stalking incident in Dubai behind her. But while this felt like the right decision on a personal level, it didn’t lend itself to great tennis.

Coming in undercooked, Raducanu arrived on court with strapping underneath her left knee, suggesting that there might be some physical issues to deal with as well as the understandable rustiness.

And once the umpire had called “play”, she failed to establish any rhythm or confidence in front of her new coach Vlado Platenik, who himself had only arrived in time to fit in one practice session on the eve of the match.

In terms of both scoreline and ball-striking quality, this was Raducanu’s weakest performance since she left Melbourne in mid-January. It extended a wretched sequence of six defeats in seven matches, starting with a 6-1, 6-0 humbling at the hands of Iga Swiatek in the third round of the Australian Open.

We should note, however, that there were extenuating circumstances. Unsurprisingly, Raducanu had felt the need for a week’s complete break from tennis after what happened in Dubai. She only arrived in California last Thursday evening, and has been playing catch-up ever since.

It’s also worth mentioning the gusty, powerful wind. It sent tumbleweed rolling along the boulevards of nearby Palm Spring, and made it extremely difficult for Raducanu to locate the centre of her strings. If Uchijima dealt with the conditions better, that owes something to the heavy topspin she applies with her forehand, making the ball cut through the breeze.

“I didn’t have what happened in Dubai in my head at all today,” said Raducanu. “If anything, [I had] a bit of a lack of preparation on the tennis court, playing someone who played pretty good in these conditions, I mean, [it was] extremely awkward in the wind here. Today was just a bit of a curveball.”

Asked what she needed to work on after her latest chastening defeat, Raducanu replied: “Being more aggressive and … going forward into the court more. I think I could improve every area of my game, to be honest.”

As someone who spent her childhood on British indoor courts, and still does a high proportion of her training under the roof of the National Tennis Centre in south–west London, Raducanu has never liked playing in the wind.

Her serve was completely undermined, coughing up four double-faults and five breaks in all. Sitting at courtside, Platenik called out plenty of advice in the first set, encouraging Raducanu to use her legs and apply more spin to the ball. As the match wore on, though, he grew quieter.

A highly-rated coach who has worked with former top-tenners Dominika Cibulkova and Daria Kasatkina, Platenik now has a challenging task in front of him. He has always liked the idea of working with Raducanu, believing that she has enormous potential. After the recent slump in results, this would be the perfect time to prove it.

“We haven’t necessarily done that much yet, because he arrived very, very recently,” said Raducanu, when asked about their partnership. It has initially been set up as a two-and-a-half-month trial, starting here and running at least until the start of the French Open in late May.

As for their first practice session together, Raducanu added: “It was the day before the match, where we don’t necessarily want to change anything. So we haven’t actually started proper work. He’s very serious, he’s very professional, gets on with it. So yeah, we’ll see how it goes.”

Beginning this season in high spirits after the appointment of sought-after fitness trainer Yukata Nakamura, Raducanu had made a promising run at the Australian Open, chiselling out creditable wins against a pair of talented players in Ekaterina Alexandrova and Amanda Anisimova.

But then came the hammer blow of losing her coach Nick Cavaday, whom she had worked with as an emerging pre-teen at the Bromley Tennis Centre and trusted implicitly. Cavaday’s chronic health problems meant that he was forced to step off the tour, and she has lost all momentum since then.

“A lot has happened since Australia,” said Raducanu, who is likely to be ranked just inside the world’s top 60 as she goes into the next big American tournament in Miami in a fortnight’s time. “It’s good that I have someone [Platenik] who is very experienced here. We’ll see how the work goes and how we get on on and off the court and the methods and everything. I think I just need to keep trying to put one foot in front of the other and not look back too much.”

In this match, Raducanu scored an early break to move to 2-0 up, but then began to bleed unforced errors like a tennis haemophiliac. By the time she recovered any kind of poise, she was 6-3, 2-0 down, and Uchijima was playing with real self-assurance.

There was a moment in the second set where Raducanu forced three break points, thus threatening to regain parity at 3-3. But Uchijima saved all three through judicious use of that heavy forehand, and then powered on to claim the win in just 83 minutes.

Raducanu was the second Briton in succession to suffer defeat on the main court at Indian Wells. Immediately before her, Jacob Fearnley had found himself in the firing line against Joao Fonseca, the Brazilian teenager who is tipped to be tennis’s next big thing.

Here was a wildly undulating contest that matched the swirling, gusting nature of the desert wind. Play had to be paused a couple of times. The first because Fonseca’s towel had blown onto the court, the second when his hat was plucked off his head. On another occasion, he misread the swerving flight of the ball so badly that he could not decide whether to hit a forehand or backhand, and eventually watched it fly past him without offering a shot.

Never mind: Fonseca still had the goods when he needed them, powering through to victory by a 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 scoreline. As he stepped up to the microphone, the on-court MC made sure everyone knew they were looking at a future star. “We remember Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic making their debuts on this court,” said the announcer. No pressure then!

Both these men are at the start of their professional careers, and they stand next to each other on the rankings ladder at Nos 80 and 81. But there the comparisons end.

Fearnley is already 23 – having spent three years developing his game at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth – while Fonseca only turned 18 last August. His rapid ascent has been accelerated by a first ATP title in Rio last month.

Since the start of this century, only three men have opened their trophy accounts at a younger age: Kei Nishikori, Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz. They all went on to become grand-slam finalists.

Emma Raducanu has not confirmed what her next tournament will be, but she has earned direct entry into the Miami Open (March 16-30) and it seems likely she will play there.

It offers another chance to get her season back on track; after that defeat, she has only won one of her last seven matches.

British hopes at Indian Wells predominantly rest with Jack Draper, who will face super-talent Joao Fonseca in the second round.

That’s it from me, thanks for reading.

42.3 - Since the format's introduction in 2009, Emma Raducanu (42.3%, 11-15) now holds the lowest win rate among former Grand Slam winners at WTA-1000 events, now below Francesca Schiavone (42.4%, 42-57). Grapple.#TennisParadise | @BNPPARIBASOPEN @WTA @WTA_insider pic.twitter.com/R0T6T1EiIh

Uchijima raises her arms in victory and bows to the spectators after shaking Raducanu’s hand at the net. She adapted much better to the blustery conditions and constantly put her opponent’s serve under pressure. The 23-year-old will play Coco Gauff in round two.

The Briton walks quickly off court. The match did not go the way she wanted, littered with errors, but she will be happy to get through match incident-free, given the Dubai stalker ordeal, and get some more time and distance from that.

Frustration writ large in Raducanu’s body language. She slashes at a forehand, with impatient power, and hits it into the net for 0-15, and another booming Uchijima forehand takes her to within two points of victory.

A backhand return flies out and it’s three match points. Uchijima only needs one as Raducanu hits the ball high and long.

Uchijima is not missing and Raducanu is broken to love, losing her service game again with a double fault.

The tall Japanese player will serve for the match. She has proven very hard to pass and made far fewer errors.

Raducanu adjusts her body excellently to an awkward sliced forehand in the wind to bring up 30-30.

She pumps her fist and shouts “come on” as a flurry of forehands ends with Uchijima blinking first and sending the ball long. However, she does not make the same error again, saving break point down the line after working Raducanu around the court.

Two more break point chances for Raducanu go begging in this long game of deuces, saved by big serves and redoubtable forehands. 

Raducanu was making the running in the final point, but her opponent doggedly ran for balls, making her play that extra shot, and she dumped her forehand volley into the net.

That might well have been Raducanu’s big chance to get back into this match.

Some pounding first serves in there and a well-placed forehand down the line put Raducanu in the ascendancy.

However, Uchijima is not missing much and has terrific feel to slice a drop shot over for deuce. 

A few unforced errors then give the game to Raducanu. The Briton has had to work for every single service game, but at least she did not have to save a break point this time.

Raducanu follows up an unforced error with a fierce, fine forehand, finding the angle too. However, Uchijima delivers a clutch ace to go 40-30 and she sees out the game with another backhand sailing wide from her opponent.

A welcome hold there for Raducanu, but she has still lost eight of the last ten games. We should probably note that she does spend a lot of time practising indoors, and has never liked playing in the wind. 

On several occasions she has tried to slide the ball out wide to the Uchijima forehand and failed to account for the crosswind taking it even further. Credit to Uchijima for her level, though, which has stayed impressively steady in the circumstances. 

An important, gutsy hold for Raducanu. Her first serve accuracy helped to get her out of jail, saving a break point at 30-40 as her opponent netted. 

To win the game, she forced Uchijima out wide, moved her into the middle then dished up a fizzing forehand winner. More of that power and precision would not go amiss.

The wind is visibly blowing the ball at times. Uchijima has to correct her ball toss.

Raducanu cannot take advantage of a few Uchijima second serves to pressurise her. She gets it to 40-30 with a belting backhand, which the scrambling Japanese cannot return, then wrongfoots her with tenacious net play to bring up a rare deuce.

However, the better-ranked player is hard to hit past, timing her striking better and finding the right spots. She wins the game with a perfectly-placed forehand into the deuce court corner, moving tantalisingly away from Raducanu’s racket.

 

Over 20 unforced errors in that first set for Raducanu, despite a 79% first serve percentage. That rather sums it up.

No luck for Raducanu today yet either as an Uchijima forehand pings off the net cord and goes straight down next to it for 15-30. Her opponent is finding the corners far better with ground strokes and making the running, moving Raducanu around.

Raducanu saves one break point with a deft backhand passing shot which scrapes her opponent’s racket, but a double fault gifts the opening game of the second set to Moyuka Uchijima.

Uchijima held it together better in horrible conditions: that’s the story of the first set. Raducanu’s serve didn’t stand up to the wind at all, which was blowing an absolute hoolie when she hit a crucial double-fault at 3-4, 30-30. She came back from 15-40 to hold on her first attempt, and then was broken three successive times.

A delicious backhand passing shot from Raducanu down the line to bring up 0-30 as Uchijima rushed the net. She had to get that through the eye of the needle to win the point, accuracy-wise, as the Japanese player covered the rest of the court.

However, her opponent digs in, levels up the game and sends her sprinting across court, left and right, to bring up a set point. Raducanu blows out her cheeks in frustration.

She thumps a backhand too hard in the tricky conditions and the first set goes to Uchijima.

Playing with new balls, Raducanu points out an item that has blown onto court at 30-30. It does nothing to help her focus, as she subsequently delivers her first double fault of the match to offer another break point.

Uchijima exploits a short forehand from the Briton to win the game, delivering a stinging clean winner back. There have not been many of those.

Platenik wants more spin and more patience from Raducanu who lost four straight games in a welter of unforced errors. She managed to find the centre of her strings in the next game, whereupon Uchijima suddenly delivered four straight easy misses. 

It’s not a day for pretty tennis here. I feel like the end to the umpire’s left is windier.

Just like that, she stops the rot. Uchijima has lost her range and Raducanu breaks her to love. 

Some fine depth on her shots in that game though, putting her adversary under sustained pressure.

Best shot of the match so far to bring up 15-15. Uchijima shows her impressive work-rate, chasing every ball, but Raducanu moves her around and fires a double-handed backhand across court into the corner.

However, the Japanese seems to have found her rhythm, despite the Briton’s unerring first-serve rate. A clean forehand strike brings up a break point at 30-40 and Raducanu sprays a backhand wide.

That is four games in a row for Uchijima. Alarm bells.

Two poor games from Raducanu there, but it’s not easy to play in the blustery and inconsistent wind that’s whipping up tumbleweed around the Californian desert today. There’s a lot of late movement in the ball-flight and we’re not seeing much clean striking right now. 

The unforced error count is ticking up for Raducanu, hitting a few balls into the doubles tramline to help Uchijima take the lead for the first time in the match.

Conditions have not improved, with that desert wind blowing hard and ruffling the players’ clothes.

Another ace helps Raducanu to 15-30 and back into the game, but a few balls deposited lamely into the net bring up two break points for Uchijima.

She comes to the net sharply to save one, moving well to place a backhand volley into open court. However, Uchijima wallops a couple of forehands to send the Briton scrambling to reach the ball before breaking back with an unanswered one. We’re back on serve.

I’m sitting almost next to Vlado Platenik, Raducanu’s new coach. He’s keeping up a constant stream of advice and encouragement: “Use your legs. Stay aggressive. Don’t jump [on the forehand].” 

She is looking to him regularly, reflecting the fact that they know each other from her teenage years. “Very slow!” she said, in relation to the court speed.

Uchijima is struggling to get her first serve in, but she gets off the mark, helped by several wide balls from Raducanu. The Briton has a sizeable plaster on her left knee, by the way, wonder whether she had a tumble in training.

A resilient hold from Raducanu, saving two break points at 15-40. She banged down an ace, then moved her opponent around behind the baseline, forcing an error out of her.

That was all about first serve reliability too; I think she only failed to get one in. 

Shot of the game was a sliced forehand return from Uchijima to bring up 15-30. The Japanese player is already showing she can find some devilish angles. 

It is important to get into the groove early and get to grips with the windy conditions. Raducanu won the coin toss and chose to receive.

On this evidence, it was wise as the Briton breaks her opponents off the bat. After exchanging unforced errors into the net, Uchijima chalked up the match’s first double fault then dumped another into the net. Raducanu hit a powerful backhand volley to take the opener.

 

After a few minutes of warming up, here we go. The match is underway.

“The first US Open win in New York was pretty epic. Ever since, I’ve had an amazing fanbase in America and I love it here. Everything is so easy, relaxed, spacious.”

""It's my favourite tournament outside of the slams"" 😅Emma Raducanu is loving being at Indian Wells 🌴 pic.twitter.com/BkJSyuhtdV

Raducanu, with white Nike visor on, keeps her head down as she strides on before putting her racket bag down at her seat.

They are playing on the primary showcourt at Indian Wells, framed by the Santa Rosa Mountains, though it is far from packed to its 16,100-capacity.

A win this afternoon would help Raducanu to turn the page a little quicker, given her sinister experience at her most recent tournament.

On Tuesday, Raducanu spoke to press about the “fixated” spectator who disrupted her match against Karolina Muchova at the Dubai Championships a fortnight ago.

“I was obviously very distraught,” said Raducanu, who has extra guards with her during this week’s event in California. “I saw him first game of the match, and I was like, ‘I don’t know how I’m gonna finish’.

“I was playing Karolina, who’s top 17 in the world or something. I’m like, ‘I literally need to just take a breather here,’ and then the first four games kind of ran away from me. I was not on the court, to be honest, and I’m not really sure how I regrouped.

“I think that was a pretty good effort for me to carry on playing in that match, in that scenario. I finished the match [which she lost by a narrow 7-6, 6-4 scoreline], and I even had chances in the first set, but, yeah, it was a very emotional time. And after the match, I did break down in tears, but not necessarily because I lost.

“It was more because there was just so much emotion in the last few weeks of events. I needed a week off to take a breather and come here and I feel a lot better.”

You can see a timeline of the ordeal and read more of her reflections here.

18-year-old tennis whizz kid Joao Fonseca sees off Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3, which means Emma Raducanu and Moyuka Uchijima will be on court within the next 20 minutes or so.

A reminder: Emma Raducanu will be on court after the conclusion of another first round match between Jacob Fearnley and Joao Fonseca, which is in its dying embers.

It has been a nip-tuck tussle. After a six-minute game, Fonseca broke the Briton and is a game away from victory. He leads 5-3. Fearnley may well rue a couple of double faults and a volley he should have put away.

Indian Wells may well be out in the desert, but the sun is not the problem this afternoon: it is only 19 degrees Celsius.

No, the wind is swirling around, blowing dust and sand around into the eyes of players and leading spectators to pull on a few layers if they are in the shade.

While Raducanu is favourite with the bookmakers, Moyuka Uchijima will pose a significant threat. She has just reached a career high no52 ranking and represented Japan at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. She won five ITF World Tour titles last year, helping her rise up the standfings.

Having come through qualifying, she knocked Jelena Ostapenko out in the first round at the Dubai Championships a fortnight ago before losing to Elena Rybakina. This one could be close.

It is little wonder Indian Wells is one of Raducanu’s favourite tournaments, given the relaxed atmosphere and pleasing, resort setting in the desert. 

She has performed well in the past at the BNP Paribas Open, not going out in the first round since the 2021 event. In the last two years, she has gone out to Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, respectively. No shame in that.

Meanwhile, after a mammoth fourth game of the second set, Great Britain’s Jacob Fearnley finally makes good his early break in the third set to go 3-1 up against Joao Fonseca. Raducanu and Uchijima are on after this match.

Fearnley has got quite the forehand.

There were happier times on court 48 hours ago for the 2021 US Open champion. She joined Ben Shelton to play at the Eisenhower Cup, a for-charity exhibition event on the eve of the tournament itself.

Taylor Fritz and Elena Rybakina won it.

Speaking about her stalker incident on Tuesday, Raducanu indicated she had received a couple of messages from fellow players.

The frightening thing is that the scary events in Dubai a fortnight ago are not particularly unusual. She is not alone.

“Each tennis player has been through something similar,” her compatriot Katie Boulter told reporters. “I’ve had people on site at WTA [tournaments] saying they were going to harm me. It can make you feel quite isolated and I don’t wish that upon anyone.”

WTA players regularly have to face misogny, toxic messages and threats on social media, sometimes linked to online betting. A very worrying state of affairs.

Raducanu will be on Court 1 after the end of the first round match match between her compatriot Jacob Fearnley and teenage hotshot Joao Fonseca.

That has just gone into a decider. The Brazilian wild card took the first 6-2, but Fearnley hit back 6-1. The man from Edinburgh has rocketed up the ATP rankings in the last twelve months and a good run here would put him on the cusp of the top 50.

Raducanu is also trialling a new coach, the Slovakian Vladimir Platenik, who she briefly worked with as a teenager. He has a sterling reputation, having helped Daria Kasatkina and Dominika Cibulkova into the top 25 in the world rankings.

If Platenik takes on the job, as many expect, he will become her seventh full-time appointment in three-and-a-half years. You can read more about his background here.

The Briton parted company with her previous coach Nick Cavaday in January, as he stepped down from his role amid health concerns.

Good evening and welcome to our live, minute-by-minute text coverage of the BNP Paribas Open first round tie between Emma Raducanu and Moyuka Uchijima.

Raducanu is looking to put the traumatic stalker incident behind her. She saw her stalker in the crowd at her most recent match in Dubai against Karolina Muchova, who had allegedly followed her around her last four countries and tournaments. It left her “distraught” and unsure of how she would be able to finish the match.

“I couldn’t see the ball through the tears, I could barely breathe,” she said on Tuesday, breaking her silence about the ordeal.

She halted the match at the end of the second game, and took refuge behind the umpire’s chair until the problematic individual – who is not a British citizen – was expelled from the stands. Her stalker was later released without charge by Dubai police, after signing a document that said he would stay away from her in the future.

Our own Simon Briggs heard her speak, candidly and at length about what happened and was struck by her poise amid an awful situation. He reckons it’s impossible to not feel sorry for her.

Raducanu took a breather back in the UK before flying off to California. Unsurprisingly, she has extra security with her at the tournament. “It’s amazing to feel protected, to feel safe,” she added.

The 22-year-old has only won one of her last six matches, but she has faced some high-class opposition and shown a marked improvement in her service reliability. The so-called “fifth slam”, Indian Wells is also a happy hunting ground, her favourite tournament of the year outside of the majors. However, she will have to deal with a wind whipping in from the desert on court.

World no 52 Uchijama sits six places ahead of Raducanu in the WTA rankings, but the Briton has won their only previous match on tour. Back in September 2022, she downed her 6-2, 6-4 in Seoul.

The winner tonight goes through to a box office second round match against Coco Gauff. They are expected on court no earlier than 9pm GMT.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Wimbledon champion announces break from tennis as 'struggling' star issues statement,https://www.express.co.uk/sport/tennis/2023536/Wimbledon-champion-shoulder-injury-Marketa-Vondrousova,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 14:40:00 GMT","



Marketa Vondrousova has announced she will take a prolonged break from professional tennis to rehabilitate a shoulder injury. The 2023 Wimbledon champion has struggled with injury since her remarkable triumph at SW19 and missed both the Paris Olympics and US Open last year with shoulder pain. She returned to the WTA Tour for the Adelaide International tournament in January but then retired midway through her second-round match.

The 25-year-old duly withdrew from the Australian Open before playing in Abu Dhabi the following month. However, she’s now taken to social media to tell fans that her comeback has been cut short. “Stepping out of the court again. I am still struggling with shoulder injury,” she wrote on Instagram. “Although it's not easy, I now have a few months of intensive training and rehabilitation to get my arm back together.

“Patience and time are my priorities right now, but I believe it will all be worth it. So, hopefully back on the court soon. Thank you everyone for your support.”

Vondrousova stunned the world at Wimbledon when she became the first unseeded woman to win the singles title. She prevailed 6-4 6-4 against sixth seed Ons Jabeur in what was considered a huge tournament upset.

She previously underlined her potential as a teenager, though, reaching the French Open final in 2019. There, she won just four games against Ashleigh Barty but ended the event widely touted as a future star.



However, it was after a first-round defeat in her title defence in London last summer that her shoulder problems seemingly began. Her layoffs have seen her drop down to 29th in the world, having previously reached a career-high of No.6.

The Czech star now seems almost certain to miss the French Open in May and will be a major doubt for Wimbledon. The grasscourt tournament gets underway on June 30.

Indian Wells, California – Playing in extreme wind is a rite of passage at the BNP Paribas Open. You don’t have to play in it every time around, but all the big names have dealt with it, and fought through the harsh reality that they’d have to find ways to win without feeling the ball in the way they prefer.



Such was the fate of BNP Paribas Open debutants Joao Fonseca and Jacob Fearnley on Thursday as the pair battled in squall conditions and conducted an entertaining – if ugly – tug-of-war that ended with a five-game run by the 18-year-old and a hard-fought 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 victory.

“First round of a Masters, windy, playing against a great guy,” Fonseca told reporters in the main interview room a few hours after the match. “So, I mean, it was difficult conditions, but I got through so I'm very happy the way that I fought today.”

For a while, it looked like he would not get through. Fearnley and his enormous forehand had turned the match on its ear. After a poor opening set the former Texan Christian University standout took charge of the run of play and dominated the second set.



Things stayed on track for him in the third set, but he few key mistakes would eventually lead to his undoing. A double-fault gave Fonseca the break back and three-all and he was off to the races after that. He broke again for 5-3 and served out the contest, sealing the win with a perfect backhand volley, to advance to the second round, where 13th-seeded Jack Draper waits.

Fonseca headed to the practice courts immediately after the win, hoping to regain his feel for the ball.

“The conditions were very difficult today, a lot of wind. So I was not feeling the ball very much because it was difficult to play. So it was just a cooldown.”

Fonseca is known for his gargantuan groundstrokes but he was actually outhit by Fearnley, who cracked 24 forehand winners on the day. Most important however, was the kid’s ability to downshift and make sure he kept his game clean down the stretch.

“After, it was just more of a mental game than both playing. I think he was playing better than me most of the time. But like I said, when it's windy, it's just a little mistake, and at this level it's just one point that can win you the match.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Iga Swiatek 'not ready to answer that question' and apologises to reporter,https://www.express.co.uk/sport/tennis/2023423/Iga-Swiatek-Indian-Wells-tennis-gambling-betting,"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 12:35:00 GMT","



World No.2 Iga Swiatek was reluctant to weigh in on the issue of gambling in tennis when put on the spot at Indian Wells. The Polish star is currently preparing for her last-64 clash with Caroline Garcia on Friday, having been handed a bye in the first round. Betting in professional sports is a growing phenomenon, with fans now able to place wagers online during live action.

However, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) currently bans professional tennis players from gambling on matches. This regulation includes conspiring to bet on outcomes or soliciting others to do so. Last year, six players were issued varying suspensions for their links to a match-fixing syndicate in Belgium. Speaking in her press conference at Indian Wells, Swiatek replied hesitantly when asked if the concept of gambling was good or bad for her sport, given the revenue it generated.

“Oh, I don't think I'm ready to answer that question because I never really thought about that much, because I always thought that this is how it is,” she said. “There's no point to think if it's good or bad, because it's always going to be there since it's big business.”

Concerns have been raised over disgruntled punters targeting players with online abuse after accusing them of costing them betting windfalls. And Swiatek, who in November was handed a one-month ban for producing a positive test for a banned substance, conceded there was little the authorities could do to prevent internet trolling.

“For sure, we as players feel the negative comments and hate, because people are sometimes losing money because we lose or because we win,” she added. So, this is what impacts us. For sure, I feel like it's not positive and not good at all.

“But, you know, hate is going to be out there on the Internet anyway. People put out on the Internet whatever they want, because it's easy. But the whole concept of gambling and business, you know, behind it, I'm not really that well-oriented to really say. Sorry.”

Madison Keys was also pressed on the issue this week. Keys has previously been vocal about the plagues of online abuse in tennis and, like Swiatek, thinks the issue is too complex to just label a positive or negative.

“I don't think it's a black-and-white answer, just because I think it depends on who you're asking,” she said. “At the end of the day a lot of the tournaments make a lot of money from the partnerships that they have with betting companies. That's what keeps us having jobs.”

 By: OU Athletics Communications

NORMAN – The No. 14 Oklahoma women's tennis team returns to the Headington Family Tennis Center for its first ever SEC home matches this weekend, beginning with No. 69 Missouri on Friday before hosting No. 16 Vanderbilt on Sunday.   

The Sooners' 2025 matches at the Headington Family Tennis Center will be open to the public and free of charge. Oklahoma follows a clear bag policy.   

First serve against the Tigers is set for 5 p.m. CT on Friday. Fans can keep up with the action through live stats or by watching on PlaySight. 

Sunday's match against the Commodores is scheduled for 1 p.m. CT. The contest can be followed through live stats and live video. 

Ace shirts, posters, roster cards and yell sheets will be provided to fans entering the tennis facility until supplies last for both matches. Free bagels will also be available on Sunday.  

Oklahoma suffered a 6-1 loss to No. 5 Texas A&M on Sunday afternoon at the Mitchell Tennis Center. 
 
Sunday marked the second matchup of the season between the programs as OU met the defending national champions in the semifinals of ITA National Indoors on Feb. 10, which saw A&M sneak away with a 4-2 win. 
 
Oklahoma's lone win in singles came from freshman Gloriana Nahum. On court six, Nahum capped a 2-0 weekend with a 7-6(2), 6-0 win against Lizanne Boyer. It was the seventh straight-set victory for the Cotonou, Benin, native. 

Oklahoma currently sits at No. 14 in the ITA team rankings. The squad reached a season-high ranking of No. 3 on Feb. 12, their best ranking since being tabbed No. 2 during the 2022 campaign which remains the highest ranking in program history. OU's impressive resume includes three ranked wins over top-15 opponents.   

Additionally, the Sooners have four players in the ITA singles rankings. Leading the pack is No. 17 Julia Garcia Ruiz, followed by No. 34 Alina Shcherbinina, No. 74 Emma Staker and No. 98 Gloriana Nahum.  
 
In doubles, OU is represented by No. 63 Shcherbinina and Cara Mester, followed by No. 66 Garcia Ruiz and Chloé Noël, and No. 76 Mester and Emma Ghirardato.   

Oklahoma's Gloriana Nahum has played a pivotal role in the Sooners' success this season. The freshman from Cotonou, Benin, went 2-0 in singles during OU's road trip last week at No. 11 Texas and No. 5 Texas A&M. Splitting time between Nos. 5 and 6 singles, Nahum boasts a 7-1 dual record, with all her victories coming in straight sets. 

In doubles, Nahum leads the team with a 7-2 record this spring and has primarily teamed up with Salakthip Ounmuang at the third court to form one of the nation's top all-freshman doubles teams.  

The Sooners return to the Headington Family Tennis Center on Friday for their first home match since Feb. 4.  

Seven of OU's nine matchups against conference opponents ranked within the top 25 of the ITA team rankings are on the road, making the Sooners' slate one of the toughest in the country in their inaugural SEC season. 

No. 69 Missouri (10-3, 1-2 SEC) enters Friday's match coming off their highest ranked win of the season against No. 55 Mississippi State, 4-3. The Tigers are led by freshman Gian Octa with a 7-3 mark in singles. Octa, a former U18 Indoor and Outdoor Ontario Provincial Singles and Doubles Champion, was ranked in the top 10 in the Canadian Junior National Rankings (U12-U18) and finished third at the 2022 U18 Fischer Outdoor Canadian Junior Nationals. Complimenting Octa at the top of the lineup for Mizzou with six wins each are senior Inah Canete and junior Andrea Artimedi. 

Friday's match will be the 31st meeting between the Sooners and Tiers with the two sides first squaring off in 1982. Oklahoma leads the all-time series 28-2.  

No. 16 Vanderbilt (10-1, 3-0 SEC) enters Sunday's match with its lone loss coming in an ITA Kickoff Weekend semifinal against UC Santa Barbara, 1-4. No. 119 Valeria Ray leads the team in singles with an unblemished 9-0 record. Accompanying Ray in the ITA singles rankings are No. 35 Bridget Stammel and No. 44 Celia Belle-Mohr. In doubles, Belle-Mohr partners with Sophia Webster as the ninth-ranked duo in the country. The tandem holds an undefeated dual record at 4-0 and reached the Round of 16 at the NCAA Championships in the fall. 

Sunday's match will be the fourth meeting between the Sooners and Commodores with inaugural showdown coming in 1993. Vanderbilt leads the all-time series 2-1.  

The Sooners will continue conference action at home against No. 58 Kentucky on Friday, March 14. First serve against the Wildcats is set for 5 p.m. CT at the Headington Family Tennis Center. Pink mugs, posters and roster cards will be available to fans for free until supplies last.

It all came down to courts five and two. Ultimately, Benjamin Martin clinched the match for Ole Miss on court five over Alabama's student-athlete. Despite dropping his first set, Martin stayed competitive and earned a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 comeback to clinch the 4-3 victory over the No. 21 Crimson Tide.
