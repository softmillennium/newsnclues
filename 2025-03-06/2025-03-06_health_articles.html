Rep. Lindsey LaPointe (D-Chicago) spoke with reporters during a press conference in Springfield on March 6, 2025.



SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WAND) — A bill moving in Springfield could significantly improve access to mental health and substance use treatment.

Democrats and Republicans are pushing for a plan to require health insurance companies to cover medically-necessary out-of-network behavioral healthcare treatments as if they are in-network.

The proposal could also set minimum reimbursement rates for providers to properly compensate them for their services and encourage more specialists to join insurance networks.

"You deserve this. You had long deserved this," Rep. Lindsey LaPointe (D-Chicago) said Thursday. "Behavioral healthcare is healthcare. We shouldn't treat it like some other, and it's just unacceptable for us to reimburse it at far lower rates."

Sponsors said people already paying costly insurance premiums should be able to access the care outlined in their benefits instead of racking up debt for mental health services. 

House Bill 1085 passed out of the House Mental Health and Addiction Committee on a bipartisan 17-5 vote Thursday. The legislation currently has over 40 co-sponsors, and representatives could see the bill on the House floor as early as Tuesday. 

Identical legislation, Senate Bill 55, is also gaining significant support in the Senate. The proposal currently has nearly 30 co-sponsors. Sen. Karina Villa (D-West Chicago) told reporters she is committed to getting the plan passed out of both chambers this spring. As a former school social worker, Villa said this fight is personal.

"You have done nothing wrong. You have paid your premiums, and you deserve for your child to be able to go in and get help when they need it," Villa said. "This bill is the most important bill regarding mental health that we can make sure to get across the finish line."

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers was in Chippewa Falls Thursday speaking with community leaders about healthcare in the Chippewa Valley.

CHIPPEWA FALLS (WQOW) - Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers was in Chippewa Falls Thursday speaking with community leaders about healthcare in the Chippewa Valley.

Evers met with local healthcare representatives, mental healthcare workers, and other community members this afternoon to discuss the plans outlined in his proposed budget to support healthcare in rural communities and bring down costs.

Evers said that funding would be critical for area hospitals if the federal government cuts Medicaid funding.

"If they do to Medicaid what everybody fears, that's going to make it more difficult for everybody, whether you're in the hospitals that are open now or not. They're not going to be able to pay the bills," he said.

Evers' budget proposal will still have to go through the Republican controlled state legislature before any of that funding can be approved.

A story of determination, strength and generosity - all from a 12-year-old girl.

Arielle Urquhart will hop on a bike Saturday to raise money for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. It’s a cause close to her heart, spending months there after surviving a car crash that almost ended her young life.

Arielle toured WSB-TV, sitting in on one of our newscasts as a guest of Channel 2 Anchor Jorge Estevez and the rest of the team. She showed she is so curious and full of life, which was almost cut short.

Arielle and her mother were in a head-on collision on their way to school a little over four years ago, when she was just 7.

“It could have gone either way, and I am so grateful to be alive,” she said.

Doctors at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta performed a lifesaving neck and spinal surgery. Arielle not only walked again, she would go on to compete in track.

Since then, she has become a “Miracle Kid” with the Children’s Miracle Network, donating her time to make care packages for others in the hospital.

Her work continues on a bike at Life Time Fitness, an athletic club that’s raising money for the Children’s Miracle Network with their signature “Ride of a Life Time Event.”

Instructors like Joshua Neal are grateful to be able to give back.

“To know that we are actually raising money to help these kids is just priceless, it is really is,” he said.

This effort means so much to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and to kids like Arielle, who thanks to the care she received gets to give back.

“I try to show them that this could be you,” she said. “You could get better. Just keep believing in yourself and keep pushing hard, and you can make it through.”

Arielle recovered from that neck surgery and a broken femur. It took her four months to walk again.

Now, she is a track star, a cheerleader and wants to pursue a modeling and acting career.

“I feel like I did get a second chance at life,” Arielle said.

Healthcare issues in Arizona prisons led the ACLU to seek a receiver while agencies like NaphCare and the ADCRR are defending their actions. FOX 10's Justin Lum investigates.

PHOENIX - Advocates for inmates incarcerated by Arizona’s Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation, and Reentry say ADCRR doesn’t have what’s necessary to run a successful healthcare system, according to the ACLU’s motion for a receiver. 

Lawyers say NaphCare, the for-profit healthcare provider contracted by the state, remains "woefully inadequate." 

What they're saying:

"My whole neck – I’ve lost four inches in my height," said Mary Whatley over the phone. 

Whatley is incarcerated at the Perryville women’s prison, serving time for weapons misconduct. She’s having issues with what’s called the thecal sac – a protective sheath around the spinal cord – and she needs surgery."I have to have this surgery or I’m going to be paralyzed, is what the nurse practitioners or providers here told me," said Whatley.

Mary Whatley 

She has a history of vertebrae fractures and neck trauma that causes numbness, tingling, and pain in both the neck and arms. Whatley doesn’t know when her next appointment will be."And it’s not just me; there are other women here that need surgeries and care that they’re not getting," said Whatley.

There are more than 100 healthcare positions vacant, the ACLU says via its latest motion in the ongoing Jensen v. Thornell lawsuit.

"It’s a battle in here," said Erin Taylor. 

Taylor is another inmate at the Perryville Complex. She has brain cancer."It’s very hard to get appointments," she said.In 2022, she had surgery to get some of the tumor removed. She says there was a long wait to receive radiation treatment."For about 15 months, I asked for some aftercare. Radiation didn’t begin until July 2023," Taylor recalled.She also says there’s been miscommunication between the prison’s medical staff and her oncologist regarding how long her chemotherapy should last. 

Erin Taylor 

Dig deeper:

In the motion for a receiver to take over health care throughout the state’s prisons, ADCRR is accused of frequently using telehealth when it’s clinically inappropriate and dangerous. 

Due to a judge’s order to fix constitutional violations found at trial, court-appointed experts reviewed countless death reports that documented "horrible care" leading to "unnecessary suffering and lost opportunities for treatment and cure" - and ultimately death, per the ACLU. 

"The ways that those things are happening come through a few structural issues that we identified in our motion. One of these is extreme delays in people getting the care they need. Another one is a real difficulty getting people to specialty appointments." 

As for the staffing shortage, Beall says there aren’t enough physicians providing care; instead, nurses who don’t have the same training," said Lauren Beall, an attorney for the ACLU of Arizona. 

Court expert reports say, "NaphCare offered a paltry two-dollars-per-hour increase to physician salaries between December 2023 and July 2024 and has made none since."

The other side:

A spokesperson for NaphCare says the provider is "proud of our record of successfully recruiting and retaining healthcare staff to work in Arizona’s prisons" and "there are more healthcare professionals working in ADCRR prisons than ever before," also saying each of the nine state prisons has a full-time medical director with 13 additional physicians across the state and two more have been hired. 

There are openings for two full-time and one part-time physician. NaphCare also says pay rates compete with market rates. 

Meanwhile, ADCRR’s responses to court monitors’ reports cite challenges with changes through third-party vendors."Passing the buck and saying, ‘you know this is NaphCare's responsibility’ is simply not an excuse, and it's not going to work for all of the people and all of the families of the people who are incarcerated," said Beall. 

We’ve also asked ADCRR about Erin Taylor and Mary Whatley’s alleged treatment delays. The department is prohibited from discussing inmates’ private and protected health information with third parties, but a spokesperson sent us the following statement:

Information for this story was provided by ADCRR, NaphCare, ACLU of Arizona, court documents and interviews with prisoners in Arizona prisons. The story was reported by FOX 10 Investigator Justin Lum from Phoenix.

Athenahealth is partnering with Abridge to integrate the company’s enhanced note-taking technology into its platform for clinicians, as the market for ambient scribing is becoming more crowded.

Abridge offers ambient note-taking, which is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology that listens to a patient and doctor conversation and generates structured medical notes. After a review by the doctor, these notes are added directly to a patient’s electronic health record.

The note-taking tool is also multilingual; it can record the patient-doctor conversation in one language and write it up in another language.

“Writing notes is something that has been a pain point for physicians since time began,” Paul Brient, chief product officer at Athenahealth, said in an interview with PYMNTS. “Artificial intelligence has gotten to the point now where it can listen to a provider-patient conversation and generate a note for the physician.”

Physicians often spend hours of their personal time catching up on medical notes — a phenomenon the industry calls “pajama time.”

Abridge’s technology will be incorporated into athenaOne, which is Athenahealth’s flagship cloud-based electronic health record (EHR), practice management and revenue cycle management platform designed for outpatient care. 

Earlier this week, Microsoft unveiled an AI-powered assistant that combines advanced voice dictation and ambient listening with generative AI. Called Dragon Copilot, the tool converts doctor and patient conversations into clinical summaries that can be integrated into electronic health records.

Microsoft is using the technology from Nuance, which it acquired in 2022. Brient said Nuance used to be the only game in town about three to four years ago, but the field has gotten crowded now with 40 to 50 vendors. 

Athenahealth is one of the largest in this market, serving 160,000 providers or about 10% of U.S. healthcare providers, primarily in outpatient care.

Brient said the Abridge partnership represents one part of Athenahealth’s broader vision for AI in healthcare technology. The company is developing a platform where users get to customize their experience.

For example, Abridge is one of three note-taking services being offered on athenaOne. The other two are Suki and iScribe, and Athenahealth plans to add more. Brient wants to give physicians a choice on which note-taking service they want to use because everyone’s style is different.

Letting each physician in a practice choose the model that works best for them is a “much more flexible strategy,” he added. “We were pretty excited about the approach, and super excited to have Abridge join that approach.”

Athenahealth also has an app marketplace with more than 850 APIs for physicians to customize their tech experience.

Looking ahead, the arrival of generative and agentic AI can “dramatically change the clinician experience” in the realm of the electronic health record system, Brient said.

First, the note-taking AI can evolve into a technology that can pull out diagnoses from the patient-doctor conversation and even suggest medicine orders, shrinking the process into a single cognitive step, Brient said.

Second, Brient sees Athenahealth using AI to digitize outpatient documentation. Unlike in-patient hospital care, where everything is electronic, at clinics and other outpatient settings a lot of documents are in various forms: lab test faxes, medical forms, and the like.

“A lot of the data coming into the EHR is unstructured. We get a lot of faxes,” Brient said. “You’re dealing with a lot of vendors all over the place.”

He added that “the good thing about AI is it can actually read those faxes. It can pull all the data out and put them in discrete form,” or stored in a way for easy retrieval and analysis. So instead of the doctor having to read each individual lab test, AI can consolidate and analyze them.

Brient also sees AI making its revenue cycle management services more efficient. This includes managing billing, insurance claims and payments. “We can add agentic AI and the new LLMs [large language models] to do a lot of the work the humans are doing, which speeds it up.”

For example, a hospital gets a check from an insurance company but it doesn’t say for whom or why, Brient said. The hospital has to investigate by logging into the insurer’s web portal. AI agents can do that.

Another use case is to appeal coverage denials. An LLM can write an appeal letter that the AI agent can upload to the insurer’s portal. The human worker would click to submit the appeal.

Also, Brient sees AI taking over the communication between the doctor’s office and the patient — taking phone calls, scheduling appointments, refilling medication and the like.

AI will handle the routine tasks to help the human worker who might be overwhelmed trying to check people in and out of the clinic, he said. 

“Big health systems are already doing that, but most of our clients are small, independent practices,” Brient added. “So we’re helping them, over the next year, to start doing that.”

He said he met with a company that uses AI agents as “nurses,” not to directly provide care, but to perform follow-ups like calling the patient to remind them they still need to get a certain lab test for their surgery. Brient can see Athenahealth acting as a “virtual call center” for doctors’ offices.

Adoption could increase as costs continue to fall. Brient said the cost for note-taking has fallen from $2,000 a month per doctor in the early days to $100 to $400 — and prices still keep declining.

“People have long joked that Dr. Google plays a big role in people’s healthcare lives,” he said. “I can imagine that Dr. ChatGPT will start to play a big role in people’s healthcare lives, officially or unofficially.”

N.C. Sen. Benton Sawrey, R-Johnston, landed an influential role in his second term this session as co-chair of the Senate’s committees on healthcare.

He joined this week’s WUNC Politics Podcast to talk about his efforts to address the unusually high costs of healthcare in North Carolina, including a recent bill to limit insurance coverage mandates and some other proposals in the works for later this year.

This conversation has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

What do you see as the big priorities for the Senate on the healthcare front this year?

“It's going to all be about cost this year. There's some recent information that came out that showed that North Carolina ranked number 50 in the nation with respect to healthcare costs. We're paying the highest health premiums in the nation, which is particularly concerning considering how expensive healthcare is in the United States generally, and then not necessarily corresponding with outcome.

“We have parts of our state that are lagging behind the rest of the country with respect to infant mortality, maternal mortality, access to care, things like that. We need to really drill down and examine why we're paying so much and not getting the results that should come along with that.”

You co-sponsored a bill that already passed the Senate to get at the affordability issue, that would restrict government mandates on what insurance plans have to cover. What's the rationale behind going at it from that direction?

“That's not the only tool in the toolbox, that's one big piece of the puzzle here. What we've examined is that government mandates with insurance are having an effect on driving up costs. Anytime there's government intervention, it increases costs, increases regulation, increases obligation, and ultimately gets passed on to consumer and drives that up.”

Do you see other bills in the works?

“I think you'll see some (Certificate of Need) legislation that comes out this session. I think a complete CON repeal probably would not get across the finish line at this point, but there's definitely an opportunity, especially for (reducing regulatory handles to adding) major medical equipment pieces.

“I think you'll see a bill dropped on Collaborative Pharmacy Practice, where you can have certain qualified pharmacists practicing in a team-based setting with some of our physicians and other people. They can do medication management and help with that cost and access in some of our rural communities.”

Some of your counterparts on the House Health Committee have been discussing what might happen here in North Carolina if federal Medicaid funding gets cut. Have there been any preliminary discussions of what that might look like?

“We’re definitely having conversations about it. It's an issue that ultimately is not within our control as to what happens at the congressional level at this point.

“We have asked DHHS to discuss some contingencies and ideas about how they would address it if there are tweaks. At the $880 billion cut level that I think they're discussing, I believe the state share to North Carolina could potentially be about $27 billion, so it’s a big issue that would affect a lot of people in North Carolina.

"To keep (the Medicaid expansion) population in place, it would require commitment from the state of several billion more dollars that we don't have. So we would have to have some tough conversations about what that would look like in case that federal share was reduced."

Sawrey also spoke about his bill to help disabled veterans afford homeownership, a new "sports caucus" and the upcoming budget season at the legislature. Listen to the full conversation on the WUNC Politics Podcast.

Libraries are so much more than a place to get books. Now, thanks to the Libraries with Heart program, libraries in Central Florida are places where community members can keep an eye on one aspect of their health. A partnership between HCA Florida Healthcare, the American Heart Association and the Orange County Library system lets patrons 18 and up check out blood pressure monitoring kits. In 2024, the kits were checked out 459 times.

"We meet people where they are, and so we try to bring our community work to life in settings like the library,” said  Jimmy Clarity, vice president of community impact for the American Heart Association. “It’s a place where people gather and spend a lot of their time and can access resources. It’s not just about checking out library books anymore.”

Each branch of the library has at least two staff members who have been trained to teach patrons how to use the kits; the system also has outreach teams that go into the community to get the kits into the hands of those who might not be able to go to the library, or who are unaware that the program exists.

Libraries with Heart has also provided automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to every library in the system; a donation from UCF Lake Nona Hospital covered those, as well as the cost of training library staffers in CPR and AED use.

WRGB aired a story reporting on St. Peter’s Health Partners new collaboration with the Caring Gene Career Pathways Training Program (CPT) to tackle healthcare workforce shortages in New York’s most affected areas.

From the report:

Meredith Robison, chief nursing officer for acute care at St. Peter’s Health Partners said, “St. Peter’s Health Partners is proud to partner with the Caring Gene to provide meaningful education opportunities for students and address the ongoing need for healthcare workers in New York state. Together, we aim to build a stronger healthcare workforce, support career advancement, and improve community health outcomes.”

To qualify, students must commit to a three-year service with a healthcare, behavioral health, or social care network provider in New York that serves a patient population of at least 30% Medicaid-reliant or uninsured individuals.

They must complete their degree by Spring 2027 and fulfill the service requirement by 2031.

Officials say Kentucky ranks in the bottom 10 states across the U-S for healthcare, and about two thirds face a massive shortage of OBGYNs. Healthcare leaders and legislators have conflicting plans to tackle the Commonwealth’s shortage. Senate Bill 132 would establish what it calls individual civil protection for healthcare workers, permitting professionals to refuse to perform procedures or treatments based on a religious or ethical belief without consequence.

While the bill’s sponsors say the measure would enable more diversity in the healthcare field amidst the state’s healthcare field, other officials say it’s not the right way.

David Conway, a minister and registered nurse, spoke about the legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Health Services. Conway said he, alongside other providers and organizations like the American Medical Association, oppose this bill because it would likely cause delays and barriers to care, especially in rural areas.

“It makes it illegal for someone to even suggest that an employee who objects to providing care be reassigned to another task. In other words, if I were the lead nurse and I knew that a nurse was opposed to this procedure, I wouldn’t have the freedom to say, ‘why don’t you take a step out and let somebody else in?’ If an employee is uncomfortable providing care, the compassionate action is to reassign them,” said Conway.

He argued in rural areas without other options, this bill would cause worse outcomes, especially for women’s health. Other healthcare providers and senators were concerned about the possibility of discrimination against patients based on their identity, race, or religion.

Proponents argued the bill would not allow practitioners to discriminate against their patients based on identity, only protecting those who refuse to perform certain procedures or prescribe medications. SB 132’s sponsors named abortion as its primary target, arguing doctors should not feel coerced or forced to perform one if it’s against their conscience.

State Senator Donald Douglas, a co-sponsor of the bill, testified to the Senate Standing Committee on Health Services early this month. He said in his career as a physician, these protections would have been pivotal.

“When I worked in pain management, the clinic I worked with insisted on writing for a lot of opioids for the patients to keep them coming through the practice,” said Douglas. “How has that worked out in the substance use disorder area, Mister Chairman? It hasn’t. So because I exercised my right of conscience to say this isn’t working, I believe I’ve saved a lot of lives.”

Other healthcare workers said it would open opportunities for discrimination and that medical professionals have an ethical obligation to serve their patients regardless of their beliefs.

The bill passed its committee reading and moves on to the full senate.</p>

The chief medical officer of Providence Medical Group, Serene Perkins, spoke about the role of artificial intelligence, or AI, in health care at a conference on AI innovation Feb. 28 in Anchorage.

She outlined the AI tools Providence is already using across its network of health care facilities in Alaska and in six other states.

She said one AI tool Providence has incorporated uses artificial intelligence to analyze patient messages to providers. It identifies patients with the highest immediate risk so a health care provider can respond quickly.

“Things like suicidal ideation,” Perkins said. “We need to get that to the top of the inbox. We need to make sure that there is a mental health counselor that can get in touch with that person right away.”

Perkins said the AI tool adheres to HIPAA, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a federal law protecting patients’ privacy.

She said the biggest potential for AI interventions in the long term are for managing chronic disease and illness.

“The more that we can use AI to really attack those and be able to monitor patients on a much more frequent basis and prevent them from getting to the place where they have to be hospitalized, because once they're at that higher level of care, or need a surgery, the complications go up exponentially,” Perkins said.

She said Providence also recently started a program that incorporates wearable glucose monitors with AI to help manage diabetes.

Perkins said as a patient, she experienced the benefits of AI when her physician used an AI transcription note-taking service during her annual physical exam.

“To be able to sit there and have a 20-minute face-to-face conversation where she's not worrying about forgetting anything that I'm saying and I'm not watching her type on the computer, turned away from me, I experienced it myself, the transformation,” Perkins said.

But she said using AI is a big responsibility. “We have to be in charge of it.”

Perkins said there's potential in the future for AI to help manage other kinds of chronic disease, like depression or cancer. But she said, for now, Providence is sticking to using artificial intelligence for diabetes and heart health care. She said once they get those applications right and can show patient outcomes are improving, they can explore using AI to aid treatment of other health conditions.</p>
