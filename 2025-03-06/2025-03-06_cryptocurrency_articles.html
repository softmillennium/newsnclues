Cryptocurrency falls as much as 6 percent as lack of plans for government purchases disappoints investors.

United States President Donald Trump’s executive order to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a stockpile of other digital assets has failed to impress crypto markets, with Bitcoin’s value plummeting following the announcement.

Bitcoin fell as much as 6 percent following Trump’s order on Thursday, which did not include plans for the government to actively buy Bitcoin.

After dropping as low as $84,900, the cryptocurrency was trading at about $87,700 as of 05:00 GMT.

In a statement announcing the order, Trump’s crypto tsar David Sacks said the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and “Digital Asset Stockpile” would be capitalised with assets forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings.

“This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,” Sacks said on X.

“It is estimated that the US government owns about 200,000 Bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. (executive order) directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings.”

Sacks said the order also called for the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce to develop “budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional Bitcoin” provided they are at no cost to the US taxpayer.

Trump’s order came after he repeatedly flagged plans to establish a cryptocurrency stockpile or reserve as part of his pledge to turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet”.

 



 

Some crypto enthusiasts, however, were less than impressed.

Shayan Salehi, a German tech entrepreneur, described the announcement that the government would not acquire additional assets as “famous words than can unleash a bear market”.

“Market muted,” Spencer Hakimian, the founder of New York-based Tolou Capital Management, said in a post on X alongside a screenshot of a graph showing Bitcoin’s fall.

Hakimian said the plan was “very underwhelming”.

“They will not currently buy any new Bitcoin unless they can do it in a revenue-neutral way. Nothing the federal government does is revenue neutral,” he said.

The US owns an estimated 200,000 Bitcoin seized during criminal and civil forfeiture.

Sacks suggested the reserve would function like a “digital Fort Knox” by helping Bitcoin retain its value.

“Premature sales of Bitcoin have already cost US taxpayers over $17bn in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings,” he said.

In addition to a Bitcoin reserve, Sacks said a separate stockpile would be established for “digital assets other than Bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings”.

That stockpile could include tokens such as ether, XRP, Solana and Cardano – assets named by Trump earlier this week in a social media post detailing his plans for a cryptocurrency reserve.

The value of Bitcoin soared after Trump was elected in November, hitting a record peak of $109,071 in mid-January.

The president’s support for cryptocurrency has come under scrutiny, as his family has amassed billions of dollars in crypto wealth, including through a Trump meme coin launched in January.

Critics of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have warned that the assets have no intrinsic value and likened their rise to a Ponzi scheme.

Bitcoin (BTC) price extends its decline, trading around $87,000 on Friday after falling more than 7% so far this week. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices followed in BTC’s footsteps and declined nearly 15% and 16%, respectively, despite Trump signing an executive order to create the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on Thursday. 

Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it…

Bitcoin price faced rejection around the $95,000 level on Sunday and declined 8.54% the next day. However, on Tuesday, BTC dipped below the daily support level at $85,000 but bounced and closed above it. This daily level roughly coincides with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,843, making it a key support zone. At the time of writing on Friday, it trades down, finding support around the 200-day EMA at $85,843.

If BTC breaks below the 200-day EMA and closes below $85,000, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 41, which points downwards after rejecting from its neutral level of 50 earlier this week, indicating bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator coils around each other, suggesting indecisiveness among the traders.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if the $85,000 level holds as support, BTC could extend the recovery to retest its Sunday high of $95,000.

Ethereum price found support around its $2,125 level on Saturday and rose 13.56%, closing above its daily resistance of $2,359 the next day. However, ETH erased its recent gains on Monday but found support around its $2,125 level the next day and recovered 3.65% by Wednesday. At the time of writing on Friday, it declines and approaches its $2,125 support level.

If ETH declines and closes below $2,125, it could extend the decline to retest its weekly support level of $1,905.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 35 after rejecting around its neutral level of 50 on Sunday, indicating bearish momentum. At the same time, its MACD also showed a bearish crossover last week, suggesting a downward trend.



ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if the $2,125 level holds as support and ETH continues its recovery, it could extend the rally to retest its next resistance level at $3,000.

Ripple price was rejected around its key psychological level of $3 on Sunday, and it declined 18.79% the next day. However, it found support on Tuesday and bounced off its 100-day EMA at $2.31, recovering 8.63% until Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, it declines slightly down around $2.48.

If the 100-day EMA at $2.31 holds, XRP could extend the recovery to retest its psychological level of $3. A firm close above this level could extend an additional rally to retest its January 16 high of $3.40.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 49 and remains flat around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among traders. The RSI must move above its neutral level for the recovery to be sustained.



XRP/USDT daily chart

However, if XRP fails to find support at the 100-day EMA and closes below, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Bitcoin price extends its decline, trading around $87,000 on Friday after falling more than 7% so far this week. Ethereum and Ripple prices declined nearly 15% and 16% respectively despite Trump signing an executive order to create the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on Thursday.

Litecoin price dipped below the $100 mark on Thursday, losing 22% in the past week as markets reacted to updates to US trade tariffs and speculation surrounding White House Crypto Summit to be held on Friday.

Bitcoin price dipped 5% to hit $85,000 on Monday as skittish sentiment around US Trade policy and Non-Farm Payrolls data introduced fresh volatility ahead of the White House Crypto Summit. However, a recent Bitcoin Strategic reserve announcement from Trump's Crypto Czar David Sacks could spark more gains. 

AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks confirmed on Thursday President Trump's executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and a list of key crypto industry figures attending the White House Crypto Summit.

Bitcoin (BTC) price extends its decline and trades below $80,000 at the time of writing on Friday, falling over 15% so far this week. This price correction wiped $660 billion of market capitalization from the overall crypto market and saw $3.68 billion in total liquidations this week.

 A US strategic Bitcoin reserve “dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic Bitcoin reserves,” says Bitwise's Matt Hougan. 

A strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States reduces the possibility that the government will ever “ban” the cryptocurrency and could encourage many more nations to adopt Bitcoin, according to crypto observers. 

On March 7, US President Donald Trump signed an order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a digital asset stockpile. 

White House crypto czar David Sacks said that the reserve would be capitalized with “Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings,” estimated at around 200,000 BTC. This apparently disappointed traders, as it led to an immediate 6% fall in the price of Bitcoin. 

However, many say the markets may have it wrong, and the news should be viewed as bullish.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said one of the impacts of a US strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve (SBR) is that it “dramatically reduces the likelihood the US government will someday ‘ban’ Bitcoin.”

In November, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis suggested that Bitcoin could one day force the federal government to balance its budget. 

“A legal prohibition against Bitcoin can restore unique implementation of permanent primary deficits, and so can a tax on Bitcoin,” it said at the time.

The US Bitcoin reserve also dramatically increases the chances that other nations will establish Bitcoin reserves and accelerates the speed at which other nations will consider establishing them, said Hougan, as it creates a short window for them to “front-run” potential Bitcoin buying by the US. 

The US is the global leader in nation-state Bitcoin holdings, with 207,189 BTC worth around $18 billion at current prices, according to BitBO. China is estimated to come in second with an estimated 194,000 BTC, followed by the United Kingdom, holding 61,000 Bitcoin. 

El Salvador is the only country to have designated BTC as legal tender. It is still accumulating and currently holds 6,103 BTC worth around $534 million, according to the nation’s Bitcoin Office.

“I expect many of the G20 to take notice and eventually follow America’s leadership,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. 

Hougan also opined that a US Bitcoin strategic reserve makes it much harder for institutions such as agencies like the International Monetary Fund “to position Bitcoin as somehow dangerous or inappropriate to hold.”

The IMF has been against sovereign nations, such as El Salvador, investing in BTC. On March 3, the IMF approved a funding program with El Salvador for $1.4 billion on the condition that it downgraded its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. 

The memorandum of understanding indicated a condition of “no voluntary accumulation of BTC by the public sector in El Salvador.”

Bitwise head of research Ryan Rasmussen continued with the notion, saying that the end game was never “the US government buys all of the world’s Bitcoin.”.

He listed what the US SBR means: “Other countries will buy BTC, wealth managers have no excuse, financial institutions have no excuse, pensions and endowments have no excuse, fear of the US selling is gone, the US will likely buy more, likelihood of states buying just went up, and the probability the government outlaws Bitcoin is definitively zero.”

The co-founder and CEO at Lightspark, David Marcus, simply said, “This is a balanced outcome and the right decision for now,” adding he was “happy reason has prevailed.”

Meanwhile, crypto lawyer John Deaton points out that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick “have been directed by the POTUS to find ‘budget neutral’ ways to acquire BTC.”

It was only a year ago that regulators approved the first US spot Bitcoin ETF, added ETF Store President Nate Geraci.

Bitcoin is currently rebounding, having reached $88,000 at the time of writing.

Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda discusses the halt in probes into crypto firms, regulation, China's presence in U.S. markets and efforts for technology independence.

President Trump, late Thursday, signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Crypto Czar David Sachs celebrated the move via a post on X. 

"The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime," he wrote. "It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.’" 

Sachs, a Silicon Valley and pro-crypto veteran who will be shaping future policy around digital assets, reiterated his criticism of prior administrations for what he deemed as dropping the ball on bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value. 

"Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings," he also noted. 

Sachs also outlined how other digital currencies may be used. 

"IN ADDITION, the Executive Order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, consisting of digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings."

The move comes on the eve of a Friday roundtable with members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets in what is being billed as a "Digital Asset Summit."

Attendees at Friday's meeting include the following crypto leaders, while more may be added:

Last Sunday, ahead of the meeting, Trump advanced his plans for a strategic reserve for cryptocurrencies, posting on Truth Social: 

"A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!."

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a strategic reserve for Bitcoin, making the US one of the few countries in the world to create a national stockpile of blockchain assets.

The reserve will hold cryptocurrency forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings, White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks said in a post on X.

The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset.

Trump - who just four years ago said Bitcoin "seems like a scam" - now says he plans to make the US "the Crypto Capital of the World".

Further details are expected when the president is due to host the first crypto summit at the White House on Friday.

It is unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.

Sacks said the stockpile would serve as "a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency", drawing comparison to a Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets.

Trump's order also creates a digital assets stockpile for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin that have been forfeited. 

It directs a full accounting of the federal government's crypto reserves, which Sacks said are estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (£13.6bn) at today's prices.

It was unclear how the new stockpile would benefit Americans, but Sacks said it "will not cost taxpayers a dime".

His implication that the US government would not buy Bitcoin led prices of the world's largest cryptocurrency to fall by more than 5%.

Some countries maintain strategic reserves of national assets to diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risk.

The US also keeps a petroleum reserve. Canada has a maple syrup reserve.

Earlier this week, Trump revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he said he would like included in the strategic reserve.

The market prices of the five coins he named - Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano -  swiftly jumped after that announcement.

Trump aggressively courted the crypto community during his presidential campaign. Former US President Joe Biden led a crackdown on crypto, citing concerns about fraud.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Cryptocurrencies fell Thursday night after President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a strategic bitcoin reserve for the United States and, separately, a "digital asset stockpile."

The price of bitcoin was last lower by 3% at $87,586.86, according to Coin Metrics. Shortly after the news broke, it fell to as low as $84,688.13.

Earlier losses in other coins – specifically those that rallied at the beginning of the week after Trump said they would be included in the strategy – also eased. Ether was down 2%, trading at $2,184.08. XRP and Solana's SOL token retreated 1% and 3%, respectively. Cardano's ADA token tumbled 13%.

White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks detailed in a post on X that the bitcoin reserve will include bitcoin already owned by the U.S. government that it seized from past law enforcement actions – a move, he emphasized, that will "not cost taxpayers a dime." The U.S. currently owns more than 198,000 bitcoins worth about $17 billion, according to Arkham.

The stockpile of other coins will include "digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings." Sacks said the government will not acquire additional assets for it "beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings." Arkham data shows the U.S. government owns about 56 ether tokens worth almost $119 million. It does not list XRP or the Solana or Cardano tokens.

Investors initially dumped their coins at the notion of the U.S. having no immediate planned purchases of bitcoin, per the order, against the backdrop of major weakness in equities.

"It is good news, but not what the market wanted in the short term," said Steven Lubka, head of private clients and family offices at Swan Bitcoin. "People were hoping for near-term buy pressure."

Sacks did point out that the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop "budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers," and that there's no plan to accumulate additional assets for the crypto stockpile beyond what's already been obtained by the government.

The announcement came days after Trump teased new details on the highly anticipated bitcoin reserve that had become one of his biggest promises to the crypto industry on his campaign trail, and on the eve of the first White House Crypto Summit.

The crypto market has been rocked this week by the tariff war and inflation concerns, which have largely overshadowed the speculative excitement around the bitcoin reserve. JPMorgan on Wednesday said it doesn't expect a big move higher in crypto in the near term, given the broader economic uncertainty and weakening demand.

Bitcoin briefly returned to the key $90,000 level earlier this week and is now hovering just below it. Investors and analysts have warned that until bitcoin can meaningfully hold above it, it's at risk of a bigger pullback toward $70,000.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday establishing a government reserve of bitcoin, a key marker in the cryptocurrency’s journey towards possible mainstream acceptance. 

Under Trump’s new order, the U.S. government will retain the estimated 200,000 bitcoin it’s already seized in criminal and civil proceedings, according to Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks. 

“The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,’” Sacks said on social media. 

The executive order calls for a “full accounting” of the government’s bitcoin holdings, which Sacks said have never been fully audited. He added that the U.S. government has previously sold off about 195,000 bitcoin over the last decade for $366 million. He said those bitcoins would be worth about $17 billion if the government hadn’t sold them.

Sacks said the order allows for the Treasury and Commerce Departments “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin.”

Once a skeptic who said a few years ago that bitcoin “ seems like a scam,” Trump has embraced digital currencies and leaned into his unofficial role as the “ crypto president ” in ways that can both help the crypto industry and enrich himself and his family. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, who felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last year’s election. 

Establishing a bitcoin reserve was one of several crypto-related promises Trump made on the campaign trail last year. Trump is also pushing Congress to pass industry-friendly legislation, and under his administration the Securities and Exchange Commission has started dropping enforcement actions it had taken against some major crypto companies. On Friday, Trump is set to host many key industry leaders at a White House “Crypto Summit.”




Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by an anonymous person or persons, bitcoin has blossomed from an experiment by libertarian cryptography enthusiasts into an asset with a market cap of about $1.7 trillion. While it hasn’t taken off as a way to pay for everyday things, bitcoin has found popularity as a store of value that’s not controlled by banks, governments or other powerful entities. 

Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, a built-in scarcity that supporters say makes it a great hedge against inflation. Critics have long said bitcoin lacks any inherent value, but it’s so far defied naysayers with remarkable price increases. Some supporters of a strategic bitcoin reserve said it could one day help pay off the U.S. national debt.

Crypto prices soared after Trump’s victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!” on social media.

But prices have since cooled off. Trump’s executive order did not equate to an immediate price spike for bitcoin, which was trading around $86,000 shortly after his announcement. 

The executive order also creates a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” where the government will hold seized cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. On Sunday, Trump sent crypto prices on a short-lived surge after a surprise announcement that he wanted the government to hold lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana and cardano.

President Donald Trump has directed his administration to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve to hold the assets that have been seized by the government, and he's additionally called for a crypto stockpile of other types of assets.

At this point, all of the assets contemplated by the order would be those seized in civil or criminal forfeitures. The bitcoin will be stored for long-term value in what was termed a "digital Fort Knox."

"The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings," said David Sacks, Trump's crypto czar, in a statement posted on social media site X.

In a video showing the president signing the order, Trump says about establishing the reserve, "Made the promise, right?"

The order has also nudged government officials to seek ways to add more bitcoin to the reserve, as long as it doesn't harm the federal budget.

"The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers," Sacks said.

The assets for the non-bitcoin stockpile will be any crypto that the government otherwise seizes. Sacks didn't highlight any particular asset names in that category, despite some being recently named by the president.

Presidential orders don't necessarily have the same legal authority as acts of Congress, so it remains unclear how Trump's administration will approach the particulars of the order, which hadn't yet been made public Thursday night. It's also unclear what the total value of the current U.S. crypto holdings may be. 

Bitcoin fell nearly 5% to $85,000 in the minutes following the order, perhaps over disappointment the reserve consists of tokens already held by the government, but — for now — includes no new buys.

Ethereum's (ETH), Ripple's (XRP), Cardano's (ADA), and Solana's (SOL) are all lower by 4%-8% over the past hour as the order allows for no fresh government purchases of those tokens.

The executive order announcement was made on the eve of the White House's industry summit, in which leaders from across the crypto spectrum are set to discuss policy matters with members of Trump's administration. The president had been expected to announce crypto reserve details before or during that event. 

“Establishing a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile is a huge moment for both crypto and American leadership on the global stage," said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital, one of the business leaders set to attend the roundtable.

Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer for Bitwise Asset Management, said in a post that the move to set up a bitcoin reserve reduces the chance the government can ever try to outlaw the asset, and it "dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic bitcoin reserves."

But Charles Edwards, founder of Bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, called it the "most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week," arguing that without a buying plan, the strategy is a "pig in lipstick."

According to KookCapitalLLC, the maximum pain scenario for Bitcoin could be a continuous upward movement without experiencing a dump after the meeting or in the future. This perspective challenges the common expectation of a post-event price correction in the cryptocurrency market.

President Trump is holding the first crypto summit at the White House Friday, featuring investors, CEOs and founders of crypto companies. Many in that world also hope Trump spells out a clearer path involving little regulation in the future, while Trump says he will announce the details of a new crypto reserve for the federal government. Paul Solman reports.

Amna Nawaz:

President Trump is holding the first crypto summit at the White House tomorrow, featuring investors, CEOs and founders of crypto companies.

Many in that world also hope that Trump spells out a clearer path involving little regulation in the future. And Trump says he will announce the details of a new crypto reserve for the federal government.

Geoff Bennett:

Estimates vary widely, but surveys have found anywhere from 7 to 28 percent of U.S. adults invest in crypto. The market's total value is estimated around $3 trillion at the moment.

There are also real concerns about the stability of crypto and similar digital assets and whether President Trump has potential conflicts of interest.

Our Paul Solman breaks it down for us.

Paul Solman:

Let's start with some basics. A cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is a bit of computer code, really just a unique string of dozens of characters that identifies your ownership of some strictly digital asset, existing only in what my mother disparagingly called cyberspace.

Neha Narula, MIT Digital Currency Initiative:

So, that's really different than most of the other assets that we think about in the world. Bitcoin itself is classified as a commodity, like things like gold, but those commodities have a real-world analog component. There's gold sitting in a vault somewhere. There's a bar or there's a coin.

Bitcoin's purely digital, digital first.

Paul Solman:

When I first covered cryptocurrency back in 2013, one Bitcoin was worth about $125, five years later, more than $7,000. Now a whole Bitcoin is selling near $90,000. So what's its appeal?

Vic Laranja, Crypto Content Creator:

If I want to send money to somebody, it has to pass through multiple institutions to get to them. With crypto, I don't need to wait. The money is liquid. You can have it instantly. It's almost free to send it, and that is innovation. It's just better.

Paul Solman:

And Bitcoin is supposed to be even scarcer than gold, as there's an absolute limit to the supply, unlike government currencies like the dollar, which can suffer inflation, and in cases like Germany in 1923 and Zimbabwe and Venezuela more recently, hyperinflation.

Plus, all transactions are publicly displayed on something called a blockchain, tracked on every computer that uses the software.

Neha Narula:

Another huge component of whether or not something is a good store of value is whether people believe in it, whether they have decided it's a good store of value. So it's kind of got these dual sides. You need to have certain properties that we can talk about pretty rationally, but then there's this narrative component.

Paul Solman:

One part of the narrative, Bitcoin will gradually replace currencies like the dollar as a form of payment, but given the volatility of its value:

Zeke Faux, Author, "Number Go Up": If you're talking to anyone who's saying that Bitcoin is going to be used for payments, that's kind of a fringe idea. Most Bitcoiners now just stick to the idea that the price will go up forever, and that we will all get rich.

Paul Solman:

OK, that's a digital asset like Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and now thousands of others. But what about meme coins in general and the Trump coin in particular?

Molly White, Crypto Researcher and Software Engineer: Meme coins are crypto assets that are themed around a specific idea or sometimes a person. Generally, there is no business behind a meme coin project. There's no sort of greater purpose, but they are used as vehicles for speculation.

Paul Solman:

Meme coins have become very popular of late. One of the most well-known is Dogecoin, long-hyped by Elon Musk. It's based on a Shiba Inu dog meme and has had enduring value, but most meme coins don't.

Molly White:

The asset is worth whatever you can sell it for and you better try to do it quick before it goes to zero.

Vic Laranja:

There are over five million meme coins; 99 percent of them go to zero.

Paul Solman:

It's a game. The goal, get in early and hope that, to use the old Wall Street expression, a greater fool will come along and pay a higher price.

Vic Laranja:

We call it vaporware. There's no promise or utility with a meme coin, other than the connection to the idea.

Paul Solman:

In January, President Trump announced his own meme coin.

Molly White:

The Trump Token was one of the biggest meme coins that we have ever seen launched. President Trump, just before his inauguration, launched a meme coin themed around himself. Shortly after, his wife launched a meme coin called Melania Token, which came a couple days later.

Paul Solman:

What happened when the Trump meme coin came out on the market?

Vic Laranja:

Insanity. It was one of the craziest nights I have ever experienced in crypto ever. Like, it was nuts, because no one believed that it was real. Everyone thought it was a scam. Everyone thought that his account was hacked.

Paul Solman:

But the Trump coin was real, one billion of them to be released over three years. Two hundred million were released to the market. The coin's creators own the remaining 800 million.

Vic Laranja:

I was like, OK, I'm going to put a little bit of money into this, because if I'm wrong, that's going to suck. And this is the amount of money that I'm OK with just completely losing.

Paul Solman:

In fact, Laranja says he made a little money on his Trump coin bet. But if you invested late, you sure didn't.

Zeke Faux:

A small number of people got in early and profited from this Trump coin. The majority of people who bought the coin ended up losing money. And they can see this because you can track transactions on the blockchain.

Paul Solman:

Hundreds of thousands of crypto accounts lost money on the bet, amounting to billions in cumulative losses.

Meanwhile, the Trump-affiliated creators of the coin made some $100 million in fees alone, plus presumably profits from the coin itself.

Molly White:

About 80 percent of the token supply was allocated to Trump and Trump entities. And so, based on the token price, he potentially makes quite a lot of money off of that token.

Paul Solman:

But to some in the crypto community, the Trump coin's downside is more that it's a gateway to scamming.

Vic Laranja:

Because he basically opened the floodgates for people to scam without being scared of it. People in the space call it crime season. That's what started. Crime season started.

Paul Solman:

Now, President Trump's views on crypto have evolved. In 2021, he called Bitcoin a scam. But with the Biden administration tough on crypto in general, supporters began to back Trump and his reelection bid.

Zeke Faux:

David Bailey, who runs "Bitcoin" magazine, which is the organizer of the annual Bitcoin conference that draws thousands of Bitcoiners from around the world, he got together a group of a few dozen of the top Bitcoin investors and got them to agree to donate the maximum amount to Trump, which, if you count all the committees and everything, is $844,600 each.

Paul Solman:

Trump's pledge?

Donald Trump, President of the United States: The United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.

(Cheering)

Paul Solman:

In part by overhauling regulations.

Zeke Faux:

And, so far, he's taken a number of steps in that direction. SEC has been dropping investigations and lawsuits against a number of crypto companies. One of the SEC lawyers who took the lead on some of these crypto enforcement actions has been punished by being transferred to the I.T. department.

I mean, there's a huge conflict of interest here. Trump has his own crypto businesses, and his administration is now deciding an entirely new set of rules that are going to govern this industry.

Paul Solman:

Trump's also planning a U.S. crypto strategic reserve to include Bitcoin and other tokens, which could boost the value of the president's own crypto ventures, of which there are several.

Molly White:

So it started with him launching several NFT projects that were themed around him. He also is a major beneficiary of a company called World Liberty Financial, which is a crypto-based project that plans to launch some sort of a crypto application in the near future. He receives something like 75 percent of the proceeds from that project.

His TRUTH Social platform, which he owns, has been talking about launching a crypto segment, where they would allow for crypto trading. They have spoken about holding crypto assets themselves. So he has very deep involvement in the crypto world these days.

Paul Solman:

And that raises another issue.

Molly White:

Members of the government are not supposed to receive money from people who are trying to influence policy, and these new crypto projects provide a very direct way for such people to do so, often in ways that can be a little bit more challenging to trace than, say, a bank transfer.

Paul Solman:

If, that is, anyone is trying to trace them at all.

The Texas Senate on Thursday passed a measure that would establish a state-controlled cryptocurrency reserve. The move comes just days after President Donald Trump announced plans to create a U.S. crypto strategic reserve.

Senate Bill 21, authored by Republican Sen. Charles Schwertner of Georgetown, would allow the state comptroller to buy, hold and manage Bitcoin and other digital assets as “a hedge against inflation and economic volatility.” The reserve would be funded through legislative appropriations and donations from private citizens and corporations.

The bill would also create a committee to provide investment recommendations for which cryptocurrency to buy to the comptroller. If signed into law, Texas would become the first U.S. state to create its own cryptocurrency reserve.

“This bill will allow Texas to diversify our investment approach, participate competitively in the evolving digital, financial economy and leverage the benefits of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Schwertner said.

Schwertner says his proposed crypto reserve would be subject to regular third-party audits, the findings of which would be released in a report to the state legislature every other year.

The bill passed out of the Senate with 25 legislators in favor and five against. It now heads to the Texas House for consideration.

Before passing, the proposed bill led to a heated debate between Schwertner and Democratic Sen. Roland Gutierrez of San Antonio, who raised concerns about Bitcoin’s volatility and the potential risks associated with allocating state funds to cryptocurrency.

“When the economy is down, Bitcoin is down, and the fluctuations on this stuff is insanity,” Gutierrez said. “We have so many real concerns in this state, and so many of our citizens that’re asking for real help, and the last thing that we need to do is go benefit some techno bro.”

Gutierrez argued that the use of crypto was “completely unregulated” — a claim that Schwertner pushed back on, saying cryptocurrency was regulated by blockchain technology, which is essentially a digital ledger that records transactions. Schwertner added that a blockchain is decentralized, meaning the data it’s not owned or operated by one single entity.

“In some ways, it is more accountable because it has that decentralized nature,” Schwertner said. However, Gutierrez was not convinced.

“All I’ve heard is it’s a blockchain and it’s a computer, it’s an algorithm,” Gutierrez asked. “We’re supposed to allow that algorithm, that computer and … some crypto bros to regulate themselves?”

Despite Gutierrez’s continued pushback, the bill was fast-tracked out of the Senate by a majority of lawmakers who moved to skip a third reading of the bill, which is the last step before a proposed law can move onto the next chamber for discussion.

Gov. Greg Abbott has previously expressed interest in making Texas a hub for the use of crypto. On Sunday. Trump announced a proposed national crypto reserve, signaling a significant federal endorsement of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano.</p>

Say what you will about the Department of Government Efficiency, but there are some ways that the Trump administration has significantly cut down on bloat. For example, it used to take at least a little digging to identify if a President was favor-trading and self-dealing. Now it seems like it just happens out in the open. So streamlined!

To that end, cryptocurrency analysis platform Nansen AI reported that World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance protocol that is operated primarily by President Trump’s three sons, purchased $25 million in cryptocurrencies including $10 million in Ethereum, $10 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and $1.5 million in of MOVE. That move comes just one day before President Trump will host the White House Crypto Summit on Friday. The company also announced Thursday that it was entering a “strategic reserve deal” with layer-1 blockchain project SUI, which caused a significant uptick in the value of the coin.

Now, to be fair, it doesn’t exactly take a genius to place a bet that the cryptocurrency market might spike in response to the hype generated by the White House Crypto Summit—just like when Trump announced a “Crypto Strategic Reserve,” it resulted in prices spiking. The crypto market, if nothing else, is extremely predictable in that it will react to hype.

But also, Trump’s kids run the company, and World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff (the son of billionaire Trump buddy Steve Witkoff) is one of the “industry leaders” invited to the summit. And that’s a whole lot of posturing to be doing right before an event that will almost certainly generate a bunch of hype, if not actual policy announcements that could cause the crypto market to surge again.

And it’d be silly to ignore the fact that World Liberty Financial has at least seemingly served as a platform for currying favor with the President via lining his kids’ pockets.

Justin Sun, a Chinese national and founder of the cryptocurrency TRON, was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023 for allegedly committing fraud and manipulating the price of his cryptocurrency. The SEC asked for a stay in the case shortly after Sun purchased $75 million worth of tokens from World Liberty Financial and joined the company as an advisor. Convenient!  Earlier this year, Reuters reported that several people who bought significant holdings of World Liberty tokens said a primary appeal was having a connection with Trump. Interesting! Also, World Liberty Financial is set up in such a way that the Trump family can lay claim to 75% of the net revenue. Very normal!

People have rightfully skewered Nancy Pelosi for her incredibly successful stock trading history, to the point where you can now ride the coattails of her trades that tend to overperform the market. It might be time to start doing the same thing by watching the crypto activity of World Liberty Financial. They sure seem to know something.

World Liberty Financial is expanding its token holdings.

The Trump-backed DeFi project will “explore product development opportunities” with layer 1 blockchain Sui, and “plans to include Sui assets in ‘Macro Strategy,’” the project’s token stockpile. 

That’s according to the Sui Foundation, which outlined the plans in a Thursday blog post. 

Sui’s native token, which has a market value of over $9 billion, jumped as much as 18% on the announcement.

The Sui deal is the latest in a growing list of crypto projects cosying up to World Liberty Financial, which has raised $300 million through sales of its WLFI token to investors since October. 

The news comes as World Liberty Financial buys up $20 million worth of so-called Wrapped Bitcoin, Ether, and Move tokens days before crypto executives are set to visit the White House to discuss policy.

The Sui blockchain uses the Move programming language, and is often pinned as a faster, more scalable competitor to Solana. Sui has $1.5 billion worth of crypto locked in its DeFi protocols, per DefiLlama data.

The crypto tokens World Liberty Financial buys often benefit from a surge in investor interest. 

When World Liberty bought $2 million worth of the Move blockchain’s token in January, it soared some 23%. 

World Liberty Financial isn’t owned by President Donald Trump, but he promotes it and benefits from its success. 

Trump and his sons Donald Jr, Eric, and Barron receive a split of the proceeds from the project’s WLFI token sales and future revenue, along with the project’s founders and collaborators, which include longtime Trump ally Steven Witkoff. 

World Liberty Financial has been stockpiling crypto for months. 

At first, it wasn’t initially clear why, but last month, onlookers received some clarity when the project announced it had been building what it called a “strategic token reserve,” called Macro Strategy. 

The reserve is intended to mitigate market volatility, foster growth, and build trust, the project said in an X post. 

However, there may be more going on with the token reserve than the project lets on. 

A February investigation by Blockworks found that World Liberty Financial had courted crypto teams for token swap deals.

Representatives for World Liberty Financial approached crypto teams with the offer to sell them at least $10 million worth of its WLFI token with a 10% fee. If accepted, World Liberty Financial then purchased the same amount of the buyer’s crypto token, sources told Blockworks.

Two crypto project founders also told DL News they had been offered similar deals.

The Sui Foundation did not respond to a DL News request for comment. 

World Liberty Financial’s token reserve includes Wrapped Bitcoin and Ether, as well as Tron’s TRX token, Ethena’s ENA token, and Ondo Finance’s ONDO token, along with several others.

Social security is a highly efficient safety net. But the president’s crypto plans and job cuts leave Americans holding the bag

Elon Musk said on Joe Rogan’s show last week that social security is “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”.

Rubbish. In a Ponzi scheme, a con artist lures investors into a fake investment project, pockets the cash, and then gets new “investors” to funnel cash to the older ones – until new recruits slow down and the whole thing collapses. Suckers are left holding worthless bags.

Social security is not a Ponzi scheme. It’s an exceptionally efficient part of the American social safety net – the opposite of a Ponzi scheme. Which is why the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose cutting it.

Social security is a “pay as you go” program. Current workers, via the payroll tax, fund payouts for retirees and disabled people. In 2024, about one in five US residents received social security.

I used to be a trustee of the social security trust fund. I know social security.

As the social security administration explains: “In 2025, when you work, about 85 cents of every social security tax dollar you pay goes to a trust fund. This fund pays monthly benefits to current retirees and their families and to surviving spouses and children of workers who have died. About 15 cents goes to a trust fund that pays benefits to people with disabilities and their families.”

The only reason social security is running out of money is that its trustees never anticipated America’s current degree of income inequality – with so much of the nation’s income in the hands of relatively few people (such as Musk).

The way to fix this is to lift the cap on income subject to social security payroll taxes, which is now $176,100.

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg fulfilled their 2025 social security payroll tax obligations a few minutes past midnight on 1 January. Most Americans keep paying payroll taxes all year.

You want a real Ponzi scheme? Look at the crypto investments Musk and Trump have hyped.

Trump’s new cryptocurrency, $Trump, soared and then crashed – exactly like a Ponzi scheme. It generated enormous profits for insiders and a cumulative $2bn in losses for more than 800,000 other investors.

Trump claims ignorance. “I don’t know if it benefited” me, he said. “I don’t know much about it.” (The Trump family and its business partners earned nearly $100m in trading fees alone on the coin.)

Musk has been promoting Dogecoin since 2019. Its value surged over 70% in the days following Trump’s announcement of the launch of Musk’s so-called 
 “department of government efficiency” (Doge). Since then, it’s dropped like a rock. A classic Ponzi scheme.

With Trump now in office, crypto is emerging from a four-year federal crackdown on crypto fraud, market manipulation and other scams following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX in 2022, one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in recent memory.

On Friday, Trump is holding a “crypto summit” at which he’ll promote the idea of a federal crypto reserve that will give crypto schemes a temporary boost by increasing demand for them.

But why should American taxpayers foot the bill for a crypto reserve? The most obvious winner will be Trump, whose own crypto venture carries millions of dollars in tokens that are to be included in the reserve. Other winners will be crypto executives, many of whom donated extensively to Trump’s re-election effort.

One example: Ripple – whose XRP token is one of the five that Trump said would be included – donated $45m to an industry-wide Pac that sought to help elect Trump and other Republicans.

In fact, most of Trump’s crypto schemes are just ways to curry his favor by paying him off.

Consider Justin Sun, a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur whom the Securities and Exchange Commission charged with securities fraud in March 2023.

After Trump was elected in 2024, Sun bought $30m worth of Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) crypto tokens, putting $18m directly into the president’s pockets. Since then, he has invested another $45m in WLF. Altogether, Sun’s investments have netted Trump more than $50m.

Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission just dropped its prosecution of Sun.

The SEC also dropped its case against the crypto trading platform Coinbase after the platform donated $75m to a political action committee associated with Trump and $1m to his inauguration.

To top it off, the SEC just ruled that “memecoins” aren’t securities, meaning that Trump’s novelty crypto tokens won’t be subject to any regulatory oversight. An open invitation to other Trump Ponzi schemes.

Trump and Musk are peddling a much bigger Ponzi scheme.

They’re promising huge “savings” from destroying the federal government (including wrecking programs like social security and Medicaid) – savings that will go to the US’s wealthy and big corporations in the form of tax cuts.

The social security administration recently announced it will consolidate the current 10 regional offices it maintains into four, and cut at least 7,000 jobs from an agency already at a 50-year staffing low.

The Republican budget recently pushed through the House cuts over $880bn most likely out of Medicaid.

Who will be left holding the bag? Most Americans.

Zoom out and you’ll see the entire Trump 2 regime is a giant Ponzi scheme – promising to “Make America Great Again” by raising tariffs, deporting over 11 million people, taking a wrecking ball to the federal government, pulverizing democracy and joining Putin and other global dictators.

Trump is the con artist behind this giant Ponzi scheme. He lured voters into his fake Maga project, pocketed some of the cash and rewarded his billionaires backers with more and will leave most Americans with a corrupt and decimated society.
