The United States offered a $10-million reward on Thursday for information leading to the arrest of a Canadian former Olympic snowboarder wanted on drug and murder charges.

Ryan Wedding, 43, who is believed to be in Mexico or another Latin American country, was also placed on the FBI's list of the "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives."

"Wedding went from shredding powder on the slopes at the Olympics to distributing powder cocaine on the streets of US cities and in his native Canada," said Akil Davis, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles field office.

"The alleged murders of his competitors make Wedding a very dangerous man," Davis said.

Wedding, whose aliases include "El Jefe," "Giant" and "Public Enemy," may possibly be living under the protection of the Sinaloa drug cartel, Davis said at a press conference.

Acting US Attorney Joseph McNally said Wedding had allegedly shipped hundreds of millions of dollars of cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the United States and Canada.

Alan Hamilton, chief of detectives for the Los Angeles Police Department, said Wedding used the southern California city as the hub for the drug smuggling operation.

"An estimated 60 metric tons of cocaine per year and five metric tons of fentanyl per month moved through Los Angeles on its way to US and Canadian cities," Hamilton said.

Wedding, who competed for Canada in snowboarding at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, finishing 24th in the parallel giant slalom, is one of 16 defendants facing US charges for their roles in the drug operation.

"The organization is violent, responsible for deaths as part of its criminal operations," McNally said.

These include the November 2023 murders of two members of a family in Ontario, Canada, in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment and a May 2024 murder in Niagara Falls, Ontario, over a drug debt.

The State Department is offering a $10-million reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Wedding.

Wedding's second-in-command, fellow Canadian Andrew Clark, 34, known as "El Dictador," was among 29 alleged or convicted narcotics traffickers extradited to the United States from Mexico last week.

People from Afghanistan and Pakistan might not be able to enter the United States from as early as next week as US President Donald Trump mulls a new new travel ban proposed, sources familiar with the matter said.

The ban is based on a review of the security and vetting risks of certain countries, the sources, who requested anonymity, said. Other countries may also be included, though the specifics remain unclear, according to three sources, who requested anonymity, cited in a Reuters report.

Other countries may also be included, though the specifics remain unclear, the report said.

The proposed ban could result in massive consequences for tens of thousands of Afghans who have been cleared to resettle in the US under refugee or Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs). These Afghans are at risk of Taliban retribution for assisting US efforts during the two-decade-long war in Afghanistan.

In January, Donald Trump issued an executive order mandating a review of foreign nationals seeking US entry, with the goal of identifying national security threats through intensified vetting. This order directed several government agencies to submit recommendations for a list of countries whose travel should be restricted due to inadequate screening by March 21, the Reuters report mentioned.

This new travel ban is part of Donald Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, which he first announced in October 2023. During that speech, he vowed to restrict immigration from countries like Gaza, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, as well as others deemed security threats.

Afghanistan and Pakistan are both expected to be on the list of countries subject to full travel bans, the sources cited in the report confirmed. The US departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which are overseeing the review, have not responded to requests for comment.

One source said out that Afghans cleared for resettlement undergo intense screening, making them "more highly vetted than any population" globally. Despite this, the State Department's office overseeing Afghan relocation efforts is seeking an exemption for SIV holders from the new ban, though approval is not guaranteed.

The department has also been tasked with preparing for the closure of the Afghan relocation office by April, as previously reported by Reuters.

Since the Taliban's takeover of Kabul in August 2021, following the US military withdrawal, the insurgency by ISIS's regional branch has further destabilised Afghanistan while Pakistan also faces its own security challenges due to violent Islamist militants.

Shawn VanDiver, head of #AfghanEvac, a coalition assisting in the resettlement of Afghans, urged those holding valid US visas to travel as soon as possible. 

"While no official announcement has been made, multiple sources within the U.S. government suggest a new travel restriction could be implemented within the next week," Reuters quoted VanDiver as saying.

Currently, around 2,00,000 Afghans are either approved for resettlement or have pending refugee or SIV applications. Many remain stranded in Afghanistan and other countries, including about 20,000 in Pakistan, following Donald Trump’s January order that froze refugee admissions and foreign aid funding for their flights.

US President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress this week and highlighted multiple examples of "appalling waste" funded by American taxpayers by the administration led by his predecessor, Joe Biden. 

During the 99-minute address on Tuesday, he claimed that the billionaire Elon Musk's government cost-cutting team, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has identified that the Biden administration spent $8 million on "making mice transgender".

"This is real," he said to laughter from his fellow Republicans.

Critics, however, challenged his claim and said the funding was meant for health studies that involved transgenic mice, not transgender mice, receiving treatments. Studies were conducted to figure out how these treatments might affect the health of humans who take them.

Transgenic mice are genetically modified mice that have had foreign DNA introduced into their genome, a process that is typically done to study the function of specific genes, model human diseases, or test potential treatments. 

The White House, however, later claimed that under the Biden administration, the National Institutes of Health spent millions of dollars to perform "transgender experiments on mice".

Citing examples that these studies exceeded $8.2 million, the White House said that $455,000 was spent on a study to test differences in the ways an HIV vaccine worked in mice that had received cross-sex hormone therapy.

It also said the National Cancer Institute awarded $299,940 to a project to compare breast cancer rates among female mice and those receiving testosterone therapy.

The White House said that $3.1 million was spent to investigate how hormones influence asthma outcomes, $2.5 million to examine the reproductive consequences of steroid hormone administration, $1.2 million to analyze androgen effects on the reproductive neuroendocrine axis and $735,113 for a study on how gender-affirming hormone therapy affects the microbiome in mice.

These projects, however, didn't involve physically transitioning mice from one gender to another and were aimed at figuring out the effects of hormones on disease, reproductive health, and immune responses.

 By Ryan Woo, Ethan Wang and Laurie Chen 

 BEIJING -China said on Friday it will "resolutely counter" pressure from the United States on the fentanyl issue and presented itself as a stable global power amid geopolitical turmoil, in an appeal to Global South countries. 

 Washington levied an additional 10% tariffs on Chinese imports this week over the continued flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the country, threatening to worsen an escalatory spiral of trade actions against China and other countries including Canada and Mexico. 

 "The abuse of fentanyl is an issue that the U.S. has to solve itself," Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a briefing on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary meeting. 

 "If one side blindly exerts pressure, China will resolutely counter that," he said, adding that both countries still have "broad common interests and space for cooperation". 

 "No country can imagine that it can suppress China on one hand while developing good relations with China on the other hand," Wang added. 

 He said that the U.S. "should not repay kindness with grievances, let alone impose tariffs without reason," referring to the "various assistance" Beijing has provided Washington over the years on the fentanyl issue. 

 Wang was also bullish U.S.-China tech competition, saying that "where there is a blockade, there is a breakthrough, and where there is suppression, there is innovation." 

 On resolving the Ukraine war, China wants to achieve a "fair, lasting and binding peace agreement" acceptable to all parties, Wang Yi said. 

 "China is willing to continue to play a constructive role in the final resolution of the crisis and the realization of lasting peace, in accordance with the wishes of the parties concerned, together with the international community." 

 Western countries have urged Beijing to take a more active role in using its economic leverage over Russia to stop the war, but Beijing has so far refused to publicly criticise its strategic partner. 

 In one of the first answers of the press conference, Wang said China-Russia relations are a "constant in a turbulent world, not a variable in geopolitical games". 

 Chinese President Xi Jinping recently reaffirmed Beijing's "no limits" partnership with Moscow in a telephone call with his Russian counterpart on the third anniversary of Moscow's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 

 U.S. President Donald Trump's administration recently began talks with Russia after virtually no contact since the war began, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Washington wished to "peel off" Moscow from Beijing. 

 GLOBAL SOUTH 

 Wang Yi also urged developing countries to "continue to improve our representation and discourse power in global governance", while facing pressure from the U.S. 

 "If every country emphasizes its own national priority and believes in strength and status, the world will regress to the law of the jungle, small and weak countries will bear the brunt, and the international rules and order will be severely impacted," said Wang in a veiled reference to Washington's actions. 

 "Major powers should assume international obligations and fulfill their responsibilities as major powers. They should not be profit-driven, and they should not bully the weak." 

 Within the first two months of taking office, President Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from several multilateral organisations and climate agreements, suspended most foreign aid, and voted against a United Nations resolution condemning Russia for the Ukraine invasion.

 BEIJING — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China will continue to retaliate to the United States’ “arbitrary tariffs” and accused Washington of “meeting good with evil” in a press conference Friday on the sidelines of the country’s annual parliamentary session. 

 Wang said China’s efforts to help the U.S. contain its fentanyl crisis have been met with punitive tariffs, which are straining the ties between the countries. 

 “No country should fantasize that it can suppress China and maintain good relationship with China at the same time,” Wang said. “Such two-faced acts are not good for the stability of bilateral relations or for building mutual trust.” 

 The two countries have been reengaging in tit-for-tat retaliatory tariffs since U.S. President Donald Trump’s return to office in January. The U.S. has imposed flat tariffs of 20% of all Chinese imports, while Beijing has countered with additional 15% duties on U.S. imports including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and expanded controls on doing business with key U.S. companies. 

 Regarding the Trump administration’s policy of safeguarding U.S. interests above international cooperation, Wang said such an approach, if adopted by every country in the world, would result in the “law of the jungle.” 

 “Small and weak countries will get burnt first, and the international order and rules will be under severe shock,” Wang said. “Major countries should undertake their international obligations … and not seek to profit from and bully the weak.”

US President Donald Trump said Thursday he planned to visit Saudi Arabia, suggesting a deal for major investment from the kingdom that has become the key venue for US diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine.

Trump, asked if he would meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia, confirmed his intention to visit the oil-rich Gulf nation but suggested that business was the main motive. 

"I'm going to Saudi Arabia," Trump told reporters, without mentioning a date.

"I said, I'll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies, (spreading) the purchase over a four-year period, of a trillion dollars," he said, referring to the duration of his presidency.

"They've agreed to do that, so I'm going to be going there."

Trump, who has yet to travel overseas since returning to the White House, made Saudi Arabia his first foreign destination after he took office in 2017.

He said recently that he decided to visit Saudi Arabia rather than Britain on his first trip in 2017 because the Arab kingdom promised to buy $450 billion worth of US products.

Trump has forged close business ties with Saudi Arabia, with the Trump Organization in December announcing a Trump Tower in Jeddah.

In his last term, Trump boasted of shielding Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from consequences over the killing of US-based Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, with the president citing the importance of Saudi purchases of US weapons.

Former president Joe Biden initially vowed to make the crown prince a "pariah" due to human rights but his administration later courted Saudi Arabia, including with a draft defense agreement, as it sought to encourage it to recognize Israel.

The Trump administration has vowed to move full-speed with trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to normalize with Israel, in what would be a landmark step as the kingdom is home to Islam's two holiest sites.

The Royal Family are reportedly planning to strip Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of their Sussex titles if they do not stop making damaging claims against the monarchy.

Just a year after she and Harry quit royal duties, Meghan publicly bashed the royal institution in a sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021. She even noted how they faced racism in the Royal spectrum.

Then, Spare, Prince Harry's tell-all memoir, hit the shelves in January 2023. The book detailed his conflicts with senior royals, including his father, King Charles III, and his brother, Prince William.

Although stripping the couple of their Sussex titles would require an Act of Parliament, sources suggest it remains an option should further controversial claims be made through interviews, books, or media projects. Daily Mail reported that discussions about this possible course of action have taken place within royal circles.

Meanwhile, Meghan has made a point of emphasizing the significance of her Sussex title, during a recent exchange in her new Netflix series, where she spoke with American actress Mindy Kaling.

“It’s so funny you keep saying Meghan Markle. You know I’m ‘Sussex’ now,” Meghan corrected Kaling during their conversation.

She then elaborated, “I didn’t know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go, ‘This is our family name. Our little family name.’”

“Well, now I know, and I love it,” Mindy replied.

“It’s our shared name as a family, and I guess I hadn’t recognised how meaningful that would be to me until we had children,” she told People Magazine. “I love that that is something that Archie, Lili, H, and I all have together. It means a lot to me.”

“It is part of our love story,” she concluded.

Daily Mail cited a royal insider suggested that Meghan’s repeated references to her title were “clearly a warning shot” directed at the monarchy.

The armed wing of Hamas said on Thursday it remained committed to its fragile ceasefire with Israel, after Donald Trump told the people of Gaza they would be "DEAD" if hostages held there are not freed.The first phase of the six-week-old truce expired at the weekend and talks on the deal's future have hit an impasse.

Hamas said Trump's threats would encourage Israel to ignore the deal, which largely halted more than 15 months of war in Gaza between Israel and Palestinian militants.

Trump had earlier floated a widely condemned plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza, prompting Arab leaders who met in Cairo this week to support an alternative.

A United States envoy praised Egypt on Thursday for coming up with the new plan, but did not endorse details of the proposed alternative.

Trump's warning followed his administration's revelation that it held unprecedented direct talks with Hamas -- listed as a "terrorist" group by Washington -- focused on American hostages in Gaza.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed Israel was consulted and said it had "expressed its opinion" on the talks.

"Despite all the enemy's attempts at evasion, lies and deception... we preferred and still prefer to adhere to the agreement in order to spare the blood of our people," Abu Obaida, spokesman for the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said in a video statement.

On Wednesday, Trump issued what he called a "last warning!" to Hamas leaders, telling the movement to immediately release all hostages "or it is OVER for you".

Israel killed Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar as well as the movement's military leader Mohammed Deif during the war in Gaza that began with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.

Trump also warned of repercussions for Gaza as a whole, where virtually the entire population has been displaced by Israel's military campaign in response to Hamas's attack.

"To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!"

Hamas's attack resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, most of them civilians, while Israel's military retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 48,446 people, also mostly civilians, figures from the two sides show.

Leaning on a cane outside a makeshift shelter in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, Mohammed Salim dismissed Trump's talk of turning the territory into hell.

"It has already become one," he said. "We have been devastated, our homes reduced to rubble, our sons, fathers and elders lost. There is nothing left to mourn."

- Israelis 'worried' -

Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim said Trump's words were pushing Israel to disregard the terms of the ceasefire in place since January 19, after more than 15 months of war.

"These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation to avoid implementing its terms," Qasim said, urging the United States to pressure Israel to enter the ceasefire's second phase, which is envisioned as leading to a lasting truce.

Analysts said the US-Hamas direct talks are a sign of dysfunction in talks to prolong the truce.

James Dorsey, an honorary fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute, said the direct talks would give Hamas "a sense of having been legitimised strongly".

The Israelis are in turn "obviously worried" by the outreach, he said.

The first phase -- negotiated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt -- brought a period of relative calm during which Israeli hostages were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and humanitarian assistance flowed into Gaza.

Israel, which on Sunday halted the aid flow, wants to extend the initial phase until mid-April.

- 'Good-faith' -

The US-Hamas talks were first reported by media outlet Axios, which said Washington's hostage envoy Adam Boehler met with Hamas in Qatar about the US captives but also about a longer-term truce.

Washington had refused direct contact with Hamas since designating it a terrorist organisation in 1997.

Of the 251 captives taken during Hamas's attack, 58 remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military has said are dead.

Five Americans are believed to remain among the hostages -- four have been confirmed dead and one, Edan Alexander, is believed to be alive.

The White House said Trump met with eight of the freed captives, who "expressed gratitude" for his efforts to bring them home.

"Hamas' actions have inflicted immense suffering, AND THEIR REIGN OF TERROR MUST BE STOPPED," the White House posted on X.

Trump previously triggered global outrage by suggesting the United States should "take over" rubble-strewn Gaza, turn it into the "Riviera of the Middle East" and relocate Palestinians to Egypt or Jordan.

Arab leaders this week endorsed an alternative plan that would finance Gaza's reconstruction through a trust fund, and would see the return of the Palestinian Authority to the territory.

The PA currently has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and is dominated by Hamas rivals Fatah.

"We need more discussion about it, but it's a good-faith first step from the Egyptians," Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy, told reporters in Washington.

The State Department, however, said Egypt's plan "does not meet the expectations."

Taiwan President Lai Ching-te denied that TSMC's investment decision was due to political pressure by the United States


	Taiwan's president and top chipmaker TSMC held a joint news conference Thursday to defend the company's decision to invest $100 billion in the US, saying it stemmed from customer demand and not pressure from the Trump administration.


	Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest chipmaker, said earlier this week it would invest $100 billion in three more chip manufacturing plants, along with two packaging facilities in Arizona.


	The decision sparked concerns that Taiwan would gain little in return for moving some of its most advanced manufacturing processes to the US.


	Taiwan President Lai Ching-te denied that TSMC's investment decision was due to political pressure by the United States. US President Donald Trump had previously said that Taiwan had taken away the US chip business and that he wanted it back.


	"TSMC's decision is necessary for its future development. The government did not face pressure from the United States during TSMC's investment process in the US," said Lai on Thursday.


	TSMC CEO CC Wei said that he had spoken with the firm's customers and realised that TSMC's current expansion plans in the US were insufficient to meet current demand.


	"Customer demand has been steadily increasing. For TSMC, our investment plans are based on customer needs, and we are very cautious," Wei said.


	"The amount of investment in the US may seem large, but it is still not enough to meet demand," he added.


	He also said that the development plans in the US would not affect TSMC's plans in Taiwan, and that the company currently had 10,000 employees researching and developing 1.0 nanometer chips.


	While Taiwan is a self-ruled island, Beijing sees Taiwan as a renegade province to be taken back by force if necessary.


	The US does not recognise Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.


	But the continued support of the US appears increasingly fragile under the Trump administration, who has contended that Taiwan relies too much on the US and needs to spend more on defence.


	A Pentagon nominee earlier this week said Taiwan should be spending about 10 per cent of its gross domestic product on defence to deter a war with China.


	Taiwan's Lai last month pledged to increase defence spending to over 3 per cent of its gross domestic product, up from less than 2.5 per cent.

A deadly missile strike hit a hotel in the hometown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy overnight, killing four people and injuring dozens.

Ukraine reports more than 100 drone strikes and two missiles were launched by Russia, following a similar attack a day earlier. One of the missiles hit a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, in central Ukraine. 

Scripps News sources in Ukraine said they received a missile alert ahead of the hotel strike. But international aid workers staying at the hotel said they had just 20 seconds of warning.

Zelenskyy didn't say whether any international aid workers were among the dead. It marks the second time in five months the hotel has been targeted by Russian strikes.

This comes as Zelenskyy is in Brussels, meeting with European officials after the U.S. suspended its military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. The U.K. has said it will increase its intelligence sharing to help make up for the U.S. withdrawal.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared that occupied Ukrainian territories, including Crimea, are officially part of Russia and the Kremlin wants full control of those areas. The Russian foreign minister says the current front lines are unacceptable to Russia.

The world's biggest YouTube star, MrBeast, had jumped in to sample Formula E's GEN3 Evo car at the Evo Sessions event on Thursday at the Miami International Autodrome, but crashed into the barriers on just his second lap.

The 26-year-old YouTuber - the most watched on the planet, with some 370 million followers - is at the Miami International Autodrome with Formula E this week, as Formula E hosts some of the world's most followed stars at its Evo Sessions event.

MrBeast - real name James 'Jimmy' Donaldson - set off for his first outing in the GEN3 Evo race car behind the Porsche Taycan Safety Car to get a feel for the Miami circuit and the world's fastest accelerating single-seater - capable of outdragging an F1 car to 60mph by some 30 percent, in a time of just 1.82 seconds.

Lap one went smoothly, but Mr Beast found himself spinning and in the wall through the first corners of his second lap. He wasn't hurt in the shunt, and was able to jump out of the car unaided when the medical car arrived on the scene.

Damage to the CUPRA KIRO GEN3 Evo race car - usually driven by German David Beckmann - looked to be limited but the session was halted for the car to be recovered to the pits.

MrBeast's initial outing was effectively guided tour of the track, as had been the case with the other personalities' opening efforts in Miami this week. Following the Safety Car meant the pace was limited so he could get used to the car and his surroundings but even so, its capabilities proved a little too hot to handle as out of a left hander in Sector 1, he span into a full 360, before clipping the wall with the left side of the car.

The team watched on, with driver Dan Ticktum cracking a smile after a little wince. Both the team and MrBeast joked and laughed about the shunt once he made it back to the garage with a sheepish "I did the thing..." as a nod to his foul up.

Evo Sessions is a motorsport-first that gives 11 personalities from the worlds of sport, tech and entertainment the unprecedented opportunity to get behind the wheel of the world’s fastest electric race car - the GEN3 Evo - and understand what it takes to reach the pinnacle of motorsport.

British Defence Secretary John Healey and his US counterpart Pete Hegseth are holding talks in Washington. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders met in Brussels, where he thanked Europe "for staying with us" during a turbulent week with the US.

Thursday 6 March 2025 19:42, UK

EU leaders have approved a statement in support of Ukraine without the backing of Hungary, an official has said.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has advocated for the bloc to support talks between the US and Russia.

Our Europe correspondent Siobhan Robbins said Orban's reluctance was well known heading into the meeting.

He had written an open letter outlining he couldn't back vows to continue support for Ukraine for as long as it takes.

In any case, Robbins said there has been a "sea change" across the continent over defence spending, with a "renewed focus" since Donald Trump came into power for a second time.

"It has become really apparent that they believe there is a new threat, that there is a new era," she added.

Money from frozen Russian assets held in Europe must be "unfrozen", a Ukrainian MP has just told us.

Speaking to our chief presenter Mark Austin, Lesia Vasylenko said it is a "just and fair way to tackle the aggressor".

European leaders are looking at how to utilise some £232bn of assets frozen by the G7 after Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron said last week the assets could be used as leverage in negotiations with Russia to end the war.

Some have also argued they could be dedicated to the reconstruction of Ukraine.

But Vasylenko told us: "Before we start rebuilding Ukraine, we must actually preserve Ukraine as it is as an independent country."

She also urged the UK to take a lead.

"It's a matter of political will and political will that needs to come from the UK - the UK can set the example for the rest of Europe and certainly Brussels will follow," she added.

We're now hearing from the US defence secretary, who is meeting with his UK counterpart John Healey.

Asked if Donald Trump's decision to halt military aid to Ukraine is permanent, Pete Hegseth says: "As the president has pointed out, it is a pause. Exactly what he said from the beginning. Pause - pending a true commitment to a path to peace."

He adds Trump is "paying a very keen eye" to what Kyiv is "saying and doing about committing to that peace process".

"And we're very encouraged by the signs we're seeing," he adds.

"Ultimately, he [Trump] will make the determination."

Moscow has already had much to say about comments made by Emmanuel Macron yesterday.

The French president suggested starting talks about using France's nuclear deterrent to protect Europe from Russian threats - comments blasted this morning as "confrontational" by Kremlin mouthpiece Dmitry Peskov.

Vladimir Putin also appeared to take aim at Macron today, saying there are still people "who want to go back to the times of Napoleon, forgetting how it ended".

Now Russia's foreign ministry has said his speech contained "notes of nuclear blackmail" and reflected Paris's ambition to "become the nuclear patron of all of Europe".

The ministry also warned Macron's statement "will be taken into account by Russia in its defence planning". 

Some remarks to bring you now from Donald Trump's special envoy.

Steve Witkoff, whose brief is officially for the Middle East but has been involved in negotiations with Russia, has just said a meeting with Ukraine is in the works.

Hailing Volodymyr Zelenskyy's letter to Trump - sent after their disastrous meeting in the White House last week - as a "positive first step", he continued: "We are now in discussions to coordinate a meeting with the Ukrainians in Riyadh or even potentially Jeddah."

"The city is moving around a little bit, but it will be Saudi Arabia," he added.

Washington is trying to agree a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire for Ukraine, he said.

Vladimir Putin says "some people" seem to have forgotten what happened to 19th century French emperor Napoleon, in comments seemingly directed towards Emmanuel Macron.

Yesterday, the French president called Russia a threat to Europe and raised the idea of putting
other European countries under France's nuclear umbrella in a televised address. 

Speaking this afternoon, Putin said: "There are still people who want to go back to the times of Napoleon, forgetting how it ended." 

Napoleon marched his French army across Russia and into Moscow in 1812 but was then forced into retreat with massive loss of life.

Senior Trump
administration officials will travel to Saudi Arabia to meet
with Ukrainian officials next week, according to reports.

The meeting will be held on Wednesday, Axios said, citing two unnamed sources.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio and others depart for Riyadh on Tuesday for the meeting, which will include top Zelenskyy aide Andriy Yermak, a Fox News reporter posted on X.

Earlier we brought you remarks from the Russian ambassador to the UK in an interview with Sky News' The World With Yalda Hakim.

Andrei Kelin said Russia wanted "quick peace" in Ukraine and the UK was at the "head of those resisting" it.

He ruled out NATO peacekeepers and said Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia should be recognised as Russian.

You can now watch the full interview below...

Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed an upcoming meeting among military officials from countries "willing to put in greater efforts to ensure reliable security in the context of ending this war".

The meeting will take place on Tuesday, he said, after the pair talked on the sidelines of the European Council meeting in Brussels.

"I thanked Emmanuel for his clear and principled stance in support of Ukraine and the need for new, more substantial steps to protect our entire Europe - our peoples, our institutions, and our European way of life," said Zelenskyy.

"We have an absolutely clear shared vision that real and lasting peace is possible through cooperation between Ukraine, all of Europe, and the United States. The war must end as soon as possible."

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has outlined his vision for how he thinks peace can be achieved in Ukraine.

The wartime leader says a truce including no attacks on energy and civilian infrastructure and on military operations in the Black Sea would be a good start.

"Everyone must ensure that Russia, the sole source of this war, accepts the need to end it. 

"This can be proved by two forms of silence: no attacks on energy and other civilian infrastructure – a truce for missiles, bombs, long-range drones; no military operations in the Black Sea."

He then says the release of prisoners "could serve as a means of establishing basic trust" which could then serve as a "prologue" to a "full and fair settlement".

This, he adds, would lead "to a comprehensive agreement on security guarantees and the end of the war".

"Ukraine is not only ready to take the necessary steps for peace, but we are also proposing those steps," he says.

Zelenskyy adds that Ukrainian and American teams "have resumed work" and he hopes that next week the two nations will have a "meaningful meeting".

'Europe must rearm'

Addressing today's summit of EU leaders in Brussels, Zelenskyy says he welcomes the European Commission’s efforts to rearm Europe.

"The ReArm Europe Plan is the right initiative," he says.

"The defence funds under this European Plan should strengthen all parts of Europe, and I call for a significant part to be allocated to arms production in Ukraine – our industrial capabilities are the fastest and most relevant to the current security threats."

Valerii Zaluzhnyi says Washington's recent actions in relation to Moscow could lead to the collapse of NATO and that Europe could become Vladimir Putin's next target.

Thursday 6 March 2025 14:47, UK

The United States is "finally destroying" the international rules-based order by trying to meet Russia "halfway", Ukraine's ambassador to the UK has warned.

Valerii Zaluzhnyi said Washington's recent actions in relation to Moscow could lead to the collapse of NATO - with Europe becoming Russian President Vladimir Putin's next target.

"The failure to qualify actions of Russia as an aggression is a huge challenge for the entire world and Europe, in particular," he told a conference at the Chatham House think tank.

"We see that it is not just the axis of evil and Russia trying to revise the world order, but the US is finally destroying this order."

Mr Zaluzhnyi, who took over as Kyiv's ambassador to London in 2024 following three years as commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, also warned that the White House had "questioned the unity of the whole Western world" - suggesting NATO could cease to exist as a result.

It comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy scrambles to repair relations with US President Donald Trump following a dramatic row between the two men in the Oval Office last week.

Mr Trump signalled on Tuesday that tensions could be easing, telling Congress he had received a letter from Mr Zelenskyy saying he was ready to sign a peace deal "at any time".

Mr Zaluzhnyi said the pause in cyber operations and an earlier decision by the US to oppose a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine were "a huge challenge for the entire world".

He added that talks between the US and Russia - "headed by a war criminal" - showed the White House "makes steps towards the Kremlin, trying to meet them halfway", warning Moscow's next target "could be Europe".

Currently in Columbia



















(CNN) — In the Faroe Islands, wild, unpredictable weather — fierce winds and rain, and thick fog that settles like a curtain — can sometimes make travel by car or ferry problematic. No wonder the Faroese love their tunnels.

They’ve built 17 of them on land and four subsea — including the world’s only subsea tunnel with a roundabout that’s underwater.

The network makes for easier navigation of the self-governing island nation within the Kingdom of Denmark.

“Though we are 18 islands, we often joke that (because of the tunnels) we defy the fact that we are islands,” says Súsanna Sørensen, marketing manager of Visit Faroe Islands. Located in the North Atlantic halfway between Iceland and Scotland, the volcanic islands’ unspoiled scenery wows visitors.

The two latest subsea tunnels are statement makers, too.

“These are our Eiffel Tower or Big Ben,” says Teitur Samuelsen, CEO of Eystur-og Sandoyartunlar, the company operating the tunnels, “with people, especially tourists, driving through them just to see the art.”

Art? Yes, indeed. A stunning marriage of art and engineering.

Every day, more than 6,000 vehicles travel through the nearly seven-mile (11-kilometer) subsea tunnel connecting Streymoy, the largest of the Faroe Islands and home to Tórshavn (one of the world’s smallest capitals), with Eysturoy, the archipelago’s next biggest island.

In addition to its stunning natural landscapes, Eysturoy is home to the G! Festival, an outstanding local and international musical event held each July in the waterfront village of Syðrugøta.

Construction of the Eysturoy Tunnel took about four years, opening in December 2020.

These subsea tunnels are created by using the drill and blast method: drilling holes in the basalt — a strong, igneous rock — and then packing the holes with dynamite.

At its lowest point, the tunnel is about 614 feet (187 meters) below sea level. And though having the North Atlantic over your head might provoke anxiety, you can feel confident in its construction, says Samuelsen.

“The tunnels are designed by the world‘s leading engineers and geologists, so safety with regards to the Atlantic above is not an issue,” he says.

Actually, the drive is kind of magical, with the highlight being a sculptural roundabout with shifting colors that is so striking, some compare it to the Aurora borealis or jellyfish glowing in the sunlight.

“The roundabout — nicknamed ‘the jellyfish’ — is certainly a tourist attraction,” says Sørensen. Many take several turns around the roundabout to soak up the mesmerizing scene.

Revered Faroese artist Tróndur Patursson was commissioned to create this vibrant installation. But why spend time and money putting art in subsea tunnels?

“We have a lot of good art in the Faroes, and we’d like to support our artists. In addition, it breaks up the monotony in a long, dark tunnel, so it’s good for driving safety,” says Samuelsen.

When this tunnel was created, a natural central basalt column was left standing for the roundabout where the tunnel branches off toward Strendur and Rókin, located on either side of a fjord on Eysturoy.

The central column, radiating clouds of color, is ringed at its base by a striking steel sculpture. Drivers gaze at a steel ring of silhouettes, life-size people holding hands around the pillar and looking inward at the ever-changing lights.

Patursson has said his intent was to represent how the Faroese, despite living in a rugged environment, are resilient, united in their accomplishments by working together. But for many, the circle of interlinked figures is evocative of the traditional Faroese chain dance that you’ll observe if you visit the Faroes for Ólavsøka, National Day, on July 29.

Beyond the visuals, the tunnel is also saturated with auditory art.

Musician Jens L. Thomsen composed the ethereal soundscape that you can listen to by tuning into FM97 when driving through.

The experience was created by “recording the sounds of the construction as well as the silence in the tunnel,” says Thomsen. Instead of using conventional instruments, “this technique allowed me to find the voice of the tunnel,” adds Thomsen.

The Eysturoy Tunnel isn’t the only dazzling undersea experience.

Since December 2023, Streymoy and the wee island of Sandoy have been connected by the latest subsea tunnel, the Sandoy Tunnel. About 1,000 vehicles a day navigate the approximately six-and-a-half-mile stretch that at its nadir is 508 feet (155 meters) below the North Atlantic.

You’ll find the visual and auditory art enthralling here as well. Along the rough basalt walls, almost a dozen glowing images reference some of the characters in Faroese folklore, such as a bishop wielding a battle ax, an old witch and a seal woman.

This is the creation of Edward Fuglø, a prominent Faroese artist, who put a contemporary take on ancient cave paintings. He also depicts birds as an homage to the self-taught, 19th-century bird painter Díðrikur á Skarvanesi, the first known visual artist in the Faroes.

Sunleif Rasmussen, a renowned Faroese composer, created the acoustic landscape.

“I had a dream of the melody,” says Rasmussen. He relied on some of the sounds of the tunnel, including water dripping during the construction, as well as music by the lead singer of the pop group Snowflakes to produce this inventive electroacoustic work.

This creates a surreal experience for those drivers tuning into FM100 while navigating this tunnel to Sandoy, where white, sandy beaches, tall sand dunes — the only ones in this archipelago — and an expansive lake that’s perfect for kayaking await.

“With all the well-developed tunnel infrastructure, it’s easy for our guests to move around the country,” says Sørensen.

With the roundabout tunnel, the driving time from the capital city Tórshavn to the island of Eysturoy was cut from about 60 minutes to about 15 minutes. It’s also easier to visit other islands.

“You can now drive from Tórshavn to Klaksvik, the second largest city (located on Borðoy), in just 45 minutes versus 75 minutes,” adds Sørensen.

The Sandoy Tunnel has been especially life-changing.

“More and more people are now moving to Sandoy from Tórshavn. In one village where 145 people live, 10 apartments are under construction. This is a lot for us,” says resident Barbara av Skardi, who would never have considered moving to Sandoy if it wasn’t for the tunnel.

“During winter, the ferry sometimes could be canceled for days” because of gusty winds and unpredictable currents, she says.

New businesses are opening, and others are seeing an uptick in visitors.

“Because of the tunnel, my wife, Barbara, and I both moved back to Sandoy and opened Cafe Retro,” says business co-owner Dávur Jacobsen.

And according to Ólavur Jøkladal, director of the Sandur Art Museum, “The number of visitors has more than doubled since the tunnel opened.”

These inventive undersea creations blend art and technology and mark a new era of connectedness for these remote islands.

The complex will provide recreational opportunities to all students, faculty and staff in addition to hosting ceremonies and other public and private events for the Northeastern and neighboring Boston communities.

Northeastern University is moving forward with plans to build a state-of-the-art, multi-purpose athletics and recreation complex on the site of Matthews Arena in Boston.

University leaders describe the new complex as an investment in the future that will provide recreational opportunities to all students, faculty and staff in addition to hosting ceremonies and other public and private events for the Northeastern and neighboring Boston communities.

The new multi-purpose complex will include a modern Division 1 athletics arena and training facilities that will elevate Northeastern’s varsity athletic programs, especially in the nationally recognized sports of basketball and ice hockey.

“This is a place where memories will be made,” says Ken Henderson, chancellor and senior vice president for learning at Northeastern. “This will be a place where we hold convocation, where we hold graduations, where we hold events for recreation, club sports and varsity sports. It will also be a place where students are coming together in small groups and large crowds.

“It will be transformational,” Henderson says.

The 310,000-square-foot complex will occupy the entire two-acre footprint of Matthews Arena, including areas currently used as surface parking lots.

It will include an arena that will seat 4,050 people for ice hockey and 5,300 for basketball, providing excellent sightlines for fans as well as for television broadcasts of Northeastern competitions. It will be Northeastern’s largest indoor gathering space, also enabling thousands of people to attend academic ceremonies and other non-athletic events.

The most profound improvement of the new multi-story complex is its commitment to serving a wide variety of university and community interests simultaneously, with an emphasis on student recreation.

Its multi-purpose nature will create myriad opportunities that cannot be matched by Matthews Arena, Henderson says.

“We love Matthews Arena, but it is a single-use space. It’s an arena where you can do one thing at a time,” Henderson says. “The new complex will have multiple events and activities going on at the same time. You could be having a hockey game at the same time as you’re having a club soccer game on the floor above — and perhaps a varsity basketball practice is being held, while other students are lifting weights and doing cardiovascular training at an individual level.”

Students will welcome greater access to recreational facilities, says Ella Freedman, a second-year undergraduate studying music industry and communication studies.

“I do think students — especially freshmen and new people coming in — will be excited about it,” Freedman says. “Everyone wants more space to work out. So that is a huge benefit for students and something a lot of people will look forward to. Having enough space for students to feel encouraged to have a healthy lifestyle is really important.”

The investment in a new complex will be worthwhile, says Emma Sullivan, who will be graduating with a degree in journalism and English in May.

“I won’t be a student by the time the new complex opens, but I do think it will be a really great opportunity for the next generations of Northeastern students,” Sullivan says. “Getting the opportunity to grow in that space is going to be really cool.”

Jim Madigan, a former ice hockey star and men’s coach at Northeastern who now serves as the university’s athletic director, envisions the new complex thrusting the Husky varsity programs to a higher competitive level.

“For our varsity sports, this building signals to our peers and our competitors that Northeastern represents excellence,” Madigan says. “It is going to be a game-changer for our programs to recruit the best student-athletes to Northeastern. It signals to them that we’re serious about the development and success of our student-athletes and it signals to our coaches that this is a place where we can win national championships and league championships, where we have the modern-day amenities to compete against any institution in the country.”

The men’s and women’s varsity basketball programs will each have a practice court, which will be a boon to recruiting, according to Madigan. There will be improved training facilities and office spaces for varsity athletes and coaches. An example of the new building’s versatility will be the presence of indoor rowing tanks for the men’s and women’s varsity teams.

For spectators, the arena will offer a “first-rate fan experience” with high-end concessions and multiple entry and exit points. Fans will be seated near the action with a dedicated section behind one of the hockey goals for the DogHouse, providing the Huskies with an impassioned advantage for home games.

“The building is going to offer food and entertainment and excitement and enjoyment,” Madigan says. “This is a complex that will be bringing people together. It’s going to create a sense of community, a sense of belonging throughout the university.”

The multipurpose athletic complex is the next step in an extended series of infrastructure investments on Northeastern’s Boston campus that have included the developments of International Village, East Village, the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex and EXP.

Since its 1979 purchase by Northeastern, Matthews Arena has served as a community venue for high school graduations and other events. That access will grow when the new complex is opened, says John Tobin, Northeastern’s vice president for city and community engagement.

“This new complex will allow us to increase our offerings with our neighbors and with our great partners in the City of Boston,” Tobin says. “It’s going to be more than just a building. It will serve as a vital part of Boston’s civic community from concerts to blood drives to Boston Public School ice hockey games. It will bring people together in ways that matter.”

Matthews Arena was originally constructed in 1910 and rebuilt in 1918 after a devastating fire. At that time it was known as Boston Arena, and over the years it would serve as a home to the Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics in addition to a wide variety of sporting, cultural and community events.

It was renamed by Northeastern in 1982 in honor of George Matthews, who would rise to chairman of the Board of Trustees, and his wife, Hope. 

Northeastern has invested millions of dollars in renovations of Matthews Arena over the years. The replacement of its historic features predating Northeastern’s ownership makes Matthews Arena ineligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, according to a 2023 evaluation conducted by Epsilon Associates.

The new complex, designed by the architectural firm Perkins&Will, is pursuing net-zero carbon certification and the deconstruction of the existing arena will capture reclaimed materials. Suffolk Construction is the contractor for the project, which will reuse rainwater for ice making, irrigation, and flushing, among other green initiatives.

During construction, the men’s and women’s basketball programs will move their games and practices to the Cabot Physical Education Center. Northeastern is making arrangements with local facilities to host the men’s and women’s hockey practices and games.

The project is awaiting final approvals from the city and state, which will determine the timelines for deconstruction and construction.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), shared details of a Pakistani national Syed Rizvi who arrived "illegally" in the US and was sent back on February 25.

In an X post shared on Thursday evening, the FBI said that it partnered with agencies across America to "remove a Pakistani national identified as a national security priority."

“The #FBI is partnering with agencies nationwide to support immigration enforcement operations. Learn how @FBIDallas, @ICEgov, and @ERODallas worked together to remove a Pakistani national identified as a national security priority.”

The statement issued by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), in this regard read, "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Dallas removed an illegally present Pakistani national identified as a national security priority to his home country Feb 25."

ICE Dallas shared the details of the Pakistani national.

"Syed Rizvi, 56, a Pakistani national was ordered removed from the U.S. after being identified by U.S. intelligence sources as a national security priority, designated as removable per the Immigration and Nationality Act."

It noted that Rizvi was residing in Dallas, Texas without authorization prior to his removal. "ERO Dallas arrested Rizvi Jan. 31, following a routine traffic stop. He was ordered removed by an immigration judge Jan. 24. Rizvi entered the United States legally Sep.20, 2017 near the New York port of entry and he violated the terms of his admission", the statement said.

Enforcement and Removals Operations Dallas Field Office acting Director Josh Johnson said, "Illegal aliens suspected or known to have ties to organizations that threaten public safety will not find refuge in the US."

He also added, "Our most important priority is to arrest and remove those who pose an imminent danger to the citizens of the U.S."

The details of Rizvi's deportation comes after FBI Director Kash Patel made a bold statement, reaffirming the US government's commitment to tracking down terrorists worldwide.

Patel's declaration came after a successful operation at Dulles airfield, where FBI personnel, along with DOJ and CIA partners, apprehended a terrorist wanted for the Afghanistan Abbey Gate murders in 2021.

Patel had said in a post on X, "To terrorists around the world responsible for harming Americans: We will hunt the ends of the earth and find you."

Trump Administration

Auto tariff pause: The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would allow carmakers to escape the tariffs imposed on all goods from Canada and Mexico for one month. The announcement came a day after President Trump imposed blanket 25 percent tariffs on all products entering the United States from those countries. The reprieve came after the president spoke with top officials at General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis. Read more ›

More V.A. cuts planned: The Veterans Affairs Department is planning to reduce its work force by more than 80,000 people, a major escalation of the downsizing efforts at the department that have already prompted pushback from Democrats and some Republicans. In announcing the cuts, Doug Collins, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, said that health care services and benefits would not be cut. Meanwhile, a judge ordered that nearly 6,000 Agriculture Department workers be reinstated.

Foreign aid ruling: The Supreme Court rejected Mr. Trump’s emergency request to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid, saying a lower court judge “should clarify what obligations the government must fulfill.” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the three liberal justices in a 5-to-4 vote. The case focuses on the U.S. Agency for International Development and aid the administration halted on Mr. Trump’s first day in office. Read more ›

In a Pentagon ceremony on Friday morning, Timothy C. Parlatore, a former naval officer who has been Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s personal lawyer for the past eight years, will be directly commissioned as a Navy commander in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps as a reservist.

Mr. Parlatore confirmed his plans in an interview on Wednesday evening, and said he will be assigned to a reserve unit that works for the secretary of defense’s office.

During his periods of reserve duty in uniform, Mr. Parlatore intends to focus on improving how the military’s uniformed lawyers are trained. When he returns to civilian life between his reserve obligations, he will continue to run his private practice.

In 2019, Mr. Parlatore successfully defended Eddie Gallagher, a SEAL accused of first-degree murder in the death of a captive ISIS fighter as well as the attempted murder of civilians in Iraq. That case brought Mr. Parlatore to President Trump’s attention, and he has appeared frequently on Fox News to discuss his defense of military clients.

A 2002 U.S. Naval Academy graduate, Mr. Parlatore served aboard the cruiser U.S.S. Normandy in Norfolk, Va., before taking an early release from active duty in 2005 to attend law school. While building his legal practice, he served as the officer in charge of a security detachment in the Bronx as lieutenant in the reserves, and was honorably discharged in 2013.

A federal appeals court cleared the way on Wednesday for the Trump administration to remove Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, from his position, lifting a lower court’s order that had allowed the federal watchdog lawyer to remain.

In a brief order on Wednesday evening, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the government had succeeded in arguing that an order keeping Mr. Dellinger in place should be lifted.

The ruling effectively dealt the Trump administration the upper hand in the struggle over Mr. Dellinger’s fate. The Supreme Court could weigh in on whether Mr. Dellinger and other officials who play a similar role in the executive branch are subject to removal and replacement by the president.

Lower courts had previously sided with Mr. Dellinger and Cathy Harris, a government lawyer on the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that reviews actions by the Office of Personnel Management. Both lawyers received letters last month notifying them that they had been fired.

The Supreme Court appeared to be poised to step in on at least one of those cases to issue the final word on whether those positions, which were created by Congress and designed to have certain independence, could be shielded from efforts to control them.

The appeals court decision also came as Mr. Dellinger and Ms. Harris had recently intervened on behalf of federal workers challenging their termination as the Trump administration shrinks the federal work force. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Dellinger issued a statement urging all agencies to rescind any “unlawful terminations” of probationary workers. Last week, a federal judge ruled that guidance sent by the Office of Personnel Management directing those firings was unlawful.

Michelle Bercovici, a lawyer who represents federal employees in litigation before the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel, said in an email that efforts to remove Mr. Dellinger had potential to jeopardize his agency’s advocacy on behalf of federal workers.

“The idea that the independent, primary watchdog of the civil service can be replaced by political whim is deeply unsettling and his termination is a true threat to the integrity of the government,” she said.

The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would overhaul a $42 billion federal grant program aimed at expanding high-speed internet to the nation, including easing some rules that could benefit Elon Musk’s satellite internet service, Starlink.

The program will be revamped to “take a tech-neutral approach” in its distribution of funds to states, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. The program’s rules, which were created during the Biden administration, previously favored broadband lines made of fiber-optic cables attached to homes.

“The department is ripping out the Biden administration’s pointless requirements,” Mr. Lutnick said. The Commerce Department will also remove regulatory and other barriers that slow down construction and connection to households, he added.

Congress created the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program in 2021 to extend broadband to the most remote areas of the nation. The Commerce Department came up with standards and rules for states and territories applying for the funds — including the preference for fiber-optic broadband, which provides the fastest internet service speeds.

Mr. Musk, who is a close adviser to President Trump and helping to lead a government efficiency initiative, is chief executive of SpaceX, the rocket company that makes Starlink. Starlink uses low-altitude satellites to beam internet service to dishes anywhere on the planet and then to devices. It serves nearly five million subscribers worldwide and was used by emergency responders late last year in North Carolina when communications networks shut down after a hurricane.

The Commerce Department’s internet program has not yet disbursed any funds, and Republicans have used it as an example of a program that was slowed down by red tape.

Some have accused the Biden administration of unfairly blocking Starlink from the grants and say the satellite service can immediately serve some of the most remote areas of the nation.

In 2023, the Federal Communications Commission rejected Starlink’s application for almost $900 million in subsidies in a separate rural broadband program, saying the company failed to show it could meet service requirements for the funding.

Brendan Carr, then a Republican F.C.C. commissioner and now chairman of the agency, opposed that decision and said the action had put the F.C.C. on a “growing list of administrative agencies that are taking action against Elon Musk’s businesses.”

Mr. Musk’s business interests — which also include the electric-car maker Tesla and the social media company X — have prompted concerns about potential conflicts of interest as he makes important decisions in Washington.

On Wednesday, some public interest groups expressed concern that Mr. Lutnick’s plans to change the broadband program could directly benefit Mr. Musk.

“Fiber broadband is widely understood to be better than other internet options — like Starlink’s satellites — because it delivers significantly faster speeds,” said Drew Garner, a director of policy engagement for the nonprofit Benton Institute for Broadband & Society.

The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to requests for details on the plan. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.

A three-judge panel from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals lifted an injunction on Wednesday evening that had allowed Hampton Dellinger, the head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, to keep his job after attempts by the Trump administration to remove him. A lower court had found that Mr. Dellinger’s role should be insulated from political efforts to replace him. He will likely appeal to the Supreme Court.

The U.S. Capitol Police said the chief of staff to Speaker Mike Johnson was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving on Tuesday night after the top aide backed his car into a parked Capitol Police vehicle.

The arrest came soon after President Trump, with Mr. Johnson presiding behind him, finished delivering his first address to a joint session of Congress since returning to office.

“A driver backed into a parked vehicle last night around 11:40 p.m.,” a Capitol Police spokesman said in a statement. “We responded and arrested them for D.U.I.”

Mr. Johnson’s office confirmed on Wednesday that Hayden Haynes, the speaker’s chief of staff, was involved in an “encounter” with Capitol Police on Tuesday night, releasing a statement that indicated that he would continue to hold his powerful post.

“The speaker has known and worked closely with Hayden for nearly a decade and trusted him to serve as his chief of staff for his entire tenure in Congress,” Taylor Haulsee, Mr. Johnson’s spokesman, said in a statement about the arrest, which was reported earlier by NBC News. “Because of this and Hayden’s esteemed reputation among members and staff alike, the speaker has full faith and confidence in Hayden’s ability to lead the speaker’s office.”

Mr. Haynes was released with a citation, rather than taken to jail, and would have a court date “within the coming weeks,” according to the Capitol Police. Since drunken-driving cases in Washington, D.C., are prosecuted by the district’s attorney general rather than the U.S. district attorney’s office under the Justice Department, the Trump administration would have no apparent role in the case.

The National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit that has had bipartisan support over decades for its work promoting democracy abroad, is suing the U.S. government and cabinet officials for withholding $239 million in congressional appropriations.

Members of the group’s board, which includes current and former Republican and Democratic lawmakers, said the organization filed the lawsuit on Wednesday afternoon as a last resort because it had been unable to get the State Department to restart the flow of money.

The group is also asking a court to prevent the government from withholding any future funds appropriated by Congress.

The group has had to put about 75 percent of its staff on unpaid leave, and about 1,800 grant projects have received no money since late January, after President Trump signed an executive order freezing all foreign aid.

In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, the group argues that its money from Congress is not foreign aid and does not fall under the purview of the State Department, which manages the transfer of funds, or any other executive branch agency. Withholding the funding, the board members say, is illegal.

Peter Roskam, a former Republican congressman from Illinois who chairs the nonprofit, said the board voted on Tuesday to go to court.

“We’d be delighted to learn that this was just an oversight and someone just forgot to hit the send button,” he said in an interview on Wednesday, minutes before the lawsuit was filed. “But clearly that’s not what’s going on.”

The endowment’s plight is emblematic of the colossal shift in foreign policy that is taking place in the second Trump administration, as the president tries to move the government away from work aimed at strengthening values-based alliances, democracy and human rights toward a more nakedly transactional and nationalistic approach.

Mr. Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the House of Representatives voted to impeach him for a second time because of his incitement of a riot at the Capitol against lawmakers certifying Mr. Biden’s win.

Some senior administration officials have adopted language, including phrases once common among progressive critics of the U.S. government, about the downside of American projects that seek to extend influence across societies abroad, calling such programs “nation-building” and attempts at “regime change.”

Representatives for the White House, the State Department and the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.

Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser to Mr. Trump, posted scathing criticism of the National Endowment for Democracy online last month, saying without providing evidence that it was “RIFE with CORRUPTION!!” “That evil organization needs to be dissolved,” he wrote, using the same conspiratorial language he has employed to describe the U.S. Agency for International Development, which Mr. Musk has helped dismantle.

Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican who is Mr. Trump’s pick for ambassador to the United Nations, was on the National Endowment for Democracy board until she had to step down to prepare for Senate confirmation for her new job. Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, is currently on the board.

Mr. Trump’s “America First” policy has also been brought into sharp relief in recent weeks by his criticism of democratic Ukraine in its defensive fight against Russia; his imposing of high tariffs on two allies, Canada and Mexico; his insistence on taking mineral-rich Greenland from Denmark, another ally; and his decision to cut off almost all U.S. foreign aid, which strategists have seen as an important component of American soft power.

The grants the National Endowment for Democracy gives out are focused on promoting democracy, free speech and religious freedoms in more than 100 countries and territories, including ones that the first Trump administration and the Biden administration considered rivals or adversaries — China, Russia, Belarus, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela and Cuba.

The grants fund projects such as the development of software that allows citizens to view banned websites and efforts to support independent journalism.

One recipient, China Labor Watch, a New York-based group with overseas offices, monitors the coerced labor and trafficking of Chinese workers. Its founder, Li Qiang, said in an interview that he had not received $150,000 of National Endowment for Democracy funds he had been expecting this year, and that most funding directly from the State Department was still frozen. He has had to lay off workers or put them on unpaid leave.

Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator representing Florida, said the Trump administration’s unwillingness to release funding for organizations that support overseas dissidents was an affront to exiles from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. “That entire group of people are politically active,” he said. “Many have been strong supporters of the president.”

In Venezuela, National Endowment for Democracy grants support independent groups that monitor elections and help provide legal defense to dissidents targeted by the autocratic government.

Authoritarian governments, including those of China and Russia, have denounced the work of the endowment over many years.

The lawsuit noted that the sudden halt in funding further endangers grant recipients living under a hostile government: “The freezing of the endowment’s funds poses special risk to partners operating in highly authoritarian contexts, as the sudden interruption in support may expose their operations and staff as endowment grantees.”

The group traces its origins to a speech by President Ronald Reagan to the British Parliament in 1982. He vowed that “the march of freedom and democracy” would “leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash-heap of history.” Congress passed a law establishing the National Endowment for Democracy the following year.

The endowment gives funding to several sister nonprofits, notably the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. Those groups are also ending programs because of the funding freeze. Several Senate allies of Mr. Trump, including Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, sit on the International Republican Institute board.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a defendant in the lawsuit, is a former board member.

The Republican group’s website says it has had to disable its operations to save on expenses, but a page aims to remind people of the work that it does: “Dictators are afraid of their own people. Helping citizens have a voice in their country is at the heart of what I.R.I. does.”

Last November, a post on the group’s X social media account, which is now defunct, congratulated Mr. Rubio on being picked to be Mr. Trump’s secretary of state and called him a “leading champion of freedom.”

David Super, a professor who studies administrative law at Georgetown University, said the National Endowment for Democracy’s case had some similarities to a lawsuit filed by contracting companies for U.S.A.I.D. The Trump administration also froze that agency’s funds. In both cases, Mr. Super said, Congress had passed “clear, mandatory authorizing and appropriations statutes.” Withholding money from the endowment, he said, “is clearly violating both laws.”

Bradley J. Bondi, brother of Attorney General Pam Bondi, has announced his candidacy to lead the bar association in Washington at a time when the group might be asked to consider accusations that political appointees at the Justice Department violated professional or ethical norms.

Mr. Bondi, a partner at Paul Hastings, a global white-collar criminal defense firm with offices in Washington, threw his hat in the ring in late February, according to a roster of candidates posted on the association’s website.

The three-year position of president at the 118,000-member association is unpaid. The role does not extend to controlling disbarments and other disciplinary actions, which are handled by a board of professional responsibility that is appointed and overseen by a court, according to the association’s bylaws.

But his candidacy comes at a time when Ms. Bondi, like many other Trump appointees, is quashing internal dissent and seeking retribution against President Trump’s perceived enemies in ways that have challenged norms of prosecutorial independence from politics.

The D.C. Bar, a mandatory body to which every lawyer practicing in Washington, D.C., is required to register, oversees disciplinary actions, such as when it acted to disbar former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York for promoting lies about the 2020 election.

It could soon become a venue to resolve complaints about the conduct of other Trump allies. Former prosecutors and Democrats are considering filing complaints against department officials over what they claim are efforts to inject politics into prosecutorial decision making, particularly at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington.

The D.C. Bar’s election period starts next month and ends in early June. Mr. Bondi’s opponent is Diane A. Seltzer, a Maryland-based lawyer who runs a small firm specializing in employment law. She has been far more active in the bar association than Mr. Bondi.

Mr. Bondi, 51, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Bondi, a former top staff member at the Securities and Exchange Commission, was already a well-known and deeply connected defense lawyer in Washington before his sister became attorney general. But his professional life has, in recent years, intersected with people in her orbit — including Mr. Trump’s business associates and Elon Musk.

He represented Tesla Inc. in a 2018 settlement with the S.E.C. over Mr. Musk’s social media posts about taking the company private. Six years later, Trump transition officials considered Mr. Bondi as a candidate to run the commission, but opted for Paul Atkins, whom Mr. Bondi has described as a close friend.

Last year, Mr. Bondi’s practice group at Paul Hastings was hired to represent Miami-based Digital World Acquisition Corp., in its merger negotiations with Mr. Trump’s media company.

Ms. Bondi later reported owning nearly $3 million in Trump Media shares after the parent company of Truth Social went public a year ago, according to financial disclosures.

In January, a group of investors seeking to buy TikTok enlisted Mr. Bondi to prepare a bid. Mr. Trump later reversed President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ban on the Chinese social media app.

Shortly before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Bondi signed on to represent Carolina Amesty, a former Republican state legislator in Florida charged by federal prosecutors with stealing $122,000 in pandemic relief aid, according to court filings.

Mr. Bondi has given more than $25,000 to political committees in support of Mr. Trump since 2020, according to federal campaign finance records. But he does not seem to share Mr. Trump’s determination to roll back diversity and inclusion efforts, a cause enthusiastically championed by his sister.

In 2021, Mr. Bondi set aside $100,000 to create the “Bradley J. Bondi Diversity and Inclusion Endowed Scholarship” at the University of Florida College of Law, his alma mater.

Congressional memo

After the 2004 elections, a Republican president, newly returned to office, decided the political moment was right to overhaul Social Security, making it more like private retirement plans in a bid to prevent it from going bankrupt in the future. Two years and a bruising political fight later, Democrats took back the House and Senate from Republicans.

Democrats now believe history may be about to repeat itself.

Elon Musk, the multibillionaire overseeing the Trump administration effort to drastically shrink government, has derided the nation’s most popular federal program as a sketchy pyramid scheme while pushing to close offices and eliminate thousands of jobs of those who administer the program. In doing so, he has touched a topic that has traditionally been known as the third rail of American politics. And Democrats, who increasingly regard Mr. Musk as a more opportune political target than even President Trump himself, have rushed to highlight what they consider to be a major political blunder.

“They don’t learn,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said of Republicans as his party pounced on the issue. “Their biggest mistake was going after Social Security when George Bush was president. And now they are doing it again.”

Illustrating the emphasis Democrats intend to put on the subject, Senator Elissa Slotkin, the Michigan Democrat who delivered her party’s rebuttal to Mr. Trump’s congressional address on Tuesday night, hit on Social Security as well, using it to cast doubt on the president’s vows not to touch the federal retirement program.

“The president claims he won’t, but Elon Musk just called Social Security the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” she said in her remarks, quoting a social media post by Mr. Musk.

Democrats were already pressing Republicans on potential cuts to Medicaid, the government health coverage program for lower-income Americans, but they view threats to Social Security as having broader resonance.

Congressional Republicans respond that Democrats are distorting the Trump administration’s — and their — position on Social Security and that they are simply trying to bolster the finances of the program to guarantee that it won’t run out of money, allowing future generations, like past ones, to get the money they paid in.

“We need to make sure that Social Security is strengthened and saved for the future so that everyone who’s paid in can get it,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Senate Republican.

Social Security has long been the political backbone of the Democratic Party. For years, Democrats have capitalized on the slightest hint of any attempt to dismantle or privatize it, as they did when President George W. Bush pushed the idea in 2005, much to the detriment of his party’s midterm election fortunes.

The issue is so volatile that when Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, put forward a policy agenda during the 2022 midterm elections that would have theoretically required the program to expire and be re-evaluated, he was immediately repudiated by Republican leaders and eventually had to disavow his own plan.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly emphasized that he has no plans to tinker with Social Security or Medicare. But Democrats see something afoot with Mr. Musk’s derogatory comments and Mr. Trump’s claims that the program is riddled with fraud.

Despite multiple reviews that have found Social Security to be one of the better-run federal programs with a record of never missing payments, Mr. Musk has characterized the program as riddled with fraud and waste.

Mr. Trump emphasized that theme in Tuesday night’s address, saying that millions of obviously long-dead beneficiaries remain on the Social Security rolls. But the claim he and Mr. Musk make that benefits still flow to those people has been widely debunked. The agency says that it is a data recording problem, and has reported that just under 90,000 people 99 years or older received Social Security benefits in December — slightly more than the 85,000 Americans over the age of 100 recorded by the Census Bureau.

Still, Democrats see the focus by Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump on erroneous claims of fraud as laying the groundwork for a benefit review that could affect those lawfully receiving monthly benefits as Republicans search for ways to offset the cost of hugely expensive tax cuts.

Democrats say an equal threat to the program are plans to reduce the work force that had already shrunk, including an effort to pare down as many as 7,000 employees while consolidating regional offices and ending the leases on dozens of field offices around the country. They say the loss of personnel and the shuttering of offices would be tantamount to denying benefits to applicants who would face long waits to talk to advisers or to receive their assistance.

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said such delays would break the inherent promise of Social Security that Americans can collect what they contributed.

“Part of that promise means being able to get on the phone with an actual human being without having to wait on hold for an hour or more, visit an in-office person to help you get your benefits without having to jump through hoops or drive hundreds of miles,” Ms. Murray said. “But Trump and Elon are decimating the Social Security Administration and without adequate staff at the agency, there will be people who cannot get their benefits period.”

Some Republicans also expressed concern about how cuts could affect the level of service their constituents receive.

“I do know that it is a whole lot easier to work your way through Social Security benefits if you’re doing it in person with somebody who is well trained in how the system works,” said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota. “Trying to do any of that stuff online is much more difficult.”

But Mr. Rounds also credited Mr. Musk with bringing attention to the fiscal condition of Social Security, which is in such dire financial trouble that benefit cuts could come within a decade if nothing changes.

“He’s at least ringing the alarm that the rest of us have tried to do,” said Mr. Rounds, who added that obvious fixes were available.

Multiple ideas are circulating to stabilize the program, such as lifting the current $176,100 cap on the amount of pay that is taxed for Social Security.

“If Congress eliminated the payroll tax cap for individuals with annual income in the millions of dollars — an amount Elon Musk makes every two hours — and collected the money they are illegally evading in taxes, Social Security would be fully funded for decades,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee.

But no one on Capitol Hill is talking seriously about raising that cap any time soon. For now, the push by Mr. Musk to shrink the agency and the beneficiary rolls will guarantee that Social Security remains at the center of the clash over federal spending in the coming months and next year’s elections.

The Senate on Wednesday confirmed President Trump’s criminal defense attorney Todd Blanche to take the No. 2 position at the Justice Department, where he has vowed to end the kind of investigations and prosecutions that led to indictments against his client.

Mr. Blanche’s nomination to be the deputy attorney general, with oversight of the F.B.I.; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and other federal law enforcement agencies, passed 52 to 46 in a mostly party-line vote.

A former federal prosecutor in New York, Mr. Blanche was in private practice as a defense lawyer when he agreed to take on Mr. Trump as a client, assembling and managing a legal team to defend him against four separate indictments.

He was Mr. Trump’s attorney in his New York State trial last year on charges of falsifying business records. Mr. Trump was convicted of all 34 counts, but he and his lawyers, including Mr. Blanche, have denounced the case as a misuse of prosecutorial power.

Mr. Blanche carried that argument, and his anger, into his confirmation hearing last month. He told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was still “frustrated” by what he called the unfair treatment of his client by judges and prosecutors. “That’s power, and that’s power that’s corrupted,” he said.

Mr. Blanche is the most prominent of several lawyers who have represented Mr. Trump in private practice who are now poised to take senior positions within the Justice Department. Democrats have raised concerns that their elevation to those roles will create inherent ethical conflicts, but Mr. Blanche and the other Trump lawyers have downplayed such concerns.

At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Blanche confirmed that his “attorney-client relationship with President Trump remains,” but added that he “will not violate my ethical obligations.”

He also discounted any suggestion that he might be put in a difficult position by the president, who had a contentious relationship with Justice Department leaders during his first term.

“I don’t think President Trump is going to ask me to do anything illegal or immoral,” Mr. Blanche said. “I say that with experience and firsthand knowledge.”

Elon Musk arrived on Wednesday at Senate Republicans’ weekly luncheon on Capitol Hill ready to field questions about the work he is doing for President Trump at the Department of Government Efficiency, the office he formed that has taken a hatchet to the federal bureaucracy with no input from Congress.

They had plenty.

Republican senators have raised few public complaints about Mr. Musk as he has undertaken mass firings across the government without consulting or informing them. But during the nearly two-hour closed-door meeting, the senators gently questioned him about how they might share feedback, minimize blowback from their constituents and, perhaps, eventually get to vote on the cuts he is making.

At one point during the largely friendly exchange, Mr. Musk, who made no presentation of his own, shared his personal phone number with senators and encouraged them to reach out directly with any concerns.

“We’re getting feedback, and we want to respond to our constituents — how do we work most effectively to do that?” Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota said after the meeting, in characterizing the tenor of his colleagues’ questions.

Other Republicans said they were simply trying to figure out how they could help Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump succeed.

“There was just a general discussion about how we can make his cuts permanent,” said Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana. “There was general discussion about how we, as senators, can do a better job of explaining clearly what he’s doing.”

The gathering highlighted the conundrum that DOGE’s slash-and-burn approach has created for a number of Republican lawmakers. Many of them genuinely believe the federal government and work force should be scaled back, and most are exceedingly reluctant to criticize Mr. Trump or Mr. Musk, who has a penchant for using his social media platform X to unleash a barrage of abuse against his critics, including Republican lawmakers.

But they are also facing intense pushback from constituents at home affected by sprawling cuts and layoffs.

In some cases, that has fueled an awkward two-step for Republicans, who have simultaneously praised the work DOGE is doing while also quietly seeking exemptions and special consideration for funding that helps their own constituents.

“People were eager to have more feedback opportunities,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who praised Mr. Musk’s efforts on the Senate floor ahead of the meeting.

Mr. Musk took a largely deferential tone toward senators, according to lawmakers who attended. When one senator stood and asked whom to contact with questions about the group’s efforts, one of Mr. Musk’s senior advisers volunteered her contact information. Mr. Musk interjected and said senators could contact him directly, a person who witnessed the exchange said.

While he told senators a major target was waste at the Pentagon — typically a place where Senate Republicans have refused to entertain spending cuts — he made a point of relaying an anecdote that Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, had shared with him. In recounting that story, which he has previously discussed, he said Ms. Collins gave the Navy money for more submarines, but no new submarines were produced.

Senators said they were interested in trying to codify the cuts Mr. Musk’s group has already targeted — a move that would endorse DOGE’s actions while also reclaiming Congress’s power of the purse.

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky suggested that lawmakers ultimately should vote on the cuts DOGE has ordered using the recission process, which allows the president to ask Congress to cancel certain funds lawmakers have appropriated.

Mr. Paul suggested that the Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday in which a majority of justices rejected Mr. Trump’s emergency request to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid indicated that using the recission process would be more fruitful than unilateral attempts by the executive branch to halt funding.

“This is a bigger argument than just one person,” Mr. Paul said in an interview.

He added: “Either the cuts and all the great things I think Elon is finding evaporate — they’re ephemeral — or we put them into a rescission package, they send them back to us, and we vote up or down on getting rid of them.”

Mr. Musk appeared supportive of the idea, according to several senators who attended.

“He said at one point, ‘You guys are going to have to act here to make any of this permanent,’” Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said.

Mr. Musk also briefed House Republicans at the Capitol later on Wednesday night, in another closed-door meeting that lasted roughly two hours. The message lawmakers sent him, according to Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina: “Speed up, don’t slow down.”

Over the last three decades, since the North American free trade zone was created in 1994, automakers have built supply chains that cross borders. Cars assembled in the United States by American companies often have components that come from all over the world, and parts regularly cross the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico. Read more about how global car production has become, making it hard to say what’s American-made.

Reporting from Washington

The Supreme Court’s Wednesday ruling that the Trump administration must heed a lower court’s order to release frozen foreign aid was a welcome but confusing development for humanitarian and development organizations around the world, as they waited to see if thousands of canceled contracts would be restarted.

For weeks, the Trump administration has worked to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, the federal agency chiefly responsible for disbursing foreign aid.

Thousands of nongovernmental groups and companies that once partnered with it have been in limbo since the administration canceled over 90 percent of contracts, neutered the agency’s payments system and reneged on promises to pay for work already completed.

The organizations that brought the lawsuit have insisted that the court’s ruling ought to force the Trump administration to restore all foreign aid funding. But the administration has been adamant that it was within its rights to decimate the agency.

Here’s where things stand, and how this court order is expected to play out.

President Trump has argued that some U.S.A.I.D. programs were counter to American interests, too “woke” and too expensive. On the first day of his second term, he signed an executive order to pause all foreign aid for 90 days, pending a review of programs to determine whether they aligned with his foreign policy objectives.

The administration has stated in its court filings that the review was “largely completed,” after it announced its decision last week to terminate funding for about 5,800 contracts. Those contracts comprised over 90 percent of U.S.A.I.D.’s remaining caseload. On Wednesday, however, Pete Marocco, the State Department official who has been overseeing the cuts to the agency, told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the review was in its early stages.

The total funding allotted to U.S.A.I.D. programs before the cuts amounted to less than 1 percent of the overall federal budget.

At this point, extremely little.

Shortly after Mr. Trump issued his executive order, Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, allowed programs providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance to avoid the 90-day freeze and review.

But in practice, almost all of the programs that had received waivers were unable to access funds to continue operating. Even a program to help contain an Ebola outbreak in Uganda was unable to access the money it needed.

In recent days, a trickle of organizations received notice that their contract termination notices had been reversed. Among the revived contracts was one to procure H.I.V. medicines and manage supply chains to ship those drugs to countries with high rates of infection. A program to spray long-acting insecticide inside the homes of people in areas of Kenya and Uganda with some of the highest rates of malaria infection in the world was also permitted to resume, until April 30.

But the changes in status have been scattered and erratic. According to Tom Hart, the head of InterAction, a U.S.-based alliance of international nongovernmental aid organizations, some groups whose contracts were canceled were notified that they had been reinstated and then canceled again.

And nearly none of the reversals of terminations have come with restored funding, obliging partners to front the funds through corporate lines of credit and other sources, if they wish to resume their work.

This is the million — or really, billion — dollar question.

The Supreme Court’s one-paragraph order kicked the matter of determining how much foreign aid had to be restored back to Judge Amir H. Ali of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. It was his order to release the funding that the Trump administration had appealed to the Supreme Court. The administration’s broad cancellation of contracts happened after Judge Ali’s order — and it is not clear if the Supreme Court’s ruling could force the administration to restore all the contracts it canceled.

Democrats on Capitol Hill, who see the cuts to U.S.A.I.D. as flouting the will of Congress, which created the agency, insist that the ruling is absolute.

“They’re defying the constitutional rules of Congress. Are they also going to defy the constitutional obligations by the Supreme Court?” asked Representative Julie Elizabeth Johnson, Democrat of Texas, after members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee met with Mr. Marocco on Wednesday.

But the Trump administration has insisted that it has the authority, separate from the president’s executive order, to end programs that it deems counter to U.S. interests. And Republican allies insist the court could not take that power away.

“We don’t interpret that the court should read that in that way,” said Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and chairman of the foreign affairs panel. “We’re going to continue to fight it.”

A variety of lawsuits challenging the cuts to the development agency have been working their way through the courts. Wednesday’s ruling was in a case initially brought by the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Journalism Development Network, challenging the administration’s aid freeze as organizations that had been promised those funds.

But a parallel suit from unions representing U.S.A.I.D. employees was not able to stop the Trump administration from laying off the agency’s contractors and putting the vast majority of direct hires on leave, as part of a plan to reduce the agency’s staffing from about 10,000 to mere hundreds of staff members deemed “essential.”

Without the majority of its staff, it is unclear how the agency would administer programs if they were restored.

Judge Ali will hold a hearing on Thursday to consider whether to turn his temporary restraining order largely lifting the administration’s freeze into a more muscular judicial command, a preliminary injunction. He has said that he intends to issue his ruling “with full dispatch.”

The temporary order is set to expire on Monday or when Judge Ali rules on the motion for a preliminary injunction, whichever comes sooner.

Should he grant the injunction, the administration will doubtless appeal again, first to a federal appeals court in Washington and then, if need be, to the Supreme Court.

In the meantime, Mr. Marocco also told lawmakers Wednesday that his staff was planning criminal referrals against individuals the administration believes misused foreign aid funds, according to people familiar with the closed-door meeting.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday establishing a government reserve of bitcoin, a key marker in the cryptocurrency’s journey towards possible mainstream acceptance. 

Under Trump’s new order, the U.S. government will retain the estimated 200,000 bitcoin it’s already seized in criminal and civil proceedings, according to Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks. 

“The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,’” Sacks said on social media. 

The executive order calls for a “full accounting” of the government’s bitcoin holdings, which Sacks said have never been fully audited. He added that the U.S. government has previously sold off about 195,000 bitcoin over the last decade for $366 million. He said those bitcoins would be worth about $17 billion if the government hadn’t sold them.

Sacks said the order allows for the Treasury and Commerce Departments “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin.”

Once a skeptic who said a few years ago that bitcoin “ seems like a scam,” Trump has embraced digital currencies and leaned into his unofficial role as the “ crypto president ” in ways that can both help the crypto industry and enrich himself and his family. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, who felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last year’s election. 

Establishing a bitcoin reserve was one of several crypto-related promises Trump made on the campaign trail last year. Trump is also pushing Congress to pass industry-friendly legislation, and under his administration the Securities and Exchange Commission has started dropping enforcement actions it had taken against some major crypto companies. On Friday, Trump is set to host many key industry leaders at a White House “Crypto Summit.”




Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by an anonymous person or persons, bitcoin has blossomed from an experiment by libertarian cryptography enthusiasts into an asset with a market cap of about $1.7 trillion. While it hasn’t taken off as a way to pay for everyday things, bitcoin has found popularity as a store of value that’s not controlled by banks, governments or other powerful entities. 

Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, a built-in scarcity that supporters say makes it a great hedge against inflation. Critics have long said bitcoin lacks any inherent value, but it’s so far defied naysayers with remarkable price increases. Some supporters of a strategic bitcoin reserve said it could one day help pay off the U.S. national debt.

Crypto prices soared after Trump’s victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!” on social media.

But prices have since cooled off. Trump’s executive order did not equate to an immediate price spike for bitcoin, which was trading around $86,000 shortly after his announcement. 

The executive order also creates a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” where the government will hold seized cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. On Sunday, Trump sent crypto prices on a short-lived surge after a surprise announcement that he wanted the government to hold lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana and cardano.

More than 100 protesters gathered on Columbia University's campus on Tuesday in response to an appearance from former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.

The State Department has revoked the visa of a student who participated in protesting in favor of Hamas, a move in line with President Donald Trump's call for canceling visas of students involved in the anti-Israel demonstrations on college campuses.

The State Department confirmed the matter with Fox News, without identifying the student or what university they attended due to "legal constraints."

"Yesterday evening, we revoked the first visa of an alien who was previously cited for criminal behavior in connection with Hamas-supporting disruptions," the State Department said. "This individual was a university student. ICE will proceed with removing this person from the country."

The State Department reviewed over 100,000 student visas and none were revoked during the Biden administration, despite all the anti-Israel protests and disruptions on college campuses. 

Trump has repeatedly called for foreign students attending American universities to have their visas revoked for supporting Hamas and other terror groups. 

Upon taking office in January, he signed an executive order to combat antisemitism.

"To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you," Trump is quoted in a fact sheet issued by the White House. "I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before."

U.S. college campuses have been a hotbed for anti-Israel protests and disruptions, including vandalism, threats against Jewish students and violence against law enforcement. 

"The Biden Administration turned a blind eye to this coordinated assault on public order; it simply refused to protect the civil rights of Jewish Americans, especially students," the fact sheet states. "According to a December 2024 U.S. House of Representatives Staff Report on anti-Semitism, ‘the failure of our federal government departments and agencies is astounding.'"

On Thursday, Axios reported that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is launching an AI-fueled "Catch and Revoke" effort to cancel the visas of foreign students who appear to support designated terror groups.

"Those who support designated terrorist organizations, including Hamas, threaten our national security," he wrote on X. "The United States has zero tolerance for foreign visitors who support terrorists. Violators of U.S. law — including international students — face visa denial or revocation, and deportation."

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested he may make it official U.S. policy that the U.S. won’t come to the aid of NATO members that don’t meet the alliance’s defence spending target if attacked, questioning whether those allies would do the same for America.

Trump has long complained the U.S. pays far more for defence than the rest of the alliance, and has called on members to increase their spending or risk not getting U.S. aid under NATO’s commitment to collective defence.

Asked if he would make that official U.S. policy, Trump replied: “I think it’s common sense, right? If they don’t pay I’m not going to defend them, no.”

He then justified his position by questioning if allies would defend the U.S. in the event of a future attack on America.

“You know, if the United States was in trouble, and we called them and said, ‘We have a problem, France, we have a problem … do you think they’re going to come and defend us? They’re supposed to. I’m not so sure,” he said.

The collective defence provisions of the NATO Treaty under Article 5 have been invoked only once in the alliance’s 75-year history: when the U.S. was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001.

At the time, the invocation was done by NATO leadership without a U.S. request, and led to limited allied military support in the leadup to American military operations against al-Qaida in the Middle East.

Trump, as he has done multiple times before, recalled he made a similar threat of withholding U.S. aid for “delinquent” members to NATO leaders directly during his first term as president. He has claimed that threat led to more members boosting their defence spending and hitting the two per cent spending target.

NATO leaders, as well as former U.S. president Joe Biden, have said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was behind the spending surge.

NBC News reported earlier Thursday that Trump was considering changes to U.S. policy toward NATO that would include prioritizing military exercises with members that meet their spending commitments, and withholding aid to members that don’t. Trump did not deny the report in the Oval Office.

The U.S. has long complained that Canada and a small number of NATO members still aren’t paying at least two per cent of GDP on defence, more than a decade after the alliance set that threshold. Canada spent around 1.3 per cent of GDP on defence last year.

The federal government has said it has a plan to hit the two per cent target by 2032 but may also speed up that timeline. Experts have told Global News it would be extremely difficult and take multiple hard spending and budget decisions to boost defence spending quickly and maintain it for years to come.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Thursday that Trump has made both the United States’ and his personal commitment to NATO clear.

“The transatlantic partnership remains the bedrock of our alliance,” Rutte added during a press conference held alongside Polish president Andrzej Duda in Brussels.

Trump’s nominee for NATO ambassador, Matt Whitaker, similarly told senators during his confirmation hearing this week that the U.S. commitment to NATO is “ironclad.” He said his primary objective if confirmed to the position would be to push Trump’s calls for greater defence spending and burden sharing from European members.

Washington — A federal judge in Washington ruled Thursday that President Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board was unlawful and said she must be allowed to continue in her role.

In a 36-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, who sits on the U.S. District Court in Washington, said that the Constitution and past decisions make clear that Congress can limit the president's removal power. She ruled that the president's firing of Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB violated federal law that allows for a board member to be removed only for "neglect of duty or malfeasance in office," and declared her termination void.

"Under our constitutional system, such checks, by design, guard against executive overreach and the risk such overreach would pose of autocracy," Howell wrote in a 36-page decision. "An American president is not a king — not even an 'elected' one — and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute, but may be constrained in appropriate circumstances, as are present here."

Howell, appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote that Mr. Trump "seems intent on pushing the bounds of his office and exercising his power in a manner violative of clear statutory law to test how much the courts will accept the notion of a presidency that is supreme."

Wilcox was nominated to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024. 

But soon after returning to a second term in the White House, Mr. Trump replaced Wilcox as chair and fired her from her position on the board in late January. While the National Labor Relations Act requires the president to remove a member "upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office," the email sent to Wilcox on behalf of the president stated that she and another board member have not "been operating in a manner consistent with the objectives of my administration."

Wilcox told CBS News last month that she was "stunned" when she received a letter from the White House firing her. 

"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job," Wilcox, 71, said. She swiftly challenged her firing in federal court.

In her decision, the judge noted that in the 90 years since the NLRB was founded, the president has never removed a member of its board.

"His attempt to do so here is blatantly illegal, and his constitutional arguments to excuse this illegal act are contrary to Supreme Court precedent and over a century of practice," she said.

The court found that a Supreme Court decision from 1935 binds the outcome of Wilcox's case. That case carved out an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers. The Supreme Court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections for multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.

"The 150-year history and tradition of multimember boards or commissions and 90-year precedent from the Supreme Court approving of removal protections for their officers dictates the same outcome for the NLRB here," Howell wrote.

She added that "nothing in the Constitution or the historical development of the removal power has suggested the president's removal power is absolute."

"The president does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law," the judge found.

Howell criticized Mr. Trump for portraying himself as a king — pointing to a social media post from the White House last month that featured an illustration of the president wearing a crown, along with the headline "long live the king" — and said that he misunderstands the role of Article II of the Constitution, which lays out the scope of the president's powers.

"At issue in this case, is the president's insistence that he has authority to fire whomever he wants within the Executive branch, overriding any congressionally mandated law in his way," she wrote. "Luckily, the Framers, anticipating such a power grab, vested in Article III, not Article II, the power to interpret the law, including resolving conflicts about congressional checks on presidential authority. The president's interpretation of the scope of his constitutional power — or, more aptly, his aspiration — is flat wrong."

The decision from Howell sets the case on a path to the Supreme Court and could lead it to overturn the 1935 decision in the case known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States. Sarah Harris, the acting solicitor general, wrote in a letter to Congress last month that the Trump administration believes that certain for-cause removal restrictions for multi-member commissions are unconstitutional and would urge the Supreme Court to overturn its precedent.

The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years chipped away at that 90-year-old ruling and reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will. Most notably in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure of a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance was unconstitutional.

Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have already indicated that they believe the Supreme Court should reverse Humphrey's Executor.

"The decision in Humphrey's Executor poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people," Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion to its 2020 decision on the CFPB, which was joined by Gorsuch.

Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, said that in a future case, he "would repudiate what is left of this erroneous precedent."

Trump’s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration is a vocal critic of the medical establishment.

What to Know About Trump’s FDA Pick

Bill Clark|CQ-Roll Call, Inc|Getty Images

Dr. Marty Makary, nominee to be commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), appears before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for his confirmation hearing on Thursday, March 6, 2025, in Washington, D.C.




Trump’s pick to lead the FDA appears likely to gain Senate confirmation. 
He expressed a willingness to work with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to “Make America Healthy Again.”
Makary faced questions about a recently canceled FDA committee meeting as well as mifepristone, a pill used in medication abortions.
























Senators on Thursday pressed President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration on the agency’s recent cancellation of a vaccine advisory committee meeting as well as his policy plans for mifepristone, a pill used in medication abortions.

Martin Makary, a surgeon and public policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, expressed a willingness to work with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during his confirmation hearing. Kennedy, one of Trump’s most controversial Cabinet picks, has long eyed the FDA for reform, previously saying that “entire departments” within the FDA “have to go.”

If confirmed, Makary will lead the agency tasked with ensuring the safety and efficacy of food, drugs, medical devices and cosmetics. His confirmation is likely. Despite holding a very narrow 53-47 margin in the upper chamber, Republicans have maintained enough unity to successfully approve Trump’s slate of picks so far.

Makary would take over the agency shortly after the Trump administration fired hundreds of employees, including medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to hire some of them back.

Here is what to know about Makary and his goals at the FDA:

Makary is a surgical oncologist and a health care researcher who serves as the chief of islet transplant surgery at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Medicine. He has served at the World Health Organization’s Patient Safety Program and is a member of the National Academy of Medicine.

Makary has been a vocal critic of the medical establishment. While expressing support for universal masking and vaccines early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary later spoke out against vaccine mandates and prolonged school closures, and he was quoted as saying the federal government was the “greatest perpetrator of misinformation” about COVID-19.

"COVID has given us a clear-eyed look at a broken Food and Drug Administration that's mired in politics and red tape," he wrote in an October 2021 commentary published by Fox News. "Americans can now see why medical advances often move at turtle speed. We need fresh leadership at the FDA to change the culture at the agency and promote scientific advancement, not hinder it."

Makary said his goals at the FDA would be very clear: “More cures and meaningful treatments for Americans, including diagnostics, healthy food for children and rebuilding the public trust.”

Makary said in his written testimony that he wants to create a “smarter FDA that works for all Americans.” He credited Trump and Kennedy for a “generational opportunity to usher in radical transparency and to facilitate more cures, meaningful treatments and diagnostics to empower people to take care of their health.”

“If confirmed, I hope to ensure the FDA holds to the gold standard of trusted science, transparency, and common sense to rebuild public trust and ‘Make America Healthy Again,’” he said, referencing a movement championed by Kennedy.

But some senators pushed Makary to distance himself from Kennedy and his previous controversial remarks on vaccines. Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado asked Makary if he’d be willing to be a “more enthusiastic supporter” of vaccinations.

“Vaccines save lives,” Makary responded. “I do believe that any child who dies of a vaccine-preventable illness is a tragedy in the modern era.”

One of the first questions senators asked Makary during his confirmation hearing on Thursday was for his view on the recent move by the FDA to cancel its annual meeting of members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee that was scheduled for March 13, where they recommend which influenza strains should be included in next flu season’s vaccine.

The meeting cancellation marked the second disruption involving a vaccine advisory group since Kennedy became HHS head. Last month, a meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was postponed.

While Makary said he would reconvene the advisory committee, he did not commit to rescheduling the canceled advisory meeting on selecting a flu vaccine, saying he would “reevaluate” the situation. He added that the committee had for years just followed World Health Organization recommendations.

Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana pushed back on Makary’s claim, pointing out the flu-strain recommendations from the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Program are based on surveillance of flu activity in the Southern Hemisphere.

“My understanding, though, is that since these (flu) strains typically begin like in Australia or China, it isn’t so much as a rubber stamp but as much as recognizing what you’re seeing because that’s what’s coming to us,” Cassidy said.

When Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state asked what he planned to evaluate to determine whether to reconvene the advisory committee’s meeting on flu vaccine, Makary said he would work with the director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to evaluate which topics they felt were necessary for the advisory committee to meet.

“In conjunction with the center director of the biologics center, I would reevaluate which topics deserve a convening of the advisory committee members on VRBPAC and which ones may not require convening,” Makary said.

Mifepristone is a hot topic that Democrats are keeping a close eye on during the Trump administration.

The FDA approved mifepristone, a pill used along with one other drug in most medication abortions in the U.S., more than 20 years ago. Anti-abortion groups hope the Trump administration implements restrictions on the pill, such as a requirement to see a doctor in person before gaining access to the medication – effectively ending telehealth as an option.

Makary heard many questions about mifepristone during his hearing. But he was noncommittal on the topic, saying – much like Kennedy did at his own hearing – that he would take a look at the data.

“I have no preconceived plans on mifepristone policy except to take a solid, hard look at the data and to meet with the professional career scientists who have reviewed the data at the FDA and to build an expert coalition to review the ongoing data, which is required to be collected as a part of the REMS program – the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy,” Makary said.

Ryan Wedding is wanted on multiple federal charges, including murder.

The U.S. Department of State is offering a $10 million reward for the capture of a former Olympic snowboarder accused of running a major transnational drug trafficking organization and orchestrating multiple murders, authorities announced Thursday.

Ryan Wedding, 43, a Canadian national, has also been added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office revealed Thursday.

Wedding is wanted for allegedly running a drug trafficking network "that routinely shipped hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia, through Mexico and Southern California, to Canada and other locations in the United States, and for orchestrating multiple murders and an attempted murder in furtherance of these drug crimes," the FBI said in a press release.

He was indicted last year in Los Angeles federal court on multiple federal charges, including running a continuing criminal enterprise, committing murder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise and assorted drug crimes, the FBI said.

He and his alleged second-in-command, 34-year-old Canadian Andrew Clark, are accused of conspiring to move hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Mexico to the Los Angeles area, where it was stored in stash houses before being transported to Canada and U.S. cities in long-haul semi-trucks, authorities said.

Wedding and Clark are also accused of ordering the murders of multiple people in Canada to achieve the organization's aims, the FBI said.

Clark was arrested in Mexico last year by Mexican authorities and was among the 29 fugitives who were extradited to the U.S. from Mexico last week, while Wedding's whereabouts remain unknown, the FBI said.

"Wedding went from shredding powder on the slopes at the Olympics to distributing powder cocaine on the streets of U.S. cities and in his native Canada," Akil Davis, the assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, said in a statement on Thursday. "The alleged murders of his competitors make Wedding a very dangerous man, and his addition to the list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, coupled with a major reward offer by the State Department, will make the public our partner so that we can catch up with him before he puts anyone else in danger."

The State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs' $10 million reward for information leading to Wedding's arrest and/or conviction was authorized by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the FBI said.

The reward is in addition to a $50,000 reward already offered by the FBI for information leading to Wedding's apprehension, arrest and extradition, the agency said.

Wedding competed for Canada in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where he placed 24th in the parallel giant slalom, before allegedly running the billion-dollar cocaine operation from Mexico for more than a dozen years, officials said.

He is believed to reside in Mexico but investigators have not ruled out his presence elsewhere, including in the U.S., Canada, Colombia, Honduras, Guatemala or Costa Rica. His aliases include "El Jefe," "Giant," "Public Enemy," "James Conrad King" and "Jesse King," the FBI said.

If convicted of murder and attempted murder charges, he faces a mandatory minimum penalty of life in federal prison, the DOJ said. The continuing criminal enterprise charges also carry a mandatory minimum penalty of life in federal prison.

Judge orders reinstatement of Gwynne Wilcox to National Labor Relations Board after her removal by US president

A federal court ruled that Donald Trump’s abrupt firing of a former senior official at the top US labor watchdog was illegal, and ordered that she be reinstated.

Gwynne Wilcox was the first member of the National Labor Relations Board to be removed by a US president since the board’s inception in 1935.

The framers of the US constitution “made clear that no one in our system of government was meant to be king – the President included – and not just in name only”, the judge Beryl A Howell, wrote in the ruling.

Howell presided over the hearing held on Wednesday on a motion for summary judgment in the District of Columbia. “The President does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,” she wrote.

“A president who touts an image of himself as a ‘king’ or a ‘dictator,’ perhaps as his vision of effective leadership, fundamentally misapprehends the role under Article II of the US Constitution,” wrote Howell.

Article II of the US Constitution outlines the executive powers and responsibilities of the president. Howell continued, “in our constitutional order, the president is tasked to be a conscientious custodian of the law, albeit an energetic one, to take care of effectuating his enumerated duties, including the laws enacted by the Congress and as interpreted by the Judiciary”.

Wilcox filed the lawsuit early last month, alleging her removal was a “blatant violation” of the National Labor Relations Act, which stipulates that members of the board can only be removed for negligence or misconduct. Her removal left the board with only two members, lacking the quorum of at least three members required to rule on cases.

“I’m ready to get back to work,” said Wilcox after the hearing in a speech outside the courthouse today. “It’s not just about me, but I’m glad to be the face of this fight.”

Her attorney, Deepak Gupta, noted this was the beginning of a long fight.

Wilcox was confirmed by the Senate in September 2023, and set to serve until August 2028. She sought a declaratory judgment ruling her removal unlawful and an injunction to permit her to complete her appointed term.

The White House has defended her removal, and that of the NLRB general counsel, claiming that “these were far-left appointees with radical records of upending longstanding labor law, and they have no place as senior appointees in the Trump administration”.

During the hearing, Howell noted that in court, the Trump administration claimed the law prohibiting removal of board members was unconstitutional. Similar arguments have been made in recent lawsuits against the NLRB by SpaceX, Amazon and other employers in response to labor law enforcement actions pursued against the corporations.

Howell explained the US supreme court precedent of Humphrey’s Executor, a 1935 case in which the court ruled that a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission had been unlawfully removed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Former NLRB chairs and labor leaders criticized the removal of Wilcox, claiming it violated that precedent set by the supreme court, undermined the independence of the NLRB and in effect halted federal labor law enforcement in the US.

The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, held a rally in support of Wilcox outside the courthouse during Wednesday’s hearing.

“A week after taking office, President Trump effectively shut down the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and jeopardized the NLRB’s independence by illegally firing Wilcox, the first Black woman to serve on the Board,” said the AFL-CIO.

Talks over a potential U.S.-Ukraine agreement centered on access to revenues associated with Ukraine’s minerals recently stalled, a deal is still possible.
It’s not certain that Ukraine has any of the 17 rare earth elements, but the country does have other resources potentially of interest to President Donald Trump.
The deal could come with long-term economic opportunities and act as a blueprint for similar agreements with other mineral-rich countries, analysts say.




Critical minerals are all the rage right now.

Ever since President Donald Trump indicated he wanted access to Ukraine’s natural resources industry in exchange for U.S. aid amid the country’s war with Russia – an idea originally floated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a way to help fund the military effort – much has been said and written about critical minerals and rare earths. And the conversation is persisting even after an Oval Office blow-up between the two presidents last week threatened to kill the deal.

During his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said he will take “historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.” He also read aloud a letter from Zelenskyy himself, which noted Ukraine is “ready to sign” the minerals agreement “at any time that is convenient.”

Whether the deal comes to fruition is not a certainty. But as negotiations previously stood, the bilateral agreement would establish a “reconstruction investment fund” owned jointly by the two countries. Ukraine would contribute 50% of “all revenues earned from the future monetization of all Ukrainian government-owned natural resource assets into the fund,” including mineral deposits, oil, natural gas and other relevant infrastructure, according to a breakdown by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based nonprofit research organization.

“We are in an era of transactional foreign policy,” says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at CSIS and co-author of the article about the deal.

Here’s what to know about Ukraine’s minerals and why Trump is so focused on them.

First of all, Baskaran says, they should not be conflated with critical minerals – a term covering a wider range of resources. Rare earths make up a group of 17 elements that aren’t actually that rare but are “extremely difficult and expensive to extract and separate.” They are “really important” for national security because they’re in virtually every type of defense technology, such as warships, tanks, munitions, satellites and lasers. Rare earths also are found in advanced semiconductors, wind turbines and even an electric vehicle’s motor, she says.

While China, for instance, is the world’s largest producer of rare earths, the U.S. has a limited supply and wants “to start sourcing from elsewhere,” Baskaran adds. Enter Ukraine.

The catch: It’s unclear which rare earth elements Ukraine has access to, if any. Baskaran notes in an opinion piece published by The New York Times that there is no modern mapping of the country’s rare earth deposits, with the most recent surveys believed to have been conducted decades ago by the Soviet Union. Those surveys are not only old, but “not robust at all,” adds Morgan Bazilian, a professor and director of the Payne Institute for Public Policy at the Colorado School of Mines.

“The media and even parts of the administration are using the term incorrectly,” he says, referring to rare earth elements. “The point is that rare earths are not really and should not be the focus of any Ukraine deal. The country itself, I don’t believe, has ever produced rare earth.”

Ukraine does have other valuable commodities that don’t fall specifically in the rare earth element bucket but the U.S. still identifies as critical, such as graphite and titanium, according to Baskaran. The country also has produced manganese and has the “potential for reserves” of uranium and lithium, Bazilian says.

And the U.S. isn’t the only country interested in Ukraine’s minerals. France has been negotiating with Kyiv for months over mineral rights. Unlike the Trump deal, the French are not framing it as payback for assistance provided but as a revenue stream for the cash-strapped nation to secure resources as it continues to defend itself from Russian aggression.

In fact, long-time analyst Paul Goble suggested in his “Window on Eurasia” blog shortly after the Russian invasion that one of President Vladimir Putin's motivations was to secure Ukraine’s rare earth minerals and later in an analysis for the Jamestown Foundation tied it to a plan by Moscow to help China corner the global market on the precious resources.

On one hand, it’s a lever that can be pulled to help put Ukraine and Russia on the path to peace, and Baskaran says “ending war is in everyone’s interest.” It’s also, though, a way for Trump to “get something out of” the process – even if it’s really a long-term play. From Ukraine’s perspective, she adds, there is a lot of upside with the “potential economic recovery and investment” tied to the deal.

“The economic opportunities for these things matter a great deal more than where they sit in the earth’s crust,” Bazilian says, while adding there must come the “understanding that standing up a mining sector in a war-torn country is extremely difficult.”



The unfolding U.S.-Ukraine minerals talks, even if a deal is not finalized, could act as a blueprint for similar transactional negotiations with other countries as well. Officials from Congo recently pitched the U.S. on providing access to the country’s own critical minerals in exchange for security assistance amid its conflict with Rwanda. And Trump’s interest in taking over Greenland, a Danish territory, is reportedly rooted at least in part in its mineral deposits.

But the minerals craze also could be just a phase.

“I don’t think that they will stay at this level of political prioritization,” Bazilian says. “Nothing does.”

CIA staffing numbers are classified so it's unclear how many will be impacted.

As President Donald Trump's administration continues its sweeping overhaul of the federal government, a federal appeals court is temporarily allowing the president to remove the head of a watchdog agency, overturning a lower court’s decision from this weekend.

Fallout continues from Trump's historic tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, along with increased duties on goods from China. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Wednesday a one-month exemption for some automakers on the tariffs from Canada and Mexico.

President Donald Trump said in a new post on his social media platform Thursday that a combination of DOGE and heads of federal agencies will take a "scalpel" approach when it comes to federal cuts rather than using a "hatchet."

Trump shared that he, his cabinet secretaries and Elon Musk had a meeting Thursday.





"We're going to have these meetings every two weeks until that aspect of this very necessary job is done. The relationships between everybody in that room are extraordinary," he said.

A federal judge denied a request Thursday to expedite a case challenging the legality of the Department of Government Efficiency after President Donald Trump's address to Congress inserted confusion about who exactly is running the cost-cutting group.

"Plaintiffs have not explained, with clarity, the nature of any emergency here that would require the Court to compel Defendants to respond more rapidly than the default rules provide for," U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb wrote in an order.

Cobb, a Biden appointee, did not mention the apparent contradiction in Trump's speech in her order.





Lawyers representing DOGE argued that speeding up the case would be "infeasible," and the case is now on track for a potential hearing later this month.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said teams from the U.S. and Ukraine will hopefully meet next week.

“The Ukrainian and American teams have renewed their work, and we hope next week we will have a substantive meeting,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X.

Andrii Yermak, the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, will go to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to meet with U.S. officials to discuss possible peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on Tuesday, a source in Zelenskyy’s office told ABC News.

Ukraine’s Minister of Defense, Foreign Affairs and military representatives may also attend the meeting, the source said.

It is unclear if anything will be signed at the meeting, but the source confirmed that the meeting will be about the peace talks.





--ABC News' Patrick Reevell and Oleksiy Pshemyskiy

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her call with President Donald Trump was "very respectful" in a press conference Thursday after the phone call.

At first, Trump said he wasn't going to change or delay the tariffs, but after she showed him how fentanyl crossing into the United States has decreased from January to February and how the additional 10,000 Mexican troops at the US-Mexico border is helping, as well as noted that Mexico sent back 29 people the U.S. wanted for various crimes, he changed his mind, Sheinbaum said.





"He didn't know this chart until we sent it to him," Sheinbaum said.

Sheinbaum repeatedly said it is her job to stand up for the people of Mexico.

She also said Mexico needs to develop its own production and manufacturing more so it isn't relying on the U.S. as much.

WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.

The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday’s journal Science.

“Butterflies have been declining the last 20 years,” said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. “And we don’t see any sign that that’s going to end.”

A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.

Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.

David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn’t part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is “catastrophic and saddening” when compounded over time.

“In just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!” Wagner said in an email. “The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.”

The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn’t show up in the data and another 212 species weren’t found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

“I’m probably most worried about the species that couldn’t even be included in the analyses” because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn’t part of the research. 

Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies — which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina — “so it could be extinct.” 

Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said. 

Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, “a species that is well adapted to invade the world,” according to Haddad, fell by 50%. 

“How can that be?” Haddad wondered.

Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.

“The loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,” Agrawal, who wasn’t part of the study, said in an email. “They are telling us that our continent’s health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature’s beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.”

Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that “calms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.”

What’s happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.

Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.

The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest — Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma — where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.

“It looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,” Edwards said. “And that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.”

Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.

Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.

“It makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,” Haddad said.

Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there’s hope, Haddad said.

“You can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,” Haddad said. “That could really improve the situation for a lot of species.”

U.S. President Donald Trump is making the race for critical minerals a key part of his agenda — and Canada’s rich reserves are a prime target for his ambitions.

Dozens of minerals are being increasingly traded around the world for technologies such as smartphones, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, as well as modern military equipment.

For years, the U.S. has been trying to reduce its reliance on China for those minerals, turning to like-minded producers like Canada.

“Canada has strategic reserves the U.S. doesn’t have a lot of,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical mineral studies program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a U.S. think tank.

Trump is now looking to accelerate that shift.

On Tuesday, he told a joint session of Congress he will be signing new executive orders this week that will “dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the U.S.A.”

But Trump is also pushing mineral-rich countries to join his cause — even by threatening their sovereignty.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told business leaders last month, in comments caught on a hot mic, that Trump’s repeated threats to annex Canada and make it the 51st U.S. state are “very real” because of the desire to control Canada’s critical minerals.

The White House hasn’t denied those ambitions, and Trump has talked openly about acquiring Greenland for its own mineral deposits, citing national security.

Trump is also pushing Ukraine to sign an economic agreement that would give the U.S. access to its critical minerals to ensure American backing in peace talks with Russia.

The agreement has yet to be sealed following a blow-up in the Oval Office last week between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had travelled to Washington to sign the deal.

Jose W. Fernandez, the former undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and environment who helped craft the Biden administration’s critical minerals strategy, said Trump’s “colonial” tactics are running counter to developing the positive trade relationships the U.S. needs.

“Deals are done … by two willing parties, and companies and countries don’t typically like to have a gun to their heads when they do a transaction,” he told Global News.

The Canadian government’s critical minerals strategy released in late 2022 identified 31 materials it classified as “critical.”

Potash — a key export to the U.S. used in fertilizers — aluminum, uranium and titanium are included in the list.

Six minerals — lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements — are particularly key and hold “the most significant potential for Canadian economic growth,” the government said at the time.

Those minerals are the ones most frequently found in sought-after components like rechargeable batteries and motors for EVs, as well as smartphones, solar panels, telecommunications and consumer electronics such as televisions.

The rise in artificial intelligence over the past two years has further increased demand for copper to power data centres and internet connectivity.

Canada has one of the world’s largest reserves of rare earth elements — elements Trump has frequently mentioned — and is a top global supplier of nickel, cobalt and lithium.

Although Canada exports far more critical minerals than it imports, according to Natural Resources Canada, a report last month from the Center for Strategic & International Studies found the U.S. imports between 50 and 100 per cent of 41 out of 50 critical minerals listed by the U.S. Geological Survey.

China has come to dominate the critical minerals industry, not just through its own vast reserves but also by buying controlling stakes in mining companies in Canada and other countries home to those minerals. At least 60 per cent of worldwide production is controlled by China.

“China has repeatedly shown its willingness to weaponize these minerals” through export restrictions and bans on several materials over the past two years, the CSIS report said, underscoring the need to reduce reliance.

“If they cut off supply of these critical minerals to North America, then that really creates a huge problem for the U.S. and for us, because we wouldn’t be able to produce any of this essential equipment as well as critical technology.”

Both Trump, during his first term, and Biden issued executive orders to strengthen and secure critical minerals supply chains in an effort to move away from China.

In 2022, when Fernandez was overseeing the U.S. State Department’s creation of the 15-member Minerals Security Partnership to broaden the critical minerals supply chain, he says Canada was the first country he reached out to.

That partnership led to investments in Canada and other mineral-rich member countries, as well as dialogue with a sister forum of 15 other producer nations — including Ukraine and Greenland.

“In my experience with producing countries, countries with a lot of resources — not just Canada, but Argentina, Chile, the Congo, Serbia, others — what they want is investment, and they want the right investment,” he said.

“They want investment that will benefit their people and will comply with their laws. No one’s looking to establish a colonial relationship.”

A separate report from CSIS said Canada would be a key critical minerals ally for the U.S., due to its more substantial mining and refining sectors and favourable business environment.

“While fears of a trade war have rattled U.S.-Canada relations, cooperation between the two countries remains essential to safeguard North American prosperity in the face of rising threats,” the report said.

In the wake of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico, Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Wednesday suggested U.S. reliance on nickel from Ontario, among other critical minerals, could be exploited in retaliation — including cutting off exports.

“Our key area — I’m telling you, it’s a key area — is those critical minerals,” Ford said. “That’s our linchpin, right there.”

At the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada convention in Toronto — one of the largest mining conferences in the Western Hemisphere — stakeholders said Canada should invest in boosting critical mineral production and diversifying its own supply chains.

“We have critical minerals in our country, and they’re just sitting there waiting for us to mine. This is our time.”

            President Donald Trump is promising to unleash the US timber industry by allowing companies to raze swaths of federally protected national forests.
    


            The Trump administration quietly issued an executive order Saturday for the “immediate expansion” of commercial logging on federal lands, setting out deadlines for officials to figure out how to fast-track permits and circumvent restrictions set out in the Endangered Species Act and other environmental protections.
    


            The order — which calls for the ramping up of the domestic timber production to avoid reliance on “foreign producers” — was followed three days later by sweeping 25% tariffs on Canadian products, including lumber.
    


            The United States has an “abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs,” the executive order says. 



            However, it’s more complex than simply swapping out Canadian imports for homegrown timber, said industry experts, who warned tariffs could end up increasing lumber and building costs — and even push up housing prices for consumers.
    


            Meanwhile, environmental groups say clearcutting national forests will pollute the air and water, endanger wildlife and exacerbate climate change. “Trump’s order will unleash the chainsaws and bulldozers on our beautiful, irreplaceable federal forests,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity.
    


            The US relies heavily on Canada for its lumber. Last year 23.6% of the lumber consumed in the US was shipped in from its northern neighbor, according to Forest Economic Advisors.
    


            Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, said Trump’s executive order addresses “the national security threat posed by an overreliance on foreign timber and lumber, while simultaneously increasing America’s lumber supply at home.”
    


            She referred to multiple organizations that have released statements of support about opening up federal land for logging, including the American Loggers Council, the American Forest Resource Council and the Forest Landowners Association.
    


            Increasing logging on federal lands would increase the supply of logs for US industry, said Rocky Goodnow, vice president of North American Timber Service at Forest Economic Advisors. But it won’t replace Canadian imports in the near term, he told CNN.
    


            That’s because it takes time to expand an industry. The US needs to build more sawmills to produce the lumber, as well as develop the labor force in rural areas and increase logging capacity, Goodnow said.

            In the meantime, prices are already going up, said Buddy Hughes, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.
    


            While he welcomed “efforts to eliminate barriers to domestic lumber production,” he said a lack of sawmill capacity means “any move in the short-term to add tariffs or hinder the flow of lumber from Canada will only harm housing affordability.”
    


            Any more tariffs or restrictions could further increase the cost of construction and discourage new development, he told CNN. “Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,” he added.
    


            The NAHB’s chief economist Robert Dietz said he was hearing anecdotally from builders that the new tariffs could increase costs anywhere from $7,500 to $10,000 per home.
    


            For environmental advocates, the plan to open up federal land for logging is fraught with risk.
    


            Trump’s executive order says federal restrictions on logging have “contributed to wildfire disasters (and) degraded fish and wildlife habitats,” but the environmental law group Earthjustice said cutting down trees releases planet-heating pollution, exacerbating the climate crisis.
    


            “Hotter temperatures caused by climate change, in turn, create dry forest conditions that are more susceptible to fire,” said a spokesperson for Earthjustice. In addition, the debris often left behind by the logging industry, including needles and leaves, “essentially acts as tinder,” they added.
    


            Spivak of the Center for Biological Diversity said logging on public lands risks polluting water and threatens the more than 400 species protected under the Endangered Species Act that rely on national forests, including grizzly bears, spotted owls and wild salmon.
    


            “This is a particularly horrific move by Trump to loot our public lands by handing the keys to the kingdom over to big business,” Spivak said.
    


            Earthjustice — which sued the government over its attempts to approve a huge logging program in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska during Trump’s first term — said it plans to closely monitor what the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management do in response to the order.

Leena Yousefi and her family typically visit Hawaii four or five times a year. The Vancouver attorney used to live in Maui and had booked another trip for this year.

But that was before President Trump, shortly after taking office in January, said he would impose 25% tariffs on many Canadian goods and repeated his wish to turn the country into the 51st U.S. state.

"Obviously out of loyalty to Canada and our values and just holding our ground, we had to cancel," Yousefi said.

Her family was even considering buying a two-bedroom condo in Hawaii given how often they vacation there. "But now we're looking at Costa Rica," she said.

The Trump administration's recent attacks on its northern neighbor have been met with confusion, frustration and anger by many Canadians, some of whom are now abandoning their trips south and boycotting travel to the U.S. in protest.

Tourism industry leaders say that could pose a major threat to the U.S. travel sector, which relies heavily on Canadian visitors. According to the U.S. Travel Association, Canadians are the largest group of foreign visitors to the U.S. annually and accounted for $20.5 billion in spending last year alone.

Florida, California, Nevada, New York and Texas are the top U.S. states for Canadian tourists.

Signs of a Canadian tourist backlash are cropping up from accommodations in Vermont to campgrounds in New Jersey.

Bookings at U.S. hotels just over the Canadian border are also down. The data analytics firm CoStar Group found that the demand for hotel rooms in a four-week period covering part of January and most of February had decreased 8% year over year in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and 12% in the Bellingham area of northwest Washington, about 50 miles south of Vancouver.

Catherine Prather, president of the U.S.-based National Tour Association, said she's heard reports from "dozens" of members about Canadian travelers cancelling the tours they had booked to the U.S. — particularly in response to Trump's stated goal of annexing the longtime ally. "Canadians feel disrespected, and that's very challenging to them because we have always been such loyal, loyal partners," she said.

Not everyone is as worried about a potential decline in Canadian travel to the U.S.

Beth Potter, president of the Tourism Industry Association of Canada, said there has been an increase in Canadians booking domestic vacations but that the tourism industry is viewing the situation as a "small blip" in the longstanding relationship between the two countries.

Marriott recently downplayed concerns that Canadians would quit traveling to the U.S., and Air Canada Executive Vice President Mark Galardo said in an earnings call that there "could be a slowdown" but that the carrier wasn't seeing it yet.

Still, according to a poll released last month by the market research firm Leger, nearly half of Canadians surveyed said they were less likely to travel to the U.S. this year. Most of them said they planned to travel within Canada instead.

The shift in Canadians' travel preferences dovetails with a souring national mood toward the U.S. An Ipsos poll for Global News released in early February, after Trump had announced the tariffs, found that 68% of residents surveyed thought less of their southern neighbor.

Lorna Hundt, CEO of the tour company Great Canadian Holidays, said most of the firm's U.S. tours are now "dead in the water" because so many of their Canadian customers have backed out.

"The anger is not with the American people. The anger is with Donald Trump," Hundt said. "And the feeling is that if he is going to go to war with Canada — something we never asked for, an economic war — then why on Earth would they spend a nickel in the United States when they don't have to?"

In early February, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau encouraged Canadians to spend their money domestically in response to the U.S. tariffs.

"It might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada and explore the many national and provincial parks, historical sites and tourist destinations our great country has to offer," Trudeau said.

Tourism industry leaders say it's too early to tell how much of an impact would be felt by a dip in Canadian tourism, but estimates suggest the U.S. has a lot to lose if Canadians snub the States en masse.

Prather of the National Tour Association said cancellations could mean "millions" in lost revenue to tour companies, hotels, restaurants and more. The U.S. Travel Association estimated that even a 10% reduction in Canadian tourism to the U.S. would spell a $2.1 billion drop in spending and a loss of 14,000 American jobs.

An expanded trade war ensnaring Canada, Mexico, China and even Europe, according to the research firm Tourism Economics, could result in a $22 billion loss in tourism revenue from international visitors.

This all comes as the tourism industry continues to dig out of the hole left by the COVID-19 pandemic, which clobbered the hospitality sector.

American Bus Association President Fred Ferguson says there are still more American tourists leaving the country than there are foreign visitors coming in, but Canadian travelers are helping lessen that deficit.

"Canada has been one of the bright spots post-COVID of closing the gap, but I think with the rhetoric, with the news, we are going to see slowdowns in Canadian travel," Ferguson said.

And it's not just the resentment created by the tariffs but also the tariffs themselves that will impact the U.S. tourism industry. The association says motor coach equipment manufacturers are mainly located in Canada and Europe, and many motor coach buses are imported.

Those economic pressures are squeezing the U.S. tourism industry just as it prepares for the busy spring and summer travel seasons, Ferguson added.

"We're just now kind of ramping up to be hosting this influx of visitation," he said. "And I think people are really concerned that if this rhetoric continues — which seemingly it is — people are just going to say, 'You know what, we're not coming. We're going to stay local, stay in Canada, stay in Europe, and not deal with the U.S.' "

Some U.S. allies are considering scaling back the intelligence they share with Washington in response to the Trump administration’s conciliatory approach to Russia, four sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told NBC News.

The allies are weighing the move because of concerns about safeguarding foreign assets whose identities could inadvertently be revealed, said the sources, who included a foreign official.

Every intelligence agency treats its commitments to foreign agents as sacrosanct, pledging to keep agents safe and shield their identities. Anything that jeopardized that obligation would violate that trust, former officials said, and that could lead some spy services to hold back on some information sharing with Washington.

The allies, including Israel, Saudi Arabia and members of the so-called Five Eyes spy alliance of English-speaking democracies, are examining how to possibly revise current protocols for sharing intelligence to take the Trump administration’s warming relations with Russia into account, the sources said

“Those discussions are already happening,” said a source with direct knowledge of the discussions.

No decision or action has been taken, however, the sources said.

The review is part of a wider examination of the spectrum of relations with Washington among many U.S. allies, including diplomacy, trade and military cooperation, as well as intelligence matters, the sources said. 

Though the extent of a U.S. policy change toward Russia remains unclear, allies are weighing the possible implications of what could be a historic shift, a Western official said.

Asked about allies’ possibly limiting what they share with the United States, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council said President Donald Trump is “clear-eyed” about America’s adversaries.

“The U.S. has unrivaled intelligence capabilities which is exactly why intelligence sharing initiatives such as the Five Eyes exist,” spokesman Brian Hughes said in an email. 

“President Trump is clear-eyed on all threats our adversaries pose to our national security and he will work with any ally or partner who understands the dangerous world inherited after the disastrous Biden years," he added. "On Biden’s watch, we had the war in Ukraine, the surrender in Afghanistan, and the slaughter of the innocents on October 7th.” 

Administration officials and some Republican lawmakers have defended Trump’s handling of Russia as a tactic designed to bring Moscow to the negotiating table and clinch a peace deal that would end a destabilizing war in Europe. But distrust of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a veteran KGB officer, remains high among U.S. allies. 

Publicly, longtime U.S. allies downplayed the issue. The United Kingdom, the most important U.S. intelligence partner, said it had no plans to reduce intelligence cooperation with the United States.

“The U.S. is the UK’s closest ally and we will continue to cooperate closely on defence, intelligence and security matters,” a British government spokesperson said in an email. “Any suggestion otherwise is totally untrue.” 

The Canada Security Intelligence Service said in a statement that it has strong relationships with numerous U.S. agencies that are “long-standing and resilient.”

It added, “Canada deeply values its partnership with the United States, and we believe that it is in the strategic interest of both countries to continue our strong national security cooperation.”

An Israeli official also praised its alliance with the U.S., saying "Cooperation between Israel and the United States on every level, including the sharing of crucial intelligence data, is as strong and solid as ever."

Officials from New Zealand, Australia and Saudi Arabia did not respond to requests for comment. 

Some officials in allied countries, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters, played down the idea that  Trump’s policies on Russia would disrupt information sharing that dates back decades. They noted that intelligence can be shared in ways that protect sources and methods.

But some former U.S. intelligence officers say they are concerned that the Trump administration may opt to scale back intelligence collection aimed at Russia, as the U.S. may no longer see Russia as a top threat. 

The administration, for example, has indicated it may place a higher priority on efforts to counter drug cartels from Mexico and other countries in the region. Already, the Defense Department has deployed more resources to the southern border, including a team of analysts. And the CIA has launched drone surveillance flights over Mexico as part of that effort. 

Trump’s decision this week to pause intelligence assistance to Ukraine, along with military aid, has reinforced concerns among  allies. The intelligence cooperation with Kyiv — which has developed since Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 — has benefited both Washington and Kyiv, former officials say, with Ukraine providing valuable insights about Russia.

In weighing whether to dial back some intelligence sharing, the Five Eyes allies — the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand — and other U.S. partners would have to take into account risks to their own national security if cooperation with Washington were reduced. 

But recent moves by the Trump administration regarding cybersecurity have also fueled concerns about the administration’s engagement with Moscow. 

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last month ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive cyber operations and information operations against Russia, NBC News has reported. It is unclear how long the order will last. 

And in a speech at a U.N. working group on cybersecurity last month, a senior State Department official, Liesyl Franz, made no mention of Russia as a top cyber threat and cited only China and Iran. 

For years, including during Trump’s first term, Republican and Democratic administrations have described Russia as one of the most sophisticated and dangerous threats to American cybersecurity. 

With Trump and his deputies echoing some of Russia’s talking points about the Ukraine war and indicating they hope to expand U.S. relations with Moscow, former intelligence officials say the administration may even share some sensitive information with Moscow.

Several former U.S. intelligence officers said they and their colleagues still in government are deeply concerned about the possible implications of the administration’s shift toward Russia, in which Moscow may no longer be treated as an adversary.

“People are very worried,” a former intelligence official said.

The Five Eyes alliance is arguably the most formidable espionage alliance in the world. The intelligence cooperation among its members is deeply embedded, dating to the 1940s, and officials have credited it with helping counter the Soviets during the Cold War and foiling terrorist plots in recent decades. 

The sharing of satellite imagery and eavesdropping intelligence among alliance members is extensive, highly integrated and “nearly automatic,” a former intelligence official said. 

Unwinding the technical side of the alliance’s cooperation would be complicated and difficult, former officials said. A likelier scenario could have allied governments withholding some intelligence from human sources or analyses that could cause friction with the White House, several former intelligence officials said.

Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a member of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said he was deeply concerned by the Trump administration’s “rapid pivot towards the Kremlin” and media reports that U.S. Cyber Command was pulling back on cyber operations against Russia. 

“Russia is an adversary and, as always, looking for opportunities to sow discord and make trouble for Americans and for the government, so any stand-down or pullback of our operations could be catastrophic,” Crow said in an interview.

The administration’s actions on cybersecurity have fueled speculation that Washington and Moscow may have come to an informal understanding to pull back from aggressive digital operations to reduce tensions and open the way for more diplomacy. 

It is possible that the Trump administration and Russia have agreed to “a cyber détente,” said Emily Harding, a former intelligence official. But Harding and other former intelligence officials warned that in past, attempts by the United States to forge limited cooperation with Russia, the Kremlin has proved to be an unreliable partner. 

“That sounds good in theory,” said Harding, director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. “I think the next question is whether you think Russia would actually stick to it.”  

A major hitch to any cyber détente with Moscow is Russia’s status as a hub of cybercriminals who target Americans. Russia does not extradite its citizens, and it has largely refused to work with U.S. law enforcement agencies when they identify hackers attacking American businesses, hospitals and government networks.

Of particular concern is ransomware, in which hackers, often Russian-speaking criminal gangs, deploy malicious software to lock up computer networks and demand payment. 

Known attacks on the U.S. public sector frequently tied to Russia have steadily increased each year through 2024, according to a survey conducted by the cybersecurity company Emsisoft. 

The cybersecurity insurer Coalition found in a report published in October that ransomware attacks around the globe cost companies  $353,000 on average last year. In some instances, ransomware gangs have alluded to ties to Russian intelligence. 

Philip Reiner, CEO of the Institute for Security and Technology, a San Francisco think tank that focuses on cybersecurity policy, told NBC News that any new agreement with Russia needs to persuade the Kremlin to rein in its cybercriminals who target Americans, as they rarely face legal repercussions in Russia.

“Any engagement the Trump administration has to normalize relations around cyber has got to take into account the economic terrorism that Russia engages in via ransomware gangs,” Reiner said. “That has to be a factor in any overall negotiation.”

Previous U.S. presidents from both parties have tried to “reset” relations with Russia and explored sharing intelligence about common threats with Moscow. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, President George W. Bush asked U.S. spy agencies to pursue possible collaboration with Russia on terrorism threats. But the effort “went nowhere fast,” a former intelligence official said. 

The Russians were not interested in sharing sensitive information about terrorist groups, according to former officials. 

In an op-ed in 2020 in The Washington Post, former CIA officer John Sipher and other former colleagues recounted how attempts to increase cooperation with Moscow’s spy services repeatedly failed. 

“Inside the CIA, we often joked that, to Putin, win-win means I beat you twice,” they wrote. “Good intentions from the U.S. side have proved time and again to have been futile in improving relations.”

French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said Thursday that France is sharing intelligence with Ukraine, a move that followed the United States saying it was cutting off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine.

The move comes as European Union leaders gathered Thursday in Brussels, along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for a summit to discuss boosting defense spending and bolstering pledges of support for Ukraine in its battle against Russia’s invasion.

French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the talks that EU members would "take decisive steps forward," while he expressed concerns about shifts in U.S. support for Ukraine under new President Donald Trump.

"The future of Europe does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow," Macron said.

Trump earlier in the week ordered the U.S. to suspend military aid to Kyiv’s fighters after his contentious meeting last week with Zelenskyy at the White House.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that the United States had also, for the moment, ended sharing its intelligence with Kyiv, although it could be short-lived after Zelenskyy said the exchanges with Trump in the Oval Office had been "regrettable" and that Ukraine was ready for peace talks with Russia.

"I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause [that prompted Ukraine's president to respond], I think will go away," Ratcliffe told the Fox Business Network.

"I think we'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have to push back on the aggression that's there, but to put the world in a better place for these peace negotiations to move forward," he said.

Since the start of the war in 2022, the United States has provided Ukraine with significant intelligence, including critical information its military needs for targeting Russian forces.

Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, told reporters Wednesday that the U.S. "had taken a step back" and that the administration was "reviewing all aspects" of its intelligence relationship with Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Waltz told CBS News that the U.S. is moving quickly to start peace negotiations to end the war and sign a mineral rights deal with Kyiv.

"I think we're going to see movement in very short order," Waltz said.

He said Trump officials will meet with Ukrainian officials as they conduct shuttle diplomacy with Russia.

"I have literally just been on the phone with my counterpart, the Ukrainian national security adviser, talking about times, locations, delegations," Waltz said.

Reaching a peace deal could prove difficult. Ukraine has long demanded a restoration of its internationally recognized 2014 borders before Moscow unilaterally seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Overall, Russia now holds about a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including much of eastern Ukraine, and has vowed to not return any of it to the Kyiv government.

Australian shares fell to its lowest close in more than six months.

The ASX 200 and the All Ordinaries index both ended Monday's session 1.8 per cent lower, wiping off about $50 billion in market value.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index fell 1.8 per cent, or by 146.5 points, to 7948.2 at close - the worst fall for the Australian indices since September last year.

The index is down more than 7.5 per cent from its all time high of 8,615.2 on February 14, and has fallen for four straight sessions amid uncertainty over US trade policy announcements.

The Australian dollar was 1.7 per cent stronger against the greenback for the week, buying 63.06 US cents.

Embattled casino group Star Entertainment will stay alive, for now, after securing a $53 million lifeline in return for selling its 50 per cent stake in the new Brisbane casino.

Star has been in talks with the owners of the other half of Brisbane's Queen's Wharf development — Hong Kong investors Far East Consortium International and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises — since mid-February.

On Friday afternoon, Far East Consortium confirmed a deal had been struck, in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Under the deal, in return for Star Entertainment's 50 per cent stake in the Queen's Wharf precinct, it will acquire the Hong Kong parties' two-thirds stake in the Gold Coast project.

It's known that rebuilding efforts from natural disasters positively impact GDP (i.e. bump it up) since the recovery expenses are counted but the losses are not. Are there any estimates for the net effect on GDP of natural disasters like cyclones or floods?

- Charles

Thanks for the question Charles.

From time to time the ABS measures natural disasters such as droughts, cyclones, floods and storms with the associated impacts reflected in economic statistics.

As it notes on its website, "these events will have had an impact on all aspects of the Australian economy to varying degrees".

Sometimes the impact is identifiable in ABS's various statistical releases after the event.

Sometimes, the modelling looks at the impact of one-off large scale disasters like cyclones. So that could very well happen in the coming months.

The Insurance Council also often puts out detailed reports on the economic impacts of natural disasters.

We will keep an eye out for any reports and report them for you over the coming weeks and months.

In the meantime, you could listen to this podcast re Why Cyclone Alfred could boost the next GDP figure.

Star Entertainment will receive a $53 million payment, in an asset swap deal with its Hong Kong investors Far East Consortium International and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises.

Under the deal, Star will sell its 50 per cent stake in its Queen's Wharf precinct in Brisbane to the two parties and, in turn, acquire the parties' 66.67 per cent stake in the Gold Coast project in Queensland, Far East confirmed a short time ago.

Star has yet to issue a statement to the stock exchange — we'll keep you updated when it does

National credit card debt hit $18 billion in January 2025 — the highest level of debt accruing interest since August 2021.

The Reserve Bank's credit card statistics showed credit card debt accruing interest rose by $172 million (up 1 per cent) in January.

It is the fourth consecutive month credit card debt has risen (excluding commercial cards).

Canstar analysis of RBA figures shows credit card debt attracting interest charges has risen every January since 2015.

Australians are paying $9.2 million in interest charges per day on a collective credit card debt of $18.02 billion, at the average interest rate of 18.71 per cent.

"That's money that could be far better spent on groceries, rent or mortgage repayments.," Canstar's Sally Tindall said.

The total value of credit card transactions rose by $21 million in January compared to the previous month.

Overall, spending on both debit and personal credit cards rose by $207 million in the month and $3.1 billion compared to the same time one year ago.

Canstar analysis of RBA credit card statistics and in-house survey data shows that of those with credit card debt, the average amount owing is estimated to be $4,420.

Costco Wholesale would consider making changes to its international supply chain if tariffs from US President Donald Trump lead to big price hikes, chief executive Ron Vachris said on a conference call.

The membership-only retailer missed Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit, but beat expectations on revenue.

Mr Vachris said while it was difficult to predict the impact of tariffs, about a third of Costco's sales in the US are imported from other countries and less than half of those are items coming from China, Mexico and Canada.

Costco could mix up its supply chain if tariffs prove painful, he said, and source from countries not exposed to them.

"As far as the tariffs go on the grocery items, our buyers deal with those like they would any other cost increase," he said.

"Sometimes the margins are much tighter in those categories, but they [buyers] are prepared to work closely with the suppliers and see how efficient we can bring goods to market - is there anything we can mitigate in those categories.

"The tariffs are very fluid right now. So it's hard to really give any predictions on what we can do, but we are prepared, our people are very well equipped to lower prices and defer any cost increase that come our way."

Costco currently operates 897 warehouses, including 617 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, seven in China, five in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand and Sweden.

The retail giant's second-quarter revenue increased to $US63.72 billion, from $US58.44 billion during the same quarter in fiscal 2024.

Net sales for the quarter rose 9.1 per cent to $US62.53 billion, compared to $US57.33 billion in the year-ago period.

Membership fees for the quarter hit $US1.19 billion, up from $US1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2024, with the company reporting 78.4 million paid memberships and 140.6 million total cardholders.

Worldwide, Costco’s membership renewal rate came in at 90.5 per cent, an increase of 0.1 per cent from last quarter.

Canadian dairy giant Saputo has sold Tasmanian cheesemaker King Island Dairy's facilities and brand to a new Australian owner.

The sale comes after more than a year on the market and the threat of closure hanging over it.

The dairy giant did not name those involved in the new entity but said it was being led by "two experienced Australian businessmen with supply chain and manufacturing expertise".

According to the corporate watchdog ASIC the entity was registered on March 3 this year, and lists Melbourne businessmen Nicholas Dobromilsky and Graeme Wilson as its directors.

"The buyer will make their own announcement in the coming days," Saputo said.

Why is ASX gradually falling since Trump is putting Tariffs on certain countries & why is this affecting my superannuation?

- Michael Langley 

Hi Michael,

While Australia isn't directly targeted by these new tariffs, economists have been warning for weeks that that a full-blown trade war could see global trade slow.

Let's not forget China remains our largest trading partner. If its economy takes a hit, so likely, will ours.

A trade war will especially impact Australia's resource exports — iron ore, coal, and natural gas - which are crucial to our economy.

A full-blown trade war could also impact the direction of local interest rates and the Aussie dollar — which has already faced much volatility.

And it knocks about investor confidence, which could see a more rocky sharemarket and a hit to your super savings.

In summary, it just makes the landscape more volatile and uncertain. Let's hope the worst isn't yet to come!

Hi Nassim . US government says it will only increase bitcoin reserve by “forfeiture”. How does that work when there is no physical coin?

- Phillip

Great question Phillip.

It isn't really clear how such a reserve would work or how it would benefit American taxpayers.

As noted, White House-appointed 'AI and Crypto Czar' David Sacks revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump signed an executive order to establish a "strategic Bitcoin".

Sacks said the US government will have a strategy to maximise the value of its holdings in such a reserve, but he didn't offer details as to how.

With the RBA's easing cycle now underway, and with underlying inflation continuing to moderate, more interest rate cuts are likely but homeowners may need to wait a little longer in the year, says Bendigo Bank's chief economist David Robertson.

"Market pricing now matches our forecast of two more rate cuts, taking the cash rate down to around 3.6 per cent by year-end," Mr Robertson said in an economic note released on Friday.

"We continue to expect a relatively shallow easing cycle, and agree with the RBA that it would be foolish to rely on an April 1 cut (when they next meet), however the next quarterly CPI data out on April 30 should reveal more evidence that inflation is slowing, allowing a second rate cut on May 20.

"Our base case forecasts centre on a steady improvement in GDP growth in 2025 and cost of living pressures subsiding as inflation moderates, further helped by RBA rate cuts and last year's tax cuts, but the global backdrop remains as unpredictable as ever."

He said with US tariffs now in force, the global outlook looked "increasingly opaque".

"US tariffs on trade with Canada, Mexico and China have just commenced, and beyond the uncertainty of what other tariffs will be imposed (and whether Australia will be exempted from them) the geopolitical landscape is remarkably complex and fast-moving, Mr Robertson said.

"Any global forecasts need to consider upside and downside scenarios, including the indirect impact of trade tensions on our largest trade partner China.

"Chinese fiscal support and targeted stimulus measures have proved successful so far and more policy support is expected, while exchange rates are also likely to play their part in offsetting tariffs."

"But the further down the horizon we look, the more opaque the outlook becomes, and stock markets are also looking more cautious as the broader impact of tariffs takes shape."

The price of Bitcoin plummeted on Friday after the US government signalled it would not acquire additional cryptocurrencies for its strategic reserve beyond its current holdings.

US President Donald Trump had sent the crypto world into a craze declaring during his reelection campaign that he would make America the the "crypto capital of the world."

He's also spent the past few months talking up a government strategic reserve that would hold bitcoin, ethereum as well as some other coins.

But White House-appointed 'AI and Crypto Czar' David Sacks revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin.

According to Sacks, the US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve, instead keeping it as a store of value. He likened the reserve to a "digital Fort Knox" for the cryptocurrency often referred to as "digital gold."

The reserve will be funded with Bitcoin owned by the federal government, obtained through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.

The executive order creates a US digital asset stockpile but the US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve.

The government will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

As a result Bitcoin slumped below $US85,000 on Friday. It's still trading down more than 3 per cent at US$87,042.06.

My colleague David Chau did a nice read in December on the promises Trump's been making on crypto and what a strategic reserve actually means. You can read that here:

Household spending rose 0.4 per cent in January, driven by Aussies spending more on areas including doctors visits and travel.

This follows a 0.2 per cent rise in December and a 0.8 per cent rise in November, according to seasonally adjusted figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

But nominal household spending slowed sharply to 2.9 per cent over the year to January, the slowest rate since September 24.

ABS head of business statistics Robert Ewing said that while spending on goods pushed up overall spending in late 2024, a 1.5 per cent rise for services drove the January growth.

In this category, health had the largest rise (+2.5 per cent), as households spent more on doctor and hospital visits.

Transport spending rose 1.1 per cent, driven by air and sea transport, as households booked in their travel plans for the year ahead.

Spending on the operation of vehicles, including petrol and motor vehicle repairs, also contributed to the rise.

But lower spending on new vehicle purchases reduced overall growth in household spending.

Also partly offsetting these rises were 1.5 per cent falls for furnishings and household equipment and clothing and footwear.

Overall goods spending fell 0.6 per cent in January, after rising for three months in a row.

Mr Ewing said the fall comes after households took advantage of promotional activity like Black Friday sales, which drove strong goods spending at the end of 2024.

The Albanese government recently introduced changes to ensure that telecommunication providers who are caught breaching industry codes will no longer be warned before being slapped with new multi-million dollar fines.

The changes allow the Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) to take direct and immediate enforcement against telcos that have breached their obligations to customers.

Currently, ACMA must respond to breaches of co-developed industry codes with a direction to comply before taking enforcement action with fines capped at $250,000.

The Albanese government's proposed change would allow ACMA to take enforcement action immediately and seek fines of up to $10 million for industry code breaches.

But a group of 22 consumer advocates known as the Fair Call Coalition has written to ACMA urging the regulator to refuse to register the Telecommunications Consumer Protections (TCP) Code and instead support direct regulation of Australia's telco industry.

Consumer Action Law Centre CEO Stephanie Tonkin said the telco industry's self-regulating code "has manifestly failed to protect consumers, especially those who are in vulnerable situations".

"It is out of step with community expectations and other essential services sectors like energy," Ms Tonkin said.

Ms Tonkin acknowledged that Communications Minister Michelle Rowland had taken some welcome steps in strengthening the ACMA's enforcement powers but said "the time has come to turn the page on the Code".

"We continue to hear from callers to our frontlines of egregious examples of telco mis-selling and harm due to poor sales practices and credit assessment requirements," she said.

"The low standard of consumer protections in many areas of the Code has not changed and its time this Code was thrown in the bin and direct regulation implemented."

Peter Gartlan, co-CEO of Financial Counselling Australia, added that everyone needs access to telecommunications services and said consumers aren't getting adequate protection.

"A self-regulating code just doesn't cut it," Mr Gartland said.

Tony Sycamore from IG has circulated a note that highlights how dire the price action has been on the stock market in recent weeks.

Here's what he's written:

"The horrific price action in the ASX200 has continued today, slipping below 8,000 for the first time in almost six months.

"This week's fall has seen the correction in the ASX200 from its 8615 high deepen to approximately 7.25%, a move that has unfolded in just four weeks. 

And he continues:

The falls this week have been driven by several factors, including US trade policy uncertainty at a time when fears of a looming US recession are rising. Locally, the falls have been exacerbated by more weakness in the big banks and worsened after BHP, RIO, South32, and energy giant Woodside all traded ex-dividend.

If the break below the psychologically important 8000 level is confirmed at the close of business today, it would open the way for the sell-off to extend towards 7600. A pullback to 7600 would be an 11% correction from the February 8615 high.

As for a potential catalyst for a turnaround in the ASX200, there isn't a clear one currently. US trade and tariff policy appears likely to remain volatile, and the upcoming Federal Election adds to the uncertainty, with the possibility of a hung parliament.

Mr Sycamore circulated that note 20 minutes ago. When he wrote it, the ASX200 index was trading at 7,996 points having lost 98 points (-1.22%).

But as I write, the ASX200 index is lower again, at 7,977 points (-1.45%).

Embattled casino operator Star Entertainment says it has been unable to reach a deal with Hong Kong investors to buy its stake in Brisbane's Queen's Wharf development.

Yesterday, there were media reports that Star was "on the brink" of inking a deal with its joint venture partners Chow Tai Fook and Far East Consortium, to buy its 50 per cent interest in the development.

This morning Star confirmed it has been in discussions, as it flagged in mid-February, but said it has been "unable to reach an agreement" to date.

The European Central Bank has cut interest rates as expected on Thursday and kept the door ajar to more, even as a looming trade war with the US and plans to boost military spending drive Europe's biggest economic policy upheaval in decades.

ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters in Frankfurt “we have huge uncertainty. Some people have used the adjective phenomenal uncertainty and we debated as to whether it was high, high and rising.”

Easing for the sixth time since June, the ECB lowered its deposit rate to 2.5% in a nod to slowing inflation and faltering growth, and said that rates were still restricting growth, even if less so than in the past.

That wording suggests that more rate cuts may be coming as the bank has long declared that restriction is no longer necessary while inflation, at 2.4% last month, is safely heading back to its 2% target this year.

The ECB lowered its 2025 economic growth forecast for the fourth straight time on Thursday, putting expansion in 2025 at just 0.9, only slightly above the 0.7% pace recorded last year.

Inflation was meanwhile seen at 2.3% this year, above the 2.1% seen three months ago.

The Australian share market is off to a gloomy start on Friday.

The ASX 200 index lost 81 points or 1 per cent to 8,014, by 10:15am AEDT.

Ten out of the 11 sectors are in the red, with basic materials (+0.1pc) the only sector that's bucking the trend.

Real estate (-1.8pc), financials (-1.7pc) and tech (-1.5pc) led the losses in the first 15 minutes of trade.

Shares of wealth manager Insignia rose 12% to $4.76, as Bain Capital and CC Capital raised their respective takeover bids to $3.34 billion, marking a pivotal moment in an escalating bidding war.

Shares of Star Entertainment were still suspended.

Here are the top and bottom movers at the open.

Insignia Financial has granted two key suiters access to its books after both Bain Capital and CC Capital raised their respective takeover bids to $3.34 billion, marking a pivotal moment in an escalating bidding war.

Insignia said on Friday the two firms now vying for control of one of Australia's largest wealth management firms had increased their per-share offers to $5 each — an 8.7% premium over their previous $4.60 bids.

Bain, best known in Australia for acquiring Virgin Australia out of administration, and CC Capital, a Wall Street-based private equity firm, now appear to have the upper hand after investment giant Brookfield entered the contest last month with a matching bid.

Insignia, formerly known as IOOF, oversees approximately $327 billion in client assets, making it the third-largest player in Australia's superannuation sector. 

Australia's publicly traded wealth management firms are drawing interest from investors attracted to the country's thriving pension system.

The embattled casino operator Star Entertainment seems to have lost a major shareholder.

The company posted a statement on the stock exchange last night, saying it's become aware that State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries ceased to be a substantial shareholder on 4 March 2025.

"The Company’s Constitution, as well as certain agreements entered into with Liquor and Gaming New South Wales and the Queensland Office of Liquor and Gaming Regulation, contain restrictions prohibiting an individual from having a voting power of more than 10% in the Company," Star said in an ASX announcement.

"The Company may refuse to register any transfer of shares which would contravene these shareholding restrictions or require divestiture of the shares that cause an individual to exceed the shareholding restrictions."

Shares in Star Entertainment have been suspended since Monday because it failed to report half-yearly profit results to the ASX by last Friday's deadline.

The company previously said that it couldn't finalise the results unless it received a substantial cash injection to stave off financial collapse.

The Australian Financial Review reported yesterday that Hong Kong investors have offered $50 million in exchange for the Brisbane casino and the rest of its Queensland operation.

So how did Star get here? Watch this short explainer video.

US President Donald Trump said Thursday he planned to visit Saudi Arabia, suggesting a deal for major investment from the kingdom that has become the key venue for US diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine.

Trump, asked if he would meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia, confirmed his intention to visit the oil-rich Gulf nation but suggested that business was the main motive. 

"I'm going to Saudi Arabia," Trump told reporters, without mentioning a date.

"I said, I'll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies, (spreading) the purchase over a four-year period, of a trillion dollars," he said, referring to the duration of his presidency.

"They've agreed to do that, so I'm going to be going there."

Trump, who has yet to travel overseas since returning to the White House, made Saudi Arabia his first foreign destination after he took office in 2017.

He said recently that he decided to visit Saudi Arabia rather than Britain on his first trip in 2017 because the Arab kingdom promised to buy $450 billion worth of US products.

Trump has forged close business ties with Saudi Arabia, with the Trump Organization in December announcing a Trump Tower in Jeddah.

In his last term, Trump boasted of shielding Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from consequences over the killing of US-based Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, with the president citing the importance of Saudi purchases of US weapons.

Former president Joe Biden initially vowed to make the crown prince a "pariah" due to human rights but his administration later courted Saudi Arabia, including with a draft defense agreement, as it sought to encourage it to recognize Israel.

The Trump administration has vowed to move full-speed with trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to normalize with Israel, in what would be a landmark step as the kingdom is home to Islam's two holiest sites.

Walgreens Boots Alliance says it has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners as the struggling retailer looks to turn itself around after years of losing money. 

Walgreens said Thursday that Sycamore will pay $11.45 per share, giving the deal an equity value just under $10 billion. Shareholders could eventually receive up to another $3 per share under certain conditions. 

A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street's reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927. 

Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations. 

The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.

The company also said last August that it was reviewing a U.S. health care operation it had expanded aggressively, and it might sell all or part of its VillageMD clinic business. That announcement came less than two years after the company said it would spend billions to expand it. 

Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said. 

Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement. 

Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.

Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.

"Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan," the analyst wrote. "Without cash flow, none of the value cases work."

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.

The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Remaining publicly traded drugstore operators include the nation's largest, CVS Health Corp., and retailers like Walmart and the grocer Kroger that run pharmacies at many of their locations.

"This lawsuit is an affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact," writes Thomas Riney, a lawyer for CBS, in the filing.


							By 

	Winston Cho



	Without a settlement in sight, Paramount Global is looking to dismiss President Trump’s lawsuit against its CBS News unit from a federal court in Texas, which has become a hot spot for legal battles advancing conservative legal causes.


	CBS is incorporated in New York, but Trump’s legal team chose to sue in the Northern District of Texas, prompting concerns that he’s cherry-picking judges by filing the lawsuit at a court where a sympathetic judge is likely to oversee the case. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who’s overseeing the litigation, was nominated to his position by Trump in 2017 and has been a member of the Federalist Society since 2012. In his five years on the bench, he’s issued rulings to block Biden-era rules regarding immigration, health care and discrimination. He’s the only judge in the Amarillo division of the court, making it a near certainty that he’s assigned cases filed at that location.

	“This lawsuit is an affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact,” writes Thomas Riney, a lawyer for CBS, in the filing. Trump seeks to “punish a news organization for constitutionally protected editorial judgments they do not like.”


	Last month, Trump revised his lawsuit to add Republican U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, his former doctor who lives in Texas, as a plaintiff to keep the case in Texas federal court. The case revolves around allegations that CBS News aired a “heavily tampered interview” with former Vice President Kamala Harris to help her in the election by editing certain answers in a way that misled consumers. This manipulation of the interview, Trump alleged, constitutes a violation of Texas’ consumer protection law covering deceptive advertising and the unfair competition prong of the Lanham Act, a trademark law.


	In Thursday’s filing, CBS argues that the inclusion of Jackson in the lawsuit is a “vain effort to manufacture a connection to this District.” It stresses that Jackson has spent the majority of the last decade based in Washington, D.C. and that the complaint doesn’t sufficiently allege that he watched or suffered an injury from the 60 Minutes segment at the center of the legal battle in the state.


	CBS also says that the lawsuit doesn’t belong in Texas because the 60 Minutes segment, which was focused on the national presidential election, didn’t target Texans more than residents of other states.

	











	“The interview of Vice President Kamala Harris, excerpts of which aired on Face the Nation and 60 Minutes, was not filmed, edited, or produced in Texas, nor was Texas in any way the subject of the interview,” the filing states. “If this district has personal jurisdiction merely because CBS programs are broadcast nationwide, so too does every district court in the country. That is not the law.”


	If the lawsuit isn’t dismissed, CBS claims that it should be moved to federal court in New York.


	Paramount declined to comment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Marc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois is getting ready to introduce a fancy ergonomic chair designed to reduce customers’ back pain and boost their productivity. He figures the most expensive one will sell for more than $1,000. But he can’t settle on a price, and he is reluctantly reducing the shipment he’s bringing to the United States from China.

There’s a reason for his caution: President Donald Trump’s ever-changing, on-again, off-again tariff war with America’s three biggest trading partners – Mexico, Canada and China.

The latest reversal came Thursday. Two days after imposing 25% taxes — tariffs — on all imports from Canada and Mexico and threatening to detonate more than $1.3 billion in annual U.S. trade in North America, Trump announced on his Truth Social media platform that he was suspending most of the levies on Mexico for a month. This was an expansion of his Wednesday announcement when he exempted auto imports from both countries for 30 days, and it also comes after a previous monthlong tariff reprieve for Canada and Mexico right before they were to take effect Feb. 4. 

Rosenberg and his ergonomic furniture, meanwhile, are contending with a 20% tariff on imports from China – which Trump on Tuesday raised from 10% -- but he’s not sure where the tariff will actually land. 

“The misdirection is making it very tough to plan for the year,’’ he said.




Tariffs cause economic pain in part because they’re a tax paid by importers that often gets passed along to consumers, adding to inflationary pressure. They also draw retaliation from trading partners, which can hurt all economies involved.

But import taxes can cause economic damage in another way: by complicating the decisions businesses have to make, including which suppliers to use, where to locate factories, what prices to charge. And that uncertainty can cause them to delay or cancel investments that help drive economic growth.

“It creates an enormous amount of uncertainty for multinational companies that sell products worldwide, that import from the rest of the world, that run these complex supply chains through multiple countries,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University. “The uncertainty is going to be very unsettling for businesses and ... it will hurt business investment.’'

During Trump’s first-term trade battles, U.S. business investment weakened late in 2019, convincing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three times in second half of the year to provide some offsetting economic stimulus.

Trump 2.0 is even more unnerving to business. The first Trump administration imposed tariffs on specific targets — steel and aluminum and most goods from China — after lengthy investigations.

This time, Trump has invoked his power to declare a national emergency — ostensibly over the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants across U.S. borders — to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China with the stroke of a pen. And he’s expanded his targets. Next month, for example, he intends to impose “reciprocal tariffs’’ on countries that charge higher import taxes than America does.

“Just the threat of those tariff increases and potential retaliations are putting a brake on — on investment, on consumption decisions, on employment, hiring, all the rest of it,’’ European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said after the ECB cut interest rates Thursday to support Europe’s struggling economy.

His tariffs on Canada and Mexico effectively blow up a 2020 North American trade deal he negotiated himself five years ago. “Past trade agreements simply don’t mean much if the president can unilaterally violate them and impose tariffs with no checks at all,” said Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College.

Adding to the uncertainty: It’s unclear what Trump is trying to achieve by plastering tariffs on American trading partners. Sometimes he cites border security. Sometimes he emphasizes the revenue that tariffs can generate for the Treasury — money that can help finance his proposed tax cuts. Sometimes he points to America’s big trade deficits with most other countries. 

Since the goals are cloudy, it’s hard to see what it will take to make Trump’s tariffs go away.

Not only that, but he’s imposed the tariffs erratically, creating even more confusion. For instance, his administration had to reverse itself last month after ending a customs loophole – the “de minimis” exemption -- allowing duty-free entry into the United States of packages from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800. Turned out, the U.S. postal service needed more time to figure out how to collect the duties.

Businesses are baffled. “I’ve talked to multiple companies that are saying, ‘We’re not moving forward with any investment. We need this to be settled,’” said trade lawyer Gregory Husisian at the law firm Foley & Lardner. At least in Trump’s first term “they knew what the ground rules were. Now they don’t know if we’re playing Monopoly or tic-tac-toe.’’

Respondents to the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing survey, out Monday, voiced complaints about the tariff uncertainty. “There is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so it’s harder to project how they will affect business,” a transportation equipment company said. A chemicals firm griped: “The tariff environment regarding products from Mexico and Canada has created uncertainty and volatility among our customers.’’

“Right now, the tariffs are putting everybody off balance because of their unpredictability and uncertainty,” said John Gulliver, president of the New England-Canada Business Council.

Taylor Samuels, the owner of Las Almas Rotas, a bar and restaurant in Dallas, depends on Mexico for much of the alcohol he offers.

The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, including the potential impact on the price of raw materials like steel and lumber, are forcing him to review his plans to build a new restaurant. 

“That construction budget is now under review and may likely be delayed ... as I recalculate costs that have already been budgeted,” he said.

Similarly, Sandya Dandamudi of GI Stone, a stone supplier in Chicago, said builders are having to rethink their plans. 

“Developers of commercial projects like high-rises and hotels budget two years in advance, so they don’t account for new tariffs,” she said. “Those budgets will be blown.’’

Dandamudi said that companies will either succeed in passing the tariffs along to their customers or they will be forced to cancel projects.

“The tariffs will be devastating for small businesses like ours,” she said. “Going forward, we won’t be able to sign any new contracts unless clients address the tariffs.”

Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, that sells Canadian whisky and other specialty spirits, said her plans for the future have been put on hold due to the tariffs. Her original plan for 2025 was to almost double her inventory and the selection she offered. 

“For now, we have no plans of adding more shelving or space for new items, we will stick to the footprint we have,” she said. “This will delay the growth of our business, making us a bit stagnant.’’

The British production outfit is the latest addition to Mediawan's growing empire, which also includes Brad Pitt's Plan B and German mini-major Leonine. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	European production-distribution group Mediawan has acquired a majority stake in British-Australian production company See-Saw Films, the Oscar-winning studio behind The King’s Speech and The Power of the Dog and such TV series as AppleTV+’s Slow Horses and Netflix’s Heartstopper. 


	Founded in 2008 by Iain Canning and Emile Sherman, See-Saw Films is one of the most prestigious outfits on the market, with an awards track record that includes 5 Oscars,  awards track record, including 5 Oscars, 13 Emmys, and 15 BAFTAs.




	The deal continues Mediawan’s buying spree, which has seen the French outfit do a series of headline-making deals, including taking majority ownership of Brad Pitt’s Plan B in 2022, partnering with LeBron James’ The SpringHill Company last September, and purchasing German mini-major Leonine. Mediawan already has a major presence in the U.K. market with a portfolio that includes production groups Drama Republic, Misfits Entertainment, and animation outfit Wildseed Studios. But See-Saw is the company’s first British operation with a major profile in feature films.

	In a statement, Mediawan said the acquisition reinforced the company’s continued global expansion, and its ambition “to cultivate rich and diverse talent and premium productions across all genres and formats. By strengthening its international presence, Mediawan will continue to create powerful stories, build iconic content and establish renowned franchises for all audiences worldwide.”


	Canning and Sherman will stay on as joint CEOs of See-Saw, working with joint managing directors Helen Gregory and Simon Gillis, and Australian head of TV and film Liz Watts. 


	Similar to the Plan B deal, the See-Saw buyout is a cash-and-shares agreement which will see Canning and Sherman become shareholders in See-Saw’s new French parent. Financial details were not disclosed. 


	“We are delighted to welcome See-Saw Films to the Mediawan family,” said Pierre-Antoine Capton, Co-founder and CEO of The Mediawan Group and Elisabeth d’Arvieu, CEO of Mediawan Pictures, in a joint statement. “Under Iain and Emile’s leadership, See-Saw has become one of the most prestigious, innovative, and critically acclaimed production companies.

Much like all the upheaval shaking the world, the huge swings rocking Wall Street may feel far from normal

You May Want to Jump off Wall Street's Wild Ride, but Remember: This Is What the Market Does

NEW YORK (AP) — Much like all the upheaval shaking the world, the huge swings rocking Wall Street may feel far from normal. But, for investing at least, all this is typical.

Sharp moves for the U.S. stock market, like its recent 6% drop in just a couple of weeks, happen regularly. Stomaching them is the price investors have to pay for the bigger returns that stocks can offer over other investments in the long term. 

This time doesn't look much different, experts say. Here's a glimpse at what's behind the market's wild moves and what experts are advising investors young and old to consider: 



  THE MARKET IS BAD, RIGHT?
 

It has certainly struggled. The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, has been dropping since setting an all-time high last month, largely because of worries about President Donald Trump's tariffs and signals that the U.S. economy is running less powerfully than economists expected. 

Any kind of uncertainty around the economy will give Wall Street pause. These tariffs have had a particularly jostling effect because no one knows how long Trump will go through with them. When worries are high, stocks sink sharply. When Wall Street goes back to thinking Trump is using tariffs as just a negotiating tactic, stocks have bounced back, such as on Wednesday. 



  STOCKS DO THIS OFTEN?
 

Yes. The S&P 500 has regularly seen declines bigger than this recent one, of 10% or more, every year or so. Often, experts view them as a culling of optimism that can otherwise run overboard, driving stock prices too high. 

Before this recent stumble, many critics were already saying the U.S. stock market was too expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits. They also pointed to how only a handful of companies was driving so much of the market's returns. A group of just seven Big Tech companies accounted for more than half of the S&P 500's total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 



  SHOULD I SELL AND GET OUT? 
 

Anytime an investor sees they’re losing money, it feels bad. This recent run feels particularly unnerving because of how incredibly calm the market had previously been. The S&P 500 is coming off a second straight year where it shot up by more than 20%, the first time that's happened since baggy pants were last in style before the millennium. 

Selling may offer some feeling of relief. But it also locks in losses and prevents the chance of making the money back over time. Historically, the S&P 500 has come back from every one of its downturns to eventually make investors whole again. That includes after the Great Depression, the dot-com bust and the 2020 COVID crash. 

Some recoveries take longer than others, but experts often recommend not putting money into stocks that you can't afford to lose for several years, up to 10. 

“Data has shown, historically, that no one can time the market,” said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of WalletHub. “No one can consistently figure out the best time to buy and sell.”

Put another way: “Keep on keeping on,” suggests Chris Fasciano, vice president, investment management and research, and chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.



  SHOULD I CHANGE ANYTHING WITH MY INVESTMENTS?
 

Even as the overall U.S. stock market has dropped, some corners outside the Magnificent Seven have done much better, Fasciano said. So have stocks outside the United States.

It could all be a reminder that investors often do best when they have a mixed set of investments rather than going all-in on just a few. And investors may no longer be as diversified as they thought after years of sheer dominance by the Magnificent Seven over the U.S. stock market and by Wall Street over global markets. 

“Now’s the time to revisit some of the old tried-and-true of portfolio construction, like diversification,” Fasciano said. 



  I JUST STARTED INVESTING IN STOCKS. WHAT SHOULD I DO?
 

The proliferation of online trading platforms and the ease of smartphones has helped create a new generation of investors who may not be used to such volatility. 

But the good news is younger investors often have the gift of time. With decades to go until retirement, they can afford to ride the waves and let their stock portfolios hopefully recover before compounding and eventually growing even bigger. 

“We would advise younger investors to not worry about this at all,” said Phil Battin, CEO of Ambassador Wealth Management. "It’s just background noise. If you have 30 to 50 years until you need the money, the economy has survived world wars, oil embargoes, presidential assassinations, Y2K, and a global pandemic. It will survive the Trump tariffs as well.”



  WHAT ABOUT CRYPTO?
 

This is a little trickier. “In theory, part of the appeal of crypto is that it’s supposed to be a hedge investment that isn’t correlated with the stock market or the fiat-currency economy,” said Sam Taube, lead investing writer for NerdWallet. 

But in reality, at least recently, crypto has often gone down in price when stocks have gone down, instead of offering that hoped-for protection during Wall Street's sell-offs. "So, young investors may need to rethink the idea that crypto’s value is completely independent of the stock market and broader economy,” Taube said.



  WHAT IF I'M NEAR RETIREMENT?
 

Older investors have less time than younger ones to allow their investments to bounce back. But even in retirement, some people will need their investments to last 30 years or more, said Niladri “Neel” Mukherjee, chief investment officer of TIAA Wealth Management.

People who have already retired may want to cut back on spending and withdrawals after sharp market downturns, because bigger withdrawals will remove more potential compounding ability in the future. But even retirees, at least in the early part of retirement, should still be invested in stocks to prepare for the possibility of decades of spending ahead. 

“You may want to slow that down and pick that back up once the market recovers,” Mukherjee said, “but it all comes down to having that conversation with your adviser and your portfolio manager.”



  HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST?
 

No one knows, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Macy’s delivered another quarter of mixed results on Thursday as investors wait and see how quickly CEO Tony Spring can pull off a turnaround of the business with yet another activist investor looking to take the chain private.

Across the business, which includes the Macy’s banner, Bloomingdale’s and Blue Mercury, comparable sales during the all-important holiday quarter were down 1.1%. But comparable sales across its owned and licensed businesses, plus its online marketplace, were up 0.2%, which is the highest the metric has been since the first quarter of 2022. 

Plus, the so-called First 50 locations — the stores that Macy’s is devoting more resources to as part of its turnaround plan — saw comparable sales up 0.8%, marking the fourth quarter in a row the metric has been positive.

The two bright spots in an otherwise worse-than-expected set of results suggest Macy’s turnaround is showing some signs of life — it just might not be working fast enough.

For fiscal 2025, Macy’s is expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 to $2.25 and sales of between $21 billion and $21.4 billion, lower than Wall Street expectations of $2.31 per share and $21.8 billion, according to LSEG.

Macy’s shares fell slightly in early trading.

Here’s how the department store performed during its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 1 was $342 million, or $1.21 per share, compared with a loss of $128 million, or a loss of 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items including impairments and settlement and restructuring charges, Macy’s reported earnings of $507 million, or $1.80 per share. 

Sales dropped to $7.77 billion, down about 4% from $8.12 billion a year earlier. Like other retailers, Macy’s benefited from an extra selling week in the year-ago period, which has skewed comparisons. 

For the current quarter, Macy’s is expecting adjusted earnings per share of between 12 cents and 15 cents and sales of between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, far below estimates of 28 cents and $4.71 billion, according to LSEG.

On a call with analysts, chief operating officer and chief financial officer Adrian Mitchell said the company is taking a “prudent” approach to guidance given the fluid nature of the turnaround plan, cautious consumer spending and uncertainties created by recent tariff increases between the U.S. and major trade partners.

“If we weren’t in the environment that were operating in, I would be even more bullish on our potential,” CEO Spring said during a call with analysts. “But I think prudency is important at this point in time.”

Macy’s mixed results come just over a year into Spring’s tenure as the legacy department store’s chief executive and his three-year strategy to turn the business around. While Bloomingdale’s and Blue Mercury saw another quarter of positive comparable sales, growing 4.8% and 6.2%, respectively, Macy’s namesake banner continues to be the company’s laggard with comps down 1.9%. 

To address long-standing issues at the legacy banner, Spring has implemented an aggressive store closure plan that includes shuttering 150 doors and a strategy to fix its better-performing locations. As Macy’s and other department stores have shrunk over the years, it’s faced criticism for neglecting its stores, not having enough staff and falling behind on the retail essentials that are necessary to win in any environment. 

Spring has started to address those issues by investing in 50 locations and providing better staffing, merchandising and visual presentation of the company’s varied assortment.

So far, the plan appears to be working. When Macy’s added more staffing to the shoes and handbag departments at 100 test locations, those stores outperformed shops that didn’t have those investments, Spring said Thursday.

Storewide, the first 50 locations have continued to outperform the bulk of the chain, and in February, the company added an additional 75 stores to the program, bringing the total number of “reimagined” locations to 125.

“Performance of both the first 50 and the 100 test stores illustrate that when we invest in the customer experience, we can grow sales,” said Spring. “Now we must scale these changes in order to achieve our long-term goals.”

In fiscal 2024, comparable sales across Macy’s business were still down by 0.9%, but that’s an improvement of 5.1 percentage points compared to fiscal 2023. In the fourth quarter, comparable sales at the Macy’s nameplate also saw a decline of 0.9%, up 3.8 percentage points from the prior year.

Still, investors shouldn’t expect a return to growth this year. The company is projecting comparable sales for the owned stores it’s keeping open, plus its licensed businesses and online marketplace, to be down 2% to flat in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year.

Reimagined stores now make up 36% of the 350 Macy’s locations that the business plans to keep open after it finishes closing underperforming locations. It will take time — and capital — to extend its strategy to the bulk of the chain. Spring has given the company two more years to pull it off, but whether investors have the patience to see the strategy play out — and whether macroeconomic conditions will slow it down — remains to be seen. 

In December, activist investor Barington Capital revealed it has a position in Macy’s and wants the company to cut spending, explore selling its luxury brands and take a hard look at its real estate portfolio. It’s the fourth activist push at the department store in the last decade.

Like the activists that had come right before it, Arkhouse and Brigade, many suspect that Barington is mainly after Macy’s lucrative real estate portfolio and is more interested in juicing it for profit than doing the work necessary to revitalize the chain. Still, Macy’s must act in the interest of shareholders and if it’s not doing enough to return value quickly an activist could eventually win out.

Macy’s on Thursday announced its intent to resume share buybacks under its remaining $1.4 billion share repurchase authorization, “market conditions pending.” 

“Building on our momentum, we continue to elevate the customer experience, deliver operational excellence and make prudent capital investments,” said Mitchell. “We remain committed to generating healthy free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and predictable quarterly dividends.”

What if the key to economic success isn’t just supporting entrepreneurs but thinking like one? 

Communities focus on attracting high-growth companies, but the real advantage comes when they adopt the same mindset as the innovators they seek to attract.

Legendary basketball coach John Wooden wisely noted, “Don’t mistake activity for achievement.” Entrepreneurs embody this principle. They don’t measure success by how many meetings they attend or how many pitches they make. Instead, they define bold visions, set clear milestones and track tangible progress. When something isn’t working, they adjust. Their success depends not on effort alone but on measurable results.

Economic development organizations and the communities they serve should adopt a similar approach. Often, there’s a focus on reporting past activities like companies recruited, jobs promised and capital invested without setting long-term outcome goals or assessing whether these efforts are the best way to strengthen the local economy. Key questions to consider include: Is household wealth increasing? How does our economy compare to peer communities? Are we positioned for future economic success? These are the real measures of economic health.

Venture capitalist John Doerr advocates for objectives and key results, a framework employed by leading innovative companies around the world. The concept is straightforward: set ambitious, measurable goals and adjust based on outcomes, not activities. Entrepreneurs thrive using this model and communities can, too.

Embracing this mindset is essential. Economic development must be as agile as the businesses it supports. By setting clear goals, tracking progress, and adjusting as needed, communities can move from activity to real achievement. Those that think like entrepreneurs won’t just attract innovators — they’ll become centers of innovation themselves.

If outspoken Palantir (PLTR) co-founder and CEO Alex Karp is uber-bullish about his secretive software company, he isn't showing it in his trades.

Karp has dumped $45 million worth of stock in the past two weeks after unloading about $2 billion in 2024, new research from Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reveals. Karp has sold 21% of his overall stake in Palantir.

The latest sale barrage comes after Karp recently adopted a 10b5-1 trading plan for the maximum sale of 9.975 million shares of Class A common stock. The trading arrangement will last until Sept. 12, 2025.

A plan of this kind allows insiders of public companies to set up a schedule to sell their shares over a period of time.

Other Palantir insiders have also been aggressively selling stock, according to Yahoo Finance data.

The flurry of sales has sent a negative signal to the retail investor community that has long propped up the momentum stock.

Shares have crashed 30% from their 52-week closing high on Feb. 18.

"Among the top retail-traded stocks, Palantir could be the most vulnerable to a loss of retail momentum. If I were to pick a single name that could be most at risk of an unwind, PLTR would be it," Vanda Research senior vice president Marco Iachini said.

The Palantir sell-off also reflects several factors.

The Department of Defense is reportedly eyeing an 8% annual cut in spending for the next five years. This is a potential blow to Palantir, which relies heavily on government contracts. The stock's surge up to its mid-February record highs had been driven, in part, by expectations that the Trump administration would ramp up defense spending.

"As Palantir has heavy exposure to US government spending/budgets there have been recent Street concerns that this spending backdrop will be a headwind to this tech stalwarts' growth profile in 2025 and beyond," said Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.

Palantir further raised fresh red flags in its annual report.

The company's headcount grew by just 5% in 2024 after declining 3% in 2023. Over the past two years, the company has added only 98 employees, Jefferies' Thill estimates.

Second, the company's chief accounting officer, Heather Planishek, stepped down on Feb. 24. The company's CFO, David Glazer, has assumed her responsibilities on an interim basis.

And third, Palantir continues to overly rely on its biggest customers for business — its top three customers accounted for 17% of revenue in 2024.

"Our concerns about the runway for growth and product differentiation remain," RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote in a client note. "We continue to see the risk-reward skewing unfavorable with shares trading at a premium multiple."

Founder and CEO of American Majority Ned Ryun discusses President Donald Trump placing a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’

The recent announcement by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to pour another $100 billion into the United States will have a direct impact on Arizona, but the debate on the future of the semiconductor industry persists after President Donald Trump's address on Tuesday night.

Rep. Abe Hamadeh, R-Ariz., said that Trump’s influence played a critical role in the company building on their existing investment in the Grand Canyon State, as the announcement happened at the White House earlier this week.

"He knows how to make deals and having foreign companies come in the United States. That's the best of all worlds because they're abandoning the policies over there to come to United States to benefit from our lower regulation, our less taxes," the congressman, whose district houses the TSMC facility, said in an interview with Fox News Digital on Monday, prior to Trump's speech.

"It’s gonna be great. And for my constituents, again, we're pushing hard to make sure that they focus on hiring Americans and veterans," he added. Hamadeh's staff met with TSMC last month, according to a news release.

The announcement comes as the president calls for the repeal of the CHIPS and Science Act, a bill that provided direct financial incentives to grow the semiconductor industry supply chain.

"Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn’t mean a thing. They take our money and they don’t spend it," Trump said on Tuesday night.

The debate about the semiconductor industry's success with the act largely centers around whether companies are coming to the U.S. because of a preferable business environment or because of grant and loan deals.

The legislation, which passed with some bipartisan support in 2022, came under direct scrutiny last year as Intel had major layoffs despite being cleared for $8.5 billion in federal funding.

"The CHIPS Act is what helped get TSMC to the US and Arizona. And it brought their $100 billion announcement that came earlier this week—at the White House. Getting rid of the CHIPS Act would hurt the entire American microchip industry, including suppliers, American companies, and more," Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., posted to X on Tuesday night, as the repeal effort was mentioned in Trump’s Joint Address to Congress.

"Plus, it unravels the years of bipartisan work it took to bring these investments to Arizona. We can't let politics get in the way of that," the senator added.

When it comes to TSMC in particular, the effort to woo the large chip producer was well underway during the first Trump administration – before the act became law under former President Joe Biden, but the company did enter preliminary agreements for financial incentives under the program.

"It was actually President Trump, Ric Grinnell, Wilbur Ross, that brought [TSMC] into the United States," Hamadeh said.

The freshman Republican lawmaker added that the president’s tariff policies, which include Mexico and Canada, will help boost American manufacturing.

"I think tariffs is excellent, because you're already seeing the results of it so quickly. These companies, they understand they could hire Americans, they could manufacture in America. Right now, there's just an incentive for them not to," he said. "And now what President Trump has removed that incentive by a lot, by imposing these tariffs. So clearly his policies are working."

The bulk of the semiconductor industry rests in Taiwan, which has raised national security concerns given the high tensions between China and the U.S. Chips play a critical role in operating everyday technology, including consumer electronics like phones and computers.

La Cala Resort has unveiled a series of renovations and new experiences that further enhance the world-class facilities at the luxury golf and lifestyle destination located on Spain’s Costa del Sol. 

The resort, which is owned by FBD Hotels & Resorts, undertook an extensive renovation project over the winter, transforming half of its 107 rooms with a modern and stylish redesign. Guests will now enjoy more spacious rooms equipped with modern furnishings and a décor that reflects the essence of Andalusian heritage. 

Each room features balconies or terraces, air conditioning, twin or double beds, and USB sockets for charging devices. Golfers will particularly appreciate the golf bag racks in the newly designed walk-in closets.

“We’re delighted to announce that the first part of our room renovations is complete, and we are now ready to welcome guests to experience both the comfort of our updated rooms and the fantastic facilities we offer,” said Sean Corte-Real, General Manager of La Cala Resort. “With everything in place, it’s the perfect time to escape to the Costa del Sol, where guests can enjoy our three championship golf courses, which have been extensively improved over the last five years.”

La Cala Resort has also introduced a golf simulator featuring the latest sensor technology for unparalleled precision. Guests can now play a few holes in the Sports Lounge, located in the clubhouse, and experience the thrill of playing at famous courses like Pebble Beach or preparing for their next day’s game on the La Cala courses.

In addition to its new rooms and golf experiences, La Cala Resort continues to deliver exceptional dining options. The newly renovated La Terraza restaurant now features a large terrace area offering stunning views of the pool, a private dining area and a new buffet section for breakfast. La Terraza will serve a new Tapas & Mediterranean inspired menu to guests in the evening. 

A second addition to the dining lineup is the new Steakhouse restaurant, which has been crafted for salad and steak lovers alike. While its main feature will be steaks cooked on charcoal, the menu will also feature a selection of succulent salads based on seasonal ingredients. All this is accompanied by carefully selected beers, IPAs, and vermouths that are perfect for every taste.

Only 3% of Businesses Accurately Spot Financial Red Flags When Assessing Customer Risk, Reveals Creditsafe Study


ALLENTOWN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--2024 was a milestone year for corporate bankruptcies, with well-known brands like Express, Joann, Red Lobster and TGI Friday’s filing for bankruptcy. The reality is that several factors contributed to the downfall of these companies, including declining sales, high debt loads, increasing costs and cash flow issues. The reality is that erratic payment practices are often highly indicative of cash flow issues and financial distress. But the ‘Cost of Late Payments’ study released by Creditsafe reveals that few businesses know how to spot the red flags or identify which risk patterns are indicative of cash flow issues.



The good news is that 86% of the respondents believe frequent or increasing late payments from customers over a 12-month period has a moderate to high impact on the likelihood that a customer will go out of business or file for bankruptcy. This suggests that businesses are becoming more aware of the correlation between payment behaviors and bankruptcy risk. But there is one major problem. Only 3% of businesses are accurately spotting the real signs of trouble when analyzing the payment behaviors of their customers – despite historical data showing that sudden shifts in payment behavior often precede bankruptcy.



Key findings from the report include:



Steve Carpenter, Chief Operating Officer for North America at Creditsafe, says, “Our study’s findings highlight the need to educate – or re-educate – finance teams on how they can properly identify red flags when assessing the financial health of their customers. It’s not just about why it’s important to regularly review and analyze the historical trade payment data of customers. While that’s very important, it’s also necessary to provide helpful tips and training so finance teams can accurately identify problematic patterns that are indicative of cash flow issues and an increased likelihood of late payments over time. Otherwise, businesses will continue to miss and misread clear red flags – costing them dearly in terms of the amount of time it takes to chase unpaid invoices and the negative impact it has on the bottom line.”

Canadian provinces pulling US alcohol off store shelves in response to Trump trade policy is "worse than tariffs", the boss of Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman has said.

Several Canadian provinces, including Ontario, which is by far the most populated, took action this week in retaliation for US tariffs on Canadian goods.

The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), one of the largest buyers of alcohol in the world, removed US-made alcoholic drinks from its shelves on Tuesday.

Brown-Forman boss Lawson Whiting said the Canadian response was "disproportionate" to the 25% levies on Canadian goods imposed by the Trump administration.

"I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves," Mr Whiting said.

In response to the tariffs, Canada has retaliated with 25% levies on goods imported from the US, including beer, spirits, and wine.

Some provinces also took action themselves, including Ontario and Nova Scotia.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the LCBO sells nearly $1bn of US alcohol per year. "As of today, every single one of these products is off the shelves," Mr Ford said on Tuesday.

The LCBO is the exclusive wholesaler in Ontario, which means other retailers, bars and restaurants in the province will no longer be able to restock US products, Mr Ford said.

Nevertheless, Mr Whiting said Canada makes up only 1% of Brown-Forman's total sales, so the firm can withstand the hit.

Canadians are being advised by the LCBO to buy products made in Canada. Some Canadians have been turning to local goods anyway in response to the Trump tariffs.

Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, criticised the US tariffs on Tuesday, saying imposing them was "a very dumb thing to do".

He also accused the US president of planning "a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us".

Trump has made a number of remarks about making Canada the 51st state of his country, which Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has said she takes "very seriously".

Washington has also placed 25% tariffs on Mexico, although Trump has said he will temporarily spare carmakers in both Canada and Mexico from the taxes.

Trump has accused both Canada and Mexico of failing to do enough to stem the flow of the fentanyl opioid into the US, an argument that has been rejected by both countries.

Mr Whiting said Brown-Forman was going to see what happens in Mexico, which accounted for 7% of its sales in 2024.

Pharmaceutical giant Merck received a $30.2 million grant from the state in an effort to sway the company to build its $900 million manufacturing facility in the Wilmington area.

The taxpayer-funded grant is the highest amount that has been doled out to a company since Bloom Energy’s approval in 2011.

Merck & Co. has not confirmed whether or not it will choose Delaware as its place to expand, but business leaders in Delaware are optimistic about what the potential move could mean for the state.

Merck & Co. is a global health care company that specializes in the production and distribution of vaccines, pharmaceuticals and animal health care products.

Merck has been looking for a location to set up their newest manufacturing facility, which will produce drug substances and products with a targeted operational start date of 2030.

According to plans shared with Delaware Online/The News Journal via a Freedom of Information Act request, the company is considering constructing a $900 million multi-building complex for labs, manufacturing and distribution operations at the Chestnut Run Innovation and Science Park near Greenville.

Under the conservative estimates listed in the plans, the facility would bring roughly 375 full-time jobs to the area.

The company is reportedly still considering other locations, but is bound by nondisclosure agreements to reveal more about the other possibilities, as reported by the Delaware Business Times.

If Merck chooses the Delaware site, the company would be locked into a 20-year lease at the CRISP campus.

This wouldn’t be Merck’s first venture into the First State, however. The company already has an animal health facility in Millsboro.

The Delaware Council on Development Finance unanimously approved the grant application on Monday, Feb. 24.

The grant was divided into $4.7 million worth in job performance grants and $25.5 million in capital expenditure grants. The performance grants are dispersed after the company makes its investments into the facility and workforce.

Although nothing is promised yet, Michael Fleming, president and CEO of the Delaware Bioscience Association, remains optimistic and said that this deal could cement Delaware as a winner in the area in terms of attracting industrial and scientific investment.

“This new facility would be a tremendous boost for and validation of the growth and momentum of our dynamic life science industry,” Fleming said. “We look forward to welcoming Merck and applaud their interest in strengthening U.S. manufacturing and our supply chain right here in Delaware.

Susan Colby, senior manager of communications for the Delaware Prosperity Partnership echoed that the move would boost Delaware’s portfolio.

“This project would reinforce Delaware’s standing in the global biopharmaceutical ecosystem, and we are excited by the potential opportunities it would provide Delaware residents and businesses,” Colby said.  

As for what Merck has to say about the grant, Ned Ehrbar, associate director of Merck’s global media relations kept it vague, stating via email: Merck is considering Delaware as a potential location to develop a new commercialization and launch facility.

The CRISP campus, located at 984 Centre Road just outside of Greenville, has long been a mainstay in the state’s evolving life sciences investment.

Formerly a site for DuPont research, the 164-acre site was purchased by MRA Group in 2021 with hopes of transforming the site into the leading campus for Delaware’s life science laboratories and research facilities.

Amenities for the campus will include a hotel, childcare and fitness centers, an outdoor amphitheater and accommodations for restaurants.  

Chemical manufacturing company Solenis expanded its research and development facilities into the CRISP campus in late 2022 and precision oncology company Prelude Therapeutics cut the ribbon on their new headquarters at CRISP in February, 2024. DuPont is also leasing 190,000 square-feet of space at its former space.

Last month, the developer group broke ground on the Marriott Residence Inn, which will feature 127 rooms with both short- and long-term stay options, food services, a full-service bar, meeting spaces and outdoor patios

MRA Group declined to comment on the recently approved grant for Merck.

Awarding these grants worth tens of millions of dollars involves a process that is relatively new, with various “checks and balances” in place, but limited transparency at times.  

The Delaware Economic Development Authority was created by the General Assembly under former Gov. John Carney, intended to promote economic activity in Delaware. It is chaired by CJ Bell, the director of the Delaware Division of Small Business.

The Council on Development Finance is an advisor to the Delaware Economic Development Authority, and is responsible for conducting public hearings before the authority issues any financial support to potential projects.

The Delaware Prosperity Partnership, a nonprofit state economic development agency, often vets applications or potential investment opportunities and brings them to the Council. As previously reported by DelawareOnline, since DPP is not technically a part of the state government, it is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.

In the seven years of its existence, the Council on Development Finance has approved every Strategic Funds application that has been brought to it by the Delaware Prosperity Partnership.

The $30 million grant offered to Merck will be reimbursed after the company makes its investment – in this case, a nearly $1 billion one.

In 2021, the Council on Development Finance approved $19 million for WuXi AppTec, a Shanghai-based company that develops and manufactures drugs for pharmaceutical clients, to build its manufacturing campus near Middletown’s Amazon fulfillment center.

Gov. Matt Meyer has gone on record against these types of taxpayer-funded grants, announcing during a Delaware State Chamber of Commerce annual dinner that his administration will see “the use of cash assistance de-emphasized,” as reported by Spotlight Delaware.

Meyer’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the most recent grant funding.

Cryptocurrency falls as much as 6 percent as lack of plans for government purchases disappoints investors.

United States President Donald Trump’s executive order to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a stockpile of other digital assets has failed to impress crypto markets, with Bitcoin’s value plummeting following the announcement.

Bitcoin fell as much as 6 percent following Trump’s order on Thursday, which did not include plans for the government to actively buy Bitcoin.

After dropping as low as $84,900, the cryptocurrency was trading at about $87,700 as of 05:00 GMT.

In a statement announcing the order, Trump’s crypto tsar David Sacks said the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and “Digital Asset Stockpile” would be capitalised with assets forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings.

“This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,” Sacks said on X.

“It is estimated that the US government owns about 200,000 Bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. (executive order) directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings.”

Sacks said the order also called for the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce to develop “budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional Bitcoin” provided they are at no cost to the US taxpayer.

Trump’s order came after he repeatedly flagged plans to establish a cryptocurrency stockpile or reserve as part of his pledge to turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet”.

 



 

Some crypto enthusiasts, however, were less than impressed.

Shayan Salehi, a German tech entrepreneur, described the announcement that the government would not acquire additional assets as “famous words than can unleash a bear market”.

“Market muted,” Spencer Hakimian, the founder of New York-based Tolou Capital Management, said in a post on X alongside a screenshot of a graph showing Bitcoin’s fall.

Hakimian said the plan was “very underwhelming”.

“They will not currently buy any new Bitcoin unless they can do it in a revenue-neutral way. Nothing the federal government does is revenue neutral,” he said.

The US owns an estimated 200,000 Bitcoin seized during criminal and civil forfeiture.

Sacks suggested the reserve would function like a “digital Fort Knox” by helping Bitcoin retain its value.

“Premature sales of Bitcoin have already cost US taxpayers over $17bn in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings,” he said.

In addition to a Bitcoin reserve, Sacks said a separate stockpile would be established for “digital assets other than Bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings”.

That stockpile could include tokens such as ether, XRP, Solana and Cardano – assets named by Trump earlier this week in a social media post detailing his plans for a cryptocurrency reserve.

The value of Bitcoin soared after Trump was elected in November, hitting a record peak of $109,071 in mid-January.

The president’s support for cryptocurrency has come under scrutiny, as his family has amassed billions of dollars in crypto wealth, including through a Trump meme coin launched in January.

Critics of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have warned that the assets have no intrinsic value and likened their rise to a Ponzi scheme.

Bitcoin (BTC) price extends its decline, trading around $87,000 on Friday after falling more than 7% so far this week. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) prices followed in BTC’s footsteps and declined nearly 15% and 16%, respectively, despite Trump signing an executive order to create the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on Thursday. 

Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it…

Bitcoin price faced rejection around the $95,000 level on Sunday and declined 8.54% the next day. However, on Tuesday, BTC dipped below the daily support level at $85,000 but bounced and closed above it. This daily level roughly coincides with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,843, making it a key support zone. At the time of writing on Friday, it trades down, finding support around the 200-day EMA at $85,843.

If BTC breaks below the 200-day EMA and closes below $85,000, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $73,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 41, which points downwards after rejecting from its neutral level of 50 earlier this week, indicating bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator coils around each other, suggesting indecisiveness among the traders.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if the $85,000 level holds as support, BTC could extend the recovery to retest its Sunday high of $95,000.

Ethereum price found support around its $2,125 level on Saturday and rose 13.56%, closing above its daily resistance of $2,359 the next day. However, ETH erased its recent gains on Monday but found support around its $2,125 level the next day and recovered 3.65% by Wednesday. At the time of writing on Friday, it declines and approaches its $2,125 support level.

If ETH declines and closes below $2,125, it could extend the decline to retest its weekly support level of $1,905.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 35 after rejecting around its neutral level of 50 on Sunday, indicating bearish momentum. At the same time, its MACD also showed a bearish crossover last week, suggesting a downward trend.



ETH/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if the $2,125 level holds as support and ETH continues its recovery, it could extend the rally to retest its next resistance level at $3,000.

Ripple price was rejected around its key psychological level of $3 on Sunday, and it declined 18.79% the next day. However, it found support on Tuesday and bounced off its 100-day EMA at $2.31, recovering 8.63% until Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, it declines slightly down around $2.48.

If the 100-day EMA at $2.31 holds, XRP could extend the recovery to retest its psychological level of $3. A firm close above this level could extend an additional rally to retest its January 16 high of $3.40.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 49 and remains flat around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among traders. The RSI must move above its neutral level for the recovery to be sustained.



XRP/USDT daily chart

However, if XRP fails to find support at the 100-day EMA and closes below, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Bitcoin price extends its decline, trading around $87,000 on Friday after falling more than 7% so far this week. Ethereum and Ripple prices declined nearly 15% and 16% respectively despite Trump signing an executive order to create the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on Thursday.

Litecoin price dipped below the $100 mark on Thursday, losing 22% in the past week as markets reacted to updates to US trade tariffs and speculation surrounding White House Crypto Summit to be held on Friday.

Bitcoin price dipped 5% to hit $85,000 on Monday as skittish sentiment around US Trade policy and Non-Farm Payrolls data introduced fresh volatility ahead of the White House Crypto Summit. However, a recent Bitcoin Strategic reserve announcement from Trump's Crypto Czar David Sacks could spark more gains. 

AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks confirmed on Thursday President Trump's executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and a list of key crypto industry figures attending the White House Crypto Summit.

Bitcoin (BTC) price extends its decline and trades below $80,000 at the time of writing on Friday, falling over 15% so far this week. This price correction wiped $660 billion of market capitalization from the overall crypto market and saw $3.68 billion in total liquidations this week.

March 6 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a strategic bitcoin reserve as well as a U.S. digital asset stockpile on Thursday, a day ahead of the White House hosting a crypto summit involving founders, ceo and investors in the cryptocurrency industry.

Trump signed the executive order on Thursday in the Oval Office.
According to a White House fact sheet, the bitcoin strategic reserve will hold only bitcoin and will be "capitalized" with the roughly 200,000 bitcoins in the Treasury's possession, which were seized over the years as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. Other agencies holding bitcoins will also look at potentially transferring them to the reserves.
"This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime," billionaire David Sacks, the White House's so-called crypto czar, said on X.

"Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value," Sacks claimed. "Now, the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings."

The executive order also established a U.S. digital asset stockpile, consisting of digital assets other than bitcoin, which are also in possession of the Treasury via forfeitures.
UPI has contacted the Treasury for comment.
The White House said agencies under the executive order are directed to provide an accounting of their digital assets to the treasury and the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.
"The purpose of the Stockpile is responsible stewardship of the government's digital assets under the Treasury Department," Sacks said.
Last week, Trump announced that the United States would create what he called a "strategic crypto reserve" that would house bitcoin and other digital currencies together.
Though initially skeptical about cryptocurrencies, Trump embraced the digital currency industry and its enthusiastic during his 2024 campaign.
Since being elected, he has created what some analysts have described as a crypto-friendly Cabinet and government. Billionaire Elon Musk is the most well-known of the new officials, having been put unofficially in charge of the quasi-government agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency.
Sacks is a Musk ally and both are considered members of the so-called PayPal mafia of founders and executives of the digital payment processing service who have gone on to develop other successful tech and venture capitalist companies.

 A US strategic Bitcoin reserve “dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic Bitcoin reserves,” says Bitwise's Matt Hougan. 

A strategic Bitcoin reserve in the United States reduces the possibility that the government will ever “ban” the cryptocurrency and could encourage many more nations to adopt Bitcoin, according to crypto observers. 

On March 7, US President Donald Trump signed an order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a digital asset stockpile. 

White House crypto czar David Sacks said that the reserve would be capitalized with “Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings,” estimated at around 200,000 BTC. This apparently disappointed traders, as it led to an immediate 6% fall in the price of Bitcoin. 

However, many say the markets may have it wrong, and the news should be viewed as bullish.

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said one of the impacts of a US strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve (SBR) is that it “dramatically reduces the likelihood the US government will someday ‘ban’ Bitcoin.”

In November, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis suggested that Bitcoin could one day force the federal government to balance its budget. 

“A legal prohibition against Bitcoin can restore unique implementation of permanent primary deficits, and so can a tax on Bitcoin,” it said at the time.

The US Bitcoin reserve also dramatically increases the chances that other nations will establish Bitcoin reserves and accelerates the speed at which other nations will consider establishing them, said Hougan, as it creates a short window for them to “front-run” potential Bitcoin buying by the US. 

The US is the global leader in nation-state Bitcoin holdings, with 207,189 BTC worth around $18 billion at current prices, according to BitBO. China is estimated to come in second with an estimated 194,000 BTC, followed by the United Kingdom, holding 61,000 Bitcoin. 

El Salvador is the only country to have designated BTC as legal tender. It is still accumulating and currently holds 6,103 BTC worth around $534 million, according to the nation’s Bitcoin Office.

“I expect many of the G20 to take notice and eventually follow America’s leadership,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. 

Hougan also opined that a US Bitcoin strategic reserve makes it much harder for institutions such as agencies like the International Monetary Fund “to position Bitcoin as somehow dangerous or inappropriate to hold.”

The IMF has been against sovereign nations, such as El Salvador, investing in BTC. On March 3, the IMF approved a funding program with El Salvador for $1.4 billion on the condition that it downgraded its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. 

The memorandum of understanding indicated a condition of “no voluntary accumulation of BTC by the public sector in El Salvador.”

Bitwise head of research Ryan Rasmussen continued with the notion, saying that the end game was never “the US government buys all of the world’s Bitcoin.”.

He listed what the US SBR means: “Other countries will buy BTC, wealth managers have no excuse, financial institutions have no excuse, pensions and endowments have no excuse, fear of the US selling is gone, the US will likely buy more, likelihood of states buying just went up, and the probability the government outlaws Bitcoin is definitively zero.”

The co-founder and CEO at Lightspark, David Marcus, simply said, “This is a balanced outcome and the right decision for now,” adding he was “happy reason has prevailed.”

Meanwhile, crypto lawyer John Deaton points out that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick “have been directed by the POTUS to find ‘budget neutral’ ways to acquire BTC.”

It was only a year ago that regulators approved the first US spot Bitcoin ETF, added ETF Store President Nate Geraci.

Bitcoin is currently rebounding, having reached $88,000 at the time of writing.

 Bitcoin's price tumbled after US President Donald Trump made a pledge not to sell any of the government’s current Bitcoin holdings but made no firm commitment to buy more. 

Bitcoin plunged approximately 6% after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

Market participants had hoped the government would announce a plan to buy more Bitcoin (BTC), but Trump’s crypto tsar David Sacks said on X it would only use the Bitcoin it already holds from criminal cases — though it will look to develop “budget-neutral” strategies to acquire additional Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin dropped about 6%, falling from $90,400 to $84,979, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Trading resource account The Kobeissi Letter said the reason for the Bitcoin price drop was there was “no explanation on how the reserve will be funded aside from Bitcoin already held by the US.”

Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) also fell on the news after Sacks confirmed that there will be a “US Digital Asset Stockpile,” but also only consist of digital assets forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings. 

“The government will not acquire additional assets for the Stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings,” Sacks said.

In the first hour after Sacks’ announcement, Ether had dropped 4%, XRP fell 7%, Solana had fallen 5.14%, and Cardano had slid 9.19%.

While it may not be the most optimistic announcement for the industry, some were surprised that Bitcoin’s price plunged after the announcement.

Electric Capital CEO Avichal said in an X post shortly after, “Who the hell sells the news of a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve?!”

Echoing a similar sentiment, pseudonymous crypto trader Ash Crypto said in an X post, “THIS IS NOT BUY THE RUMOR SELL THE NEWS EVENT, EVERY COUNTRY WILL FOLLOW SOON AND BITCOIN IS GOING TO $250,000+”

Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter added, “This market is way off. The ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ will have “additional bitcoin” acquisitions.” 

Other participants agree that it is a positive step that will only bolster greater adoption of Bitcoin.

Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda discusses the halt in probes into crypto firms, regulation, China's presence in U.S. markets and efforts for technology independence.

President Trump, late Thursday, signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Crypto Czar David Sachs celebrated the move via a post on X. 

"The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime," he wrote. "It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.’" 

Sachs, a Silicon Valley and pro-crypto veteran who will be shaping future policy around digital assets, reiterated his criticism of prior administrations for what he deemed as dropping the ball on bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value. 

"Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings," he also noted. 

Sachs also outlined how other digital currencies may be used. 

"IN ADDITION, the Executive Order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, consisting of digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings."

The move comes on the eve of a Friday roundtable with members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets in what is being billed as a "Digital Asset Summit."

Attendees at Friday's meeting include the following crypto leaders, while more may be added:

Last Sunday, ahead of the meeting, Trump advanced his plans for a strategic reserve for cryptocurrencies, posting on Truth Social: 

"A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!."

Here's a real-time pricing snapshot of popular cryptocurrencies.

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a strategic reserve for Bitcoin, making the US one of the few countries in the world to create a national stockpile of blockchain assets.

The reserve will hold cryptocurrency forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings, White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks said in a post on X.

The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset.

Trump - who just four years ago said Bitcoin "seems like a scam" - now says he plans to make the US "the Crypto Capital of the World".

Further details are expected when the president is due to host the first crypto summit at the White House on Friday.

It is unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.

Sacks said the stockpile would serve as "a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency", drawing comparison to a Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets.

Trump's order also creates a digital assets stockpile for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin that have been forfeited. 

It directs a full accounting of the federal government's crypto reserves, which Sacks said are estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (£13.6bn) at today's prices.

It was unclear how the new stockpile would benefit Americans, but Sacks said it "will not cost taxpayers a dime".

His implication that the US government would not buy Bitcoin led prices of the world's largest cryptocurrency to fall by more than 5%.

Some countries maintain strategic reserves of national assets to diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risk.

The US also keeps a petroleum reserve. Canada has a maple syrup reserve.

Earlier this week, Trump revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he said he would like included in the strategic reserve.

The market prices of the five coins he named - Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano -  swiftly jumped after that announcement.

Trump aggressively courted the crypto community during his presidential campaign. Former US President Joe Biden led a crackdown on crypto, citing concerns about fraud.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Cryptocurrencies fell Thursday night after President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a strategic bitcoin reserve for the United States and, separately, a "digital asset stockpile."

The price of bitcoin was last lower by 3% at $87,586.86, according to Coin Metrics. Shortly after the news broke, it fell to as low as $84,688.13.

Earlier losses in other coins – specifically those that rallied at the beginning of the week after Trump said they would be included in the strategy – also eased. Ether was down 2%, trading at $2,184.08. XRP and Solana's SOL token retreated 1% and 3%, respectively. Cardano's ADA token tumbled 13%.

White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks detailed in a post on X that the bitcoin reserve will include bitcoin already owned by the U.S. government that it seized from past law enforcement actions – a move, he emphasized, that will "not cost taxpayers a dime." The U.S. currently owns more than 198,000 bitcoins worth about $17 billion, according to Arkham.

The stockpile of other coins will include "digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings." Sacks said the government will not acquire additional assets for it "beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings." Arkham data shows the U.S. government owns about 56 ether tokens worth almost $119 million. It does not list XRP or the Solana or Cardano tokens.

Investors initially dumped their coins at the notion of the U.S. having no immediate planned purchases of bitcoin, per the order, against the backdrop of major weakness in equities.

"It is good news, but not what the market wanted in the short term," said Steven Lubka, head of private clients and family offices at Swan Bitcoin. "People were hoping for near-term buy pressure."

Sacks did point out that the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop "budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers," and that there's no plan to accumulate additional assets for the crypto stockpile beyond what's already been obtained by the government.

The announcement came days after Trump teased new details on the highly anticipated bitcoin reserve that had become one of his biggest promises to the crypto industry on his campaign trail, and on the eve of the first White House Crypto Summit.

The crypto market has been rocked this week by the tariff war and inflation concerns, which have largely overshadowed the speculative excitement around the bitcoin reserve. JPMorgan on Wednesday said it doesn't expect a big move higher in crypto in the near term, given the broader economic uncertainty and weakening demand.

Bitcoin briefly returned to the key $90,000 level earlier this week and is now hovering just below it. Investors and analysts have warned that until bitcoin can meaningfully hold above it, it's at risk of a bigger pullback toward $70,000.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday establishing a government reserve of bitcoin, a key marker in the cryptocurrency’s journey towards possible mainstream acceptance. 

Under Trump’s new order, the U.S. government will retain the estimated 200,000 bitcoin it’s already seized in criminal and civil proceedings, according to Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks. 

“The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,’” Sacks said on social media. 

The executive order calls for a “full accounting” of the government’s bitcoin holdings, which Sacks said have never been fully audited. He added that the U.S. government has previously sold off about 195,000 bitcoin over the last decade for $366 million. He said those bitcoins would be worth about $17 billion if the government hadn’t sold them.

Sacks said the order allows for the Treasury and Commerce Departments “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin.”

Once a skeptic who said a few years ago that bitcoin “ seems like a scam,” Trump has embraced digital currencies and leaned into his unofficial role as the “ crypto president ” in ways that can both help the crypto industry and enrich himself and his family. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, who felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last year’s election. 

Establishing a bitcoin reserve was one of several crypto-related promises Trump made on the campaign trail last year. Trump is also pushing Congress to pass industry-friendly legislation, and under his administration the Securities and Exchange Commission has started dropping enforcement actions it had taken against some major crypto companies. On Friday, Trump is set to host many key industry leaders at a White House “Crypto Summit.”




Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by an anonymous person or persons, bitcoin has blossomed from an experiment by libertarian cryptography enthusiasts into an asset with a market cap of about $1.7 trillion. While it hasn’t taken off as a way to pay for everyday things, bitcoin has found popularity as a store of value that’s not controlled by banks, governments or other powerful entities. 

Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, a built-in scarcity that supporters say makes it a great hedge against inflation. Critics have long said bitcoin lacks any inherent value, but it’s so far defied naysayers with remarkable price increases. Some supporters of a strategic bitcoin reserve said it could one day help pay off the U.S. national debt.

Crypto prices soared after Trump’s victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!” on social media.

But prices have since cooled off. Trump’s executive order did not equate to an immediate price spike for bitcoin, which was trading around $86,000 shortly after his announcement. 

The executive order also creates a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” where the government will hold seized cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. On Sunday, Trump sent crypto prices on a short-lived surge after a surprise announcement that he wanted the government to hold lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana and cardano.

President Donald Trump has directed his administration to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve to hold the assets that have been seized by the government, and he's additionally called for a crypto stockpile of other types of assets.

At this point, all of the assets contemplated by the order would be those seized in civil or criminal forfeitures. The bitcoin will be stored for long-term value in what was termed a "digital Fort Knox."

"The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings," said David Sacks, Trump's crypto czar, in a statement posted on social media site X.

In a video showing the president signing the order, Trump says about establishing the reserve, "Made the promise, right?"

The order has also nudged government officials to seek ways to add more bitcoin to the reserve, as long as it doesn't harm the federal budget.

"The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers," Sacks said.

The assets for the non-bitcoin stockpile will be any crypto that the government otherwise seizes. Sacks didn't highlight any particular asset names in that category, despite some being recently named by the president.

Presidential orders don't necessarily have the same legal authority as acts of Congress, so it remains unclear how Trump's administration will approach the particulars of the order, which hadn't yet been made public Thursday night. It's also unclear what the total value of the current U.S. crypto holdings may be. 

Bitcoin fell nearly 5% to $85,000 in the minutes following the order, perhaps over disappointment the reserve consists of tokens already held by the government, but — for now — includes no new buys.

Ethereum's (ETH), Ripple's (XRP), Cardano's (ADA), and Solana's (SOL) are all lower by 4%-8% over the past hour as the order allows for no fresh government purchases of those tokens.

The executive order announcement was made on the eve of the White House's industry summit, in which leaders from across the crypto spectrum are set to discuss policy matters with members of Trump's administration. The president had been expected to announce crypto reserve details before or during that event. 

“Establishing a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile is a huge moment for both crypto and American leadership on the global stage," said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital, one of the business leaders set to attend the roundtable.

Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer for Bitwise Asset Management, said in a post that the move to set up a bitcoin reserve reduces the chance the government can ever try to outlaw the asset, and it "dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic bitcoin reserves."

But Charles Edwards, founder of Bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, called it the "most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week," arguing that without a buying plan, the strategy is a "pig in lipstick."

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, marking a major shift in U.S. digital asset policy.

White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, wrote in a post on X that the reserve will be funded exclusively with bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases, ensuring that taxpayers bear no financial burden.

According to estimates, the U.S. government controls approximately 200,000 bitcoin, though no full audit has ever been conducted. Trump's order mandates a comprehensive accounting of federal digital asset holdings and prohibits the sale of bitcoin from the reserve, positioning it as a permanent store of value.

Additionally, the order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, managed by the Treasury Department, to hold other confiscated cryptocurrencies.

Many crypto investors who have supported Trump raised concerns over the weekend after the president said in a post on Truth Social that in addition to bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana's SOL token, and Cardano's ADA coin would be part of a strategic crypto reserve.

"I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve," bitcoin billionaire Tyler Winklevoss wrote. "Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar and that digital asset is bitcoin."

SOL, ether and bitcoin all fell around 5% late Thursday, while ADA plunged nearly 12%.

Ahead of the announcement, Castle Island Venture's Nic Carter told CNBC that the U.S. committing to a bitcoin-only reserve would "ratify bitcoin as a global asset of consequence, somewhere in the realm of gold."

"The U.S. is clearly the most important nation in the world, and so their stamp of approval really does a lot for bitcoin," Carter said, noting that including any digital currencies other that bitcoin would have made it look like another speculative fund.

Ryan Gilbert, a fintech investor, said the move will send a strong message to institutions that bitcoin is here to stay. He said the decision would further distinguish bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies.

"There's been many folks out there for the past decade and a half that have said bitcoin is the way to go, ignore the other tokens," Gilbert said. "I do think it will help bitcoin as a token, as an asset, separate itself from all the others as far as the debate is concerned."

But Gilbert said the U.S. has to be cautious in how it manages the reserve.

"What we don't want to see is the U.S. actively trading bitcoin," he said. "A reserve should be a long-term store of value, not something that introduces market-moving speculation."

Sacks praised the decision, calling it a milestone in making the U.S. the "crypto capital of the world." He previously noted that the U.S. lost over $17 billion in potential value by selling seized bitcoin prematurely.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will oversee further policy development, with a focus on budget-neutral acquisition strategies for bitcoin, according to Sacks.

According to KookCapitalLLC, the maximum pain scenario for Bitcoin could be a continuous upward movement without experiencing a dump after the meeting or in the future. This perspective challenges the common expectation of a post-event price correction in the cryptocurrency market.

President Trump is holding the first crypto summit at the White House Friday, featuring investors, CEOs and founders of crypto companies. Many in that world also hope Trump spells out a clearer path involving little regulation in the future, while Trump says he will announce the details of a new crypto reserve for the federal government. Paul Solman reports.

Amna Nawaz:

President Trump is holding the first crypto summit at the White House tomorrow, featuring investors, CEOs and founders of crypto companies.

Many in that world also hope that Trump spells out a clearer path involving little regulation in the future. And Trump says he will announce the details of a new crypto reserve for the federal government.

Geoff Bennett:

Estimates vary widely, but surveys have found anywhere from 7 to 28 percent of U.S. adults invest in crypto. The market's total value is estimated around $3 trillion at the moment.

There are also real concerns about the stability of crypto and similar digital assets and whether President Trump has potential conflicts of interest.

Our Paul Solman breaks it down for us.

Paul Solman:

Let's start with some basics. A cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is a bit of computer code, really just a unique string of dozens of characters that identifies your ownership of some strictly digital asset, existing only in what my mother disparagingly called cyberspace.

Neha Narula, MIT Digital Currency Initiative:

So, that's really different than most of the other assets that we think about in the world. Bitcoin itself is classified as a commodity, like things like gold, but those commodities have a real-world analog component. There's gold sitting in a vault somewhere. There's a bar or there's a coin.

Bitcoin's purely digital, digital first.

Paul Solman:

When I first covered cryptocurrency back in 2013, one Bitcoin was worth about $125, five years later, more than $7,000. Now a whole Bitcoin is selling near $90,000. So what's its appeal?

Vic Laranja, Crypto Content Creator:

If I want to send money to somebody, it has to pass through multiple institutions to get to them. With crypto, I don't need to wait. The money is liquid. You can have it instantly. It's almost free to send it, and that is innovation. It's just better.

Paul Solman:

And Bitcoin is supposed to be even scarcer than gold, as there's an absolute limit to the supply, unlike government currencies like the dollar, which can suffer inflation, and in cases like Germany in 1923 and Zimbabwe and Venezuela more recently, hyperinflation.

Plus, all transactions are publicly displayed on something called a blockchain, tracked on every computer that uses the software.

Neha Narula:

Another huge component of whether or not something is a good store of value is whether people believe in it, whether they have decided it's a good store of value. So it's kind of got these dual sides. You need to have certain properties that we can talk about pretty rationally, but then there's this narrative component.

Paul Solman:

One part of the narrative, Bitcoin will gradually replace currencies like the dollar as a form of payment, but given the volatility of its value:

Zeke Faux, Author, "Number Go Up": If you're talking to anyone who's saying that Bitcoin is going to be used for payments, that's kind of a fringe idea. Most Bitcoiners now just stick to the idea that the price will go up forever, and that we will all get rich.

Paul Solman:

OK, that's a digital asset like Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and now thousands of others. But what about meme coins in general and the Trump coin in particular?

Molly White, Crypto Researcher and Software Engineer: Meme coins are crypto assets that are themed around a specific idea or sometimes a person. Generally, there is no business behind a meme coin project. There's no sort of greater purpose, but they are used as vehicles for speculation.

Paul Solman:

Meme coins have become very popular of late. One of the most well-known is Dogecoin, long-hyped by Elon Musk. It's based on a Shiba Inu dog meme and has had enduring value, but most meme coins don't.

Molly White:

The asset is worth whatever you can sell it for and you better try to do it quick before it goes to zero.

Vic Laranja:

There are over five million meme coins; 99 percent of them go to zero.

Paul Solman:

It's a game. The goal, get in early and hope that, to use the old Wall Street expression, a greater fool will come along and pay a higher price.

Vic Laranja:

We call it vaporware. There's no promise or utility with a meme coin, other than the connection to the idea.

Paul Solman:

In January, President Trump announced his own meme coin.

Molly White:

The Trump Token was one of the biggest meme coins that we have ever seen launched. President Trump, just before his inauguration, launched a meme coin themed around himself. Shortly after, his wife launched a meme coin called Melania Token, which came a couple days later.

Paul Solman:

What happened when the Trump meme coin came out on the market?

Vic Laranja:

Insanity. It was one of the craziest nights I have ever experienced in crypto ever. Like, it was nuts, because no one believed that it was real. Everyone thought it was a scam. Everyone thought that his account was hacked.

Paul Solman:

But the Trump coin was real, one billion of them to be released over three years. Two hundred million were released to the market. The coin's creators own the remaining 800 million.

Vic Laranja:

I was like, OK, I'm going to put a little bit of money into this, because if I'm wrong, that's going to suck. And this is the amount of money that I'm OK with just completely losing.

Paul Solman:

In fact, Laranja says he made a little money on his Trump coin bet. But if you invested late, you sure didn't.

Zeke Faux:

A small number of people got in early and profited from this Trump coin. The majority of people who bought the coin ended up losing money. And they can see this because you can track transactions on the blockchain.

Paul Solman:

Hundreds of thousands of crypto accounts lost money on the bet, amounting to billions in cumulative losses.

Meanwhile, the Trump-affiliated creators of the coin made some $100 million in fees alone, plus presumably profits from the coin itself.

Molly White:

About 80 percent of the token supply was allocated to Trump and Trump entities. And so, based on the token price, he potentially makes quite a lot of money off of that token.

Paul Solman:

But to some in the crypto community, the Trump coin's downside is more that it's a gateway to scamming.

Vic Laranja:

Because he basically opened the floodgates for people to scam without being scared of it. People in the space call it crime season. That's what started. Crime season started.

Paul Solman:

Now, President Trump's views on crypto have evolved. In 2021, he called Bitcoin a scam. But with the Biden administration tough on crypto in general, supporters began to back Trump and his reelection bid.

Zeke Faux:

David Bailey, who runs "Bitcoin" magazine, which is the organizer of the annual Bitcoin conference that draws thousands of Bitcoiners from around the world, he got together a group of a few dozen of the top Bitcoin investors and got them to agree to donate the maximum amount to Trump, which, if you count all the committees and everything, is $844,600 each.

Paul Solman:

Trump's pledge?

Donald Trump, President of the United States: The United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.

(Cheering)

Paul Solman:

In part by overhauling regulations.

Zeke Faux:

And, so far, he's taken a number of steps in that direction. SEC has been dropping investigations and lawsuits against a number of crypto companies. One of the SEC lawyers who took the lead on some of these crypto enforcement actions has been punished by being transferred to the I.T. department.

I mean, there's a huge conflict of interest here. Trump has his own crypto businesses, and his administration is now deciding an entirely new set of rules that are going to govern this industry.

Paul Solman:

Trump's also planning a U.S. crypto strategic reserve to include Bitcoin and other tokens, which could boost the value of the president's own crypto ventures, of which there are several.

Molly White:

So it started with him launching several NFT projects that were themed around him. He also is a major beneficiary of a company called World Liberty Financial, which is a crypto-based project that plans to launch some sort of a crypto application in the near future. He receives something like 75 percent of the proceeds from that project.

His TRUTH Social platform, which he owns, has been talking about launching a crypto segment, where they would allow for crypto trading. They have spoken about holding crypto assets themselves. So he has very deep involvement in the crypto world these days.

Paul Solman:

And that raises another issue.

Molly White:

Members of the government are not supposed to receive money from people who are trying to influence policy, and these new crypto projects provide a very direct way for such people to do so, often in ways that can be a little bit more challenging to trace than, say, a bank transfer.

Paul Solman:

If, that is, anyone is trying to trace them at all.

The Texas Senate on Thursday passed a measure that would establish a state-controlled cryptocurrency reserve. The move comes just days after President Donald Trump announced plans to create a U.S. crypto strategic reserve.

Senate Bill 21, authored by Republican Sen. Charles Schwertner of Georgetown, would allow the state comptroller to buy, hold and manage Bitcoin and other digital assets as “a hedge against inflation and economic volatility.” The reserve would be funded through legislative appropriations and donations from private citizens and corporations.

The bill would also create a committee to provide investment recommendations for which cryptocurrency to buy to the comptroller. If signed into law, Texas would become the first U.S. state to create its own cryptocurrency reserve.

“This bill will allow Texas to diversify our investment approach, participate competitively in the evolving digital, financial economy and leverage the benefits of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Schwertner said.

Schwertner says his proposed crypto reserve would be subject to regular third-party audits, the findings of which would be released in a report to the state legislature every other year.

The bill passed out of the Senate with 25 legislators in favor and five against. It now heads to the Texas House for consideration.

Before passing, the proposed bill led to a heated debate between Schwertner and Democratic Sen. Roland Gutierrez of San Antonio, who raised concerns about Bitcoin’s volatility and the potential risks associated with allocating state funds to cryptocurrency.

“When the economy is down, Bitcoin is down, and the fluctuations on this stuff is insanity,” Gutierrez said. “We have so many real concerns in this state, and so many of our citizens that’re asking for real help, and the last thing that we need to do is go benefit some techno bro.”

Gutierrez argued that the use of crypto was “completely unregulated” — a claim that Schwertner pushed back on, saying cryptocurrency was regulated by blockchain technology, which is essentially a digital ledger that records transactions. Schwertner added that a blockchain is decentralized, meaning the data it’s not owned or operated by one single entity.

“In some ways, it is more accountable because it has that decentralized nature,” Schwertner said. However, Gutierrez was not convinced.

“All I’ve heard is it’s a blockchain and it’s a computer, it’s an algorithm,” Gutierrez asked. “We’re supposed to allow that algorithm, that computer and … some crypto bros to regulate themselves?”

Despite Gutierrez’s continued pushback, the bill was fast-tracked out of the Senate by a majority of lawmakers who moved to skip a third reading of the bill, which is the last step before a proposed law can move onto the next chamber for discussion.

Gov. Greg Abbott has previously expressed interest in making Texas a hub for the use of crypto. On Sunday. Trump announced a proposed national crypto reserve, signaling a significant federal endorsement of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano.

According to André Dragosch, the primary argument for a Bitcoin-only reserve lies in its proof-of-work mechanism. He highlights that while foreign adversaries could potentially harm a network by acquiring 33% of the supply in Ethereum's proof-of-stake system, achieving a 51% hash rate in Bitcoin's proof-of-work is significantly more challenging, thereby offering a stronger security measure.

Say what you will about the Department of Government Efficiency, but there are some ways that the Trump administration has significantly cut down on bloat. For example, it used to take at least a little digging to identify if a President was favor-trading and self-dealing. Now it seems like it just happens out in the open. So streamlined!

To that end, cryptocurrency analysis platform Nansen AI reported that World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance protocol that is operated primarily by President Trump’s three sons, purchased $25 million in cryptocurrencies including $10 million in Ethereum, $10 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and $1.5 million in of MOVE. That move comes just one day before President Trump will host the White House Crypto Summit on Friday. The company also announced Thursday that it was entering a “strategic reserve deal” with layer-1 blockchain project SUI, which caused a significant uptick in the value of the coin.

Now, to be fair, it doesn’t exactly take a genius to place a bet that the cryptocurrency market might spike in response to the hype generated by the White House Crypto Summit—just like when Trump announced a “Crypto Strategic Reserve,” it resulted in prices spiking. The crypto market, if nothing else, is extremely predictable in that it will react to hype.

But also, Trump’s kids run the company, and World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff (the son of billionaire Trump buddy Steve Witkoff) is one of the “industry leaders” invited to the summit. And that’s a whole lot of posturing to be doing right before an event that will almost certainly generate a bunch of hype, if not actual policy announcements that could cause the crypto market to surge again.

And it’d be silly to ignore the fact that World Liberty Financial has at least seemingly served as a platform for currying favor with the President via lining his kids’ pockets.

Justin Sun, a Chinese national and founder of the cryptocurrency TRON, was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023 for allegedly committing fraud and manipulating the price of his cryptocurrency. The SEC asked for a stay in the case shortly after Sun purchased $75 million worth of tokens from World Liberty Financial and joined the company as an advisor. Convenient!  Earlier this year, Reuters reported that several people who bought significant holdings of World Liberty tokens said a primary appeal was having a connection with Trump. Interesting! Also, World Liberty Financial is set up in such a way that the Trump family can lay claim to 75% of the net revenue. Very normal!

People have rightfully skewered Nancy Pelosi for her incredibly successful stock trading history, to the point where you can now ride the coattails of her trades that tend to overperform the market. It might be time to start doing the same thing by watching the crypto activity of World Liberty Financial. They sure seem to know something.

Bitcoin Foundation Chairman Brock Pierce joins ‘Varney & Co.’ to discuss Trump’s ‘crypto strategic reserve’ plan. 

White House artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto czar David Sacks claimed Thursday that the federal government’s lack of a "long-term strategy" on cryptocurrency has negatively impacted American taxpayers.

"Over the past decade, the federal government sold approximately 195,000 bitcoin for proceeds of $366 million. If the government had held the bitcoin, it would be worth over $17 billion today," he claimed in an X post. "That’s how much it has cost American taxpayers not to have a long-term strategy." 

He pointed to calculations by Grok, the xAI-developed AI chatbot, as the source of those figures. xAI is an AI company that Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and owner of X, launched in 2023.

TRUMP MOVES ‘CRYPTO STRATEGIC RESERVE’ FORWARD, PROMISES TO ELEVATE INDUSTRY

President Donald Trump selected Sacks to serve as the White House AI and crypto czar within his administration in early December. He is also heading up the "Working Group on Digital Asset Markets" that the president formed in January through an executive order.

The executive order tasked the working group with multiple things related to digital assets, including looking into the "potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile" and proposing "criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts." 

Over the weekend, Trump indicated he indeed wanted to pursue creating the stockpile.

"A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA," the president said on Truth Social.

In addition to those tokens, Trump also said Bitcoin and Ether would be the "heart" of the strategic reserve.

Bitcoin has posted a nearly 5.5% jump in price over the past five days. The other cryptocurrencies that Trump mentioned have also seen increases in that timeframe, such as Cardano jumping nearly 41% and XRP rising 19.8%.

The White House is hosting a crypto summit on Friday that the administration said will feature "prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the president’s Working Group on Digital Assets," FOX Business previously reported.

World Liberty Financial is expanding its token holdings.

The Trump-backed DeFi project will “explore product development opportunities” with layer 1 blockchain Sui, and “plans to include Sui assets in ‘Macro Strategy,’” the project’s token stockpile. 

That’s according to the Sui Foundation, which outlined the plans in a Thursday blog post. 

Sui’s native token, which has a market value of over $9 billion, jumped as much as 18% on the announcement.

The Sui deal is the latest in a growing list of crypto projects cosying up to World Liberty Financial, which has raised $300 million through sales of its WLFI token to investors since October. 

The news comes as World Liberty Financial buys up $20 million worth of so-called Wrapped Bitcoin, Ether, and Move tokens days before crypto executives are set to visit the White House to discuss policy.

The Sui blockchain uses the Move programming language, and is often pinned as a faster, more scalable competitor to Solana. Sui has $1.5 billion worth of crypto locked in its DeFi protocols, per DefiLlama data.

The crypto tokens World Liberty Financial buys often benefit from a surge in investor interest. 

When World Liberty bought $2 million worth of the Move blockchain’s token in January, it soared some 23%. 

World Liberty Financial isn’t owned by President Donald Trump, but he promotes it and benefits from its success. 

Trump and his sons Donald Jr, Eric, and Barron receive a split of the proceeds from the project’s WLFI token sales and future revenue, along with the project’s founders and collaborators, which include longtime Trump ally Steven Witkoff. 

World Liberty Financial has been stockpiling crypto for months. 

At first, it wasn’t initially clear why, but last month, onlookers received some clarity when the project announced it had been building what it called a “strategic token reserve,” called Macro Strategy. 

The reserve is intended to mitigate market volatility, foster growth, and build trust, the project said in an X post. 

However, there may be more going on with the token reserve than the project lets on. 

A February investigation by Blockworks found that World Liberty Financial had courted crypto teams for token swap deals.

Representatives for World Liberty Financial approached crypto teams with the offer to sell them at least $10 million worth of its WLFI token with a 10% fee. If accepted, World Liberty Financial then purchased the same amount of the buyer’s crypto token, sources told Blockworks.

Two crypto project founders also told DL News they had been offered similar deals.

The Sui Foundation did not respond to a DL News request for comment. 

World Liberty Financial’s token reserve includes Wrapped Bitcoin and Ether, as well as Tron’s TRX token, Ethena’s ENA token, and Ondo Finance’s ONDO token, along with several others.

Social security is a highly efficient safety net. But the president’s crypto plans and job cuts leave Americans holding the bag

Elon Musk said on Joe Rogan’s show last week that social security is “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”.

Rubbish. In a Ponzi scheme, a con artist lures investors into a fake investment project, pockets the cash, and then gets new “investors” to funnel cash to the older ones – until new recruits slow down and the whole thing collapses. Suckers are left holding worthless bags.

Social security is not a Ponzi scheme. It’s an exceptionally efficient part of the American social safety net – the opposite of a Ponzi scheme. Which is why the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose cutting it.

Social security is a “pay as you go” program. Current workers, via the payroll tax, fund payouts for retirees and disabled people. In 2024, about one in five US residents received social security.

I used to be a trustee of the social security trust fund. I know social security.

As the social security administration explains: “In 2025, when you work, about 85 cents of every social security tax dollar you pay goes to a trust fund. This fund pays monthly benefits to current retirees and their families and to surviving spouses and children of workers who have died. About 15 cents goes to a trust fund that pays benefits to people with disabilities and their families.”

The only reason social security is running out of money is that its trustees never anticipated America’s current degree of income inequality – with so much of the nation’s income in the hands of relatively few people (such as Musk).

The way to fix this is to lift the cap on income subject to social security payroll taxes, which is now $176,100.

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg fulfilled their 2025 social security payroll tax obligations a few minutes past midnight on 1 January. Most Americans keep paying payroll taxes all year.

You want a real Ponzi scheme? Look at the crypto investments Musk and Trump have hyped.

Trump’s new cryptocurrency, $Trump, soared and then crashed – exactly like a Ponzi scheme. It generated enormous profits for insiders and a cumulative $2bn in losses for more than 800,000 other investors.

Trump claims ignorance. “I don’t know if it benefited” me, he said. “I don’t know much about it.” (The Trump family and its business partners earned nearly $100m in trading fees alone on the coin.)

Musk has been promoting Dogecoin since 2019. Its value surged over 70% in the days following Trump’s announcement of the launch of Musk’s so-called 
 “department of government efficiency” (Doge). Since then, it’s dropped like a rock. A classic Ponzi scheme.

With Trump now in office, crypto is emerging from a four-year federal crackdown on crypto fraud, market manipulation and other scams following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange FTX in 2022, one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in recent memory.

On Friday, Trump is holding a “crypto summit” at which he’ll promote the idea of a federal crypto reserve that will give crypto schemes a temporary boost by increasing demand for them.

But why should American taxpayers foot the bill for a crypto reserve? The most obvious winner will be Trump, whose own crypto venture carries millions of dollars in tokens that are to be included in the reserve. Other winners will be crypto executives, many of whom donated extensively to Trump’s re-election effort.

One example: Ripple – whose XRP token is one of the five that Trump said would be included – donated $45m to an industry-wide Pac that sought to help elect Trump and other Republicans.

In fact, most of Trump’s crypto schemes are just ways to curry his favor by paying him off.

Consider Justin Sun, a Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur whom the Securities and Exchange Commission charged with securities fraud in March 2023.

After Trump was elected in 2024, Sun bought $30m worth of Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) crypto tokens, putting $18m directly into the president’s pockets. Since then, he has invested another $45m in WLF. Altogether, Sun’s investments have netted Trump more than $50m.

Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission just dropped its prosecution of Sun.

The SEC also dropped its case against the crypto trading platform Coinbase after the platform donated $75m to a political action committee associated with Trump and $1m to his inauguration.

To top it off, the SEC just ruled that “memecoins” aren’t securities, meaning that Trump’s novelty crypto tokens won’t be subject to any regulatory oversight. An open invitation to other Trump Ponzi schemes.

Trump and Musk are peddling a much bigger Ponzi scheme.

They’re promising huge “savings” from destroying the federal government (including wrecking programs like social security and Medicaid) – savings that will go to the US’s wealthy and big corporations in the form of tax cuts.

The social security administration recently announced it will consolidate the current 10 regional offices it maintains into four, and cut at least 7,000 jobs from an agency already at a 50-year staffing low.

The Republican budget recently pushed through the House cuts over $880bn most likely out of Medicaid.

Who will be left holding the bag? Most Americans.

Zoom out and you’ll see the entire Trump 2 regime is a giant Ponzi scheme – promising to “Make America Great Again” by raising tariffs, deporting over 11 million people, taking a wrecking ball to the federal government, pulverizing democracy and joining Putin and other global dictators.

Trump is the con artist behind this giant Ponzi scheme. He lured voters into his fake Maga project, pocketed some of the cash and rewarded his billionaires backers with more and will leave most Americans with a corrupt and decimated society.

Bitcoin price wavered on Thursday as investors embraced a risk-off sentiment amid the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and its top trading partners.

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $90,000, up 15% from its lowest level this month, while American stock indices like the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 dropped by over 1%.

BTC has two key catalysts that may push its price to $100,000 in the next few days. First, Donald Trump will host the first-ever crypto summit in Washington. This summit will feature top industry leaders, including Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, and Tether’s Paolo Ardoino.

The most notable outcome of the summit will be the launch of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by Donald Trump. Such a reserve could help boost Bitcoin’s price due to the size of the government’s balance sheet.

One option would be to transform the Bitcoin the government holds into reserves. It currently holds 198,109 coins worth over $17.9 billion. Another option would be to push the Cynthia Lummis bill which proposes that the government buy and hold 200,000 coins annually for five years, a move that would lead to substantial demand.

David Sacks, the AI and crypto czar, made the case for these reserves, noting that the U.S. government had sold 195,000 coins in the last decade. It raised $366 million from these sales, significantly lower than their current value of $17 billion.

Over the past decade, the federal government sold approximately 195,000 bitcoin for proceeds of $366 million. If the government had held the bitcoin, it would be worth over $17 billion today. That’s how much it has cost American taxpayers not to have a long-term strategy.

Another potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s price on Friday will be the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data. This report will provide more insight into the state of the American economy at a time when it is facing substantial headwinds.

Wall Street analysts expect the NFP report to show that the economy added 159,000 jobs in February, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.0%. There is a possibility that the jobs report will fall short of expectations due to Elon Musk’s job cuts. An ADP report released on Wednesday showed that the private sector added just 77,000 jobs in February.

A weak NFP report would be bullish for Bitcoin’s price as it could increase the likelihood of the Fed delivering more rate cuts.

The weekly chart shows that Bitcoin’s price is showing signs of bottoming out after plunging to a low of $78,100 last week. It has remained above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since Aug. 5.

Bitcoin has also formed two hammer patterns. A hammer candlestick comprises a long lower shadow and a small body and is one of the most bullish reversal patterns. It also remains above the 50-day moving average.

Therefore, Bitcoin’s price is likely to continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $100,000. This view will become invalid if it drops below the support at $80,000.

The global crypto market capitalization increased by 6.2% in the last 24 hours as traders took on bullish positions ahead of the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on Friday. Rather than double-down on BTC, sector-wide price trends show that investors are leaning towards altcoins. 





Top 10 Crypto assets performance | March 6 

United States (US) President Donald Trump’s decision to include four altcoins in the crypto strategic reserve has sparked expectations of more altcoin-friendly policy fallouts from the White House Crypto Summit. 

Notably, tokens like Chainlink (LINK), Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA), which have developed close links to the Trump administration in recent months, are witnessing considerable gains at press time on Thursday. 

Crypto AI tokens also scored substantial gains, with top assets like Near Protocol (NEAR) and Render Network (RNDR) posting 9% rallies apiece, outperforming the market average.

Bitcoin price pulled back below $89,900 on Thursday, down 2% from the 24-hour peak of $92,800.

With market sentiment dominantly bullish, investors are strategically leaning towards altcoins with high growth potential. 

Bitcoin ETFs posted another $38 million outflows on Wednesday.

This marks the third consecutive day of outflow this week, which evidently contributed to Bitcoin price retracement. 



Chainlink price action 

Given Chainlink’s recent partnership with Trump’s DeFi platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and global payments giant SWIFT, investors anticipate further integration for TradFi and DeFi during the White House Crypto Summit could spark more gains.

The New York State Assembly has introduced a new bill, targeting cryptocurrency-related fraud, including "rug pulls," private key theft and undisclosed token interests. 

The bill, sponsored by Clyde Vanel, establishes new categories within the state’s penal code to address virtual token fraud, illegal rug pulls and fraudulent failures to disclose financial interests in tokens, aiming to bolster protections for investors in the growing digital asset market.

The bill comes amid increasing reports of crypto scams, with provisions that could impose penalties of up to $25 million for corporations and prison terms of up to 20 years for individuals found guilty of such offenses. 

Brazilian fintech company Méliuz announced that its board of directors has approved a new treasury strategy, allowing the allocation of up to 10% of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. 

The company has already purchased 45.72 Bitcoin for approximately $4.1 million, marking it as the first publicly-listed firm in Brazil to incorporate the cryptocurrency into its corporate reserves, according to a securities filing and reports from local news outlets.

The move reflects Méliuz’s aim to maximize long-term shareholder value through Bitcoin investments, joining a global trend of traditional finance companies adopting cryptocurrency strategies. 

The company specified that it will continue to monitor and analyze the strategy, including the potential for Bitcoin to become a primary strategic asset in its treasury, while acknowledging risks associated with market volatility and regulatory challenges.

Emirates NBD, Dubai’s largest bank, announced on Thursday a partnership with digital asset platform Aquanow to introduce cryptocurrency trading services through its digital banking arm, Liv X. 

The collaboration allows customers to buy, sell, and trade major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, via the Liv X app, marking a significant step in integrating digital assets into the UAE’s financial sector, according to a statement from the bank and reports from financial news outlets.

The initiative aligns with Dubai’s broader strategy to position itself as a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation, leveraging Aquanow’s infrastructure, which is licensed by the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).

Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial increased its Ethereum holdings nearly threefold on Thursday, buying the recent ETH price dip. Ethereum hovers around $2,200, up nearly 1.5% on Thursday. 

The upcoming first-ever White House Crypto Summit will be held on Friday. The event will unite key industry leaders to explore how regulation and innovation can shape the cryptocurrency market's future.

Bitcoin extends recovery and trades above $92,000 on Thursday after rallying 5% in the last two days. A Glassnode report highlights that Bitcoin’s market reaction hinges on the $92,000, a key level for momentum, while $71,000 serves as critical support if BTC declines.

Chainlink extends its gains by more than 4% on Thursday, trading around $17.22 after rallying nearly 13% in the last two days. On-chain data suggest a rally ahead as LINK's long-to-short ratio reaches its highest monthly level and its funding rates are positive. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price extends its decline and trades below $80,000 at the time of writing on Friday, falling over 15% so far this week. This price correction wiped $660 billion of market capitalization from the overall crypto market and saw $3.68 billion in total liquidations this week.

Euronext today announced the expansion of Euronext Clearing’s central counterparty (CCP) services to include cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) listed on its markets.

This enhancement, effective on 3 March 2025, marks a significant step in integrating digital assets into the regulated financial ecosystem.

The expansion of clearing services is crucial in driving broader adoption of cryptocurrency ETPs within the regulated financial system. With this development, investors will have access to a wider selection of ETPs underlying cryptocurrencies while benefiting from the security, efficiency, and transparency of a regulated marketplace. Euronext Clearing’s risk management expertise ensures that market participants can trade confidently while adhering to stringent regulatory requirements.

This strategic expansion reinforces Euronext Clearing’s position as a leading multi-asset CCP in Europe and highlights the Euronext Group’s commitment to supporting our clients’ investment needs through the provision of best-in-class trading and post-trading services.

A total of 156 crypto ETPs from multiple issuers are listed and traded on Euronext’s markets as of end of February 2025. Issuers and investors can leverage Euronext’s dynamic European ETPs market, benefiting from deep liquidity and broad investor access. Euronext has proactively developed the necessary market infrastructure to ensure strong safeguards, optimal liquidity, and tight spreads fostering a secure and transparent trading environment.

Anthony Attia, Global Head of Derivatives and Post-Trade of Euronext, said:

“Euronext is committed to fostering innovation within a well-regulated market, ensuring both growth and compliance. We actively collaborate with regulators to advance market innovation while maintaining a secure and transparent financial ecosystem. With the continued expansion of our EMIR-authorised clearing house, we are enhancing our services to meet our clients’ evolving needs, providing a trusted and efficient marketplace for members and investors.”

The cryptocurrency exchange Bybit lost $1.5 billion to North Korean hackers last month — and it all traced back to an account on a free digital storage service.

David Yaffe-Bellany covers the cryptocurrency industry.

On the night of Feb. 21, Ben Zhou, the chief executive of the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, logged on to his computer to approve what appeared to be a routine transaction. His company was moving a large amount of Ether, a popular digital currency, from one account to another.

Thirty minutes later, Mr. Zhou got a call from Bybit’s chief financial officer. In a trembling voice, the executive told Mr. Zhou that their system had been hacked.

“All of the Ethereum is gone,” he said.

When Mr. Zhou approved the transaction, he had inadvertently handed control of an account to hackers backed by the North Korean government, according to the F.B.I. They stole $1.5 billion in cryptocurrencies, the largest heist in the industry’s history.

To pull off the astonishing breach, the hackers exploited a simple flaw in Bybit’s security: its reliance on a free software product. They penetrated Bybit by manipulating a publicly available system that the exchange used to safeguard hundreds of millions of dollars in customer deposits. For years, Bybit had relied on the storage software, developed by a technology provider called Safe, even as other security firms sold more specialized tools for businesses.

The hack sent crypto markets into a free fall and undermined confidence in the industry at a crucial time. Under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, industry executives are lobbying for new U.S. laws and regulations that would make it easier for people to pour their savings into digital currencies. On Friday, the White House is scheduled to host a “crypto summit” with President Trump and top industry officials.

Crypto security experts said they were troubled by what the heist revealed about Bybit’s safety protocols. The losses were “completely preventable,” one security firm wrote in an analysis of the breach, arguing that it “should not have happened.”

Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has introduced a proposal aimed at significantly lowering the tax rate on crypto gains from the current maximum of 55% to 20%.

This proposal seeks to classify cryptocurrencies as a new asset class under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, thereby aligning the tax treatment of crypto with that of traditional securities.

Currently, Japan categorizes crypto gains as miscellaneous income, subjecting investors to a steep tax burden. The proposed regulatory reform would transition the classification from the Payment Services Act to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, designating cryptocurrencies as “financial products.”

This change could pave the way for a potential spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Japan, which has been a topic of interest among industry stakeholders.

Akihisa Shiozaki, a member of Japan's House of Representatives and leader of the LDP’s Web3 working group, noted that the initiative aims to foster market development and enhance investor protection. The LDP is inviting public feedback on the proposal until March 31, after which it will be submitted to the Financial Services Agency (FSA).

In December, the Japanese government approved a revision to its tax regime, allowing corporations to avoid taxation on unrealized crypto gains if they hold the assets for the long term. The FSA is also expected to outline further directions for crypto regulation by June.

Industry leaders have expressed optimism regarding the proposal, viewing it as a positive step towards creating a more favorable environment for crypto investments.

ST. JOHN'S, N.L. — The outgoing premier of Newfoundland and Labrador says he’s drawing on the province’s history as he urges Canadians not to underestimate U.S. President Donald Trump’s “imperialist” ambitions.

In a recent interview, Andrew Furey was clear: he says Trump is launching an attack on Canada by sowing economic chaos to create instability. And he warned that economic pressure can be just as effective as tanks and gunfire at eroding a nation’s independence and sovereignty.

“In Newfoundland and Labrador, we know that all too well,” the premier said. “It was the economic forces, not the military forces, that caused us to lose our independence and choose to join Canada.”

Trump has kept Canadians frustrated and bewildered for months, threatening punishing tariffs on Canadian goods and then changing his plan at the last minute. As of Thursday, he had imposed 25 per cent tariffs on most Canadian goods, but paused the duties on the auto sector for a month. Energy flowing from Canada to the U.S. was subject to 10 per cent duties.

Meanwhile, Trump regularly calls the Canadian prime minister "Governor Justin Trudeau," and has threatened to use "economic force" to make Canada the 51st state.

“He has shown by his threats that he has an expansive agenda, a territorial agenda, and that feeds an imperialist approach,” Furey said.

Jeff Webb, a history professor at Memorial University, agrees that dire economic circumstances influenced Newfoundlanders when they voted to become a Canadian province in 1949. But they didn't do it under force, he said in a recent interview.

Newfoundland was a self-governing dominion of the British Empire until 1933, when Canada and Britain stepped in to help bail the region out of financial hardship. The Great Depression hit Newfoundland hard, and the dominion had accrued a large debt sending soldiers to fight in the First World War.

As a condition of the bailout, Newfoundland gave up self-governance, and instead agreed to be ruled by a commission appointed by the British government, according to Memorial University's Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage website.

By the 1940s, Britain and Canada thought it would be best for Newfoundland to join Canada, but they didn't force it, Webb said. When 52 per cent of Newfoundlanders voted in 1949 to join Canada rather than return to self-government, many hoped Confederation would bring financial stability and help them avoid the destitution that plagued the region under its own government, he said.

“We didn't get arm-twisted into this,” Webb said about Newfoundland’s Confederation with Canada. “It’s incredibly different from what we’re getting now. And what we’re getting now is crazy, nonsensical bullying.”

"Part of the craziness of this is that there are no sensible parallels," he said of Trump's behaviour toward his northern neighbour.

Historian Sean Cadigan noted that some of Newfoundland's hardship before it joined Canada were a result of the Trump-like tariffs it imposed on foreign manufacturers. It was already costly to make things in Newfoundland — an island in the North Atlantic Ocean — and the taxes just made everything expensive, he said. The cost of living became unbearable, particularly in rural Newfoundland.

"The lessons that I've learned from protectionism, is that it just hurts a lot of people, especially rural people," the Memorial University professor said. "Tariffs create tremendous social and economic divisions. They create winners and losers, and the stress among the losers can be terrible."

The United States under Trump is absolutely "acting in an imperial manner," said Blayne Haggart, an associate political science professor at Brock University. And he agrees with Furey: Canada needs to take it seriously.

"I think we're taking the threat of the tariffs seriously," Haggart said in an interview. "But what comes next? … I don't know yet if Canadians, and particularly our political leaders, fully understand what it means to chart a separate course from the United States."

That will involve costly measures such as strengthening the Canadian military, relying less on the United States for regulatory approvals for drugs and manufacturing, and even strengthening weather forecasting systems as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency fires workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

But instead of having a government digging into those discussions, Canada has an outgoing prime minister and an upcoming federal election, Haggart said.

"I'm 52 years old. This is the worst crisis that Canada has faced in my lifetime," he said. "It's been disappointing to me that the federal leadership vacuum was allowed to persist for so long … I understand the reasons for it but it's still incredibly concerning."

	Owners of high-risk dogs should be careful about how they manage their pet’s food

Labradors with a higher genetic risk for obesity are more likely to seek out food, a new study finds.

University of Cambridge

Labrador retriever owners are likely familiar with how persistent their dogs can be in their quest for food, whether begging under the dinner table or stealing a snack left unattended. It’s no surprise, then, that Labs are among the most overweight dog breeds, along with golden retrievers, cocker spaniels and beagles.

Scientists have now identified multiple genes associated with obesity in Labradors, according to a March 6 study in Science.

The researchers had previously found that a form of a gene called POMC made Labs more prone to overeating. But “we could tell from our studies that the POMC mutation wasn’t the whole story,” says Eleanor Raffan, a veterinary surgeon and geneticist at the University of Cambridge.

In the new study, Raffan and her colleagues examined DNA samples from 241 British Labrador retrievers. The researchers also collected information including the dogs’ body fat mass, how much dogs begged for food, and how strictly their owners regulated their diet.

The researchers uncovered five genes potentially associated with obesity in the dogs. The strongest effect came from a gene called DENND1B — Labradors with a certain variant of this gene had around 8 percent more body fat than dogs without it. DENND1B, which affects how the brain’s responds to food, was also associated with higher body mass indexes in humans.

Knowing which genes were associated with obesity allowed Raffan and her colleagues to develop a risk scoring system, which helped calculate whether individual Labradors were at higher or lower risk of obesity based on their genetic profile.

“You can rank all of the individuals in the population based on whether they inherited a bunch of obesity-prone genes, or maybe they didn’t inherit many at all,” says Adam Boyko, a canine geneticist at Cornell University who was not involved with the study.

With this information, the researchers could see how high-risk and low-risk Labradors differed when it came to their relationships with food. Labradors at a high risk for obesity, for example, were more likely to beg and to be more driven toward finding food. And for Labradors that were more genetically predisposed to obesity, owners who were stricter about regulating their pets’ diet made all the difference.

“If you’re a high-risk dog and your owner is really strict with the management, you can be a perfectly healthy body weight,” Raffan says. “But if they’re pretty relaxed about the management, those are the dogs who get overweight.” She added that dogs with a lower genetic risk tended to stay at a fairly healthy weight, regardless of how their owner fed them.

So do you need a genetic test to determine whether your Labrador may be at risk for obesity? Probably not, says Raffan. If a dog seems like it would tip the scales if given the chance to plan its own diet, that could be a hint that their genes may be behind its drive for food. Trying to ration food for dogs that pack on the pounds could be a safe bet — though it’s often easier said than done. “To be disciplined about your dog’s food intake, it sounds straightforward, but it’s actually quite a tough job if you’ve got one of these massively food-motivated pets,” Raffan says.

It may seem counterintuitive, but scientists are investigating a potent neurotoxin found in pufferfish known as tetrodotoxin to relieve lingering, hard-to-treat pain in the skin known as chronic subcutaneous pain.

“The main challenge is [controlling] its toxicity,” explained Chao Zhao at the University of Alabama. This is because even a small dose of a couple of milligrams can be lethal. But Zhao and his team have come up with a solution in the form of a marker pen.

“Our pen is designed to control the dose with great precision, ensuring that only a tiny, safe amount reaches the skin,” he said. “This way, we can take advantage of tetrodotoxin’s strong pain-relieving effects while minimizing risks.”

Though still proof-of-concept, the team are confident that their “simplified approach to a difficult problem” will lay the foundation for more studies, and, if found safe and effective, this research could be extended to human trials.



The idea of using marker pen to safely deliver tetrodotoxin came to Zhao giving a lecture, during which he was writing on a whiteboard.

“A marker pen stores water-based ink in a sponge core and delivers a consistent amount through capillary action,” explained Zhao. “If we replace the ink with an aqueous tetrodotoxin solution, the pen could continuously release a precise, controlled amount of tetrodotoxin — potentially at the nanogram level, far below the toxic threshold.”

Tetrodotoxin works by blocking electrical signaling along nerves with a potency estimated to be 1,000 times that of standard local anesthetics, and 3,000 times stronger than morphine for pain relief.

But this is a double-edged sword because while potent, it is also extremely toxic. 

The problem is that current therapies including topical creams and anesthetic injections, only work well for moderate pain but do not help severe long-term pain. This is because they are not powerful enough, their effects are short lived or the way they work does not treat the root of the problem. 

Zhao explained that unlike conventional pain medications that broadly act on pain pathways, such as opioids, tetrodotoxin specifically blocks the channels that allow transmission of pain.

“By silencing these channels, tetrodotoxin can effectively prevent the continuous and excessive firing of sensory neurons that drive postherpetic neuralgia pain,” he said. “In 2020, my father developed postherpetic neuralgia [after a bout of shingles]. He tried almost all commercially available creams and patches to relieve the pain. Witnessing his suffering inspired me to develop a more potent and effective method to treat postherpetic neuralgia and other severe skin pain conditions.”

Zhao says that, in addition to its superior potency, tetrodotoxin has several advantages over commonly used anesthetics such as bupivacaine and lidocaine. For example, it does not cause muscle cell breakdown or permanent nerve damage, nor does it cross the blood–brain barrier, reducing the risk of addiction. Unlike conventional local anesthetics, it also does not affect cardiac cells or normal heart function.



To create their pens, Zhao and his team filled commercially available felt tip marker pens with a very small dose of tetrodotoxin mixed with other compounds to improve skin permeability.

In animal studies, the team found that just 900 nanograms of tetrodotoxin caused complete relief from pain for 4 hours, and reduced pain for approximately 11 hours. Importantly, there was no toxicity observed or damage to muscles or nerves.

This isn’t the first time tetrodotoxin has been explored, in fact, human trials in cancer patients demonstrated pain relief but also found side effects. Concerns about safety including toxicity, the drug delivery system, and logistical challenges of storage and transportation have hindered its progression as a pain killer in clinical practice.

Getting the delivery system right is essential if therapeutics are to be developed. Considering the high risk, the team say they would take safety precautions to minimize toxicity to humans. For example, if the pen was damaged and tetrodotoxin leaked out.

“To prevent any risk of human poisoning from environmental exposure to tetrodotoxin, the amount of tetrodotoxin  in each marker pen will be kept below the minimum oral dose known to cause acute toxicity in humans. This amount is considered safe for practical use, as it is significantly lower than both the lethal dose and the dose that causes noticeable symptoms in human,” explained Zhao.

The team say because their application is topical, a much lower dose is generally needed in these cases, compared to what was tested in previous trials, where it was given as injections and therefore increasing the risk of the toxin entering the bloodstream.

Further preclinical studies will determine whether tetrodotoxin, delivered via the marker pen system, can successfully translate into a safe and effective treatment for patients.

Teledyne Marine joined forces with Maritime Robotics and DEEP to survey DEEP's quarry lake, affectionately referred to as Loch Lye, in the Wye Valley.

The team deployed the latest survey equipment mounted on a Maritime Robotics Otter Pro vessel, including a Teledyne RESON SeaBat T51 (800 kHz) multi beam sonar with integrated inertial navigation, paired with a Teledyne Valeport SWiFT profiler. 

Loch Lyr serves as the centerpiece of the DEEP campus, a facility spanning 50 acres. The former National Dive Center offers environment for testing subsea equipment, developing methodologies, and training personnel in controlled conditions. The lock stretches 500 meters in length, up to 125 meters in width, and plunges to 80 meters deep.

The SeaBat T51's controls were tailored for autonomous operations to map the quarry, while the SWiFT profiler complemented the system by providing critical environmental data, such as temperature, sound velocity, and depth, to correct multibeam readings. An onboard winch enabled remote deployment, and near real-time profiler data was accessible via smartphone for immediate quality control.

The electric Otter Pro vessel, launched via crane, operated both locally and remotely. During surveyor breaks, operators in Norway controlled the vessel through satellite communications, leveraging its onboard cameras and collision avoidance radar to navigate autonomously. The survey produced high-quality data, covering nearly the entire body of water in a single pass.

The Trump administration has transformed its traditional press shop into a rapid-response influencer operation, and “they’re all offense, all the time.”

When actress Selena Gomez posted an Instagram video in January in which she cried about the Trump administration’s deportations of children, the viral clip threatened to stoke nationwide unease over the policy’s human impact.

But the White House digital strategy team had a plan. They dispatched videographers to interview the mothers of children killed by undocumented immigrants. They put President Donald Trump’s face on a Valentine’s Day card reading: “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally and we’ll deport you.”

And they mimicked a style of video popular for its meditative soundscapes, known as ASMR, with a presentation that featured the rattling handcuff chains of a deportation flight. Gomez deleted her video shortly after posting, without specifying why. The Trump team’s video has been viewed more than 100 million times.

The effort was part of a new administration strategy to transform the traditional White House press shop into a rapid-response influencer operation, disseminating messages directly to Americans through the memes, TikToks and podcasts where millions now get their news.

After years of working to undermine mainstream outlets and neutralize critical reporting, Trump’s allies are now pushing a parallel information universe of social media feeds and right-wing firebrands to sell the country on his expansionist approach to presidential power.

For the Trump team, that has involved aggressively confronting critics like Gomez, not just to “reframe the narrative” but to drown them out, said Kaelan Dorr, a deputy assistant to the president who runs the digital team.

“We thought it was necessary to provide pushback in the harshest, most forceful way possible,” he said. “And through that, we had a viral hit on our hands.”

Stephen K. Bannon, a senior White House aide during Trump’s first term and the host of the “War Room” podcast, said the White House has reimagined itself as a “major information content provider.” What Trump does “is the action, and we just happen to be one of the distributors,” he said.

“Rapid-response communications are normally defensive,” he said. “They’re all offense, all the time.”

The White House’s rapid-response account posted 207 times to X on Tuesday, the day of Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress, or nearly nine posts an hour, including Trump sound bites, supporter interviews and Democrat-slamming memes and attack lines. When a Fox News analyst called Trump “the political colossus of our time,” the team got the clip cut, captioned and posted online within 11 minutes.

In press rooms, the administration is welcoming friendly “new media” podcasters, X users and YouTubers to deliver what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt calls “news-related content” to their millions of followers.

And on social media, the White House is firing off talking points across every platform in a bid to win online attention and reach viewers who have tuned out the traditional press. In an X post, communications director Steven Cheung described their goal: “FULL SPECTRUM DOMINANCE.”

The administration has produced news-style reports trumpeting Trump’s successes and put them in email newsletters and Leavitt-narrated “MAGA Minute” video segments; soon, they’ll be delivered via text.

The team has worked to humanize the president with picturesque postcards of a White House snowfall and behind-the-scenes videos from the Oval Office — where a New York Post showing the president’s mug shot hangs framed just outside the door. But the digital team has also gone for shock factor, posting a photo of chained men shuffling onto a transport jet (“Deportation Flights Have Begun”) and a portrait of Trump with a golden crown (“LONG LIVE THE KING”).

The president has appointed influential social media figures across the federal government — like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Kash Patel — who amplify his messages with their own marketing pushes. Trump has also fired off attention-getting posts of his own, including an AI-generated video transforming the war-torn Gaza Strip into a gilded Trump beach resort, in line with his call to forcibly remove millions of people from Palestinian land.

The administration’s brash campaign-style tactics are designed to stand out on a crowded internet and speak to voters that officials believe are hungry for aggressive action.

“Even the tagline we’ve been using — ‘America is back’ — is very much saying: ‘We’re here. We’re in your face.’ It’s irreverent. It’s unapologetic,” said Dorr, 32. (A veteran of both Trump campaigns, Dorr also worked as a “head of engagement” at Gettr, the right-wing social network run by Jason Miller.)

The posts have shocked and repulsed the left, leading Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats to say on X: “To find joy and entertainment in this is truly vile.” But the Trump team has been emboldened to go even further by the millions who have watched, shared and followed the accounts since Trump’s inauguration. Half of the White House’s Instagram views have come from non-followers, Dorr said, a sign that the team’s messages are gaining traction beyond Trump’s base.

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said in a statement that the approach is built to reach audiences without the media’s help and to broadcast Trump’s “America First message far and wide.”

But this model of messaging could supercharge the presidential bully pulpit until it shifts Americans’ perception of events, according to experts who study propaganda and the press. Like Trump’s moves to shore up loyalty in Congress and remake the judiciary, the strategy is designed to weaken his opponents and dismantle checks against executive power.

Undermining the accountability mission of the Fourth Estate and building a viral pipeline of state media helps the administration — and future ones — stifle dissent, said Anya Schiffrin, a senior lecturer at Columbia University’s School for International and Public Affairs.

And by replacing dispassionate observers with partisan cheerleaders, political leaders are elevating a class of messengers incentivized to defend their decisions, no matter the seriousness or scale. Every policy maneuver could turn into a meme.

Said Renee Hobbs, a communications professor at the University of Rhode Island: “It’s an effort to replace the mainstream press with a partisan press” that will function as the new “purveyors of reality.”

Though members of the digital team serve on the front lines of what the White House calls the “most transparent administration” in history, Trump officials requested that their identities remain anonymous, citing personnel policy and concern over public backlash.

The team is made up of roughly a dozen employees — people mostly in their 20s and 30s from outside politics — who work out of the White House and are given wide leeway to craft content. By removing layers of bureaucracy before publishing, the team avoids the “analysis paralysis” of other messaging shops, Dorr said.

And members are expected to move at internet speed. When a federal judge declined to block the White House from banning the Associated Press from certain news events, the team raced to declare “VICTORY” in graphics that members slapped across White House TVs and social accounts.

They “have the buy-in from the [Trump] team to go out there and be unapologetic in our pursuit of advancing the administration’s goals,” Dorr said, “with the ferocity and the quickness and the pointedness” the White House demands.

For its rapid-response account, the White House employs video producers and editors, known as clippers, to create and post short videos on the fly. The role was first popularized by political activists looking to highlight opponents’ gaffes on the campaign trail, but Trump’s clippers often promote his moments, hoping to make them go viral in real time.

On Friday, within minutes of Trump and Vice President JD Vance’s fiery confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the White House accounts blasted out video of major punch lines, meme-ready photos and images of the American flag. “This is going to be great television,” Trump said as reporters filed out of the Oval Office.

The approach seems to be resonating online: Trump’s first Cabinet meeting, which was live-streamed and featured billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, has more than 6 million views on X. “Trump is literally overwhelming them with information” in a way that is “changing the nature of the presidency,” Bannon said. “How many young men under 30 years old would ever watch two seconds of a Cabinet meeting?”

That fast-twitch model has spread beyond the White House, including to the Defense Department, which this month launched a rapid-response account to praise Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, grapple with senators and declare that “REAL journalism is dead.” But it has also helped seed major advertising campaigns to reach viewers beyond the web.

Kristi L. Noem, head of the Department of Homeland Security, has posted videos of herself in a flak jacket at the southern border and on immigration raids, including one on Tuesday at an apartment complex in Northern Virginia.

Footage from the raids is used in an international TV and digital ad blitz that warns undocumented immigrants to leave the country or be hunted down. At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Noem said the ads had a budget of up to $200 million and had been personally requested by Trump.

“We’re not going to let the media tell this story,” Noem recalled Trump saying, as was first reported by Rolling Stone. “We’re going to run a marketing campaign to make sure the American people know the truth.”

As the administration has expanded its marketing arm, it has also worked to uproot the classic structure of the White House press corps. In her first briefing, Leavitt called on “podcasters, social media influencers and content creators” to apply for credentialed access to a briefing room long filled by legacy news outlets. More than 12,000 have since applied, according to the White House, and several have been ushered to exclusive new-media seats near the podium.

Administration officials have said the change reflects a fundamental shift in American culture, as journalists compete for relevance with a new generation of influencers who speak to audiences of millions online.

But virtually all of the new-media creators have come from right-wing outlets friendly to the Trump cause. The Breitbart writer Matt Boyle asked whether the White House would continue its “breakneck” pace. (Yes, Leavitt said.) The pro-Trump podcaster John Ashbrook asked whether the media was “out of touch” about the border. (Yes, Leavitt said.) And John Stoll, the head of news at Musk’s X, asked about the White House’s “confidence” in going “toe-to-toe with Vladimir Putin.” (Very confident, national security adviser Michael Waltz said.)

“The Trump White House is loyal, and they are loyal to people who stood with them,” podcaster Dan Bongino said while toasting Rumble chief Chris Pavlovski’s moment in the new-media spotlight. (Days later, Bongino was named deputy director of the FBI.)

Some of the new-media figures have eagerly promoted Trump’s domestic agenda. A few hours after podcaster Sage Steele asked about the importance of passing a law to ban transgender women and girls from women’s sports, she stood behind Trump as he signed an executive order on the same issue.

Other Trump-boosting creators have joined the administration outright, like the “Dear America” podcast host Graham Allen, newly hired as the Defense Department’s digital media director. Brenden Dilley, a pro-Trump meme maker, said of the news, “There’s going to be nobody left doing podcasts soon because the top people are all going to work for the government.”

Friendliness between the White House and its messengers of choice is nothing new, including during the first Trump term, when right-wing provocateurs like Mike Cernovich and blogs like Gateway Pundit held credentials alongside the legacy press.

But back then, the traditional press corps set the tone, Bannon said. The softer questions during Trump’s recent Cabinet meeting, he said, made the first term’s briefings look like “hand-to-hand combat.”

Today “the powerful media is the ecosystem of the right,” Bannon said, “while the mainstream media [is] suffering layoffs.”

The right-wing media figures embraced by the Trump administration have often returned the favor. After the banning of the AP, Brian Glenn — a correspondent for the pro-Trump media network Real America’s Voice and the boyfriend of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) — was given the rare opportunity to question Trump in the Oval Office. A few days later, he posted a selfie with Trump on X that read: “So much accomplished, and we’re still under a month in office.”

For those working closely with Trump’s public-relations infrastructure, the first weeks have marked a huge opportunity for exclusive content. Benny Johnson, a Tampa-based MAGA influencer who calls himself the “Front Seat to the Golden Era,” got to interview Vance last month, then headed to the Capitol, where he live-streamed a friendly chat with two Republican senators before they voted to confirm Patel as FBI director.

“First time in history we’ll have the stream going from the senator’s office. This is amazing,” Johnson said on stream.

The night before, Johnson had posted a video of himself stopping to rejoice outside the shuttered offices of the U.S. Agency for International Development, once the world’s largest provider of food aid. “Destroy the idols of the conquered church, right?” he said with a laugh. “Desecrate their idols. Look at this. There it is. Blacked out. It’s gone.”

Wildfires in California during January caused widespread destruction, affecting communities and ecosystems. To improve wildfire monitoring and response, NASA deployed a new scientific instrument capable of capturing high-resolution thermal infrared images. The Compact Fire Infrared Radiance Spectral Tracker (c-FIRST) was tested aboard NASA's B200 King Air aircraft over fire-hit areas in Pacific Palisades and Altadena. The instrument, developed for satellite-based missions, was assessed for its ability to provide real-time data on active and smoldering fires. Scientists aim to use this technology to enhance understanding of wildfire behavior and improve mitigation strategies.

According to reports, the c-FIRST instrument was developed and is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), with support from NASA's Earth Science Technology Office. The compact design allows it to be deployed on airborne platforms, simulating satellite missions while providing near-instantaneous observations. The system captures a wide range of fire characteristics, including temperature variations across large areas. Unlike previous infrared imaging systems, c-FIRST can detect extremely high temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (550 degrees Celsius) with improved clarity.

In a statement, Sarath Gunapala, principal investigator for c-FIRST at NASA JPL, noted that current fire observation instruments do not fully capture fire attributes across the Earth system. He explained that limitations in past imaging technologies have resulted in gaps in data concerning wildfire frequency, size, and intensity.

As per sources, c-FIRST is expected to provide critical insights for firefighting agencies by identifying smoldering fires that could reignite under changing wind conditions. In a report, Gunapala stated that the instrument's ability to distinguish such fires in near real-time could support more effective wildfire management efforts.

KC Sujan, operations engineer for the B200 King Air, told that the aircraft's flight characteristics made it ideal for testing the instrument. With further evaluation, c-FIRST is expected to be integrated into future satellite missions, potentially improving global wildfire monitoring capabilities.

Virtu Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIRT), a provider of global, multi-asset financial services that delivers liquidity and innovative, transparent products across the entire investment cycle to the global markets, announces the public launch of Virtu Technology Solutions (VTS), a comprehensive product suite that repackages Virtu Execution Services’ (VES) capabilities for distribution to sell-side broker-dealers worldwide.

Virtu Execution Services (VES) has long provided execution and workflow solutions to buy-side and sell-side clients, offering a robust suit of technology-driven services that support seamless and integrated market access, trade execution and analytics. These solutions, built to optimize Virtu’s own trading infrastructure, have been leveraged by a range of institutional clients to enhance their operational efficiency and market connectivity.

With the introduction of VTS, Virtu is now formalizing and expanding the availability of these capabilities specifically for sell-side brokers, providing them with access to the same technology and infrastructure that powers Virtu’s own broker-dealer operations. This initiative reflects Virtu’s commitment to delivering scalable, modular and multi-asset solutions tailored to the infrastructure needs of broker-dealers.

Virtu’s global execution services business is uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive, multi-asset products to brokers by combining Virtu’s Workflow Solutions, Analytics, and Broker-Dealer offerings in a turn-key solution.

With connectivity to over 60 global markets, operations across over 235 venues, management of over 10 thousand broker FIX connections for clients, and certifications with the majority of today’s OMS/EMS platforms. VTS provides the sell-side with the complete suite of proprietary tools originally developed for Virtu’s own broker-dealer operations and designed to support the front-to-back-office needs of the sell-side. These solutions are modular, scalable, and designed for seamless, multi-asset, global deployment.

“The breadth of capabilities within our internal broker-dealer framework is incredible. I don’t think there’s a vendor on the street that can offer the range and quality of products we’re bringing to market,” said Michael Loggia, Virtu’s Global Head of VTS and Workflow Solutions. “With the public launch of VTS, we are expanding awareness and formalizing our offering to ensure broker-dealers of all sizes can benefit from the same infrastructure that has supported our own operations.”

Third acquisition in less than 12 months expands core platform offer following customer driven use case requests


SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Armis, the cyber exposure management & security company, announced today that it has acquired OTORIO, a leading provider of OT (Operational Technology) and CPS (Cyber Physical Systems) security.



OTORIO’s Titan platform will be integrated into Armis’ Centrix™ cloud-based cyber exposure management platform to expand Armis’ OT/CPS suite and offer an on-premises CPS solution for organizations or segments of an organization’s environment that are airgapped or sequestered from online access.



“We are seeing unprecedented demand across all industries but for some specific verticals, customers require a hybrid environment for complete protection. Through this acquisition, Armis can now offer an on-premises solution for customers that require a fully air-gapped environment for heavy industry and critical infrastructure like energy or utilities,” said Yevgeny Dibrov, CEO and Co-founder, Armis.



“I am excited to welcome the OTORIO team to Armis and leveraging their expertise and deep foundational industry knowledge to support our customers in securing their critical infrastructure,” continued Dibrov. “This new hybrid and on-premises expansion of Armis Centrix™ makes it the most complete platform for any customer looking to secure their operational technology and cyber-physical environments.”



Founded in 2018 by co-founders Daniel Bren and Yair Attar, OTORIO has deep domain technical expertise, securing heavy industry and critical infrastructure with customers across the globe in industries like oil and gas, utilities, manufacturing and more. OTORIO specializes in cyber physical, converged and air gapped environments, providing proactive protection against cyber attacks. By expanding Armis’ platform with broader capabilities including Secure remote access (SRA) for full Zero trust and full attack path mapping, Armis can support any organization, with any requirement delivering a single, comprehensive solution for critical infrastructure, manufacturing and industrial environments.



“Armis has rapidly become the leading provider of cyber exposure management and has built a best in industry cloud SaaS platform that provides unmatched visibility, security, and risk management to enterprises across all industries,” said Daniel Bren, CEO and Co-Founder of OTORIO. “I am thrilled for our team to be joining Armis at this time and to leverage our deep domain operational context in ICS/CPS environments and help customers achieve complete resiliency and compliant business operations.”



Armis has a proven history of seamlessly integrating acquisitions into its Armis Centrix™ platform and transforming acquired technologies into substantial revenue drivers. Following the acquisitions of Silk Security and CTCI, Armis has achieved an exceptional 2000% increase in related revenues, demonstrating its ability to maximize value and accelerate growth as it continues to prepare for an IPO.



This marks Armis’ third acquisition in less than 12-months, (having acquired AI security startup CTCI and risk prioritization startup Silk Security) – each aimed at strengthening the company’s already robust product capabilities and expanding ability to reach new market segments.



Armis is the leader in cyber exposure management and now offers unparalleled security solutions covering all industries, sectors & environments. Only Armis offers a platform that provides for your complete cyber exposure needs from the ground to the cloud. In October 2024, Armis announced a new $200m funding round which has enabled Armis to rapidly advance and scale to complete its vision and roadmap in line with customer demand.

Virtu Financial's launch of Virtu Technology Solutions (VTS) represents a strategic commercialization of its proprietary technology that has potential revenue implications. The company is essentially packaging its internal trading infrastructure and execution capabilities as a formal product offering for sell-side broker-dealers.

This move leverages Virtu's existing technological assets with minimal incremental investment, potentially creating a new revenue stream by monetizing infrastructure already developed for internal use. The scale is noteworthy - connectivity to over 60 global markets, operations across more than 235 venues, and management of over 10,000 broker FIX connections.

What's particularly meaningful is how this aligns with industry trends toward increased technology outsourcing among smaller and mid-sized broker-dealers seeking to reduce fixed costs. By offering modular, scalable solutions, Virtu positions itself to capture market share in the broker technology space while leveraging its existing competitive advantages.

However, the announcement lacks specific revenue projections or pricing structures, making it difficult to quantify the financial impact. While potentially significant long-term, VTS likely represents an incremental addition to Virtu's diverse business model rather than a transformative change. The company is essentially following the industry playbook of transforming internal capabilities into sellable products, similar to how exchanges have monetized their technology platforms.

NEW YORK, March  06, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Virtu Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIRT) a leading provider of global, multi-asset financial services that delivers liquidity and innovative, transparent products across the entire investment cycle to the global markets, announces the public launch of Virtu Technology Solutions (VTS), a comprehensive product suite that repackages Virtu Execution Services’ (VES) capabilities for distribution to sell-side broker-dealers worldwide.

Virtu Execution Services (VES) has long provided execution and workflow solutions to buy-side and sell-side clients, offering a robust suit of technology-driven services that support seamless and integrated market access, trade execution and analytics. These solutions, built to optimize Virtu’s own trading infrastructure, have been leveraged by a range of institutional clients to enhance their operational efficiency and market connectivity.

With the introduction of VTS, Virtu is now formalizing and expanding the availability of these capabilities specifically for sell-side brokers, providing them with access to the same technology and infrastructure that powers Virtu’s own broker-dealer operations. This initiative reflects Virtu’s commitment to delivering scalable, modular and multi-asset solutions tailored to the infrastructure needs of broker-dealers.

Virtu’s global execution services business is uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive, multi-asset products to brokers by combining Virtu’s Workflow Solutions, Analytics, and Broker-Dealer offerings in a turn-key solution. With connectivity to over 60 global markets, operations across over 235 venues, management of over 10 thousand broker FIX connections for clients, and certifications with the majority of today’s OMS/EMS platforms.

These solutions are modular, scalable, and designed for seamless, multi-asset, global deployment.

“The breadth of capabilities within our internal broker-dealer framework is incredible. I don’t think there’s a vendor on the street that can offer the range and quality of products we’re bringing to market,” said Michael Loggia, Virtu’s Global Head of VTS and Workflow Solutions. "With the public launch of VTS, we are expanding awareness and formalizing our offering to ensure broker-dealers of all sizes can benefit from the same infrastructure that has supported our own operations."

Animation shows traditional counter-drone technology vs. Epirus' Leonidas system that can take out entire swarms of drones at once.

A new high-powered microwave system that can knock swarms of drones out of the sky at once is going to "touch every aspect of warfare," according to Epirus founder, Joe Lonsdale. 

"It’s kind of like a Star Trek shield," Lonsdale, founder of Epirus and a co-founder of fast-rising defense technology company Palantir, explained of its Leonidas counter-drone system. "It’s able to turn them off from very far away." 

"This is going to touch every aspect of warfare over the next decade," he told Fox News Digital. "We can knock down some pretty advanced drones." 

Defense tech startup Epirus secured another $250 million in a Series D funding round, which was announced Wednesday, bringing its total venture funding to over $550 million.

Epirus’ Leonidas system is a ground-based, directed energy weapon that fires off an electromagnetic pulse to disable swarms of drones, or it can neutralize precision targets. The company aims to help the military shift away from a "1 to 1 mindset to a ‘1 to many’ way of thinking for short-range defense," according to CEO Andy Lowery. 

Drone swarms have been a key frontline tactic in the Russia-Ukraine war because most defense systems are designed to take out one unmanned vehicle at a time. Additionally, in the Middle East, the U.S. has been using multimillion-dollar missiles to shoot down Houthi drones that are built for around $2,000 or less. 

"Swarms of drones is where war is going, and currently you have swarms of drones that are very expensive and very difficult to stop," said Lonsdale. "It's not just drones, they're all sorts of different types of uses for this," he added, predicting that one day the technology might be deployed to freeze up planes in the sky and protect satellites. The technology has already been successful in Defense Department tests on boat motors and other electronics, according to the company.  

"This is just it's just going to touch every aspect of warfare in the next decade."

Rep. Rob Wittman, vice chair of the House Armed Services Committee, warned that the U.S. needs to "run to play catchup" with its adversaries in the counter-UAS space. 

"We are not doing what we need to do," he told Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the National Security Innovation Base Summit in Washington, D.C. "We have failed miserably at counter-UAS. We do okay in CENTCOM [Central Command], but … in places like Langley Air Force Base, we are not where we need to be." 

Dozens of drones hovered over Langley for over two weeks in 2023, and lawmakers say they still have not been provided with an explanation.

Epirus won a $66 million contract in 2023 to supply its Leonidas to the U.S. Army, and the technology is believed to be  in the testing phase by Central Command, which oversees the Middle East, according to comments that Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George made to Congress last year. 

The rapid rise of unmanned aerial vehicles in war has prompted a defensive race to develop systems to counter them, like high-energy lasers and high-power microwaves. 

"We have a lot of people who are, you know, coming into the [Defense Department]wanting to embrace new technologies," said Lonsdale. "They’re really excited about this." 

The defense entrepreneur suggested there is "tons of waste" in the Pentagon that could be repurposed for new technologies.

"There’s a ton of cronyism. We're seeing tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars you could pull out, depending [on] how aggressive you want to be. And these should be put into cutting-edge technologies that actually deter enemies."

Epirus was valued at $1.35 billion when it raised $200 million in Series C funding, but the company did not disclose its valuation for this round.

China to Set up National Venture Capital Guidance Fund, State Planner Says

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will set up a government-backed fund in the near future that will mobilize 1 trillion yuan ($138.01 billion) from social capital to support technology startups, Zheng Shanjie, the head of China's state planner, said on Thursday.

The "national venture capital guidance fund" - an investment vehicle set up as public-private partnership - would focus on "hard technology", Zheng told a news conference, referring to areas such as semiconductors and renewable energy.

The fund, will maintain long-term investment cycles, increasing tolerance for risk, and invest in technology enterprises through market-based approaches, the director of the National Development and Reform Commission said.

Zheng and other officials spoke to the media a day after Premier Li Qiang told lawmakers Beijing aimed to keep the tariff-hit economy growing at a roughly 5% rate this year.

China said on Wednesday it would boost support for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models and the development of venture capital investment, in a bid to foster more technology breakthroughs and become more self-reliant.

The fund will focus on cutting-edge fields such as AI, quantum technology, and hydrogen energy storage and will invest in seed-stage and start-up companies through market-oriented methods, state media CCTV reported on Thursday.

Hexaware Technologies rose 2.37% to Rs 819.75 after the company announced a new collaboration with the San Francisco Unicorns, a team in Major League Cricket.


As part of the association, Hexaware will be recognized as the San Francisco Unicorns' official partner. In addition to featuring Hexaware branding on the team's helmets and caps, the company will also receive a perimeter signage display.



Hexaware is a global technology and business process services company. It reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 857.50 crore and sales of Rs 8,820 crore for the nine months ended on 30 September 2024. 



Hexaware Technologies made a debut on the stock exchanges on 19 February 2025, with its shares listing at Rs 731, a 3.25% premium to the issue price of Rs 708. The company's initial public offering (IPO), which closed on February 14th, was subscribed 2.66 times. The IPO was priced within a band of Rs 674 to Rs 708 per share.



Hexaware was delisted from stock exchanges in November 2020. In 2021, Carlyle acquired it from ETQ (earlier Baring Private Equity Asia) for around $3 billion through an investment holding company CA Magnum Holdings. 



Currently, CA Magnum Holdings has 74.71% stake in the IT company.

Samsung on (Wednesday, March 5, 2025) announced the availability of Galaxy AI features on more Galaxy devices through the One UI 7 beta program. The beta program will be available for Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 in India from March 6. The official update of the One UI 7 will be available within April.

It will be rolled out to more devices within the month including Galaxy S23 series, Tab S10 series and A55, the company said. Users can apply to join the beta program via Samsung Members.

“Integrating leading AI agents with multimodal capabilities into every touch point of the interface, One UI 7 marks a significant leap forward in creating a new kind of mobile experience where every interaction feels more intuitive than ever before,” said Samsung.

One UI 7 brings updates to Galaxy AI features including advanced writing assist tools. Integrated into AI OS, they will allow texts that can be selected without needing to switch between applications.

The Upgraded call features with One UI 7 for call transcripts to support 20 languages. When call recording is enabled, recorded calls will automatically be transcribed for reference later on.

The One UI 7’s AI features come with a significant new look, based on a new notification system that streamlines communication with easy access from the device’s lock screen. It includes Now Bar, which highlights relevant activities across various features like Interpreter, Music, Recording, Stopwatch and more. It will be supported on upcoming Galaxy S series devices.

A redesigned camera UX will allow more intuitive control over advanced settings. Camera buttons, controls and modes have been reorganised to make it easier to find the features for a clearer preview of the picture or the video.

For Pro and Pro video modes, the manual settings layout has also been simplified. A new zoom control is available when you’re recording in Pro video mode, allowing you to control the zoom speed.

The official One UI 7 release will commence with upcoming Galaxy S series devices, featuring additional AI capabilities including enhanced on-device AI functions, starting from the first quarter of 2025. The update will gradually roll out to other Galaxy devices.

Rep. Lindsey LaPointe (D-Chicago) spoke with reporters during a press conference in Springfield on March 6, 2025.



SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WAND) — A bill moving in Springfield could significantly improve access to mental health and substance use treatment.

Democrats and Republicans are pushing for a plan to require health insurance companies to cover medically-necessary out-of-network behavioral healthcare treatments as if they are in-network.

The proposal could also set minimum reimbursement rates for providers to properly compensate them for their services and encourage more specialists to join insurance networks.

"You deserve this. You had long deserved this," Rep. Lindsey LaPointe (D-Chicago) said Thursday. "Behavioral healthcare is healthcare. We shouldn't treat it like some other, and it's just unacceptable for us to reimburse it at far lower rates."

Sponsors said people already paying costly insurance premiums should be able to access the care outlined in their benefits instead of racking up debt for mental health services. 

House Bill 1085 passed out of the House Mental Health and Addiction Committee on a bipartisan 17-5 vote Thursday. The legislation currently has over 40 co-sponsors, and representatives could see the bill on the House floor as early as Tuesday. 

Identical legislation, Senate Bill 55, is also gaining significant support in the Senate. The proposal currently has nearly 30 co-sponsors. Sen. Karina Villa (D-West Chicago) told reporters she is committed to getting the plan passed out of both chambers this spring. As a former school social worker, Villa said this fight is personal.

"You have done nothing wrong. You have paid your premiums, and you deserve for your child to be able to go in and get help when they need it," Villa said. "This bill is the most important bill regarding mental health that we can make sure to get across the finish line."

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers was in Chippewa Falls Thursday speaking with community leaders about healthcare in the Chippewa Valley.

CHIPPEWA FALLS (WQOW) - Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers was in Chippewa Falls Thursday speaking with community leaders about healthcare in the Chippewa Valley.

Evers met with local healthcare representatives, mental healthcare workers, and other community members this afternoon to discuss the plans outlined in his proposed budget to support healthcare in rural communities and bring down costs.

Evers said that funding would be critical for area hospitals if the federal government cuts Medicaid funding.

"If they do to Medicaid what everybody fears, that's going to make it more difficult for everybody, whether you're in the hospitals that are open now or not. They're not going to be able to pay the bills," he said.

Evers' budget proposal will still have to go through the Republican controlled state legislature before any of that funding can be approved.

Arielle Urquhart will hop on a bike Saturday to raise money for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. It’s a cause close to her heart, spending months there after surviving a car crash that almost ended her young life.

Arielle toured WSB-TV, sitting in on one of our newscasts as a guest of Channel 2 Anchor Jorge Estevez and the rest of the team. She showed she is so curious and full of life, which was almost cut short.

Arielle and her mother were in a head-on collision on their way to school a little over four years ago, when she was just 7.

“It could have gone either way, and I am so grateful to be alive,” she said.

Doctors at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta performed a lifesaving neck and spinal surgery. Arielle not only walked again, she would go on to compete in track.

Since then, she has become a “Miracle Kid” with the Children’s Miracle Network, donating her time to make care packages for others in the hospital.

Her work continues on a bike at Life Time Fitness, an athletic club that’s raising money for the Children’s Miracle Network with their signature “Ride of a Life Time Event.”

Instructors like Joshua Neal are grateful to be able to give back.

“To know that we are actually raising money to help these kids is just priceless, it is really is,” he said.

This effort means so much to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and to kids like Arielle, who thanks to the care she received gets to give back.

“I try to show them that this could be you,” she said. “You could get better. Just keep believing in yourself and keep pushing hard, and you can make it through.”

Arielle recovered from that neck surgery and a broken femur. It took her four months to walk again.

Now, she is a track star, a cheerleader and wants to pursue a modeling and acting career.

“I feel like I did get a second chance at life,” Arielle said.

Healthcare issues in Arizona prisons led the ACLU to seek a receiver while agencies like NaphCare and the ADCRR are defending their actions. FOX 10's Justin Lum investigates.

PHOENIX - Advocates for inmates incarcerated by Arizona’s Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation, and Reentry say ADCRR doesn’t have what’s necessary to run a successful healthcare system, according to the ACLU’s motion for a receiver. 

Lawyers say NaphCare, the for-profit healthcare provider contracted by the state, remains "woefully inadequate." 

What they're saying:

"My whole neck – I’ve lost four inches in my height," said Mary Whatley over the phone. 

Whatley is incarcerated at the Perryville women’s prison, serving time for weapons misconduct. She’s having issues with what’s called the thecal sac – a protective sheath around the spinal cord – and she needs surgery."I have to have this surgery or I’m going to be paralyzed, is what the nurse practitioners or providers here told me," said Whatley.

Mary Whatley 

She has a history of vertebrae fractures and neck trauma that causes numbness, tingling, and pain in both the neck and arms. Whatley doesn’t know when her next appointment will be."And it’s not just me; there are other women here that need surgeries and care that they’re not getting," said Whatley.

There are more than 100 healthcare positions vacant, the ACLU says via its latest motion in the ongoing Jensen v. Thornell lawsuit.

"It’s a battle in here," said Erin Taylor. 

Taylor is another inmate at the Perryville Complex. She has brain cancer."It’s very hard to get appointments," she said.In 2022, she had surgery to get some of the tumor removed. She says there was a long wait to receive radiation treatment."For about 15 months, I asked for some aftercare. Radiation didn’t begin until July 2023," Taylor recalled.She also says there’s been miscommunication between the prison’s medical staff and her oncologist regarding how long her chemotherapy should last. 

Erin Taylor 

Dig deeper:

In the motion for a receiver to take over health care throughout the state’s prisons, ADCRR is accused of frequently using telehealth when it’s clinically inappropriate and dangerous. 

Due to a judge’s order to fix constitutional violations found at trial, court-appointed experts reviewed countless death reports that documented "horrible care" leading to "unnecessary suffering and lost opportunities for treatment and cure" - and ultimately death, per the ACLU. 

"The ways that those things are happening come through a few structural issues that we identified in our motion. One of these is extreme delays in people getting the care they need. Another one is a real difficulty getting people to specialty appointments." 

As for the staffing shortage, Beall says there aren’t enough physicians providing care; instead, nurses who don’t have the same training," said Lauren Beall, an attorney for the ACLU of Arizona. 

Court expert reports say, "NaphCare offered a paltry two-dollars-per-hour increase to physician salaries between December 2023 and July 2024 and has made none since."

The other side:

A spokesperson for NaphCare says the provider is "proud of our record of successfully recruiting and retaining healthcare staff to work in Arizona’s prisons" and "there are more healthcare professionals working in ADCRR prisons than ever before," also saying each of the nine state prisons has a full-time medical director with 13 additional physicians across the state and two more have been hired. 

There are openings for two full-time and one part-time physician. NaphCare also says pay rates compete with market rates. 

Meanwhile, ADCRR’s responses to court monitors’ reports cite challenges with changes through third-party vendors."Passing the buck and saying, ‘you know this is NaphCare's responsibility’ is simply not an excuse, and it's not going to work for all of the people and all of the families of the people who are incarcerated," said Beall. 

We’ve also asked ADCRR about Erin Taylor and Mary Whatley’s alleged treatment delays. The department is prohibited from discussing inmates’ private and protected health information with third parties, but a spokesperson sent us the following statement:

Information for this story was provided by ADCRR, NaphCare, ACLU of Arizona, court documents and interviews with prisoners in Arizona prisons. The story was reported by FOX 10 Investigator Justin Lum from Phoenix.

Athenahealth is partnering with Abridge to integrate the company’s enhanced note-taking technology into its platform for clinicians, as the market for ambient scribing is becoming more crowded.

Abridge offers ambient note-taking, which is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology that listens to a patient and doctor conversation and generates structured medical notes. After a review by the doctor, these notes are added directly to a patient’s electronic health record.

The note-taking tool is also multilingual; it can record the patient-doctor conversation in one language and write it up in another language.

“Writing notes is something that has been a pain point for physicians since time began,” Paul Brient, chief product officer at Athenahealth, said in an interview with PYMNTS. “Artificial intelligence has gotten to the point now where it can listen to a provider-patient conversation and generate a note for the physician.”

Physicians often spend hours of their personal time catching up on medical notes — a phenomenon the industry calls “pajama time.”

Abridge’s technology will be incorporated into athenaOne, which is Athenahealth’s flagship cloud-based electronic health record (EHR), practice management and revenue cycle management platform designed for outpatient care. 

Earlier this week, Microsoft unveiled an AI-powered assistant that combines advanced voice dictation and ambient listening with generative AI. Called Dragon Copilot, the tool converts doctor and patient conversations into clinical summaries that can be integrated into electronic health records.

Microsoft is using the technology from Nuance, which it acquired in 2022. Brient said Nuance used to be the only game in town about three to four years ago, but the field has gotten crowded now with 40 to 50 vendors. 

Athenahealth is one of the largest in this market, serving 160,000 providers or about 10% of U.S. healthcare providers, primarily in outpatient care.

Brient said the Abridge partnership represents one part of Athenahealth’s broader vision for AI in healthcare technology. The company is developing a platform where users get to customize their experience.

For example, Abridge is one of three note-taking services being offered on athenaOne. The other two are Suki and iScribe, and Athenahealth plans to add more. Brient wants to give physicians a choice on which note-taking service they want to use because everyone’s style is different.

Letting each physician in a practice choose the model that works best for them is a “much more flexible strategy,” he added. “We were pretty excited about the approach, and super excited to have Abridge join that approach.”

Athenahealth also has an app marketplace with more than 850 APIs for physicians to customize their tech experience.

Looking ahead, the arrival of generative and agentic AI can “dramatically change the clinician experience” in the realm of the electronic health record system, Brient said.

First, the note-taking AI can evolve into a technology that can pull out diagnoses from the patient-doctor conversation and even suggest medicine orders, shrinking the process into a single cognitive step, Brient said.

Second, Brient sees Athenahealth using AI to digitize outpatient documentation. Unlike in-patient hospital care, where everything is electronic, at clinics and other outpatient settings a lot of documents are in various forms: lab test faxes, medical forms, and the like.

“A lot of the data coming into the EHR is unstructured. We get a lot of faxes,” Brient said. “You’re dealing with a lot of vendors all over the place.”

He added that “the good thing about AI is it can actually read those faxes. It can pull all the data out and put them in discrete form,” or stored in a way for easy retrieval and analysis. So instead of the doctor having to read each individual lab test, AI can consolidate and analyze them.

Brient also sees AI making its revenue cycle management services more efficient. This includes managing billing, insurance claims and payments. “We can add agentic AI and the new LLMs [large language models] to do a lot of the work the humans are doing, which speeds it up.”

For example, a hospital gets a check from an insurance company but it doesn’t say for whom or why, Brient said. The hospital has to investigate by logging into the insurer’s web portal. AI agents can do that.

Another use case is to appeal coverage denials. An LLM can write an appeal letter that the AI agent can upload to the insurer’s portal. The human worker would click to submit the appeal.

Also, Brient sees AI taking over the communication between the doctor’s office and the patient — taking phone calls, scheduling appointments, refilling medication and the like.

AI will handle the routine tasks to help the human worker who might be overwhelmed trying to check people in and out of the clinic, he said. 

“Big health systems are already doing that, but most of our clients are small, independent practices,” Brient added. “So we’re helping them, over the next year, to start doing that.”

He said he met with a company that uses AI agents as “nurses,” not to directly provide care, but to perform follow-ups like calling the patient to remind them they still need to get a certain lab test for their surgery. Brient can see Athenahealth acting as a “virtual call center” for doctors’ offices.

Adoption could increase as costs continue to fall. Brient said the cost for note-taking has fallen from $2,000 a month per doctor in the early days to $100 to $400 — and prices still keep declining.

“People have long joked that Dr. Google plays a big role in people’s healthcare lives,” he said. “I can imagine that Dr. ChatGPT will start to play a big role in people’s healthcare lives, officially or unofficially.”

N.C. Sen. Benton Sawrey, R-Johnston, landed an influential role in his second term this session as co-chair of the Senate’s committees on healthcare.

He joined this week’s WUNC Politics Podcast to talk about his efforts to address the unusually high costs of healthcare in North Carolina, including a recent bill to limit insurance coverage mandates and some other proposals in the works for later this year.

This conversation has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

What do you see as the big priorities for the Senate on the healthcare front this year?

“It's going to all be about cost this year. There's some recent information that came out that showed that North Carolina ranked number 50 in the nation with respect to healthcare costs. We're paying the highest health premiums in the nation, which is particularly concerning considering how expensive healthcare is in the United States generally, and then not necessarily corresponding with outcome.

“We have parts of our state that are lagging behind the rest of the country with respect to infant mortality, maternal mortality, access to care, things like that. We need to really drill down and examine why we're paying so much and not getting the results that should come along with that.”

You co-sponsored a bill that already passed the Senate to get at the affordability issue, that would restrict government mandates on what insurance plans have to cover. What's the rationale behind going at it from that direction?

“That's not the only tool in the toolbox, that's one big piece of the puzzle here. What we've examined is that government mandates with insurance are having an effect on driving up costs. Anytime there's government intervention, it increases costs, increases regulation, increases obligation, and ultimately gets passed on to consumer and drives that up.”

Do you see other bills in the works?

“I think you'll see some (Certificate of Need) legislation that comes out this session. I think a complete CON repeal probably would not get across the finish line at this point, but there's definitely an opportunity, especially for (reducing regulatory handles to adding) major medical equipment pieces.

“I think you'll see a bill dropped on Collaborative Pharmacy Practice, where you can have certain qualified pharmacists practicing in a team-based setting with some of our physicians and other people. They can do medication management and help with that cost and access in some of our rural communities.”

Some of your counterparts on the House Health Committee have been discussing what might happen here in North Carolina if federal Medicaid funding gets cut. Have there been any preliminary discussions of what that might look like?

“We’re definitely having conversations about it. It's an issue that ultimately is not within our control as to what happens at the congressional level at this point.

“We have asked DHHS to discuss some contingencies and ideas about how they would address it if there are tweaks. At the $880 billion cut level that I think they're discussing, I believe the state share to North Carolina could potentially be about $27 billion, so it’s a big issue that would affect a lot of people in North Carolina.

"To keep (the Medicaid expansion) population in place, it would require commitment from the state of several billion more dollars that we don't have. So we would have to have some tough conversations about what that would look like in case that federal share was reduced."

Sawrey also spoke about his bill to help disabled veterans afford homeownership, a new "sports caucus" and the upcoming budget season at the legislature. Listen to the full conversation on the WUNC Politics Podcast.

Libraries are so much more than a place to get books. Now, thanks to the Libraries with Heart program, libraries in Central Florida are places where community members can keep an eye on one aspect of their health. A partnership between HCA Florida Healthcare, the American Heart Association and the Orange County Library system lets patrons 18 and up check out blood pressure monitoring kits. In 2024, the kits were checked out 459 times.

"We meet people where they are, and so we try to bring our community work to life in settings like the library,” said  Jimmy Clarity, vice president of community impact for the American Heart Association. “It’s a place where people gather and spend a lot of their time and can access resources. It’s not just about checking out library books anymore.”

Each branch of the library has at least two staff members who have been trained to teach patrons how to use the kits; the system also has outreach teams that go into the community to get the kits into the hands of those who might not be able to go to the library, or who are unaware that the program exists.

Libraries with Heart has also provided automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to every library in the system; a donation from UCF Lake Nona Hospital covered those, as well as the cost of training library staffers in CPR and AED use.

WRGB aired a story reporting on St. Peter’s Health Partners new collaboration with the Caring Gene Career Pathways Training Program (CPT) to tackle healthcare workforce shortages in New York’s most affected areas.

From the report:

Meredith Robison, chief nursing officer for acute care at St. Peter’s Health Partners said, “St. Peter’s Health Partners is proud to partner with the Caring Gene to provide meaningful education opportunities for students and address the ongoing need for healthcare workers in New York state. Together, we aim to build a stronger healthcare workforce, support career advancement, and improve community health outcomes.”

To qualify, students must commit to a three-year service with a healthcare, behavioral health, or social care network provider in New York that serves a patient population of at least 30% Medicaid-reliant or uninsured individuals.

They must complete their degree by Spring 2027 and fulfill the service requirement by 2031.

Officials say Kentucky ranks in the bottom 10 states across the U-S for healthcare, and about two thirds face a massive shortage of OBGYNs. Healthcare leaders and legislators have conflicting plans to tackle the Commonwealth’s shortage. Senate Bill 132 would establish what it calls individual civil protection for healthcare workers, permitting professionals to refuse to perform procedures or treatments based on a religious or ethical belief without consequence.

While the bill’s sponsors say the measure would enable more diversity in the healthcare field amidst the state’s healthcare field, other officials say it’s not the right way.

David Conway, a minister and registered nurse, spoke about the legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Health Services. Conway said he, alongside other providers and organizations like the American Medical Association, oppose this bill because it would likely cause delays and barriers to care, especially in rural areas.

“It makes it illegal for someone to even suggest that an employee who objects to providing care be reassigned to another task. In other words, if I were the lead nurse and I knew that a nurse was opposed to this procedure, I wouldn’t have the freedom to say, ‘why don’t you take a step out and let somebody else in?’ If an employee is uncomfortable providing care, the compassionate action is to reassign them,” said Conway.

He argued in rural areas without other options, this bill would cause worse outcomes, especially for women’s health. Other healthcare providers and senators were concerned about the possibility of discrimination against patients based on their identity, race, or religion.

Proponents argued the bill would not allow practitioners to discriminate against their patients based on identity, only protecting those who refuse to perform certain procedures or prescribe medications. SB 132’s sponsors named abortion as its primary target, arguing doctors should not feel coerced or forced to perform one if it’s against their conscience.

State Senator Donald Douglas, a co-sponsor of the bill, testified to the Senate Standing Committee on Health Services early this month. He said in his career as a physician, these protections would have been pivotal.

“When I worked in pain management, the clinic I worked with insisted on writing for a lot of opioids for the patients to keep them coming through the practice,” said Douglas. “How has that worked out in the substance use disorder area, Mister Chairman? It hasn’t. So because I exercised my right of conscience to say this isn’t working, I believe I’ve saved a lot of lives.”

Other healthcare workers said it would open opportunities for discrimination and that medical professionals have an ethical obligation to serve their patients regardless of their beliefs.

The bill passed its committee reading and moves on to the full senate.

The chief medical officer of Providence Medical Group, Serene Perkins, spoke about the role of artificial intelligence, or AI, in health care at a conference on AI innovation Feb. 28 in Anchorage.

She outlined the AI tools Providence is already using across its network of health care facilities in Alaska and in six other states.

She said one AI tool Providence has incorporated uses artificial intelligence to analyze patient messages to providers. It identifies patients with the highest immediate risk so a health care provider can respond quickly.

“Things like suicidal ideation,” Perkins said. “We need to get that to the top of the inbox. We need to make sure that there is a mental health counselor that can get in touch with that person right away.”

Perkins said the AI tool adheres to HIPAA, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a federal law protecting patients’ privacy.

She said the biggest potential for AI interventions in the long term are for managing chronic disease and illness.

“The more that we can use AI to really attack those and be able to monitor patients on a much more frequent basis and prevent them from getting to the place where they have to be hospitalized, because once they're at that higher level of care, or need a surgery, the complications go up exponentially,” Perkins said.

She said Providence also recently started a program that incorporates wearable glucose monitors with AI to help manage diabetes.

Perkins said as a patient, she experienced the benefits of AI when her physician used an AI transcription note-taking service during her annual physical exam.

“To be able to sit there and have a 20-minute face-to-face conversation where she's not worrying about forgetting anything that I'm saying and I'm not watching her type on the computer, turned away from me, I experienced it myself, the transformation,” Perkins said.

But she said using AI is a big responsibility. “We have to be in charge of it.”

Perkins said there's potential in the future for AI to help manage other kinds of chronic disease, like depression or cancer. But she said, for now, Providence is sticking to using artificial intelligence for diabetes and heart health care. She said once they get those applications right and can show patient outcomes are improving, they can explore using AI to aid treatment of other health conditions.

EG Funds has made its first move into the healthcare real estate sector with the acquisition of two high-quality medical centers in Australia’s Gold Coast region — Parkwood and Highland Park medical centers — for a combined purchase price of A$12.8 million ($8.1 million).

The acquisition is underpinned by strong investment fundamentals, including a net passing yield of 8.7 percent and a weighted average lease expiry of 3.0 years, which includes a rental guarantee. Investors are projected to receive an average distribution of 8.4 percent per year (paid quarterly).

Located in key growth corridors, these properties provide essential primary healthcare services, serving as a frontline solution to alleviate pressure on Australia’s increasingly stretched hospital system. They are leased to IPN, Australia’s largest operator of GP clinics and a division of ASX-listed Sonic Healthcare. By supporting preventative and community-based care, these facilities play a vital

—

Healthcare workers in Alabama are calling for legislative action to address the growing issue of workplace violence in hospitals and medical facilities.

According to the Alabama State Nurses Association (ASNA), one in four nurses will experience workplace violence each year. ASNA President Abby Horton emphasized that the problem has escalated in recent years.

“Violence against nurses and other healthcare workers has become an increasing problem,” Horton said.

National Nurses United reports that 80% of healthcare workers have faced some form of assault from patients in the past year. Casey Martin, a patient care technician in an intensive care unit, has experienced this firsthand.

“A patient suddenly became confused, kicked me multiple times, pulled a nurse’s hair, and punched another nurse,” Martin recalled.

Since the pandemic, hospitals have responded by implementing de-escalation training for staff. However, Martin believes this alone is not enough.

“It feels pointless sometimes,” he said. “At the end of the day, I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I also have to protect myself.”

Alabama law currently requires proof of intentional harm to convict someone of felony assault against a healthcare worker. Horton and other advocates argue that updating the law could provide stronger protections for medical staff.

“I think it’s important to have conversations about legislative changes,” Horton said. “Any support we can get is helpful.”

Martin, who has written multiple letters to state lawmakers, believes collective action is key to making a difference.

“It’s about standing up and saying, ‘This isn’t okay, and something needs to change,’” he said.

Healthcare workers across the state continue to push for stronger protection, hoping lawmakers will take action to address the rising violence in medical settings.

In response, Congressman Robert Aderholt issued the following statement calling violence against healthcare workers “absolutely unacceptable.”

“These men and women dedicate their lives to caring for others, and they deserve to do their jobs without fear for their safety,” Aderholt said.

“I firmly believe that anyone who commits violence against a healthcare worker should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Protecting those who care for us in healthcare settings is just common sense.”

“While current law needs to be fully enforced, I would also be inclined to support legislation that strengthens laws safeguarding healthcare workers from violence, ensuring they have the protection they need while serving our communities.”

Thousands of Virginians are navigating the loss of job-based health care following massive layoffs from the federal government.

Enroll Virginia is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that wants to help those who need to enroll in a new health care plan.

Director Deepak Madala says they’ve seen a sharp spike in calls for assistance, especially in Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and Richmond, following the federal layoffs.

Many of these Virginians without work have not had to navigate the challenge of enrolling in non-work-related health care in years, according to Madala.

That’s where Enroll Virginia can step in. Their statewide team of assisters can provide free, unbiased advice to help you review all of the options you may have.

Play has been suspended in all five evening matches in the BNP Paribas Open after rain started to fall for a second time Thursday evening.

Play was briefly stopped the first time in four of the five matches after rain started falling around 8:20 p.m. Thursday on the second day of main draw competition for men and women.

On Stadium 2, only a few sprinkles were falling so the match between Mariano Navone and 19-year-old American Learner Tien continued. Tien lost the first set 7-5.

After a 15-minute delay, action resumed on all courts.

But the rain returned around 8:45 p.m., and players on all five courts returned to the locker rooms.

Matches began at 11 a.m. Thursday under a mix of sun, clouds and gusty wind, but as the afternoon wore on the clouds looked more threatening.

A total of 33 singles matches and seven doubles matches were scheduled for Thursday. Thirty-four matches had already been completed, including one that carried over from late Wednesday because of rain.

The weather forecast calls for a 30% chance of showers continuing Thursday evening.

Sunshine is expected to return Friday and temperatures are expected to rise into the 70s on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.

Pregnant players on the women’s tennis tour now can receive 12 months of paid maternity leave, and those who become parents via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption can get two months off with pay, under a program sponsored by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia and announced Thursday by the WTA.

“Independent contractors and self-employed individuals don’t typically have these kinds of maternity benefits provided and available to them. They have to go out and sort of figure out those benefits for themselves,” WTA CEO Portia Archer said. “This is really sort of novel and groundbreaking.”

More than 300 players are eligible for the fund, which is retroactive to Jan. 1. The WTA would not disclose how much money is involved.

The program — which the WTA touted as “the first time in women’s sports history that comprehensive maternity benefits are available to independent, self-employed athletes” — also provides grants for fertility treatments, including egg freezing and IVF.

It’s part of a wider trend: As women’s sports rise, there is an emphasis on meeting maternity and parental needs.




The WTA says 25 moms are active on tour; one, Tokyo Olympics gold medalist Belinda Bencic, won a title last month after returning from maternity leave in October.

More and more pros in tennis have returned to action after having children, including past No. 1-ranked players and Grand Slam title winners such as Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, Kim Clijsters, Caroline Wozniacki and Victoria Azarenka.

Azarenka — a member of the WTA Players’ Council, which Archer acknowledged played a key role in pushing for this fund — thinks these benefits will encourage lower-ranked or lower-earning athletes to take as much time off as they feel they need after becoming a parent, rather than worrying about losing out on income while not entering tournaments.

“That’s certainly one of the aims of the program: to provide the financial resources, the flexibility, the support, so that these athletes, regardless of where they’re ranked, but particularly those who earn less, will have that agency ... to decide when and how they want to start their families,” Archer said.

And, Azarenka said, this could lead some players to decide to become parents before retiring from the sport for good.

“Every feedback we’ve heard from players who are mothers — or who are not mothers — is like, ‘Wow, this is an incredible opportunity for us,’” said 2012 and ’13 Australian Open champion Azarenka, whose son, Leo, is 8. “I believe it’s really going to change the conversation in sports. But going beyond sports, it’s a global conversation, and I’m happy that we’re (part of it).”

Other steps the WTA has taken in recent years to benefit players include steering more women into coaching, implementing safeguarding, attempting to stem cyberbullying, and increasing prize money with an eye to pay that equals what men receive in the sport.

The Public Investment Fund, or PIF, became the WTA’s global partner last year, after much public debate — Hall of Famers Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova were among the critics — over questions about LGBTQ+ and women’s rights in Saudi Arabia.

The kingdom now hosts the season-ending WTA Finals and an ATP event for rising stars of men’s tennis. The PIF sponsors the WTA and ATP rankings.

“We wouldn’t have been able to provide the benefits were it not for this relationship and the funding that PIF provides,” Archer said.

In golf, which like tennis is an individual sport without guaranteed salaries, the LPGA introduced an updated maternity leave policy in 2019 that lets athletes have the same playing status when they return.

In soccer, both the NWSL and the U.S. women’s national team have collective bargaining agreements that allow for pregnancy leave and parental leave; the NWSL pays the full base salary while an athlete is pregnant.

In basketball, the WNBA’s CBA guarantees full pay during maternity leave.

For tennis, Azarenka said, the PIF WTA Maternity Fund Program is “just the beginning.”

“It’s an incredible beginning. Monumental change,” she said. “But I think we can look into how we can expand this fund for bigger, better things.”

University of Oklahoma

Missouri

 March  06, 2025  | Women's Tennis

 By: OU Athletics Communications

NORMAN – The No. 14 Oklahoma women's tennis team returns to the Headington Family Tennis Center for its first ever SEC home matches this weekend, beginning with No. 69 Missouri on Friday before hosting No. 16 Vanderbilt on Sunday.   

The Sooners' 2025 matches at the Headington Family Tennis Center will be open to the public and free of charge. Oklahoma follows a clear bag policy.   

First serve against the Tigers is set for 5 p.m. CT on Friday. Fans can keep up with the action through live stats or by watching on PlaySight. 

Sunday's match against the Commodores is scheduled for 1 p.m. CT. The contest can be followed through live stats and live video. 

Ace shirts, posters, roster cards and yell sheets will be provided to fans entering the tennis facility until supplies last for both matches. Free bagels will also be available on Sunday.  

Oklahoma suffered a 6-1 loss to No. 5 Texas A&M on Sunday afternoon at the Mitchell Tennis Center. 
 
Sunday marked the second matchup of the season between the programs as OU met the defending national champions in the semifinals of ITA National Indoors on Feb. 10, which saw A&M sneak away with a 4-2 win. 
 
Oklahoma's lone win in singles came from freshman Gloriana Nahum. On court six, Nahum capped a 2-0 weekend with a 7-6(2), 6-0 win against Lizanne Boyer. It was the seventh straight-set victory for the Cotonou, Benin, native. 

Oklahoma currently sits at No. 14 in the ITA team rankings. The squad reached a season-high ranking of No. 3 on Feb. 12, their best ranking since being tabbed No. 2 during the 2022 campaign which remains the highest ranking in program history. OU's impressive resume includes three ranked wins over top-15 opponents.   

Additionally, the Sooners have four players in the ITA singles rankings. Leading the pack is No. 17 Julia Garcia Ruiz, followed by No. 34 Alina Shcherbinina, No. 74 Emma Staker and No. 98 Gloriana Nahum.  
 
In doubles, OU is represented by No. 63 Shcherbinina and Cara Mester, followed by No. 66 Garcia Ruiz and Chloé Noël, and No. 76 Mester and Emma Ghirardato.   

Oklahoma's Gloriana Nahum has played a pivotal role in the Sooners' success this season. The freshman from Cotonou, Benin, went 2-0 in singles during OU's road trip last week at No. 11 Texas and No. 5 Texas A&M. Splitting time between Nos. 5 and 6 singles, Nahum boasts a 7-1 dual record, with all her victories coming in straight sets. 

In doubles, Nahum leads the team with a 7-2 record this spring and has primarily teamed up with Salakthip Ounmuang at the third court to form one of the nation's top all-freshman doubles teams.  

The Sooners return to the Headington Family Tennis Center on Friday for their first home match since Feb. 4.  

Seven of OU's nine matchups against conference opponents ranked within the top 25 of the ITA team rankings are on the road, making the Sooners' slate one of the toughest in the country in their inaugural SEC season. 

No. 69 Missouri (10-3, 1-2 SEC) enters Friday's match coming off their highest ranked win of the season against No. 55 Mississippi State, 4-3. The Tigers are led by freshman Gian Octa with a 7-3 mark in singles. Octa, a former U18 Indoor and Outdoor Ontario Provincial Singles and Doubles Champion, was ranked in the top 10 in the Canadian Junior National Rankings (U12-U18) and finished third at the 2022 U18 Fischer Outdoor Canadian Junior Nationals. Complimenting Octa at the top of the lineup for Mizzou with six wins each are senior Inah Canete and junior Andrea Artimedi. 

Friday's match will be the 31st meeting between the Sooners and Tiers with the two sides first squaring off in 1982. Oklahoma leads the all-time series 28-2.

Emma Raducanu was defeated 3-6 2-6 by Moyuka Uchijima in her first-round match; it was the first tournament Raducanu was playing in since she was the target of 'fixated behaviour';  watch all in action from Indian Wells live on Sky Sports Tennis from 5-16 March

Britain's Emma Raducanu was defeated in straight sets by Japan's Moyuka Uchijima in her first-round match at Indian Wells on Thursday.

It was Raducanu's first appearance since she was the target of "fixated behaviour" from a man during the Dubai Championships in February, with the man subsequently banned from all future WTA events "pending a threat assessment" and given a restraining order.

Having admitted prior to the event that she was unsure if she would complete at Indian Wells, Raducanu lost 3-6 2-6 to Uchijima as the pair battled through strong winds in the desert but the Brit ultimately was unable to put up a fight against her in-form opponent.

It is also the first time she teamed up with new coach Vladimir Platenik, after Nick Cavaday stood down for health reasons following the Australian Open, where Raducanu was heavily beaten by five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek in the third round.

However, Raducanu was unable to master the hot and windy conditions of the desert with Uchijima claiming four games in a row to take the first set 6-3.

The second set followed a similar tale, and after Raducanu was broken in the first game she was unable to gather momentum in her favour or challenge Uchijima's serve amid a lot of unforced errors.

Uchijima held her serve and won crucial points to inch slowly towards victory before ending the match with a hold to love for a 6-3 6-2 victory.

Uchijima will face USA's Coco Gauff in the next round, while Raducanu heads to prepare for the Miami Open.

Britain's Jacob Fearnley fell to a 2-6 6-1 3-6 defeat to Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca at Indian Wells.

World No 80 Fonseca rallied from a break down in the third set to beat the Brit during his tournament debut.

Fearnley was unable to find his rhythm during the opening set with Fonseca easing through, but the 23-year-old made a comeback in the second set to send the match to a decider.

Fearnley, who is ranked one spot below Fonseca, raced to a 3-1 lead in the third set before his Brazilian opponent took the final five points to book his place in the following round where he will meet another Brit, 13th seed Jack Draper.

Emma Raducanu has won only one of her past six WTA Tour matches

Emma Raducanu struggled in a testing Indian Wells wind as she was beaten on her first appearance since being targeted by a stalker during a match.

The 22-year-old Briton was unsure if she was going to even play in the California tournament following the incident at the Dubai Tennis Championships on 18 February, where she spotted a man who she had reported for what WTA officials described as "exhibiting fixated behaviour".

After deliberating whether to take an extended break from the WTA Tour, Raducanu decided to make the journey to Indian Wells - one of the biggest events outside of the four majors.

However, the world number 55 was out of sorts as she lost 6-3 6-2 to Japan's Moyuka Uchijima in the first round of the BNP Paribas Open.

"I didn't feel anxious about any of the scenarios that have happened recently," Raducanu told BBC Sport.

"I think I had a good preparation with good people around."

Raducanu, who has been given increased security at the WTA event in California, walked on court with a solemn expression and glanced several times around the vast arena.

Throughout the match she showed little emotion and, unsurprisingly given the defeat, quickly left with a despondent look.

Later, speaking in her post-match news conference, she added: "I didn't have what happened in Dubai in my head at all today.

"I think today was just a bit of a curveball. I guess it's just nice, I'm just going to move on."

In tricky conditions created by a brisk wind in the Californian desert, Raducanu looked uncomfortable throughout as Uchijima adapted impressively.

The 2021 US Open champion made a host of errors to allow Uchijima, a tenacious opponent who continued to put balls back into court, to come out on top of the often scrappy rallies.

Raducanu faced break points in her opening six service games, a result of the pressure created by a lack of accuracy as she looked to be aggressive.

Five of those games ended in Raducanu losing serve as she trailed by a set and a break to the 52nd-ranked Uchijima.

The Briton cut a subdued figure after she could not convert any of three chances to break back for 3-3.

After Uchijima dug deep to hold, Raducanu did not win another point and trudged off court having lost for a sixth time in her nine matches this year.

Raducanu was watched from the stands by Slovakian coach Vladimir Platenik, who has linked up with the British number two on a trial basis.

Platenik, 49, was coaching New Zealand qualifier Lulu Sun when she beat Raducanu at Wimbledon last year, while he has also worked with top-10 players Dominika Cibulkova, Daria Kasatkina and Veronika Kudermetova.

When asked which areas of her game she wanted to work on with Platenik, Raducanu smiled and said "everything".

"I'll need to improve starting the point. That's a big part of tennis. I can do that a lot better," she added.

"I could improve being more aggressive and having a better quality of shot going forward into the court.

"I could improve every area of my game after today's performance."

Shortly after Raducanu's exit, British number three Sonay Kartal did move into the second round, making the most of being given a 'lucky loser' spot having been beaten in qualifying.

Kartal, 23, won 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 against 38-year-old American qualifier Varvara Lepchenko and faces Brazilian 16th seed Beatriz Haddad Maia next.

In the men's draw, Jacob Fearnley was unable to set up an all-British clash with Jack Draper after losing to rising star Joao Fonseca.

Emma Raducanu admitted that she needs to improve every aspect of her game, after extending her dismal series of results with a 6-3, 6-2 defeat at the hands of unheralded Japanese player Moyuka Uchijima.

In all her interviews this week, Raducanu has insisted that her late call to fly out to Indian Wells had helped to put the recent stalking incident in Dubai behind her. But while this felt like the right decision on a personal level, it didn’t lend itself to great tennis.

Coming in undercooked, Raducanu arrived on court with strapping underneath her left knee, suggesting that there might be some physical issues to deal with as well as the understandable rustiness.

And once the umpire had called “play”, she failed to establish any rhythm or confidence in front of her new coach Vlado Platenik, who himself had only arrived in time to fit in one practice session on the eve of the match.

In terms of both scoreline and ball-striking quality, this was Raducanu’s weakest performance since she left Melbourne in mid-January. It extended a wretched sequence of six defeats in seven matches, starting with a 6-1, 6-0 humbling at the hands of Iga Swiatek in the third round of the Australian Open.

We should note, however, that there were extenuating circumstances. Unsurprisingly, Raducanu had felt the need for a week’s complete break from tennis after what happened in Dubai. She only arrived in California last Thursday evening, and has been playing catch-up ever since.

It’s also worth mentioning the gusty, powerful wind. It sent tumbleweed rolling along the boulevards of nearby Palm Spring, and made it extremely difficult for Raducanu to locate the centre of her strings. If Uchijima dealt with the conditions better, that owes something to the heavy topspin she applies with her forehand, making the ball cut through the breeze.

“I didn’t have what happened in Dubai in my head at all today,” said Raducanu. “If anything, [I had] a bit of a lack of preparation on the tennis court, playing someone who played pretty good in these conditions, I mean, [it was] extremely awkward in the wind here. Today was just a bit of a curveball.”

Asked what she needed to work on after her latest chastening defeat, Raducanu replied: “Being more aggressive and … going forward into the court more. I think I could improve every area of my game, to be honest.”

As someone who spent her childhood on British indoor courts, and still does a high proportion of her training under the roof of the National Tennis Centre in south–west London, Raducanu has never liked playing in the wind.

Her serve was completely undermined, coughing up four double-faults and five breaks in all. Sitting at courtside, Platenik called out plenty of advice in the first set, encouraging Raducanu to use her legs and apply more spin to the ball. As the match wore on, though, he grew quieter.

A highly-rated coach who has worked with former top-tenners Dominika Cibulkova and Daria Kasatkina, Platenik now has a challenging task in front of him. He has always liked the idea of working with Raducanu, believing that she has enormous potential. After the recent slump in results, this would be the perfect time to prove it.

“We haven’t necessarily done that much yet, because he arrived very, very recently,” said Raducanu, when asked about their partnership. It has initially been set up as a two-and-a-half-month trial, starting here and running at least until the start of the French Open in late May.

As for their first practice session together, Raducanu added: “It was the day before the match, where we don’t necessarily want to change anything. So we haven’t actually started proper work. He’s very serious, he’s very professional, gets on with it. So yeah, we’ll see how it goes.”

Beginning this season in high spirits after the appointment of sought-after fitness trainer Yukata Nakamura, Raducanu had made a promising run at the Australian Open, chiselling out creditable wins against a pair of talented players in Ekaterina Alexandrova and Amanda Anisimova.

But then came the hammer blow of losing her coach Nick Cavaday, whom she had worked with as an emerging pre-teen at the Bromley Tennis Centre and trusted implicitly. Cavaday’s chronic health problems meant that he was forced to step off the tour, and she has lost all momentum since then.

“A lot has happened since Australia,” said Raducanu, who is likely to be ranked just inside the world’s top 60 as she goes into the next big American tournament in Miami in a fortnight’s time. “It’s good that I have someone [Platenik] who is very experienced here. We’ll see how the work goes and how we get on on and off the court and the methods and everything. I think I just need to keep trying to put one foot in front of the other and not look back too much.”

In this match, Raducanu scored an early break to move to 2-0 up, but then began to bleed unforced errors like a tennis haemophiliac. By the time she recovered any kind of poise, she was 6-3, 2-0 down, and Uchijima was playing with real self-assurance.

There was a moment in the second set where Raducanu forced three break points, thus threatening to regain parity at 3-3. But Uchijima saved all three through judicious use of that heavy forehand, and then powered on to claim the win in just 83 minutes.

Raducanu was the second Briton in succession to suffer defeat on the main court at Indian Wells. Immediately before her, Jacob Fearnley had found himself in the firing line against Joao Fonseca, the Brazilian teenager who is tipped to be tennis’s next big thing.

Here was a wildly undulating contest that matched the swirling, gusting nature of the desert wind. Play had to be paused a couple of times. The first because Fonseca’s towel had blown onto the court, the second when his hat was plucked off his head. On another occasion, he misread the swerving flight of the ball so badly that he could not decide whether to hit a forehand or backhand, and eventually watched it fly past him without offering a shot.

Never mind: Fonseca still had the goods when he needed them, powering through to victory by a 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 scoreline. As he stepped up to the microphone, the on-court MC made sure everyone knew they were looking at a future star. “We remember Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic making their debuts on this court,” said the announcer. No pressure then!

Both these men are at the start of their professional careers, and they stand next to each other on the rankings ladder at Nos 80 and 81. But there the comparisons end.

Fearnley is already 23 – having spent three years developing his game at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth – while Fonseca only turned 18 last August. His rapid ascent has been accelerated by a first ATP title in Rio last month.

Since the start of this century, only three men have opened their trophy accounts at a younger age: Kei Nishikori, Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz. They all went on to become grand-slam finalists.

Emma Raducanu has not confirmed what her next tournament will be, but she has earned direct entry into the Miami Open (March 16-30) and it seems likely she will play there.

It offers another chance to get her season back on track; after that defeat, she has only won one of her last seven matches.

British hopes at Indian Wells predominantly rest with Jack Draper, who will face super-talent Joao Fonseca in the second round.

That’s it from me, thanks for reading.

42.3 - Since the format's introduction in 2009, Emma Raducanu (42.3%, 11-15) now holds the lowest win rate among former Grand Slam winners at WTA-1000 events, now below Francesca Schiavone (42.4%, 42-57). Grapple.#TennisParadise | @BNPPARIBASOPEN @WTA @WTA_insider pic.twitter.com/R0T6T1EiIh

Uchijima raises her arms in victory and bows to the spectators after shaking Raducanu’s hand at the net. She adapted much better to the blustery conditions and constantly put her opponent’s serve under pressure. The 23-year-old will play Coco Gauff in round two.

The Briton walks quickly off court. The match did not go the way she wanted, littered with errors, but she will be happy to get through match incident-free, given the Dubai stalker ordeal, and get some more time and distance from that.

Frustration writ large in Raducanu’s body language. She slashes at a forehand, with impatient power, and hits it into the net for 0-15, and another booming Uchijima forehand takes her to within two points of victory.

A backhand return flies out and it’s three match points. Uchijima only needs one as Raducanu hits the ball high and long.

Uchijima is not missing and Raducanu is broken to love, losing her service game again with a double fault.

The tall Japanese player will serve for the match. She has proven very hard to pass and made far fewer errors.

Raducanu adjusts her body excellently to an awkward sliced forehand in the wind to bring up 30-30.

She pumps her fist and shouts “come on” as a flurry of forehands ends with Uchijima blinking first and sending the ball long. However, she does not make the same error again, saving break point down the line after working Raducanu around the court.

Two more break point chances for Raducanu go begging in this long game of deuces, saved by big serves and redoubtable forehands. 

Raducanu was making the running in the final point, but her opponent doggedly ran for balls, making her play that extra shot, and she dumped her forehand volley into the net.

That might well have been Raducanu’s big chance to get back into this match.

Some pounding first serves in there and a well-placed forehand down the line put Raducanu in the ascendancy.

However, Uchijima is not missing much and has terrific feel to slice a drop shot over for deuce. 

A few unforced errors then give the game to Raducanu. The Briton has had to work for every single service game, but at least she did not have to save a break point this time.

Raducanu follows up an unforced error with a fierce, fine forehand, finding the angle too. However, Uchijima delivers a clutch ace to go 40-30 and she sees out the game with another backhand sailing wide from her opponent.

A welcome hold there for Raducanu, but she has still lost eight of the last ten games. We should probably note that she does spend a lot of time practising indoors, and has never liked playing in the wind. 

On several occasions she has tried to slide the ball out wide to the Uchijima forehand and failed to account for the crosswind taking it even further. Credit to Uchijima for her level, though, which has stayed impressively steady in the circumstances. 

An important, gutsy hold for Raducanu. Her first serve accuracy helped to get her out of jail, saving a break point at 30-40 as her opponent netted. 

To win the game, she forced Uchijima out wide, moved her into the middle then dished up a fizzing forehand winner. More of that power and precision would not go amiss.

The wind is visibly blowing the ball at times. Uchijima has to correct her ball toss.

Raducanu cannot take advantage of a few Uchijima second serves to pressurise her. She gets it to 40-30 with a belting backhand, which the scrambling Japanese cannot return, then wrongfoots her with tenacious net play to bring up a rare deuce.

However, the better-ranked player is hard to hit past, timing her striking better and finding the right spots. She wins the game with a perfectly-placed forehand into the deuce court corner, moving tantalisingly away from Raducanu’s racket.

 

Over 20 unforced errors in that first set for Raducanu, despite a 79% first serve percentage. That rather sums it up.

No luck for Raducanu today yet either as an Uchijima forehand pings off the net cord and goes straight down next to it for 15-30. Her opponent is finding the corners far better with ground strokes and making the running, moving Raducanu around.

Raducanu saves one break point with a deft backhand passing shot which scrapes her opponent’s racket, but a double fault gifts the opening game of the second set to Moyuka Uchijima.

Uchijima held it together better in horrible conditions: that’s the story of the first set. Raducanu’s serve didn’t stand up to the wind at all, which was blowing an absolute hoolie when she hit a crucial double-fault at 3-4, 30-30. She came back from 15-40 to hold on her first attempt, and then was broken three successive times.

A delicious backhand passing shot from Raducanu down the line to bring up 0-30 as Uchijima rushed the net. She had to get that through the eye of the needle to win the point, accuracy-wise, as the Japanese player covered the rest of the court.

However, her opponent digs in, levels up the game and sends her sprinting across court, left and right, to bring up a set point. Raducanu blows out her cheeks in frustration.

She thumps a backhand too hard in the tricky conditions and the first set goes to Uchijima.

Playing with new balls, Raducanu points out an item that has blown onto court at 30-30. It does nothing to help her focus, as she subsequently delivers her first double fault of the match to offer another break point.

Uchijima exploits a short forehand from the Briton to win the game, delivering a stinging clean winner back. There have not been many of those.

Platenik wants more spin and more patience from Raducanu who lost four straight games in a welter of unforced errors. She managed to find the centre of her strings in the next game, whereupon Uchijima suddenly delivered four straight easy misses. 

It’s not a day for pretty tennis here. I feel like the end to the umpire’s left is windier.

Just like that, she stops the rot. Uchijima has lost her range and Raducanu breaks her to love. 

Some fine depth on her shots in that game though, putting her adversary under sustained pressure.

Best shot of the match so far to bring up 15-15. Uchijima shows her impressive work-rate, chasing every ball, but Raducanu moves her around and fires a double-handed backhand across court into the corner.

However, the Japanese seems to have found her rhythm, despite the Briton’s unerring first-serve rate. A clean forehand strike brings up a break point at 30-40 and Raducanu sprays a backhand wide.

That is four games in a row for Uchijima. Alarm bells.

Two poor games from Raducanu there, but it’s not easy to play in the blustery and inconsistent wind that’s whipping up tumbleweed around the Californian desert today. There’s a lot of late movement in the ball-flight and we’re not seeing much clean striking right now. 

The unforced error count is ticking up for Raducanu, hitting a few balls into the doubles tramline to help Uchijima take the lead for the first time in the match.

Conditions have not improved, with that desert wind blowing hard and ruffling the players’ clothes.

Another ace helps Raducanu to 15-30 and back into the game, but a few balls deposited lamely into the net bring up two break points for Uchijima.

She comes to the net sharply to save one, moving well to place a backhand volley into open court. However, Uchijima wallops a couple of forehands to send the Briton scrambling to reach the ball before breaking back with an unanswered one. We’re back on serve.

I’m sitting almost next to Vlado Platenik, Raducanu’s new coach. He’s keeping up a constant stream of advice and encouragement: “Use your legs. Stay aggressive. Don’t jump [on the forehand].” 

She is looking to him regularly, reflecting the fact that they know each other from her teenage years. “Very slow!” she said, in relation to the court speed.

Uchijima is struggling to get her first serve in, but she gets off the mark, helped by several wide balls from Raducanu. The Briton has a sizeable plaster on her left knee, by the way, wonder whether she had a tumble in training.

A resilient hold from Raducanu, saving two break points at 15-40. She banged down an ace, then moved her opponent around behind the baseline, forcing an error out of her.

That was all about first serve reliability too; I think she only failed to get one in. 

Shot of the game was a sliced forehand return from Uchijima to bring up 15-30. The Japanese player is already showing she can find some devilish angles. 

It is important to get into the groove early and get to grips with the windy conditions. Raducanu won the coin toss and chose to receive.

On this evidence, it was wise as the Briton breaks her opponents off the bat. After exchanging unforced errors into the net, Uchijima chalked up the match’s first double fault then dumped another into the net. Raducanu hit a powerful backhand volley to take the opener.

 

After a few minutes of warming up, here we go. The match is underway.

“The first US Open win in New York was pretty epic. Ever since, I’ve had an amazing fanbase in America and I love it here. Everything is so easy, relaxed, spacious.”

"It's my favourite tournament outside of the slams" 😅Emma Raducanu is loving being at Indian Wells 🌴 pic.twitter.com/BkJSyuhtdV

Raducanu, with white Nike visor on, keeps her head down as she strides on before putting her racket bag down at her seat.

They are playing on the primary showcourt at Indian Wells, framed by the Santa Rosa Mountains, though it is far from packed to its 16,100-capacity.

A win this afternoon would help Raducanu to turn the page a little quicker, given her sinister experience at her most recent tournament.

On Tuesday, Raducanu spoke to press about the “fixated” spectator who disrupted her match against Karolina Muchova at the Dubai Championships a fortnight ago.

“I was obviously very distraught,” said Raducanu, who has extra guards with her during this week’s event in California. “I saw him first game of the match, and I was like, ‘I don’t know how I’m gonna finish’.

“I was playing Karolina, who’s top 17 in the world or something. I’m like, ‘I literally need to just take a breather here,’ and then the first four games kind of ran away from me. I was not on the court, to be honest, and I’m not really sure how I regrouped.

“I think that was a pretty good effort for me to carry on playing in that match, in that scenario. I finished the match [which she lost by a narrow 7-6, 6-4 scoreline], and I even had chances in the first set, but, yeah, it was a very emotional time. And after the match, I did break down in tears, but not necessarily because I lost.

“It was more because there was just so much emotion in the last few weeks of events. I needed a week off to take a breather and come here and I feel a lot better.”

You can see a timeline of the ordeal and read more of her reflections here.

18-year-old tennis whizz kid Joao Fonseca sees off Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3, which means Emma Raducanu and Moyuka Uchijima will be on court within the next 20 minutes or so.

A reminder: Emma Raducanu will be on court after the conclusion of another first round match between Jacob Fearnley and Joao Fonseca, which is in its dying embers.

It has been a nip-tuck tussle. After a six-minute game, Fonseca broke the Briton and is a game away from victory. He leads 5-3. Fearnley may well rue a couple of double faults and a volley he should have put away.

Indian Wells may well be out in the desert, but the sun is not the problem this afternoon: it is only 19 degrees Celsius.

No, the wind is swirling around, blowing dust and sand around into the eyes of players and leading spectators to pull on a few layers if they are in the shade.

While Raducanu is favourite with the bookmakers, Moyuka Uchijima will pose a significant threat. She has just reached a career high no52 ranking and represented Japan at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. She won five ITF World Tour titles last year, helping her rise up the standfings.

Having come through qualifying, she knocked Jelena Ostapenko out in the first round at the Dubai Championships a fortnight ago before losing to Elena Rybakina. This one could be close.

It is little wonder Indian Wells is one of Raducanu’s favourite tournaments, given the relaxed atmosphere and pleasing, resort setting in the desert. 

She has performed well in the past at the BNP Paribas Open, not going out in the first round since the 2021 event. In the last two years, she has gone out to Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, respectively. No shame in that.

Meanwhile, after a mammoth fourth game of the second set, Great Britain’s Jacob Fearnley finally makes good his early break in the third set to go 3-1 up against Joao Fonseca. Raducanu and Uchijima are on after this match.

Fearnley has got quite the forehand.

There were happier times on court 48 hours ago for the 2021 US Open champion. She joined Ben Shelton to play at the Eisenhower Cup, a for-charity exhibition event on the eve of the tournament itself.

Taylor Fritz and Elena Rybakina won it.

Speaking about her stalker incident on Tuesday, Raducanu indicated she had received a couple of messages from fellow players.

The frightening thing is that the scary events in Dubai a fortnight ago are not particularly unusual. She is not alone.

“Each tennis player has been through something similar,” her compatriot Katie Boulter told reporters. “I’ve had people on site at WTA [tournaments] saying they were going to harm me. It can make you feel quite isolated and I don’t wish that upon anyone.”

WTA players regularly have to face misogny, toxic messages and threats on social media, sometimes linked to online betting. A very worrying state of affairs.

Raducanu will be on Court 1 after the end of the first round match match between her compatriot Jacob Fearnley and teenage hotshot Joao Fonseca.

That has just gone into a decider. The Brazilian wild card took the first 6-2, but Fearnley hit back 6-1. The man from Edinburgh has rocketed up the ATP rankings in the last twelve months and a good run here would put him on the cusp of the top 50.

Raducanu is also trialling a new coach, the Slovakian Vladimir Platenik, who she briefly worked with as a teenager. He has a sterling reputation, having helped Daria Kasatkina and Dominika Cibulkova into the top 25 in the world rankings.

If Platenik takes on the job, as many expect, he will become her seventh full-time appointment in three-and-a-half years. You can read more about his background here.

The Briton parted company with her previous coach Nick Cavaday in January, as he stepped down from his role amid health concerns.

Good evening and welcome to our live, minute-by-minute text coverage of the BNP Paribas Open first round tie between Emma Raducanu and Moyuka Uchijima.

Raducanu is looking to put the traumatic stalker incident behind her. She saw her stalker in the crowd at her most recent match in Dubai against Karolina Muchova, who had allegedly followed her around her last four countries and tournaments. It left her “distraught” and unsure of how she would be able to finish the match.

“I couldn’t see the ball through the tears, I could barely breathe,” she said on Tuesday, breaking her silence about the ordeal.

She halted the match at the end of the second game, and took refuge behind the umpire’s chair until the problematic individual – who is not a British citizen – was expelled from the stands. Her stalker was later released without charge by Dubai police, after signing a document that said he would stay away from her in the future.

Our own Simon Briggs heard her speak, candidly and at length about what happened and was struck by her poise amid an awful situation. He reckons it’s impossible to not feel sorry for her.

Raducanu took a breather back in the UK before flying off to California. Unsurprisingly, she has extra security with her at the tournament. “It’s amazing to feel protected, to feel safe,” she added.

The 22-year-old has only won one of her last six matches, but she has faced some high-class opposition and shown a marked improvement in her service reliability. The so-called “fifth slam”, Indian Wells is also a happy hunting ground, her favourite tournament of the year outside of the majors. However, she will have to deal with a wind whipping in from the desert on court.

World no 52 Uchijama sits six places ahead of Raducanu in the WTA rankings, but the Briton has won their only previous match on tour. Back in September 2022, she downed her 6-2, 6-4 in Seoul.

The winner tonight goes through to a box office second round match against Coco Gauff. They are expected on court no earlier than 9pm GMT.

LEXINGTON, Ky. – Kentucky men’s tennis will hit the road this weekend, playing back-to-back road matches for the first time this season. The Cats (9-4, 2-1 SEC) will open the weekend in Athens, taking on No. 50 Georgia (7-6, 1-2 SEC) at 2 p.m. ET on Friday, March 7 at the Dan Magill Tennis Complex. The squad will then travel up Interstate-75 for a rivalry matchup with No. 19 Tennessee (10-5, 1-3 SEC) at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday, March 9 at Barksdale Stadium in Knoxville.

Ranked No. 27 in the latest ITA Computer Rankings, Kentucky heads into the weekend after defeating South Carolina in a rematch of last year’s SEC Tournament championship. The Cats moved to 2-0 in SEC play and 3-3 overall after losing doubles, using singles wins on courts one, two, four, and six to move to 7-0 in home matches this season.

Four Wildcats are currently ranked in singles by the ITA, led by No. 53 Jaden Weekes. No. 70 Antoine Ghibaudo, No. 105 Charlelie Cosnet, and No. 121 Jack Loutit help round out the ranked players in one of the deepest singles lineups in the country.

The Cats are looking for their first win in Athens since 2012, when Kentucky earned the program’s second SEC regular season championship. Georgia enters Friday’s match with a 7-1 home record, featuring a win over No. 16 Tennessee and a lone loss to No. 5 Virginia. Three Bulldogs feature in the top 32 of the ITA Singles Rankings—No. 26 Thomas Paulsell, No. 27 Ryan Colby, and No. 32 Miguel Perez Pena. Paulsell and Colby check in at No. 14 in the ITA Doubles Rankings with No. 23 Freddy Blaydes and Niels Ratiu and No. 47 Miguel Perez Pena and Oscar Pinto Sansano also featuring as ranked pairings.

The matchup with the Vols will be the first top 25 opponent Kentucky has faced since falling to No. 14 Texas A&M at the ITA Indoor National Championships. The Cats are 2-2 this season against ranked opponents. Tennessee is led by Alex Kotzen who ranks No. 29 in singles and No. 11 in doubles alongside Alejandro Moreno. Shunsuke Mitsui also features at No. 25 in the singles rankings. The Cats defeated Tennessee in Lexington last season, clinching a perfect conference record and outright SEC Regular Season title with a 4-3 win over the Vols.

The Cats will return home to the Boone next week, hosting LSU on Thursday, March 13 at 5 p.m. ET and Vanderbilt at 1 p.m. ET on Saturday, March 15.

All home matches will be played at the Hilary J. Boone Tennis Complex, and admission is free to the public for all regular season contests. A live stream will be provided for all home matches on UKAthletics.com.

ORLANDO - A historic non-conference campaign will come to a close this weekend for the No. 13 UCF men’s tennis team as it plays host to a trio of programs at the USTA National Campus.

On Friday, the 2024 season-opening doubleheader will shift to Orlando, as UNC-Wilmington and Coastal Carolina will match up with the Knights (12-3) once again. The finale will be a fitting contest, with UCF set to host No. 36 South Florida on Sunday afternoon, marking the second meeting between the two teams this season and the 52nd match all-time.

LAST TIME OUT

Following the Knights’ inaugural ITA Indoor Championship in Waco, where they topped No. 4 Ohio State and faced three teams currently in the top 10, the squad returned home with a pair of dominating displays against UAB and Stetson.

A 4-0 record across six doubles matches made for an easy pathway in singles, with the Black and Gold dropping just one court over two days. Paul Colin jumped into the win column with a pair of triumphs on courts three and four, while his fellow Frenchman Liam Branger also grabbed two victories.

THE OPPONENTS

While UNCW (3-6) ride a five-match losing streak before its first trip to Orlando since 2017, the Seahawks have consistently held their own against some of the nation’s best. Two weeks ago, the squad took two singles courts off No. 1 Wake Forest, a feat also achieved against No. 56 Georgia Tech. 

The squad is led by Harold Huens, who holds a 4-2 record on court one, along with Sam Nicholson and Wayand Joseph on courts two and three. UNCW is led by Mait Dubois, embarking on his 18th season leading the program, claiming 10 conference championships in that span and 11 NCAA tournament appearances. 

A mixed bag of results for Coastal Carolina (4-4) precedes its Friday evening contest with the Knights, the second between the two program’s all-time. Christopher Norlin leads the Chanticleers with a 4-1 record on court one, while head coach Chris Powers continued to lead the squad in his 24th season in Conway and 21st as head coach.

A tight meeting with No. 36 South Florida (10-3) in Tampa to begin February action makes for an anticipated ranked matchup in Orlando. A seven-match road swing propelled the Bulls into the national rankings, with their lone defeat coming at the hands of No. 2 TCU in Fort Worth. Triumphs over Oregon, UC Santa Barbara and Florida Atlantic highlighted the trip.

Eighth-year head coach Ashley Fisher’s team has been dominant on the back two courts, compiling a 20-6 record, while also boasting an 11-1 record on court one. Hugo Car (8-1), Agustin Cuellar (8-0) and Stepan Mruzek (8-0) have underlined their success in singles.

ORLANDO - Big 12 tennis returns to the USTA National Campus this weekend as the No. 23 UCF women’s tennis team gears up to face No. 15 Baylor and No. 40 TCU.

The Knights (10-1) will strive to protect its flawless 6-0 record at home this season, starting with the Bears at 6 p.m. on Friday before they meet the Horned Frogs at noon on Sunday. UCF already boasts a 2-0 record in conference play this season.

LAST TIME OUT 

The Knights kicked off their 2025 Big 12 campaign on the road last Friday against No. 73 Kansas State in a hard-fought 4-1 victory at the Mike Goss Tennis Stadium. UCF snatched the doubles point with tiebreak triumphs on courts one and two against the Wildcats. Kansas State leveled the match on court four to open singles play, but the Black and Gold were quick to respond, winning straight sets for the rest of the match to deliver their first conference win of the season.

The Knights only stepped harder on the gas in their following match against conference favorites Oklahoma State. The nearly four-hour thriller saw UCF claim the vital doubles point across a pair of tiebreaks before a chaotic stalemate in singles play. Both sides took three courts each, with court two serving as a stage for Olivia Lincer to upset No. 88 Anastasiya Komar in a sensational series of play, 7-6 (10-8), 6-3. UCF now sits on a 10-1 record this season after the intense win at the Greenwood Tennis Center.

THE OPPONENTS

BAYLOR

The Bears will arrive in Orlando on a nine-game win streak, only allowing nine points in that stretch. Their only loss was handed to them by No.12 Texas in the second round of the ITF Kickoff Weekend after a court-two loss in the third set tiebreak ended the match, 3-4.

TCU

The Horned Frogs have shown a relentless form in their last three games, sweeping their opponents 4-0 in each match. Their 7-3 record includes a win against No. 45 Washington State that went down to the wire, 4-3. 

The last time the Knights faced TCU ended in a 4-3 victory away from home for UCF last year. Among the line up was Biolay and Lincer, who will hope to make another big impact against the Frogs this time around.

Tennis and fashion go hand in hand. That is especially true when the tennis world descends upon the Coachella Valley for the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.

The annual Masters 1000 tournament is one of the most glamorous events in the United States. Players and fans alike bring their best style to "Tennis Paradise," and lululemon is raising the bar this year.

First, lululemon ambassadors Frances Tiafoe and Leylah Fernandez will be competing in brand-new on-court kits that sport a bold shade of Starch Blue. 

Fernandez will rock the Power Pivot Tank Top ($58) and Perforated Narrow Waistband Tennis Skirt ($88) in Starch Blue on the court. Additionally, she will wear the Energy Bra in Starch Blue ($52).

Off the court, the Canadian tennis star will wear the Court Rival Track Jacket Perforated ($128) and Court Rival Wide-Leg Track Pant Regular ($128) in matching Starch Blue.

Meanwhile, Tiafoe will wear the Striped Mesh Tennis Short Sleeve ($88) and the Striped Mesh Tennis Short 7-inch Linerless ($78) in a matching Starch Blue color scheme. Additionally, he will wear the Built to Move Boxer ($38).

The American tennis star will customize his accessories (headband, sweatbands, socks) with either Starch Blue or Lavender Lux and White. Off the court, Tiafoe will wear the 2-in-1 Transformable Mesh Jacket and Mesh-Paneled Pant in Stoney/Tru Tangerine.

In addition to stealing the spotlight on the court, lululemon is bringing an immersive activation to the tournament, designed to celebrate athletes and engage tennis fans like never before. 

The festivities kicked off on Wednesday night and will continue throughout the tournament. Lululemon's Indian Wells Activation Highlights, on and off the court:

Kim Clijsters of Belgium and daughter Jada after her US Open triumph in 2010

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is to finance a joint initiative with the WTA for paid maternity leave of "up to 12 months" for players on the women's tennis circuit, it was announced on Thursday.

The PIF WTA Maternity Fund Program "will offer benefits to more than 320 eligible WTA players", the Women's Tennis Association said in a statement.

"WTA players will for the first time receive paid maternity leave up to 12 months, and have access to grants for fertility treatments to build families, as well as other benefits," it read.

Players will have to compete "in a certain number of WTA tournaments in a window of time" to benefit from the payments.

Two-time Grand Slam winner Victoria Azarenka, a WTA players' council representative, welcomed "the beginning of a meaningful shift in how we support women in tennis, making it easier for athletes to pursue both their careers and their aspirations of starting a family."

"Ensuring that programs like this exist has been a personal mission of mine," the Belarusian former world number one, who gave birth to a son in 2016, was quoted in the statement as saying. 

For WTA CEO Portia Archer "this initiative will provide the current and next generation of players the support and flexibility to explore family life, in whatever form they choose."

Several top players have taken a break from their careers to give birth, with varying degrees of impact on their subsequent careers. 

Belgian Kim Clijsters won three majors -- the US Open in 2009 and 2010 and the Australian Open in 2011 -- after giving birth to her daughter in 2008, following in the footsteps of Australians Margaret Court and Evonne Goolagong, who triumphed at Grand Slams as mothers.

However, 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams did not win any after the birth of her first child in September 2017, even though the American reached four finals at Wimbledon and the US Open.

Four-time Grand Slam winner and former world number one Naomi Osaka of Japan returned to the courts in early 2024 after giving birth to a daughter. 

Since then, the 27-year-old's best result has been a final at the modest Auckland tournament in January. 

Criticised by some tennis figures for its record on women's rights, Saudi Arabia has boosted its tennis investments in recent years, organising the season-ending WTA Finals for the first time in Riyadh last November.

That came months after the WTA entered into a multi-year partnership with the PIF sovereign wealth fund, with the kingdom again set to host the WTA Finals in 2025 and 2026.

Should Nike bring back the OG Hyperdunk?

This post contains references to products from one or more of our advertisers. We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.

One of the most iconic Nike Hyperdunk colorways of all time has returned… but on a tennis shoe. The Hyperdunk-inspired Vapor 12 Hypersmash just released in “United We Rise” makeup tributing the OG colorway Kobe Bryant made famous during the Beijing Olympics.

Those who watched the “Redeem Team” win gold need little overview, but to the uninitiated; the Hyperdunk was simply the shoe of the 2008 games. The Swoosh made Kobe Bryant the face of the model, and basically every Nike-sponsored country wore it throughout the Olympics. Designed by Eric Avar, it was the first shoe to feature Flywire tech and Lunarlon cushioning, thus creating a blueprint for Nike Basketball models for years to come.

Following a 2016 retro, the “United We Rise” colorway is stepping back into the spotlight through a Hyperdunk-inspired tennis model. The Vapor 12 Hypersmash tributes the iconic hoops shoe with Flywire cables and a similar TPU heel badge, taken with patriotic red, white, and blue in all the right places. Many hoopers have been clamoring for a Hyperdunk retro run, but this is probably the closest we’re getting (for now).

The Vapor 12 Hypersmash “United We Rise” is available now via the Nike website, commanding a $180 retail price. See official images below if you’re moved to cop some late 2000s nostalgia.

Greg Garber


INDIAN WELLS -- After the US Open, the BNP Paribas Open is probably the most sought-after American tennis title for Americans.

You might think a homegrown woman would have found a way to win here in the desert sometime over the past couple of decades. If so, you’d think wrong. It’s been 24 years since Serena Williams wrested the title from Kim Clijsters in a three-set final.

Before this year’s tournament, Madison Keys seemed to sense a change in the wind.

“I think it’s probably been a little while since there has been so many American women doing as well as they are,” Keys said. “I think not only are there the names that everyone obviously knows and are a little bit more established, but there’s also a ton of up-and-comers that are doing really, really well.

“I would not be surprised if you saw some really great results from the U.S. women.”

Keys, of course, won the season’s first Grand Slam singles title in Melbourne -- and, at the age of nearly 30, the first of her career. That moved Keys into the Top 5 in the PIF WTA Rankings, joining compatriots Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula in that rare air. It’s the first time three Americans have been ranked among the Top 5 since 2003, when Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Jennifer Capriati were dominating.

“I think it’s just a really great group of women that I’ve grown up with that have continued to encourage and push and support each other,” Keys said. “When we see each other do well, we’re not only extremely excited for them, but with the support and kind of we’re all being cheerleaders with each other. I think it just helps push all of us to continue to have some really good success.”

It goes well beyond the very top, too. Amanda Anisimova won her first WTA Tour 1000 title in Dubai, vaulting into the Top 20 and just last week Pegula was the winner in Austin and Emma Navarro was crowned in Merida, Mexico. Including the United Cup -- where Gauff went 5-0 and led US to the team victory -- U.S. players have won seven of 14 titles contested so far.

Gauff’s eyes widened visibly when she heard that last statistic. She believes it’s been a collective, collaborative effort -- that extends to the men’s side, too. Taylor Fritz, Tommy Paul and Ben Shelton are all inside the Top 15, and there are eight American men among the Top 50.

“We’re all pushing each other to do better,” Gauff told reporters. “Now the men have strong depth, and I think that it just inspires us to do more. You see one win a tournament and you also want to do that.”

Fritz, the No. 4-ranked player on the ATP Tour, went even further.

“I think it’s great that we are kind of building the tennis, we can help build the tennis culture in the U.S.,” he said. “I think that’s something that I wanted to contribute to help my whole career. I think the women have been doing an incredible job of that for a long, long time, and I think the guys kind of need to step it up a little bit.”

Sparking the belief

These days, Pam Shriver is an astute broadcaster for ESPN’s Grand Slam coverage, a mother of three and, here at Indian Wells, the coach of No. 20-ranked Donna Vekic. She’s also one of most decorated U.S. players in history, winning 133 singles and doubles titles combined on the WTA Tour.

“I think it’s unusual that we’ve had a numbers gap on the women’s side,” Shriver said, standing by the players’ soccer pitch. “We always had great names at the top -- Venus and Serena. But this feels more conjoined, more momentum grabbing.”

Shriver pointed to three events that, in her mind, led to this American resurgence that, in her words, “sparked the belief.” The first came at the 2017 US Open, when a 16-year-old Anisimova was a 6-0, 6-2 winner in the junior final over 13-year-old Gauff, the youngest girls’ singles finalist in tournament history.

“Whenever you have two juniors reach the finals of a Grand Slam,” Shriver said, “that’s a big deal.”

Six years later, Gauff was the 2023 US Open champion, defeating Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set final. That was a signal, Shriver said, to her fellow Americans -- even those younger than her -- of what was possible.

“I don’t consider myself a mentor or anything,” the 20-year-old Gauff said. “I’m just me. I’m just out here vibing, trying to do my best. But it is cool.”

The third was Pegula’s run to the final of last year’s US Open. She had turned 30 in February and her Grand Slam resume showed six quarterfinals reached since 2021 -- but never further. This time, she surprised Iga Swiatek in the quarters and Karolina Muchova in the semifinals before losing in the final to Sabalenka.

“Everyone can relate to getting stuck -- in the rankings, at a certain level of big tournaments,” Shriver said. “That was a really good thing for the Americans to see Pegula break through at her home Slam. Another example of the power of perseverance.

“It shows in the diversity of this group.”

Not out of their depth

Indeed, beyond the quality of play among the American women, there is an undeniable quantity as well. Six are ranked among the Top 20 and 17 in the Top 100, four more than the next-best nation.

While Gauff, Pegula and Keys are the marquee names, there are a lot of different moving, grooving parts not far behind. 

No. 8-ranked Navarro hurtled into the Top 10 only three years after winning the NCAA Division 1 singles title as a freshman at the University of Virginia. No. 14 Danielle Collins had the season of her career in 2024 -- at the age of 30. No. 41 Ashlyn Krueger is only 20 but has been playing professionally for nearly five years.

Taylor Townsend is a Top 100 singles player -- and a mother -- but the 28-year-old, along with Katerina Siniakova, is also part of the World No. 1 doubles team. They won Wimbledon last year and have already taken titles at the Australian Open and in Dubai.

Another testament to America’s depth is the fact that No. 228 Whitney Osuigwe won both her qualifying matches. It’s her first WTA main draw in nearly four years -- she nearly made the Top 100 as a teenager but she’s still only 22.

So … why now?

“That’s a great question,” Pegula said on Wednesday. “I don’t really know exactly why now, but I just think that our depth is pretty incredible. I think we’re just seeing more Americans maybe in the Top 10, obviously Top 20, for sure. 

“Having Coco and Maddie win Slams over the last couple of years as Americans is huge for women’s tennis or for women’s tennis in America. I don’t know if maybe that’s kind of inspiring to maybe some of the lower-ranked Americans to do really well or the younger generation.”

Gauff, for one, is ready to end America’s 0-for streak at Indian Wells.

“I don’t remember the last time an American woman has won this tournament,” Gauff said in her press conference.

Serena Williams in 2001, she was told.

“OK, so before I was born,” Gauff acknowledged. “Every year they love to remind us of that stat when we compete. We’re all like, ‘Who’s it going to be?’ I was in the semis last year, so I was hoping it would be me. Hopefully this year we can, and if it’s not me I hopefully it's an American.”

A win by an American here at the BNP Paribas Open, Pegula believes, could help grow the game in a nation whose population exceeds 325 million.

“To get an American to win it I think would only grow that exposure of tennis in the U.S. which would be really, really cool,” Pegula said. “Even for me, if I didn’t watch that much, I’d want to go watch someone that's from the same country, and that's an American.

“I think that goes a long way, especially in a country where we have so many other dominant sports. The fact that we have that depth I think is going to help tennis fans in the U.S. a lot to kind of get behind the sport and find their American to root for, because there is definitely a lot of us.”

Victoria Azarenka described the WTA's maternity fund as "a meaningful shift in how we support women in tennis"

Female tennis players will receive paid maternity leave on the WTA Tour for the first time.

More than 320 players will be eligible for up to 12 months paid leave through a new maternity fund introduced by governing body, the Women's Tennis Association.

Everyone will receive the same amount, which has not been disclosed, irrespective of their ranking. And players will not have to repay the money if they later choose not to return to the sport.

Grants will also be made available for fertility treatment.

The maternity programme will be fully funded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is a global partner of the WTA Tour.  

Petra Kvitova and Belinda Bencic have both made their comeback from maternity leave in recent months.

Former world number one Victoria Azarenka, who gave birth to son Leo in 2016, told the BBC last year that it would be a "huge win for women in general" if the WTA was to introduce maternity pay.

Four-time major champion Naomi Osaka also spoke in support of maternity pay, saying it would be "life-changing".

"It's actually quite novel in a lot of ways," the WTA chief executive Portia Archer told BBC Sport.

"In women's professional sports, particularly sports where athletes are self-employed, this has never been something that has been provided.

"I think it will provide opportunities for our athletes to have [some] agency around when and how they choose to start or continue to build their families.

"It's available to players regardless of their ranking. Those who earn less will find this benefit particularly valuable."

Players will have to compete in a minimum of eight WTA events in the previous 12 months (or a minimum of 24 in the previous 36 months) to be eligible.

Returning to the tour after maternity leave has become easier since the WTA changed the rules before the 2019 season.

New mothers are now be able to use their previous ranking to enter 12 tournaments over a three-year period from the birth of their child.

Since 2019, returning mothers with a special ranking high enough to be seeded have also had a guarantee they will not face a seeded player in the opening round of their first eight tournaments.

A seeding allows tournaments to ensure the world's best players do not meet in the early stages of competitions and instead play lower-ranked players in the opening rounds.

The WTA says 50 players have benefitted from the special ranking since it was introduced six years ago.

The WTA also offers access to a health team and taskforce, which includes physical assessments, mental health support and guidance on a staged return to play for new mothers and pregnant players.

            Two-time grand slam champion Victoria Azarenka has told CNN Sport that a landmark maternity fund created for professional women’s tennis players is a game-changing moment for the sport.
    


            The first-of-its-kind initiative provides eligible WTA players with the financial support and comprehensive resources to start or expand their families, according to the tennis body.
    


            Fully funded by the Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), players will receive paid maternity and parental support for the first time, as well as grants for egg and embryo freezing and IVF treatment.
    


            “It’s a very global conversation, much bigger than just sport,” says Azarenka, a WTA players’ council representative who has been at the forefront of the discussion.
    


            “It’s such an important topic in all walks of life, people have families, and I think that it’s a very important conversation to continue to bring to the table.”
    


            The initiative has personal meaning for the former world No. 1.
    


            Having lifted back-to-back Australian Open titles in 2012 and 2013, Azarenka gave birth to son Leo in December 2016 but says there was no maternity leave policy in place at the time. That led her to question her career in the game – and she wasn’t the only one.
    


Serena Williams also experienced the limitations of the system for returning mothers following the birth of her daughter, Olympia, in September 2017.
    


            “When I became pregnant with my son, it was a conversation about: am I going to be coming back to the tour or not?” Azarenka recalls. “I had doubts right away. I was also scared … I was top five in the world at the time.
    


            “It was an interesting way for me to find out that we didn’t really have any rules even in our organization to address maternity leave.”
    


            It wasn’t until 2019 that the WTA gave increased protection for returning mothers on the tour, specifically with a change in the protective ranking system.
    


            The rule change has allowed returning players to compete in a certain number of tournaments based on the ranking they held before going on maternity leave for a period of up to three years.
    


            According to the WTA, 50 players have already benefited since its introduction.
    


            “I feel like me and Serena broke the stereotype that in tennis it’s going to be possible and that’s what we’re so proud to do,” Azarenka explains.
    


            “I wanted to make sure that all of our other athletes feel the same way as well as that. Not everybody has the financial opportunity to stop playing and not have any income so that was a very big project of mine.
    


            “I really believe that helping other people, helping our sport grow is something that gives me a lot of pleasure, a lot of pride, probably more than my own winnings (and) I do believe this is a very life-changing program.”
    


            The launch of the fund is the latest significant move following the multi-year partnership signed by the WTA with PIF in May 2024.
    


            This was part of Saudi Arabia’s wider plan to invest in tennis, which has been the subject of criticism from some of the sport’s leading figures. Legendary players Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, for instance, have described hosting the WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia as a “step backward,” expressing concerns about the kingdom’s record on women’s rights, human rights and LGBTQ rights.
    


            Despite such criticism, Azarenka is confident that the intentions behind the initiative are the right ones.
    


            “I’ve personally not been there, so I cannot judge without seeing with my own eyes,” the 35-year-old says. “I am very appreciative that they saw the vision (and) I think it’s a big testament that … they were the ones who really wanted to support that and want to continue to grow that.”

            And it’s not just existing moms on tour that she believes could stand to benefit from the fund: A whole new generation of players will be empowered to not have to choose between peak performance and future family planning.
    


            “We have full (and) non-full members covered, which is very unprecedented in sports,” she says.
    


            “A lot of players (will) see these opportunities like, ‘Hey, maybe we actually can prolong our careers, and we can have families,’ and it’s almost like a two-phase way you can look at your career: before family and then you have family and you continue your career.”
    


            Azarenka sees the fund as “just the beginning” for what she hopes will open up even more benefits, opportunities and conversations in other areas of the women’s game, including childcare and healthcare services.
    


            “It’s important to create just a little bit of an ecosystem that is part of the healthcare, part of financial support, part of childcare services, so how we can navigate that we need,” she says.
    


            “(We also need) people who are willing to look for outside of the boxes for the opportunities and to create those programs.”
    


            Indeed, a growing number of returning champion moms are creating that very path for the new generation to follow suit.
    


            Former Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki and two-time grand slam winner Naomi Osaka have returned to the fold alongside Azarenka, while Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina and Switzerland’s Belinda Bencic have recorded notable wins as mothers on the WTA Tour.
    


            And while Belgium’s Kim Clijsters remains the only player to have won a grand slam singles title as a mother – the 2011 Australian Open – Azarenka hopes it’s not too long before that changes.
    


            Serena Williams notably reached four grand slams singles finals but on each occasion narrowly missed out on capturing a record-equaling 24th major, while Azarenka herself reached the US Open final in 2020.
    


            “I’m extremely happy for all the young moms, new moms when they come out and succeed and just go out there and do their thing and represent our sport on such a global stage,” Azarenka says, smiling.
    


            “There’s probably going to be more grand slam champions that are moms and I think that is amazing. I hope, of course, it’s going be me as a competitor. We had Serena be also very close to that. I was very close to that achievement.
    


            “We’re still competitors, we want to make that happen, (and) I think it’s going be an incredible opportunity to see that happen.”

The Women’s Tennis Association has become the first international sports body to introduce up to 12 months of paid maternity leave for players, in what it has hailed as a defining moment for women’s sport.

Under the new policy, funded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, players will also get access to grants for fertility treatments, including egg freezing and IVF.

The WTA said that at least 320 of the world’s top players would be entitled to access the fund, which also includes two months of paid leave to anyone who becomes a parent via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption.

The two-times grand slam winner Victoria Azarenka, who is a representative on the WTA players’ council, told the Guardian that the response from her colleagues to the new WTA PIF Maternity Fund programme had been “incredible”.

“The players are extremely excited and some were really surprised that we are creating this,” she said. “The feedback from players has actually been incredible. And it is incredibly motivating that we can make the difference. It’s also important to point out this was a player-led programme and we really pushed very hard to make it happen.”

The 35-year-old – who has a son, Leo, born in 2016 – said it had been a long battle to set up a programme that she hoped would be a model for other sports, as well as sparking global conversations.

“I absolutely believed this day would come,” she added. “It took a lot of work, even if I thought in the beginning it wouldn’t take this long. I was getting quite impatient, so I am very proud that we are here. I strongly feel this is just the beginning.

“This type of programme will also open global conversations about how important family planning, maternity leave, parental leave is. Because one way or another, almost everyone gets to experience this, if they wish to.”

To receive assistance, players will need to have competed in a minimum of eight WTA tournaments, including grand slams, in the previous 12 months, at least four of which must be at WTA 250 level or above.

Players who have played a minimum of 24 WTA tournaments on the WTA Tour over the previous 36 months, at least 12 of which must be at WTA 250 level or above, will also be entitled to help.

The same amount will be paid to each player regardless of ranking, with the exact sum dependent on whether they fit the first or second criteria.

It is still relatively rare for active players on the WTA tour to have children, although there are several currently in the world’s top 100, including Azarenka, Naomi Osaka, Elina Svitolina, Caroline Wozniacki, Belinda Bencic and Taylor Townsend.

The WTA chief executive, Portia Archer, said the programme would give more players the flexibility to choose when they wanted to start their family life.

“They can do so at a time of their choosing now, and they have some agency, because they have the financial resources, benefits, flexibility and the support to be able to make that decision,” she said. “It is important for players across the ranking profile, but we do think that it will have great impact and be quite transformational for players who are not earning at the highest levels in the sport.”

Archer also said it was another example of the WTA, which was founded by Billie Jean King in 1973, leading the way when it comes to women’s sport.

“This is really is a groundbreaking initiative that hasn’t been made available in women’s sports for players and athletes who are self-employed – so-called independent contractors,” she said. “And this comprehensive set of benefits for paid maternity leave, paid parental leave, grants for fertility preservation also has never been made available.”

“So we’re excited at the WTA to launch this. We have been in the business of trailblazing and being the first many times. And we’re excited to be in this position again.”

Archer also denied suggestions that partnering with the investment arm of the Saudi government could send mixed messages, given that human rights groups such as Amnesty International report that women continue to face discrimination in law and in practice.

“From the very beginning, PIF has been very supportive of our ambition to create this comprehensive programme,” she said. “They’ve been very eager to partner and collaborate with us. They are funding the programme, which is a high priority for our players. And I think it will be a great opportunity for the WTA to leverage the power of sport to provide empowerment and to progress women.”

Alanoud Althonayan, head of events and sponsorships at PIF, echoed Archer’s sentiments. “PIF partnerships are designed to elevate every level of sport and leave a legacy of transformative impact on a global scale,” she said. “Our partnership with WTA is built on a shared ambition, aligned with PIF’s vision, purpose and values.”

Second up in Stadium 1 is another match between two players who are close in ranking—Uchijima is 52, Raducanu 55. But those numbers don’t reveal much about the direction these two women are taking. Raducanu, the younger of the two at 22, had a meteoric rise to Grand Slam fame four years ago in New York, but has been treading injury-plagued waters ever since. Uchijima, while she is older at 23, appears to be coming into her own in 2025. She nearly beat Mirra Andreeva at the Australian Open, she upset Jelena Ostapenko in Dubai, and her ranking of 52 is a career high.Still, Raducanu won their only meeting, three years ago, and she played some credible tennis in Dubai, beating Maria Sakkari and losing a close two-setter to Karolina Muchova. Raducanu likes a stage; if she wins this match, she’ll get a big one against Coco Gauff. Winner: Raducanu—Steve Tignor👉 Click here for more news on the BNP Paribas Open.

Marketa Vondrousova has announced she will take a prolonged break from professional tennis to rehabilitate a shoulder injury. The 2023 Wimbledon champion has struggled with injury since her remarkable triumph at SW19 and missed both the Paris Olympics and US Open last year with shoulder pain. She returned to the WTA Tour for the Adelaide International tournament in January but then retired midway through her second-round match.

The 25-year-old duly withdrew from the Australian Open before playing in Abu Dhabi the following month. However, she’s now taken to social media to tell fans that her comeback has been cut short. “Stepping out of the court again. I am still struggling with shoulder injury,” she wrote on Instagram. “Although it's not easy, I now have a few months of intensive training and rehabilitation to get my arm back together.

“Patience and time are my priorities right now, but I believe it will all be worth it. So, hopefully back on the court soon. Thank you everyone for your support.”

Vondrousova stunned the world at Wimbledon when she became the first unseeded woman to win the singles title. She prevailed 6-4 6-4 against sixth seed Ons Jabeur in what was considered a huge tournament upset.

She previously underlined her potential as a teenager, though, reaching the French Open final in 2019. There, she won just four games against Ashleigh Barty but ended the event widely touted as a future star.



However, it was after a first-round defeat in her title defence in London last summer that her shoulder problems seemingly began. Her layoffs have seen her drop down to 29th in the world, having previously reached a career-high of No.6.

The Czech star now seems almost certain to miss the French Open in May and will be a major doubt for Wimbledon. The grasscourt tournament gets underway on June 30.

Jessica Pegula has been part of a strong start to the 2025 season for American players on the WTA Tour.

Pegula won the ATX Open title last week, after beating compatriot McCartney Kessler in the final.

This was a monumental moment for women’s tennis, with Pegula and Kessler making history after achieving something that had not been done in nearly eight years.

Pegula was not the only American to win a title last week, with Emma Navarro making history of her own in Merida after a dominant run to her second WTA trophy.

This continues on from a very positive start to the season for American women, headlined by Madison Keys’ Australian Open triumph. 

American women have dominated the 2025 WTA season so far, winning half of the available titles.

This includes Amanda Anisimova winning the Qatar Open in the biggest triumph of her career so far.

All of this success means that American women have made WTA ranking history already this year, and have a total of 17 women inside the top 100.

Pegula previously praised American tennis, and has now elaborated on this in her pre-tournament press conference at Indian Wells when asked why she thinks it is so strong at the moment.

The world number four also referenced both Keys and Coco Gauff winning Grand Slam titles as a potential inspiration for lower ranked American players.

“I mean, that’s a great question,” said Pegula. “I don’t really know exactly why now, but I just think that our depth is pretty incredible. I think it has been, though, honestly, for a few years now. I think we’re just seeing more Americans maybe in the top 10, obviously top 20, for sure. That’s definitely a big change.

“You know, having Coco and Maddie win Slams over the last couple of years as Americans is huge for women’s tennis or for women’s tennis in America. I don’t know if maybe that’s kind of inspiring to maybe some of the lower-ranked Americans to do really well or the younger generation.

“That’s just been really incredible. I’m happy to just kind of be a part of that group, to be a part of that group for the last couple years now, it’s been really cool. It’s nice to see, you know, we don’t have to hold the fort down by ourselves. We have a lot of help, which is nice.”

Despite American women enjoying success on the WTA Tour at the moment, they have not won the title at Indian Wells since 2001.

Serena Williams beat Kim Clijsters at Indian Wells that year, and at the time American women had won eight of the last 12 titles at the WTA 1000 tournament.

However, since then there have only been two different American finalists, with Williams the last player to reach the Indian Wells final before losing to Victoria Azarenka in 2016.

Pegula, Gauff and Keys can end this drought in 2025, but could face tricky runs if they are to do so.

After struggling for form during the Middle Eastern swing, Gauff could play a fellow Grand Slam champion in her first match at Indian Wells.

Further down the line, Gauff and Keys could go head-to-head if both players reach the quarter-finals.

While in the other half of the draw, Pegula will play Magda Linette, who beat an American that Ons Jabeur has praised.

World No.2 Iga Swiatek was reluctant to weigh in on the issue of gambling in tennis when put on the spot at Indian Wells. The Polish star is currently preparing for her last-64 clash with Caroline Garcia on Friday, having been handed a bye in the first round. Betting in professional sports is a growing phenomenon, with fans now able to place wagers online during live action.

However, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) currently bans professional tennis players from gambling on matches. This regulation includes conspiring to bet on outcomes or soliciting others to do so. Last year, six players were issued varying suspensions for their links to a match-fixing syndicate in Belgium. Speaking in her press conference at Indian Wells, Swiatek replied hesitantly when asked if the concept of gambling was good or bad for her sport, given the revenue it generated.

“Oh, I don't think I'm ready to answer that question because I never really thought about that much, because I always thought that this is how it is,” she said. “There's no point to think if it's good or bad, because it's always going to be there since it's big business.”

Concerns have been raised over disgruntled punters targeting players with online abuse after accusing them of costing them betting windfalls. And Swiatek, who in November was handed a one-month ban for producing a positive test for a banned substance, conceded there was little the authorities could do to prevent internet trolling.

“For sure, we as players feel the negative comments and hate, because people are sometimes losing money because we lose or because we win,” she added. So, this is what impacts us. For sure, I feel like it's not positive and not good at all.

“But, you know, hate is going to be out there on the Internet anyway. People put out on the Internet whatever they want, because it's easy. But the whole concept of gambling and business, you know, behind it, I'm not really that well-oriented to really say. Sorry.”

Madison Keys was also pressed on the issue this week. Keys has previously been vocal about the plagues of online abuse in tennis and, like Swiatek, thinks the issue is too complex to just label a positive or negative.

“I don't think it's a black-and-white answer, just because I think it depends on who you're asking,” she said. “At the end of the day a lot of the tournaments make a lot of money from the partnerships that they have with betting companies. That's what keeps us having jobs.”

Ingrid Michaelson is sharing a story about an interaction she had with Taylor Swift about five years ago.

Earlier this week, the 45-year-old singer-songwriter opened up about the time she ran into the pop superstar while attending an awards show in 2019. Michaelson initially claimed in the video that it was the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) that year, but after a little sleuthing, the picture "The Way I Am" artist shared in her TikTok "storytime" was taken at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards.

"I was on the red carpet, like feeling myself," she began, mimicking the paparazzi and photographers calling out for her attention. "Ingrid! Ingrid! Ingrid!"

"Then all of the sudden, it was like they were ushering me off [the carpet]...and I realized that Taylor Swift was coming. I look to my right, and there she is."

Michaelson recalled how the "I Can Do It With a Broken Heart" songstress moved down the carpet, posing for countless photos before taking cover between some panels and her bodyguards.

The "Keep Breathing" singer went on, remembering thinking to herself, "'Well I know her, we've hung out a couple of times,'" Before actually making moves to get near the artist.

"So I went between the panels, literally running after this woman. And I go, 'Taylor! Taylor!' and of course she doesn't turn around, because why would she turn around hearing a random woman screaming her name."

But that's not what was "so pathetic," according to the artist, that came later when she proceeded to yell at the top of her lungs: "Taylor! It's Ingrid!"

Luckily, that was enough to divert any amount of embarrassment Michaelson would have otherwise had to shake off, as it did grab Swift's attention.

"She did turn around and remembered me," Michaelson revealed.

"We took a picture," she added with a smile.

Michaelson's experience isn't oh-so unique, as several other Hollywood stars and the lucky few average Joes who've interacted with the pop star have all said pretty much the same thing: She's a delight!

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and author of 'My Mother and I,' discusses how the Duchess of Sussex isn't going to be welcomed back across the pond anytime soon following her royal exit.

While Meghan Markle has been promoting her new Netflix show, "With Love, Meghan," it appears that some viewers have no love for her.

On Thursday, Markle appeared on Drew Barrymore's talk show to discuss the lifestyle series, and to some, the interview wasn't easy to watch.

Towards the beginning of Markle's segment, Barrymore discussed her interview style, which has been described as very touchy: "I like to connect… I'm such a warm person, and I love affection."

Drew Barrymore admitted that she likes "to connect" with people during her interview with Meghan Markle. ("The Drew Barrymore Show"/CBS)

Markle, who didn't appear bothered by Barrymore's consistent closeness during the interview, responded, "I just think it's really important, we've missed this human connection certainly after the pandemic and everything else, and we crave that… to really be able to hold and touch and embrace someone." 

The interview was met with some harsh criticism. Several viewers weighed in on social media, with many of them slamming Markle, Barrymore or both for what some called a "fake" appearance.

"Drew Barrymore is just as false as Meghan," one user wrote on X. "All that fake hugging of complete strangers is just so false."

"Barrymore also out-hugged Markle. Doesn't Drew know that is supposed to be Meghan's thing!?" another X user commented.

One viewer wrote, "Meghan Markle has finally met her match. Drew is even more clingier (and cringier imo) than her."

Another post read, "Not sure who’s more insufferable, Meghan Markle or Drew. It’s a surprise that anyone can suffer through such inane garbage. And given all the crap Meghan Markle has received over her show for being so fake, Drew Barrymore was the worst option for a talk show."

"I am so glad that Drew had her on the show," another comment read. "Genuine authenticity and a good heart will always prevail. Meghan's energy and positive attitude are infectious!"

One viewer commented, "the fact that she continues to be joyful and happy in the face of all the hate is so encouraging. good on you meghan! keep going." 

"I truly believe that the hate Meghan receives comes from jealousy. She is so classy, elegant and talented," another wrote. "She is married to a prince and has two beautiful children. Her style and success are why I think people are ugly to her. I wish her the very best!"

Fox News Digital reached out to representatives for Barrymore and Markle for comment.

On Barrymore's show, Markle also spoke about her relationship with Prince Harry, whom Barrymore said she "loved so much," despite never having met him.

"He's very lovable," Markle said with a smile. "He's easy to love."

Barrymore spoke highly of Harry before saying, "I got to meet his mom when I was 7 years old," which Markle said she "didn't know." Barrymore told Markle that she had a photo with her upstairs that she wanted to share with her — which she did later in the show — of her presenting Princess Diana with an "E.T." doll.

"It was one of the most special moments of my life," Barrymore told her. "I loved her so much, and I think the world of him, and he found you."

Markle responded, "Life is full of surprises. I did not expect to meet H [her nickname for Harry], and for this to be our love story, and I'm very lucky I am married to the funniest, sweetest, most charming… he's an amazing father. I count my blessings because I have him, and also because I have a partner who is so supportive of me."

Markle also shared that she and Harry "make it a point to date each other," saying that they have lunch together every day amid various business meetings.

"It's felt amazing, honestly, it's just felt so amazing and fun, just showing up," Markle said, adding that when she travels, she brings a children's book with her so that Harry or whoever is caring for their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, can show them a video of her reading to them.

"You find ways to show up for each other, and if that's the one thing that I can convey through the show, or through As Ever as a brand, I want people to know you can show up for each other, because you know how good it feels when someone shows up for you."

Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's legal teams battled over a proposed protective order during a 90-minute hearing Thursday.

The two parties have been arguing about how much protection and confidentiality is necessary in the case. Lively sued Baldoni in December for sexual harassment. However, Baldoni insisted in his lawsuit that Lively "falsely" accused him in an attempt to repair her reputation after the fallout around the movie's press tour after she took control of the film.

Lively's lawyers argued for an "attorney's eyes only" (AEO) designation for evidence in the case, seemingly pushing for text messages with "high-profile individuals" to be kept hidden from the public.

"There is a significant chance of irreparable harm if marginal conversations with high-profile individuals with no relevance to the case were to fall into wrong hands," Lively's lawyer, Meryl Conant Governski, argued during the hearing, insinuating a chance of texts leaking.

Governski claimed there are "100 million reasons" Baldoni's side may leak text messages due to public relations value.

Lively's team focused on examples of information that should be kept confidential, including security measures taken to protect the actress, her husband and their children. The lawyers argued there is no reason for anybody to know about the specific security measures the family has in place.

Justin Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said it was offensive to suggest the team would disregard a protective order from the court. The lawyer pushed back against the "attorneys' eyes only" designation, stating his concern Lively's legal team was shifting the burden to the defense.

Freedman also confirmed there is no intention to disclose any information regarding Lively's medical and psychological records.

Judge Lewis Liman noted if something relevant to the case was discussed, the defense should be able to discuss and use it. However, the judge did not make a decision on which protective order would be put in place during Thursday's hearing.

Lively and others who have spoken out in support of the actress have received "violent" messages, leading the "Gossip Girl" star to request "heightened" protections, according to a letter filed in court Feb. 20 and obtained by Fox News Digital.

"As detailed in Ms. Lively’s Amended Complaint, Ms. Lively, her family, other members of the cast, various fact witnesses, and individuals that have spoken out publicly in support of Ms. Lively have received violent, profane, sexist, and threatening communications," the filing said.

Baldoni's legal team filed a response to Lively's request for "heightened protections" and privacy in court ahead of Thursday's hearing.

"Given how actively the Lively Parties have publicized and litigated Ms. Lively’s claims in the media, we are surprised to now learn how vehemently she wants to prevent the public from accessing material and relevant evidence," the response says.

Baldoni's team emphasized its approval of the court's model protective order but noted having an "attorneys' eyes only" designation for discovery was "not warranted."

"Although the Lively Parties contend that the ability to designate information AEO is appropriate because the ‘litigation involves claims of sexual harassment in the workplace,’ … Ms. Lively has already publicized the alleged details of the so-called ‘harassment’ in her Amended Complaint spanning 138 pages and almost 500 paragraphs."

A lawyer for actor Blake Lively wants a federal judge to prevent defendants including “It Ends With Us” costar Justin Baldoni from getting personal or intimate information about her or other celebrities as her sexual harassment lawsuit advances toward trial

Blake Lively's Lawyers Seek Tight Hold Over Release of Information in Lawsuit Against Justin Baldoni

NEW YORK (AP) — A lawyer for actor Blake Lively asked a federal judge Thursday to impose strict rules to prevent anyone associated with Justin Baldoni getting personal or intimate information about her or other celebrities while potential evidence is shared among attorneys as her sexual harassment claims against her costar in “It Ends With Us” proceeds toward trial.

Meryl Governski, representing Lively, told Judge Lewis J. Liman in a telephone conference that some materials must be shared only between lawyers to protect her client and others. The judge did not immediately rule.

Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and sought unspecified damages. Baldoni later countersued, accusing Lively and her husband, “Deadpool” actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.

Governski said some defendants in Lively's lawsuit filed in late December against Baldoni, his production company and others seemed to be operating on an unlimited budget as they “try to ruin the lives of Ms. Lively and her family.”

“There is an insatiable appetite for any information about this case, no matter how benign it is,” Governski said. “The defendants have bragged in text messages about being able to publish information without fingerprints.”

She said one category of information that needs to be kept between lawyers related to medical information, including mental health, and that “personal and intimate conversations with unrelated third parties” must be kept out of the public eye because — while the public relations value would be high — the evidentiary value would be “virtually nonexistent.”

Governski said there were “dozens and dozens of third parties” that would be identified by name in discovery materials, and “we think there is a significant chance of irreparable harm if marginally relevant information with high-profile individuals who are unrelated to the case fall into the wrong hands.”

Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni and his production company, scoffed at Governski's statements, saying the judge's proposed order to keep potential evidence in the case secret while it is shared between attorneys and their clients was sufficient.

Freedman said the case was similar to others, despite the fame of its litigants, and he should be able to discuss potential evidence with his clients to properly defend them.

“Frankly we see no difference because someone is a celebrity” as to how the case should proceed, he said.

Freedman said Lively's lawyers could request that certain sensitive materials, such as medical information related to her claims that she suffered emotional distress, be kept between lawyers when the issue arises.

“If they need greater protection and need our clients not to see something, they could make a specific showing,” he said.

The judge said he expects to rule soon. He noted there was a “presumption of public access” to the courts, and he cited the public's right to know how the court's resources are being used.

He has already warned lawyers to obey court rules about making public statements that could endanger a fair trial and suggested he could order a trial scheduled for March 9, 2026, to occur sooner if lawyers continued making fiery public comments.

“It Ends With Us,” an adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie’s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.

Lively became widely known after she appeared in the 2005 film “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.” She bolstered her stardom on the TV series “Gossip Girl” from 2007 to 2012 before starring in films including “The Town” and “The Shallows.”

Baldoni starred in the TV comedy “Jane the Virgin,” directed the 2019 film “Five Feet Apart” and wrote “Man Enough,” a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.

Netflix is giving Running Point fans exactly what they asked for: another season!

After tons of buzz and viewer requests, the streamer officially announced on Thursday, March 6, that the Mindy Kaling-created dramedy has been renewed for a second season. The news dropped via a special social media video featuring the show’s leading lady, Kate Hudson.

“A good basketball team owner knows when to listen to the fans. So we hear you and so did Netflix,” Hudson says in the clip. “Running Point is officially coming back for Season 2! Thank you so much to everyone who’s watched so far—you’re the reason we get to do this again. See you next season!”

The renewal comes just a week after Running Point premiered on February 27, but let’s be real—this was pretty much inevitable. The show wasted no time climbing to the top of Netflix’s most-watched list, proving it’s already a major hit.

For those who need a quick refresher, Running Point follows Isla Gordon (Hudson), a sharp, no-nonsense L.A. executive who suddenly finds herself in charge of one of the most famous professional basketball teams in the country after her older brother spectacularly flames out in public. 

The show boasts a seriously stacked ensemble cast, including Scott MacArthur (The Mick), Drew Tarver (The Other Two), Max Greenfield (New Girl), Brenda Song (The Last Showgirl), Chet Hanks (Your Honor) and Toby Sandeman (The Royals).

As for when season two will drop? Netflix hasn’t spilled the details just yet, but since the show only premiered a week ago, you’ll likely have to wait a bit. In the meantime, all ten episodes of Running Point season one are available to stream now on Netflix.

Kim Kardashian recently drew attention to financial struggles she faced following her split from ex-husband Damon Thomas when she was just 21 years old. 

The SKIMS founder opened up about her post-divorce finances in the latest episode of The Kardashians on Hulu. The star praised her younger sister, Khloe Kardashian, for giving away her "life savings" so she could leave Thomas and find an apartment. 

The now 44-year-old pulled an all-nighter with Khloe to count the money, and they soon discovered they had $6,000, which was enough for her to set off on her own and leave the space she shared with the music producer, 10 years her senior. 

Khloe also commented on her selfless act, revealing that she didn't think twice about giving her sister the money.

"She was crying in my room. I was just like, 'OK, I have this Coke bottle. Let’s take what’s in here, go to the bank and cash it—and let's use this money for your divorce.' I gave her all that I got."

According to E!News, Thomas and Kardashian wed in 2000 when Kim was just 19 years old and spent four years together before parting ways in 2004. Kim went on to tie the knot with basketball star Kris Humphries in 2011 and called it quits 72 days later. The mother-of-four married rapper Kanye West in 2014, with whom she shares children North, 11, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 5. The former pair ended their relationship in 2021.

Dolly Parton has shared a new statement following the death of her "beloved husband," Carl Dean, earlier this week.

The legendary country star — whose husband of 58 years passed away on Monday, March 3 at age 82 — took to Instagram on Thursday, March 6, to thank everybody for their love and support amid the difficult time.

"This is a love note to family, friends, and fans. Thank you for all the messages, cards, and flowers that you've sent to pay your respects for the loss of my beloved husband Carl," the "9 to 5" singer, 79, wrote in her post. "I can't reach out personally to each of you but just know it has meant the world to me. He is in God's arms now and I am okay with that."

She concluded the heartfelt post with a nod to one of her most famous songs.

"I will always love you," Parton wrote.

Fans commented on the post, expressing sympathy for the 10-time Grammy Award winner.

"The I will always love you at the end 😭 so sorry for your loss," one person wrote. "The price of love is grief, and I'm sending you so many prayers mama!"

"What a beautiful message and perspective. We will always love you, Dolly. ♥️," another fan commented.

"Dolly - if anyone could bring everyone together, it's you❤️," a separate individual wrote.

The musician's Instagram account first announced the heartbreaking news on Monday. The post included a quote from Parton, which read, "Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy."

The "Jolene" hitmaker and Dean wed in 1966 in Georgia. The couple opted not to have children.

In 2023, Parton spoke to UK publication Saga about her decision to not become a parent.

"I haven't missed it like I thought I might. When you're a young couple, you think you're going to have kids, but it just wasn't one of those burning things for me," she noted. "I had my career and my music and I was travelling."

Dean's cause of death has not been disclosed yet.

The country star and her husband also share a 10-year-old daughter, a 9-year-old son and a 6-year-old son.

As a mom of four, Jessie James Decker is more in love with her body today than she was at 23 years old. 

In a new interview, the country singer, 36, opened up about her postpartum journey after giving birth to her son, Denver, one year ago and got candid about the mental and physical challenges she's faced along the way. 

"After I stopped nursing, I was like, ‘Wow, [the weight] is not coming off as fast as it did before. I’m going to have to really go for it this time,’" Decker - who shares daughter Vivianne, 10, and sons Eric Jr., 9, Forrest, 6, and Denver, 1, with husband Eric Decker - told Us Weekly. "I wanted to feel strong."

With a combination of intermittent fasting, weightlifting and HIIT workouts, Decker said she now feels better than ever. 

"I knew what I weighed before and around that ballpark felt good to me," she said. "I love where I’m at [now] because I put in the time building the muscle. I like being toned, muscular and really strong."

"As I’ve gotten older, I like the way I look now more than I did when I was 23," she added. 

Though Decker admitted she does not necessarily love working out with her husband, she is grateful for his constant support.

"He thinks I’m pretty no matter what, even when I’m having a hard day or after I’ve had a baby [and] I’m not feeling like myself," she said of Eric. "I look for it in his face and he never flinches. He tells me I look pretty the way that I am."

In May 2024, Decker shared two photos of herself in an orange bikini, admitting in the caption she "really didn’t wanna post any of these kittenish swim photos" due to her weight gain following baby No. 4.

"I weigh 30 pounds more right now than I did last year this time," she shared in the caption. "Yes I know I just had a baby three months ago but it’s easy to compare on here and wonder why my body likes to hold on to it more than others. The pressure we put on our self is not realistic."

"And if you’re breast-feeding like me and your body needs to hold on to as much weight as possible to keep making milk, then let it," she said. "Focus on that sweet new baby because that’s what it’s all about. Plenty of time to "get back" when it’s time. But for now. Give yourself grace… you’re doing great and you got this girl!

"We are in this together Xoxo."

Bhad Bhabie has issued a stern warning to Alabama Barker, the daughter of Shanna Moakler and Travis Barker, amid their ongoing feud — and just hours after the rapper's boyfriend Le Vaughn was shot.

Referring to Alabama's diff track where she references the "Hi Bich" artist's daughter with Le Vaughn, Bhad Bhabie, whose real name is Danielle Bregoli, took to her Instagram Stories on Thursday, March 6, to hit back.

"Who told this h** to talk about my kid? You thought that was a good idea? That wasn't 'hard' like you thought it was gonna b the whole internet on your ass now slow a** h** when I see you you better run," Bregoli, 21, wrote.

Bregoli's message is the latest update in the ongoing drama between her and the 19-year-old influencer. Things really soured between the two rappers when Bregoli accused Barker of trying to steal Le Vaughn from her in late 2024. In the months that followed, Bregoli and Alabama have been going back and forth releasing diss tracks about each other.

In January 2025, Bregoli released the song "Over Cooked," which many believe was about Alabama. Then, it was Alabama's turn. She released "Cry Bhabie" in which she rapped about the rumors involving her and Le Vaughn. Bregoli was next up, releasing "Ms. Whitman," in which she was accused of dragging Alabama's family into the drama, even mentioning Travis' relationship with Kourtney Kardashian — Alabama's stepmother.

Most recently, Alabama previewed her next track in which she brings Bregoli's daughter, Kali, who turns 1 this month, into the mix. This got a scathing reaction from Bhad Bhabie's mom, Barbara Bregoli, who took aim at Alabama in a series of messages on her own Instagram Stories — even going as far as to say Travis "has a whole new family" per TMZ, referring to the musician's marriage to Kardashian and their 1-year-old son, Rocky ("Rocky Rules," Barbara also wrote).

Bhad Bhabie's new warning to Alabama comes just hours after Le Vaughn, 26, was shot at a strip club in Los Angeles. According to TMZ, Le Vaughn's injuries were not life-threatening. He posted a selfie from the hospital on Wednesday, March 5, showing his bandaged hand.

Gene Hackman's nephew doesn't want to fuel "negative theories" surrounding the Hollywood legend's death.

The 95-year-old actor and his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, were found dead in their Santa Fe home last week but his nephew Tim Hackman has stressed that his loved ones don't want to "speculate" on what caused the mysterious tragedy, which has been described as "suspicious" by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office.

Tim told Us Weekly: "We're waiting on toxicology. That will tell us everything. It's hard to theorize. There are lots of theories out there and I don't want to speculate. It's easy to speculate negative theories."

He added: "The family wants to keep it positive for now and when we know the truth we will deal with it."

Tim revealed that the description of 'The Royal Tenenbaums' actor and his wife's mummified bodies - as well as that of their dog Zinna - have left the family with lots of unanswered questions.

He said: "My uncle was 95 years old at an age where you think about, 'Okay, it's time'. But from the circumstances now things have changed a bit. It's a major change."

Tim explained that the Oscar-winning star was "like any other family member", although he was left in awe by his uncle's successful career in the movies.

He said: "For me personally, it's something I would find strange because I was a fan and a nephew. There were moments of, 'Wow, Gene Hackman is in front of me'."

It has emerged that Gene's death was not likely to have been as a result of gas poisoning.

The New Mexico Gas Company confirmed via a statement from officials to DailyMail.com that "there were no significant findings" of gas leaks or carbon monoxide in the home.

However, the authorities did confirm that five "red tags" had been issued, including one "minor leak" from a stove with a reading of "0.03 per cent gas in the air".

The statement added: "The other four red tags were for code enforcement violations - not involving gas leaks or carbon monoxide - involving a water heater and gas log lighters installed in three fireplaces."

Investigators have suggested that it could take weeks to determine the cause of the pair's deaths.

Gwyneth Paltrow admitted to self-medicating with alcohol to deal with the stress from the Los Angeles fires in January.

During a recent episode of "The Goop Podcast," Paltrow shared that her menopause symptoms started to ramp up when she was drinking alcohol daily during the month of January.

"I’m really in the thick of it right now, so I’m all over the place," Paltrow said. "But I noticed my symptoms are, like, pretty well under control unless, you know, in January when the fires were happening in L.A. I’ve used alcohol for its purpose."

Gwyneth Paltrow Reflects On What She ‘Let Go Of’ In 2024: ‘Some People Who Were Not Right For Me’

She confirmed that she "drank every night" and alcohol became a way she was "medicating."

"My symptoms were completely out of control. It was the first time I really noticed causation in that way," Paltrow said.

Prior to the L.A. fires, she said that she would barely drink alcohol, and if she did, it was once a week.

Back in January, Paltrow took to Instagram to share how devastated she was about the Palisades and Eaton fires that devastated the Pacific Palisades and Altadena communities.

"Our beloved Los Angeles … We are in deep grief for so many of our close friends who have lost everything," her caption began.

She also clarified that she and her family were safe. The actress is married to Brad Falchuk, and she shares two children, Apple and Moses, with her ex-husband, Chris Martin.

"Thank you to those inquiring, we are currently safe. When the fires are out there will be more to say and everything to do. The city of angels will need angels of all kinds. Please everyone, stay safe and vigilant," she concluded.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Paltrow sold her Brentwood home for $22 million the same month of the L.A. fires. The home was originally put on the market for $29.9 million in May 2024, but the price was lowered to $24.9 million in October. The outlet reported that Paltrow's home was threatened by the Palisades Fire but ultimately was not affected.

Twenty-nine people were killed in the Palisades and Eaton fires; 23,448 acres burned in the Palisades Fire and 6,833 businesses and homes were destroyed, according to Cal Fire.

Cal Fire also reported that the Eaton Fire burned 14,021 acres in Altadena, and 9,418 businesses and homes were destroyed.

In February, musicians gathered in Los Angeles for the FireAid benefit concert, which was held at the Intuit Dome and Kia Forum. The goal of the benefit was to rebuild communities decimated by the fires that burned through Los Angeles in January.

A Tamil-language suspense thriller, Finder Project 1, directed by Vinoth Rajendran, follows the journey of two criminology students who establish a detective agency aimed at proving the innocence of wrongfully convicted individuals. The film, featuring Charle, Sendrayan, Vinoth Rajendran, and Dharani Reddy in key roles, delves into an investigative narrative inspired by real-life projects like the Innocence Project in the United States. With a gripping premise, the story unfolds as the detectives uncover the truth behind a case involving two men convicted of murder.

Scheduled for its digital premiere, Finder Project 1 will be available for streaming on Aha Tamil from March 7, 2025. The film, which initially hit theatres on April 19, 2024, received moderate attention for its intriguing storyline and investigative theme.

The trailer of Finder Project 1 offers a glimpse into the intense and methodical approach taken by the protagonists in solving a wrongful conviction case. The film's plot revolves around Peter, a fisherman played by Charle, and his brother-in-law Rayan, portrayed by Sendrayan, who are falsely accused of murdering a councillor. Lured by the promise of financial compensation and an early release, they accept the charges, only for Rayan to lose his life in prison. The detective duo, played by Vinoth Rajendran and Dharani Reddy, take up the case, navigating layers of deception and corruption to unearth the truth.

The film boasts an ensemble cast, with Charle portraying Peter and Sendrayan appearing as Raayan. The lineup includes director Vinoth Rajendran, Dharani Reddy, Nizhalgal Ravi as Dhayalan, Gopinath Shankar, Brana Abdulsalam, and Nazar Anver Raja. The project has been helmed by Vinoth Rajendran, who has taken on multiple roles, including writing the screenplay and dialogues. Baby Antony handled cinematography, while Surya Prasadh composed the music.

While performances and cinematography have been praised, audience response to the film's narrative execution varies. It has an IMDb rating of 6.1 / 10.

The film, directed by Marc Forster, explores the evolving dynamics of a marriage after a woman regains her eyesight, leading to unforeseen consequences. Originally released in 2017, the movie garnered attention for its unconventional storytelling and visual style. While it received mixed reviews, its psychological depth and performances have been points of discussion among viewers and critics.

What initially seems like a joyous transformation soon reveals underlying insecurities and power struggles, leading to a tense psychological unraveling. The official trailer highlights the film's eerie atmosphere, shifting perspectives, and a slow-burning tension that builds throughout the story.

Directed by Marc Forster, the screenplay was co-written by Forster and Sean Conway. Cinematography was handled by Matthias Koenigswieser, while Marc Streitenfeld composed the music.

During the trailer launch of the series, the media questioned Neeraj about the ongoing discussion about the guest appearance of cricketer Sourav Ganguly in Khakee: The Bengal Chapter. Although the filmmaker did not say much about this, he answered the question with a smile and said that as far as Sourav is concerned, keep watching. Neeraj's just saying this has now increased the curiosity of these people about the presence of Sourav Ganguly because Neeraj has not completely denied the news of the former skipper's presence.

Neeraj told why Kolkata was chosen for this series

During the trailer launch, Neeraj Pandey also talked about his attachment and personal relations with Kolkata. Because of this, he chose Kolkata for his new project. Neeraj said, "I was born and brought up in Kolkata. This is the reason why I chose Kolkata for the second phase of the Khaki series. This is my personal choice."
