Noem said that she and González talked “extensively” about energy and how the federal government could help streamline efforts to update energy sources on the island. González, who is a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, said she and Noem also talked about ways to strengthen Puerto Rico’s border security, and how the island can beef up relations with federal security agencies. “We want to dismantle all those criminal organizations hitting our shores,” González said, adding that Noem’s visit “demonstrates how important Puerto Rico is in this fight.” Her visit comes weeks after federal agents in Puerto Rico began arresting people believed to be undocumented immigrants, a move that has been widely criticized on the island.

Money from frozen Russian assets held in Europe must be "unfrozen", a Ukrainian MP has just told us. We're now hearing from the US defence secretary, who is meeting with his UK counterpart John Healey. The French president suggested starting talks about using France's nuclear deterrent to protect Europe from Russian threats - comments blasted this morning as "confrontational" by Kremlin mouthpiece Dmitry Peskov. The ministry also warned Macron's statement "will be taken into account by Russia in its defence planning". Addressing today's summit of EU leaders in Brussels, Zelenskyy says he welcomes the European Commission’s efforts to rearm Europe.</p>

A fragile ceasefire since January 19 saw an influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza, before Israel on Sunday announced it was blocking deliveries until Palestinian militant group Hamas accepted its terms for an extension of the ceasefire. "As the occupying power, Israel is always obliged to ensure sufficient food, medical supplies and other relief services." Israel stopped aid deliveries into Gaza saying they were being diverted by Hamas. With significant US involvement, Hamas and Israel are arguing over how to extend the ceasefire.

While Israel has said it wants to extend the first phase until mid-April, Hamas has insisted that the second phase go ahead as planned. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump warned the people of Gaza that they would be "DEAD" unless all the remaining hostages were released. "Any escalation of aggression against our people will likely lead to the death of some enemy prisoners, as has happened in many cases in the past." Earlier on Thursday, Israel's military said that "several suspects were identified planting an explosive device in the ground" near soldiers operating in northern Gaza, adding that a military aircraft struck them "in order to remove the threat."

He called for talks with France and Britain about an expansion of their nuclear protection, something Macron referred to in his speech on Wednesday as a "historical" turning point. Inevitably for an issue where strategic ambiguity is essential, Macron's proposal remains very vague, however, and some EU leaders expressed caution. Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has displayed stark strategic differences with Macron over the course of his mandate, said it was important not to give up on U.S. military protection.

France introduced new regulations Thursday that will require major pornography sites to check the ages of visitors or risk being blocked. This was extended with a decree published Thursday that widens the measures to companies based in the European Union, meaning Cyprus-based PornHub and YouPorn as well as Hungary-based Jacquie et Michel. Age verification can be done with a credit card or by sending an identity document, but websites are also required to offer at least one "double blind" option for users to prove their age without revealing their identity. The report found that two thirds of children aged 15 or less had seen pornographic content. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.</p>

A trade dispute between Canada and the US has escalated, with several Canadian provinces pulling American-made alcohol from store shelves. "I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves," Whiting said. Canada has retaliated against the US tariffs with its own 25% levies on American goods, including beer, spirits, and wine. The trade tensions have sparked a nationalist sentiment among Canadians, with some opting to buy local products instead of US-made goods. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticised the US tariffs, calling them "a very dumb thing to do."</p>

(CNN) — President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a nearly one-month tariff delay on all products from Mexico that are covered by the USMCA free trade treaty, a significant walkback of the administration’s signature economic plan that has rattled markets, businesses and consumers. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also said Thursday that Trump will likely announce later in the day a one-month delay on all Canadian tariffs. “After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday, after a phone conversation with the Mexican president. “Believe it or not, despite the terrible job he’s done for Canada, I think that Justin Trudeau is using the Tariff problem, which he has largely caused, in order to run again for Prime Minister,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. Trump in his joint address to Congress Tuesday night acknowledged that tariffs are unpopular and could cause some pain, particularly by raising prices on an already inflation-weary American public.</p>

The comments come as the US puts pressure on Ukraine to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, and after a public clash between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump. His comments come as Politico reports that members of Trump's team held discussions with some of Zelensky's political opponents, after Trump allies suggested the Ukrainian president should stand aside as his term expired in May. Responding to the report, Tymoshenko said her team was talking with "all allies who can help ensure a just peace as soon as possible", while noting elections cannot be held under Ukraine's constitution while it is under martial law. While criticising Zelensky's government over its political decisions and communications with the US, he too stressed that elections could only take place after a ceasefire was signed. However the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.</p>

For years the bloc’s two biggest countries have been at odds, due largely to a frosty rapport between their respective leaders. Mr Scholz, and to some extent Angela Merkel before him, all but refused to engage with Emmanuel Macron, the French president who endlessly fizzes with ideas of how the continent can be built into a Europe-puissance, generally at Germany’s expense. Mr Merz, an Atlanticist visibly shocked by America’s shabby treatment of Europe, looks readier to collaborate with his French counterpart. Both like to hint at vast intellectual hinterlands with public displays of admiration for impenetrable philosophers. Expect more “coalitions of the willing” spearheaded by France and Germany—perhaps including Britain, too, on defence matters.</p>

Timothy Cho, a two-time defector from North Korea, has revealed the difficulties citizens go through in the secretive nation in order to purchase simple consumer goods such as TVs. He shed light on the bizarre and rigid media control in the country and revealed how something as simple as owning a television can be particularly difficult in North Korea. "If you buy a TV in North Korea, the government come to your house and take all antennas out and leave only one antenna," he told LADbible as he was asked about censorship in the country.

Over 300 people have been nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, organisers said on Wednesday, with politicians saying they had put US President Donald Trump forward for the award. On Monday, US Congressman Darrell Issa declared in a post on X that he too would nominate Trump for the prestigious prize, adding: "No-one deserves it more." Issa's nomination would be submitted after the submission deadline but Ukrainian parliamentarian Oleksandr Merezhko also nominated Trump back in November in a move to grab the then president-elect's attention, according to Ukrainian media. In January, thousands of people signed a UK petition calling for Frenchwoman Gisele Pelicot to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

US President Donald Trump wants a share in revenues from Ukraine's mineral wealth as compensation for the military and financial aid Washington has poured into Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion more than three years ago. A Ukraine-US deal on minerals was due to have been signed at the White House last week, but the event was called off after a spectacular televised clash between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But he is adamant that the sector "really needs investment" since Ukrainian companies are not putting money into it. Trump has engineered a stunning rapprochement with Russian President Vladimir Putin and this week suspended all military assistance to Ukraine.

Speaking Thursday, Lai said the government was not pressured by Washington "during TSMC's US investment process". Wei said TSMC's expansion was driven by growing demand from US clients and it would not affect the company's investments in Taiwan. "At the same time, it also provides Taiwanese enterprises with opportunities for international cooperation and contributes to Taiwan's greater strength." The concentration of chip manufacturing in Taiwan has long been seen as a "silicon shield" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China and an incentive for the United States to defend it.

Under current immigration laws in the US, they will no longer qualify as dependents of their H1-B visa-holder parents. Many are now exploring other options, including immigrating to countries like Canada or the UK, which have more flexible policies. DACA provides temporary, renewable two-year protection from deportation for undocumented youth, including those who lose dependent status after turning 21. US Senator Bernie Sanders, a leading progressive, had criticised the H-1B program earlier this year, arguing that it primarily benefits corporations by bringing in lower-paid foreign workers instead of hiring Americans. Mr Sanders also took aim at billionaires like Tesla owner Elon Musk and Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for their support of the H-1B program.</p>

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a plan to loosen budget rules so countries that are willing can spend much more on defense. Her proposal is underpinned by 150 billion euros worth of loans to buy priority military equipment. Most of the increased defense spending would have to come from national budgets at a time when many countries are already overburdened with debt. Five other countries using the euro currency have debt levels over 100% of GDP: Belgium, Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal.

Northeastern University is moving forward with plans to build a state-of-the-art, multi-purpose athletics and recreation complex on the site of Matthews Arena in Boston. “This is a place where memories will be made,” says Ken Henderson, chancellor and senior vice president for learning at Northeastern. It will be Northeastern’s largest indoor gathering space, also enabling thousands of people to attend academic ceremonies and other non-athletic events. Since its 1979 purchase by Northeastern, Matthews Arena has served as a community venue for high school graduations and other events. That access will grow when the new complex is opened, says John Tobin, Northeastern’s vice president for city and community engagement.</p>

Hundreds of Chinese nationals freed from Myanmar online scam centres flew home through Thailand on Thursday, as the kingdom said it aimed to repatriate 1,500 such workers a week. Around 600 Chinese nationals were returned from Myanmar through Thailand two weeks ago, and last week the three countries held talks in Bangkok to arrange further transferrals. Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura told reporters that "another group of Chinese nationals" were repatriated on Thursday, without saying how many. He added that Thailand plans to repatriate 1,500 people per week, or 300 each weekday, with "regular repatriations of Chinese nationals every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday." A Rwandan scam centre worker who asked to remain anonymous told AFP on Wednesday that he had been trafficked into one of the compounds where he was tortured and had his money taken from him.</p>

A fritillary butterfly perches on blooming milkweed at Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Laurel, Md., June 5, 2019. “Butterflies have been declining the last 20 years,” said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997. Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.

Sign up for our email to enjoy your city without spending a thing (as well as some options when you’re feeling flush). In 2024, a record-breaking 332 million visitors explored the country’s national treasures, from towering peaks to serene coastlines. The Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal workforce led to a nearly 10% cut in NPS employees, with about 1,000 workers laid off just before Valentine’s Day. Advocates warn that the effects are already showing, as some parks have cut hours, limited programs and seen longer wait times at entrances. Keeping parks clean, safe and well-maintained with fewer hands on deck will be a challenge as summer approaches.</p>

Beijing maintains that it does not allow the drug to be made within its borders. Yet cooperation on stemming narcotics trafficking has stalled when political relations between the two countries are strained. It should be noted that the vast majority – more than 86% – of individuals sentenced for fentanyl trafficking in fiscal 2023 were U.S. citizens, according to government data.

If Trump does make that change, it would mark a significant shift from a core tenet of the alliance known as Article 5, which says that an attack on any NATO country is an attack on all of them. Asked about Trump considering making these changes to how the U.S. engages with NATO, a National Security Council official said in a written statement, “President Trump is committed to NATO and Article V.” Most recently he said NATO members should spend 5% of their GDP on defense, though the U.S. does not currently do that. Five of those nations — Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland and the U.S. — spent more than 3% on defense. Trump didn’t announce anything at his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, but Coons said, “If you’re not given pause by everything about President Trump’s statements and actions on foreign policy, you’re not paying attention.”</p>

“With 25 per cent tariffs, it blows a complete hole in the trade agreement,” Verheul said Wednesday. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government would announce duties on targeted products and other measures Sunday. But U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data shows only a small volume of fentanyl crosses illegally into the United States from Canada. Mexico is acting on the president’s border concerns, looking to build a long-term plan, but Ramos said it must be separate from trade if there are to be good-faith conversations about a trade pact. “Leaving this agreement or allowing it to expire will have a very damaging impact on millions of American workers and families,” Brady said.</p>

Of particular concern is ransomware, in which hackers, often Russian-speaking criminal gangs, deploy malicious software to lock up computer networks and demand payment. Philip Reiner, CEO of the Institute for Security and Technology, a San Francisco think tank that focuses on cybersecurity policy, told NBC News that any new agreement with Russia needs to persuade the Kremlin to rein in its cybercriminals who target Americans, as they rarely face legal repercussions in Russia. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, President George W. Bush asked U.S. spy agencies to pursue possible collaboration with Russia on terrorism threats. The Russians were not interested in sharing sensitive information about terrorist groups, according to former officials. “Inside the CIA, we often joked that, to Putin, win-win means I beat you twice,” they wrote.</p>

Lai added that he did not even know one of the alleged co-conspirators, Andy Li. Lai has been held in solitary confinement for more than 1,500 days since December 2020.

These tariffs have had a particularly jostling effect because no one knows how long Trump will go through with them. Often, experts view them as a culling of optimism that can otherwise run overboard, driving stock prices too high. Before this recent stumble, many critics were already saying the U.S. stock market was too expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits. “We would advise younger investors to not worry about this at all,” said Phil Battin, CEO of Ambassador Wealth Management.

Macy’s delivered another quarter of mixed results on Thursday as investors wait and see how quickly CEO Tony Spring can pull off a turnaround of the business with yet another activist investor looking to take the chain private. Here’s how the department store performed during its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Like other retailers, Macy’s benefited from an extra selling week in the year-ago period, which has skewed comparisons. As Macy’s and other department stores have shrunk over the years, it’s faced criticism for neglecting its stores, not having enough staff and falling behind on the retail essentials that are necessary to win in any environment. “Building on our momentum, we continue to elevate the customer experience, deliver operational excellence and make prudent capital investments,” said Mitchell.</p>

These fake websites can be very convincing, so take extra steps to confirm what website you are on. These liquidation scams play on people’s desire to get a good deal. Even for a liquidation sale, if the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you’re checking out when shopping online and are suddenly asked for additional personal information like your Social Security number, take that as a red flag for a scam.</p>

"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. "We had an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results, within the framework of respect for our sovereignties," Sheinbaum said in a post on X. Trump made the announcement soon after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a one-month delay of tariffs on Mexico and Canada would likely apply to all products compliant with the USMCA. "That which is part of President Trump’s deal with Canada and Mexico [is] likely to get an exemption from these tariffs," Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday morning. Stellantis -- the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep -- saw its stock price fall 2%.</p>

"As Palantir has heavy exposure to US government spending/budgets there have been recent Street concerns that this spending backdrop will be a headwind to this tech stalwarts' growth profile in 2025 and beyond," said Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.

The carefully-curated presentation stayed in line with other awards ceremonies keeping Washington at arm’s length from Hollywood, even as the administration cracks down on diversity initiatives hailed not too long ago as representing a much-needed step forward in getting films and TV series to more accurately reflect audiences worldwide. There’s a reason why several of these policies no longer explicitly mention race, often using read-between-the-lines placeholders like “underrepresented” or “underserved” or “unique perspectives.” The studios’ responses to Trump’s war on DEI could either mean that they genuinely no longer intend to advance diversity, or it could just mean that they will continue to operate in the same way they have been but behind closed doors after making splashy announcements that DEI is dead. Another example: The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2020 implemented inclusion standards requiring movies to meet specific levels of diversity, but they are so easy to meet that virtually every title ever nominated for best picture in recent decades would have been eligible. According to a March 4 report from ISS-Corporate, companies across the board are deemphasizing DEI in their proxies and annual reports. If the situations playing out within Paramount Global and Comcast, both of which have been targeted by government agencies, is any indication, they may opt to continue folding.</p>

Only 3% of Businesses Accurately Spot Financial Red Flags When Assessing Customer Risk, Reveals Creditsafe Study The reality is that erratic payment practices are often highly indicative of cash flow issues and financial distress. This suggests that businesses are becoming more aware of the correlation between payment behaviors and bankruptcy risk. Steve Carpenter, Chief Operating Officer for North America at Creditsafe, says, “Our study’s findings highlight the need to educate – or re-educate – finance teams on how they can properly identify red flags when assessing the financial health of their customers. While that’s very important, it’s also necessary to provide helpful tips and training so finance teams can accurately identify problematic patterns that are indicative of cash flow issues and an increased likelihood of late payments over time.</p>

Canadian provinces pulling US alcohol off store shelves in response to Trump trade policy is "worse than tariffs", the boss of Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman has said. "I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves," Mr Whiting said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the LCBO sells nearly $1bn of US alcohol per year. Canadians are being advised by the LCBO to buy products made in Canada. Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, criticised the US tariffs on Tuesday, saying imposing them was "a very dumb thing to do".</p>

Beijing was slapped with an initial 10 per cent tariff last month, while both Canada and Mexico were able to successfully negotiate for a one-month delay. For a man who is generally fickle with his views, tariffs are an issue where Trump’s been uncharacteristically consistent. Yes, tariffs can impact foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad, but there is collateral damage on both sides. The European Union has also hit back against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing US products, from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. US tariffs, and the retaliatory duties that they’ve triggered, would upend two crucial segments of Trump’s voter base.</p>

According to André Dragosch, the primary argument for a Bitcoin-only reserve lies in its proof-of-work mechanism. He highlights that while foreign adversaries could potentially harm a network by acquiring 33% of the supply in Ethereum's proof-of-stake system, achieving a 51% hash rate in Bitcoin's proof-of-work is significantly more challenging, thereby offering a stronger security measure.

Texas State Senator Charles Schwertner argued for the bill, saying that it would help the US state shore up its balance sheet with a valuable, scarce asset. Lawmakers also assuaged fears that Bitcoin was a direct competitor to the US dollar as a global reserve currency, adding that it was much more similar to gold. The Texas strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation was introduced by State Senator Charles Schwertner in January 2025 as a Bitcoin-only bill that omitted the acquisition of other digital assets. However, in February 2025, the bill was refiled to include other digital assets following US President Donald Trump’s Jan. 23 executive order directing a commission to study the feasibility of a “digital asset stockpile.” This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.</p>

Bitcoin Foundation Chairman Brock Pierce joins ‘Varney & Co.’ to discuss Trump’s ‘crypto strategic reserve’ plan. White House artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto czar David Sacks claimed Thursday that the federal government’s lack of a "long-term strategy" on cryptocurrency has negatively impacted American taxpayers. "That’s how much it has cost American taxpayers not to have a long-term strategy." President Donald Trump selected Sacks to serve as the White House AI and crypto czar within his administration in early December.

Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes still rival those of the entire Ethereum ecosystem despite a steep dropoff in memecoin trading activity, asset manager VanEck said. Activity on the Solana network declined in February after a series of memecoin-related scandals soured sentiment among retail traders. ‘[T]he impact was severe, with stablecoin transfers — the backbone of on-chain trading — plummeting (-80%) from January levels,” VanEck said. On Feb. 14, Libra, a memecoin seemingly endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei, erased some $4.4 billion in market capitalization within hours of launching. As of March 6, Raydium has more than $1.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama.</p>

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg fulfilled their 2025 social security payroll tax obligations a few minutes past midnight on 1 January. Other winners will be crypto executives, many of whom donated extensively to Trump’s re-election effort. One example: Ripple – whose XRP token is one of the five that Trump said would be included – donated $45m to an industry-wide Pac that sought to help elect Trump and other Republicans.

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $90,000, up 15% from its lowest level this month, while American stock indices like the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 dropped by over 1%. BTC has two key catalysts that may push its price to $100,000 in the next few days. There is a possibility that the jobs report will fall short of expectations due to Elon Musk’s job cuts. An ADP report released on Wednesday showed that the private sector added just 77,000 jobs in February. Therefore, Bitcoin’s price is likely to continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $100,000.</p>

Notably, tokens like Chainlink (LINK), Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA), which have developed close links to the Trump administration in recent months, are witnessing considerable gains at press time on Thursday. The move reflects Méliuz’s aim to maximize long-term shareholder value through Bitcoin investments, joining a global trend of traditional finance companies adopting cryptocurrency strategies. Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial increased its Ethereum holdings nearly threefold on Thursday, buying the recent ETH price dip. Bitcoin (BTC) price extends its decline and trades below $80,000 at the time of writing on Friday, falling over 15% so far this week.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://finance.yahoo.com/news/proposal-japans-ruling-party-aims-133327224.html'>New Proposal From Japan's Ruling Party Aims To Cap Cryptocurrency Tax at 20%</a></h2><b>Source:</b> Yahoo Finance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-06 13:33:27 <p>
Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has introduced a proposal aimed at significantly lowering the tax rate on crypto gains from the current maximum of 55% to 20%. This proposal seeks to classify cryptocurrencies as a new asset class under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, thereby aligning the tax treatment of crypto with that of traditional securities. Currently, Japan categorizes crypto gains as miscellaneous income, subjecting investors to a steep tax burden. This change could pave the way for a potential spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Japan, which has been a topic of interest among industry stakeholders. The FSA is also expected to outline further directions for crypto regulation by June.</p>

Let's see why XRP outperformed Bitcoin by such a wide margin -- and consider which one is the better cryptocurrency to buy right now. All of those developments -- along with Trump's election victory, hopes for lower interest rates, and the broader rotation back toward cryptocurrencies -- helped drive XRP's price higher. So if the Fed sees inflation rising and pauses its interest rate cuts -- or starts hiking rates again -- a new crypto winter could begin. The surge that many coins saw on Sunday after Trump made another social media announcement about plans for a national crypto reserve had largely evaporated by Monday afternoon. XRP might generate some bigger near-term gains through its volatile swings this year, but I don't think there are enough catalysts to keep it ahead of Bitcoin over the next few years.</p>

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged over 5% on Thursday, soaring past $91,000 after dipping below $82,000 just two days ago. Advocates argue that such a reserve could strengthen national financial security and provide a hedge against economic volatility, much like traditional commodity reserves such as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. However, skeptics warn that large-scale government involvement in bitcoin could disrupt market dynamics and raise regulatory concerns. Last Sunday evening, Trump unveiled plans for a broader US Crypto Reserve, extending beyond bitcoin to include other digital assets like XRP (XRP-USD), Cardano (ADA-GBP), and Solana (SOL-USD). However, some analysts have suggested that experienced traders are taking a more cautious approach ahead of the event.</p>

In a recent interview, Andrew Furey was clear: he says Trump is launching an attack on Canada by sowing economic chaos to create instability. As a condition of the bailout, Newfoundland gave up self-governance, and instead agreed to be ruled by a commission appointed by the British government, according to Memorial University's Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage website. When 52 per cent of Newfoundlanders voted in 1949 to join Canada rather than return to self-government, many hoped Confederation would bring financial stability and help them avoid the destitution that plagued the region under its own government, he said. “We didn't get arm-twisted into this,” Webb said about Newfoundland’s Confederation with Canada. … I don't know yet if Canadians, and particularly our political leaders, fully understand what it means to chart a separate course from the United States."</p>

To improve wildfire monitoring and response, NASA deployed a new scientific instrument capable of capturing high-resolution thermal infrared images. The Compact Fire Infrared Radiance Spectral Tracker (c-FIRST) was tested aboard NASA's B200 King Air aircraft over fire-hit areas in Pacific Palisades and Altadena. The compact design allows it to be deployed on airborne platforms, simulating satellite missions while providing near-instantaneous observations. As per sources, c-FIRST is expected to provide critical insights for firefighting agencies by identifying smoldering fires that could reignite under changing wind conditions. With further evaluation, c-FIRST is expected to be integrated into future satellite missions, potentially improving global wildfire monitoring capabilities.</p>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will set up a government-backed fund in the near future that will mobilize 1 trillion yuan ($138.01 billion) from social capital to support technology startups, Zheng Shanjie, the head of China's state planner, said on Thursday. The "national venture capital guidance fund" - an investment vehicle set up as public-private partnership - would focus on "hard technology", Zheng told a news conference, referring to areas such as semiconductors and renewable energy. Zheng and other officials spoke to the media a day after Premier Li Qiang told lawmakers Beijing aimed to keep the tariff-hit economy growing at a roughly 5% rate this year. China said on Wednesday it would boost support for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models and the development of venture capital investment, in a bid to foster more technology breakthroughs and become more self-reliant.

Qwen, the e-commerce leader’s artificial intelligence unit, said on X that its QwQ-32B, with 32 billion parameters, can achieve performance comparable to DeepSeek’s R1 model, which boasts 671 billion parameters. The announcement came a day after the Chinese government pledged increased support for industries including artificial intelligence, humanoid robots and 6G telecom, as AI models see increasing adoption by government agencies and smaller companies in China. The firm said the QwQ-32B demonstrated capabilities in mathematical reasoning, coding and general problem-solving in benchmark tests, performing close to top models such as OpenAI’s o1 mini and DeepSeek’s R1. Analysts said initiatives laid out by the government will expand usage of AI in China. “China is rapidly building an application-driven AI ecosystem that isn’t just about research — it’s about immediate, tangible economic impact,” said Sun Wei, principal AI analyst at research company Counterpoint.</p>

Gavin Newsom found common ground with Turning Point USA founder and conservative activist Charlie Kirk when the liberal governor – who has been rumored to be eyeing a 2028 presidential run – agreed that biological men in women's sports is "deeply unfair." Newsom didn't directly address the win, but said "it's a fairness issue." Transgender athletes in California have long been protected prior to Newsom's administration under AB 1266, also known as the School Success and Opportunity Act. Newsom agreed that trans issues are something his party is "getting crushed on," which Kirk said he should express "compassion" about while calling out cases like the recent incident in Jurupa Valley High School as "not fair." The student, AB Hernandez, won an invitational meet on Feb. 22, booting out a female runner-up who had jumped just over 32 feet in their competition category.</p>

Deals can be made before that though as the so-called legal tampering period begins at noon ET on March 10. The Las Vegas Raiders announced on Wednesday that they have signed Pro Bowl defensive end Maxx Crosby to a multi-year extension. This offseason, only Kansas City Chiefs OL Trey Smith and Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins were tagged by their teams. Smith's future, meanwhile, still seems to be in Kansas City, with multiple reports indicating the Chiefs want him long-term, especially given their offensive line issues. Gardner Minshew has $3.16 million in fully guaranteed money left on the two-year, $25M deal he signed with Las Vegas last March.</p>

“I am not wrestling with the fairness issue,” continued Newsom, who played varsity baseball as a college student. Overall, polling suggests that allowing transgender female athletes to play on women’s teams isn’t broadly popular. But Republicans have nonetheless sought to capitalize on the cultural touchstone that sports represent in America. Trump regularly hammered Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom’s fellow Californian, for supporting LGBTQ+ rights. Kirk, not Newsom, brought up the overall issue during their hour-plus conversation, which focused in part on how Democrats can rebuild a broader coalition of voters.</p>

“Protecting the female participation is a must but we also have to address the fact that there are more transgender individuals who want to practice high-level sport,” Parsons told Reuters in an interview. I think science is what can give us answers in every sport about participation of transgender athletes. However, United States President Donald Trump, whose country will host the Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, has issued an order to exclude transgender girls and women from female sports. “It’s a tight schedule but we are confident, and we have been reassured by the Italian authorities, that it’s going to be delivered,” he said. So in this edition, yes, it means that the venues are very spread out,” Parsons said.</p>

Asked how it was being back on the floor, Morant responded with one word: "Terrible." It has been an inefficient season for Morant individually, and the shoulder issue could be playing a role in that, but Jenkins doesn't want him turning down open looks. Since then, they've lost seven of nine and have fallen to fourth in the West. Reserve forward John Konchar sat out against OKC due to right knee soreness, and newly signed big man Marvin Bagley III logged 15 minutes off the bench.

There are several good, every-down starters in their prime," wrote Mike Clay. As Clay notes, the free-agent cornerback position is led by DJ Reed, Carlton Davis, Byron Murphy, Paulson Adebo, Charvarius Ward, Kendall Fuller, and Asante Samuel Jr. A few veteran options include Darius Slay and Stephon Gilmore. "We've got to get better," said Ballard about the cornerback and safety positions. The addition of Lou Anarumo and his defensive scheme, which helped produce some productive defensive backfields in Cincinnati, can help with some of the heavy lifting when it comes to improved play. However, also a key part of that equation is Ballard making some additions as well.</p>

When Bonds was asked about Ohtani's brilliance, he did tip his cap to the 2024 NL MVP. Bonds said he admires Ohtani's ability to excel in every aspect of the game. Bonds said Ohtani wouldn't have been able to hit multiple home runs without getting plunked in the old days. Ohtani is not gonna hit two home runs without seeing one go (by his ear) in my generation. He's not gonna steal two bases without someone decapitating his kneecap to slow him down.</p>

Players line up during the Penn State men’s hockey game against Minnesota in Pegula Ice Arena on Saturday, Mar. The blue and white’s next contest was narrowly lost to a then-No. While its comeback bids had been successful against non-conference opponents, constantly playing from behind in the Big Ten gauntlet wasn’t sustainable. However, the Nittany Lions still tallied their first conference points and put on a solid performance. The Nittany Lions went from 0-8 in conference play to taking 12 of its last 16 Big Ten games and riding a seven-game win streak until it was narrowly snapped by then-No.</p>

He’s a special talent who would silence those criticizing Jerry Jones for not signing Derrick Henry in free agency last year. With Josh Sweat expected to leave in free agency and Brandon Graham possibly retiring, Green gives the Super Bowl champions a high-energy edge rusher. The Vikings traded most of their picks away last year to move up for J.J. McCarthy so trading down and adding more assets makes sense.</p>

Also, it's very easy, and therefore boring, to just say that x artist did a great Super Bowl halftime show, so let's give them the World Cup. Meanwhile, if anyone knows how to build a halftime show that speaks to a modern audience, it is surely the man whose Roc Nation management company have brought the Super Bowl halftime show back towards relevance. Honestly, FIFA, if you can book Bad Bunny, extend that halftime break to an hour and a half. Get yourself Taylor Swift and you might have started something that will actually hold a fond place in the hearts of football fans.</p>

Young striker Chido Odi will likely come off the bench against his former club Arsenal. OUT: Jonny Evans (lower back), Toby Collyer (knock), Mason Mount (thigh), Luke Shaw (foot), Lisandro Martinez (torn ACL - MORE), Altay Bayindir (undisclosed), Patrick Dorgu (suspension), Kobbie Mainoo (undisclosed), Amad Diallo (ankle - out for season) | QUESTIONABLE: Harry Maguire (lower back), Manuel Ugarte (small issue) Calafiori could start over Lewis-Skelly at left back as the youngster had to be hooked in the first half at PSV after picking up a yellow card and he should have been shown a second. We could see Jorginho start instead of Partey in midfield but more likely is that Arteta will go with Odegaard, Partey and Rice from the start and that trio have been so good in recent weeks. Trossard has been excellent on the other wing too, while Mikel Merino continues to pop up with goals as an emergency striker.</p>

Others like Luis Arraez and Yandy Díaz were reportedly available in trades, but ultimately stayed put. Had the Phillies taken Harper up on his offer and brought in a first baseman, it presumably would have meant no Kepler. Alonso did not sign until right as spring training opened, though those other first basemen all changed teams in mid-December. Understandably, there were growing pains initially, though Harper has turned into a very good defensive first baseman in fairly short order. He'll again man first base this season with Kepler, Nick Castellanos, Brandon Marsh, and Johan Rojas handling outfield duty.</p>

I think it is important to better understand how frequently negative interactions occur and what we can do as a society to improve the culture of sports, otherwise there is not a means in place for betterment,” he said.</p>

This week we're going to tackle the automated strike zone challenge system. There will be missed calls, obviously, given  the level of difficulty in doing that job, and this system creates an  avenue to fix any egregious misses that could change the game. The dugout isn't involved at  all and there's hardly any delay. I do worry about potential  unintended consequences; for example, the equivalent to when instant  replay introduced those annoying "came off the bag for a trivial amount  of time" calls. The limited number of challenges might suppress that  becoming a widespread issue, but it is something to keep in mind if/when  MLB institutes the challenge system for regular and postseason play.</p>

The Los Angeles Chargers announced Wednesday night that they have released five-time Pro Bowl pass rusher Joey Bosa. 3 pick in the 2016 NFL Draft out of Ohio State. He was the league's Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2016 after tallying 10.5 sacks and made his first Pro Bowl in his second season. He was due a $12.36 million roster bonus on March 12.

Metcalf is one of several wide receivers who could be finding a new home this offseason, along with Davante Adams, Christian Kirk (released Wednesday) and Lockett. For those of you saying he doesn't fit Chicago's timeline, I say the timing is always right to upgrade your quarterback's protection, especially given Caleb Williams' sack-filled debut season. Mavs GM Nico Harrison expected to be buried from the moment he traded Luka Dončić for Anthony Davis, which probably wasn't a great sign, and the trade is blowing up in Harrison's face less than a month after it was made, Jasmyn Wimbish says. Whatever sliver of contender status Dallas was hanging on to this campaign is gone. Things can change very quickly, but Sam Quinn says it may already be time to consider trading Davis.</p>
