ST. JOHN'S, N.L. — The outgoing premier of Newfoundland and Labrador says he’s drawing on the province’s history as he urges Canadians not to underestimate U.S. President Donald Trump’s “imperialist” ambitions.

In a recent interview, Andrew Furey was clear: he says Trump is launching an attack on Canada by sowing economic chaos to create instability. And he warned that economic pressure can be just as effective as tanks and gunfire at eroding a nation’s independence and sovereignty.

“In Newfoundland and Labrador, we know that all too well,” the premier said. “It was the economic forces, not the military forces, that caused us to lose our independence and choose to join Canada.”

Trump has kept Canadians frustrated and bewildered for months, threatening punishing tariffs on Canadian goods and then changing his plan at the last minute. As of Thursday, he had imposed 25 per cent tariffs on most Canadian goods, but paused the duties on the auto sector for a month. Energy flowing from Canada to the U.S. was subject to 10 per cent duties.

Meanwhile, Trump regularly calls the Canadian prime minister "Governor Justin Trudeau," and has threatened to use "economic force" to make Canada the 51st state.

“He has shown by his threats that he has an expansive agenda, a territorial agenda, and that feeds an imperialist approach,” Furey said.

Jeff Webb, a history professor at Memorial University, agrees that dire economic circumstances influenced Newfoundlanders when they voted to become a Canadian province in 1949. But they didn't do it under force, he said in a recent interview.

Newfoundland was a self-governing dominion of the British Empire until 1933, when Canada and Britain stepped in to help bail the region out of financial hardship. The Great Depression hit Newfoundland hard, and the dominion had accrued a large debt sending soldiers to fight in the First World War.

As a condition of the bailout, Newfoundland gave up self-governance, and instead agreed to be ruled by a commission appointed by the British government, according to Memorial University's Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage website.

By the 1940s, Britain and Canada thought it would be best for Newfoundland to join Canada, but they didn't force it, Webb said. When 52 per cent of Newfoundlanders voted in 1949 to join Canada rather than return to self-government, many hoped Confederation would bring financial stability and help them avoid the destitution that plagued the region under its own government, he said.

“We didn't get arm-twisted into this,” Webb said about Newfoundland’s Confederation with Canada. “It’s incredibly different from what we’re getting now. And what we’re getting now is crazy, nonsensical bullying.”

"Part of the craziness of this is that there are no sensible parallels," he said of Trump's behaviour toward his northern neighbour.

Historian Sean Cadigan noted that some of Newfoundland's hardship before it joined Canada were a result of the Trump-like tariffs it imposed on foreign manufacturers. It was already costly to make things in Newfoundland — an island in the North Atlantic Ocean — and the taxes just made everything expensive, he said. The cost of living became unbearable, particularly in rural Newfoundland.

"The lessons that I've learned from protectionism, is that it just hurts a lot of people, especially rural people," the Memorial University professor said. "Tariffs create tremendous social and economic divisions. They create winners and losers, and the stress among the losers can be terrible."

The United States under Trump is absolutely "acting in an imperial manner," said Blayne Haggart, an associate political science professor at Brock University. And he agrees with Furey: Canada needs to take it seriously.

"I think we're taking the threat of the tariffs seriously," Haggart said in an interview. "But what comes next? … I don't know yet if Canadians, and particularly our political leaders, fully understand what it means to chart a separate course from the United States."

That will involve costly measures such as strengthening the Canadian military, relying less on the United States for regulatory approvals for drugs and manufacturing, and even strengthening weather forecasting systems as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency fires workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

But instead of having a government digging into those discussions, Canada has an outgoing prime minister and an upcoming federal election, Haggart said.

"I'm 52 years old. This is the worst crisis that Canada has faced in my lifetime," he said. "It's been disappointing to me that the federal leadership vacuum was allowed to persist for so long … I understand the reasons for it but it's still incredibly concerning."

	Owners of high-risk dogs should be careful about how they manage their pet’s food

Labradors with a higher genetic risk for obesity are more likely to seek out food, a new study finds.

University of Cambridge

Labrador retriever owners are likely familiar with how persistent their dogs can be in their quest for food, whether begging under the dinner table or stealing a snack left unattended. It’s no surprise, then, that Labs are among the most overweight dog breeds, along with golden retrievers, cocker spaniels and beagles.

Scientists have now identified multiple genes associated with obesity in Labradors, according to a March 6 study in Science.

The researchers had previously found that a form of a gene called POMC made Labs more prone to overeating. But “we could tell from our studies that the POMC mutation wasn’t the whole story,” says Eleanor Raffan, a veterinary surgeon and geneticist at the University of Cambridge.

In the new study, Raffan and her colleagues examined DNA samples from 241 British Labrador retrievers. The researchers also collected information including the dogs’ body fat mass, how much dogs begged for food, and how strictly their owners regulated their diet.

The researchers uncovered five genes potentially associated with obesity in the dogs. The strongest effect came from a gene called DENND1B — Labradors with a certain variant of this gene had around 8 percent more body fat than dogs without it. DENND1B, which affects how the brain’s responds to food, was also associated with higher body mass indexes in humans.

Knowing which genes were associated with obesity allowed Raffan and her colleagues to develop a risk scoring system, which helped calculate whether individual Labradors were at higher or lower risk of obesity based on their genetic profile.

“You can rank all of the individuals in the population based on whether they inherited a bunch of obesity-prone genes, or maybe they didn’t inherit many at all,” says Adam Boyko, a canine geneticist at Cornell University who was not involved with the study.

With this information, the researchers could see how high-risk and low-risk Labradors differed when it came to their relationships with food. Labradors at a high risk for obesity, for example, were more likely to beg and to be more driven toward finding food. And for Labradors that were more genetically predisposed to obesity, owners who were stricter about regulating their pets’ diet made all the difference.

“If you’re a high-risk dog and your owner is really strict with the management, you can be a perfectly healthy body weight,” Raffan says. “But if they’re pretty relaxed about the management, those are the dogs who get overweight.” She added that dogs with a lower genetic risk tended to stay at a fairly healthy weight, regardless of how their owner fed them.

So do you need a genetic test to determine whether your Labrador may be at risk for obesity? Probably not, says Raffan. If a dog seems like it would tip the scales if given the chance to plan its own diet, that could be a hint that their genes may be behind its drive for food. Trying to ration food for dogs that pack on the pounds could be a safe bet — though it’s often easier said than done. “To be disciplined about your dog’s food intake, it sounds straightforward, but it’s actually quite a tough job if you’ve got one of these massively food-motivated pets,” Raffan says.

It may seem counterintuitive, but scientists are investigating a potent neurotoxin found in pufferfish known as tetrodotoxin to relieve lingering, hard-to-treat pain in the skin known as chronic subcutaneous pain.

“The main challenge is [controlling] its toxicity,” explained Chao Zhao at the University of Alabama. This is because even a small dose of a couple of milligrams can be lethal. But Zhao and his team have come up with a solution in the form of a marker pen.

“Our pen is designed to control the dose with great precision, ensuring that only a tiny, safe amount reaches the skin,” he said. “This way, we can take advantage of tetrodotoxin’s strong pain-relieving effects while minimizing risks.”

Though still proof-of-concept, the team are confident that their “simplified approach to a difficult problem” will lay the foundation for more studies, and, if found safe and effective, this research could be extended to human trials.



The idea of using marker pen to safely deliver tetrodotoxin came to Zhao giving a lecture, during which he was writing on a whiteboard.

“A marker pen stores water-based ink in a sponge core and delivers a consistent amount through capillary action,” explained Zhao. “If we replace the ink with an aqueous tetrodotoxin solution, the pen could continuously release a precise, controlled amount of tetrodotoxin — potentially at the nanogram level, far below the toxic threshold.”

Tetrodotoxin works by blocking electrical signaling along nerves with a potency estimated to be 1,000 times that of standard local anesthetics, and 3,000 times stronger than morphine for pain relief.

But this is a double-edged sword because while potent, it is also extremely toxic. 

The problem is that current therapies including topical creams and anesthetic injections, only work well for moderate pain but do not help severe long-term pain. This is because they are not powerful enough, their effects are short lived or the way they work does not treat the root of the problem. 

Zhao explained that unlike conventional pain medications that broadly act on pain pathways, such as opioids, tetrodotoxin specifically blocks the channels that allow transmission of pain.

“By silencing these channels, tetrodotoxin can effectively prevent the continuous and excessive firing of sensory neurons that drive postherpetic neuralgia pain,” he said. “In 2020, my father developed postherpetic neuralgia [after a bout of shingles]. He tried almost all commercially available creams and patches to relieve the pain. Witnessing his suffering inspired me to develop a more potent and effective method to treat postherpetic neuralgia and other severe skin pain conditions.”

Zhao says that, in addition to its superior potency, tetrodotoxin has several advantages over commonly used anesthetics such as bupivacaine and lidocaine. For example, it does not cause muscle cell breakdown or permanent nerve damage, nor does it cross the blood–brain barrier, reducing the risk of addiction. Unlike conventional local anesthetics, it also does not affect cardiac cells or normal heart function.



To create their pens, Zhao and his team filled commercially available felt tip marker pens with a very small dose of tetrodotoxin mixed with other compounds to improve skin permeability.

In animal studies, the team found that just 900 nanograms of tetrodotoxin caused complete relief from pain for 4 hours, and reduced pain for approximately 11 hours. Importantly, there was no toxicity observed or damage to muscles or nerves.

This isn’t the first time tetrodotoxin has been explored, in fact, human trials in cancer patients demonstrated pain relief but also found side effects. Concerns about safety including toxicity, the drug delivery system, and logistical challenges of storage and transportation have hindered its progression as a pain killer in clinical practice.

Getting the delivery system right is essential if therapeutics are to be developed. Considering the high risk, the team say they would take safety precautions to minimize toxicity to humans. For example, if the pen was damaged and tetrodotoxin leaked out.

“To prevent any risk of human poisoning from environmental exposure to tetrodotoxin, the amount of tetrodotoxin  in each marker pen will be kept below the minimum oral dose known to cause acute toxicity in humans. This amount is considered safe for practical use, as it is significantly lower than both the lethal dose and the dose that causes noticeable symptoms in human,” explained Zhao.

The team say because their application is topical, a much lower dose is generally needed in these cases, compared to what was tested in previous trials, where it was given as injections and therefore increasing the risk of the toxin entering the bloodstream.

Further preclinical studies will determine whether tetrodotoxin, delivered via the marker pen system, can successfully translate into a safe and effective treatment for patients.
