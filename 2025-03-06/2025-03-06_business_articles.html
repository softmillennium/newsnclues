Australian shares fell to its lowest close in more than six months, wiping off about $50 billion in market value.

While the price of Bitcoin plummeted on Friday after the US President Donald Trump's administration signalled it would not acquire additional cryptocurrencies for its strategic reserve beyond its current holdings.

Australian shares fell to its lowest close in more than six months.

The ASX 200 and the All Ordinaries index both ended Monday's session 1.8 per cent lower, wiping off about $50 billion in market value.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index fell 1.8 per cent, or by 146.5 points, to 7948.2 at close - the worst fall for the Australian indices since September last year.

The index is down more than 7.5 per cent from its all time high of 8,615.2 on February 14, and has fallen for four straight sessions amid uncertainty over US trade policy announcements.

The Australian dollar was 1.7 per cent stronger against the greenback for the week, buying 63.06 US cents.

Embattled casino group Star Entertainment will stay alive, for now, after securing a $53 million lifeline in return for selling its 50 per cent stake in the new Brisbane casino.

Star has been in talks with the owners of the other half of Brisbane's Queen's Wharf development — Hong Kong investors Far East Consortium International and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises — since mid-February.

On Friday afternoon, Far East Consortium confirmed a deal had been struck, in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Under the deal, in return for Star Entertainment's 50 per cent stake in the Queen's Wharf precinct, it will acquire the Hong Kong parties' two-thirds stake in the Gold Coast project.

It's known that rebuilding efforts from natural disasters positively impact GDP (i.e. bump it up) since the recovery expenses are counted but the losses are not. Are there any estimates for the net effect on GDP of natural disasters like cyclones or floods?

- Charles

Thanks for the question Charles.

From time to time the ABS measures natural disasters such as droughts, cyclones, floods and storms with the associated impacts reflected in economic statistics.

As it notes on its website, "these events will have had an impact on all aspects of the Australian economy to varying degrees".

Sometimes the impact is identifiable in ABS's various statistical releases after the event.

Sometimes, the modelling looks at the impact of one-off large scale disasters like cyclones. So that could very well happen in the coming months.

The Insurance Council also often puts out detailed reports on the economic impacts of natural disasters.

We will keep an eye out for any reports and report them for you over the coming weeks and months.

In the meantime, you could listen to this podcast re Why Cyclone Alfred could boost the next GDP figure.

Star Entertainment will receive a $53 million payment, in an asset swap deal with its Hong Kong investors Far East Consortium International and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises.

Under the deal, Star will sell its 50 per cent stake in its Queen's Wharf precinct in Brisbane to the two parties and, in turn, acquire the parties' 66.67 per cent stake in the Gold Coast project in Queensland, Far East confirmed a short time ago.

Star has yet to issue a statement to the stock exchange — we'll keep you updated when it does

National credit card debt hit $18 billion in January 2025 — the highest level of debt accruing interest since August 2021.

The Reserve Bank's credit card statistics showed credit card debt accruing interest rose by $172 million (up 1 per cent) in January.

It is the fourth consecutive month credit card debt has risen (excluding commercial cards).

Canstar analysis of RBA figures shows credit card debt attracting interest charges has risen every January since 2015.

Australians are paying $9.2 million in interest charges per day on a collective credit card debt of $18.02 billion, at the average interest rate of 18.71 per cent.

"That's money that could be far better spent on groceries, rent or mortgage repayments.," Canstar's Sally Tindall said.

The total value of credit card transactions rose by $21 million in January compared to the previous month.

Overall, spending on both debit and personal credit cards rose by $207 million in the month and $3.1 billion compared to the same time one year ago.

Canstar analysis of RBA credit card statistics and in-house survey data shows that of those with credit card debt, the average amount owing is estimated to be $4,420.

Costco Wholesale would consider making changes to its international supply chain if tariffs from US President Donald Trump lead to big price hikes, chief executive Ron Vachris said on a conference call.

The membership-only retailer missed Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit, but beat expectations on revenue.

Mr Vachris said while it was difficult to predict the impact of tariffs, about a third of Costco's sales in the US are imported from other countries and less than half of those are items coming from China, Mexico and Canada.

Costco could mix up its supply chain if tariffs prove painful, he said, and source from countries not exposed to them.

"As far as the tariffs go on the grocery items, our buyers deal with those like they would any other cost increase," he said.

"Sometimes the margins are much tighter in those categories, but they [buyers] are prepared to work closely with the suppliers and see how efficient we can bring goods to market - is there anything we can mitigate in those categories.

"The tariffs are very fluid right now. So it's hard to really give any predictions on what we can do, but we are prepared, our people are very well equipped to lower prices and defer any cost increase that come our way."

Costco currently operates 897 warehouses, including 617 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, seven in China, five in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand and Sweden.

The retail giant's second-quarter revenue increased to $US63.72 billion, from $US58.44 billion during the same quarter in fiscal 2024.

Net sales for the quarter rose 9.1 per cent to $US62.53 billion, compared to $US57.33 billion in the year-ago period.

Membership fees for the quarter hit $US1.19 billion, up from $US1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2024, with the company reporting 78.4 million paid memberships and 140.6 million total cardholders.

Worldwide, Costco’s membership renewal rate came in at 90.5 per cent, an increase of 0.1 per cent from last quarter.

Canadian dairy giant Saputo has sold Tasmanian cheesemaker King Island Dairy's facilities and brand to a new Australian owner.

The sale comes after more than a year on the market and the threat of closure hanging over it.

The dairy giant did not name those involved in the new entity but said it was being led by "two experienced Australian businessmen with supply chain and manufacturing expertise".

According to the corporate watchdog ASIC the entity was registered on March 3 this year, and lists Melbourne businessmen Nicholas Dobromilsky and Graeme Wilson as its directors.

"The buyer will make their own announcement in the coming days," Saputo said.

Why is ASX gradually falling since Trump is putting Tariffs on certain countries & why is this affecting my superannuation?

- Michael Langley 

Hi Michael,

While Australia isn't directly targeted by these new tariffs, economists have been warning for weeks that that a full-blown trade war could see global trade slow.

Let's not forget China remains our largest trading partner. If its economy takes a hit, so likely, will ours.

A trade war will especially impact Australia's resource exports — iron ore, coal, and natural gas - which are crucial to our economy.

A full-blown trade war could also impact the direction of local interest rates and the Aussie dollar — which has already faced much volatility.

And it knocks about investor confidence, which could see a more rocky sharemarket and a hit to your super savings.

In summary, it just makes the landscape more volatile and uncertain. Let's hope the worst isn't yet to come!

Hi Nassim . US government says it will only increase bitcoin reserve by “forfeiture”. How does that work when there is no physical coin?

- Phillip

Great question Phillip.

It isn't really clear how such a reserve would work or how it would benefit American taxpayers.

As noted, White House-appointed 'AI and Crypto Czar' David Sacks revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump signed an executive order to establish a "strategic Bitcoin".

Sacks said the US government will have a strategy to maximise the value of its holdings in such a reserve, but he didn't offer details as to how.

With the RBA's easing cycle now underway, and with underlying inflation continuing to moderate, more interest rate cuts are likely but homeowners may need to wait a little longer in the year, says Bendigo Bank's chief economist David Robertson.

"Market pricing now matches our forecast of two more rate cuts, taking the cash rate down to around 3.6 per cent by year-end," Mr Robertson said in an economic note released on Friday.

"We continue to expect a relatively shallow easing cycle, and agree with the RBA that it would be foolish to rely on an April 1 cut (when they next meet), however the next quarterly CPI data out on April 30 should reveal more evidence that inflation is slowing, allowing a second rate cut on May 20.

"Our base case forecasts centre on a steady improvement in GDP growth in 2025 and cost of living pressures subsiding as inflation moderates, further helped by RBA rate cuts and last year's tax cuts, but the global backdrop remains as unpredictable as ever."

He said with US tariffs now in force, the global outlook looked "increasingly opaque".

"US tariffs on trade with Canada, Mexico and China have just commenced, and beyond the uncertainty of what other tariffs will be imposed (and whether Australia will be exempted from them) the geopolitical landscape is remarkably complex and fast-moving, Mr Robertson said.

"Any global forecasts need to consider upside and downside scenarios, including the indirect impact of trade tensions on our largest trade partner China.

"Chinese fiscal support and targeted stimulus measures have proved successful so far and more policy support is expected, while exchange rates are also likely to play their part in offsetting tariffs."

"But the further down the horizon we look, the more opaque the outlook becomes, and stock markets are also looking more cautious as the broader impact of tariffs takes shape."

The price of Bitcoin plummeted on Friday after the US government signalled it would not acquire additional cryptocurrencies for its strategic reserve beyond its current holdings.

US President Donald Trump had sent the crypto world into a craze declaring during his reelection campaign that he would make America the the "crypto capital of the world."

He's also spent the past few months talking up a government strategic reserve that would hold bitcoin, ethereum as well as some other coins.

But White House-appointed 'AI and Crypto Czar' David Sacks revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin.

According to Sacks, the US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve, instead keeping it as a store of value. He likened the reserve to a "digital Fort Knox" for the cryptocurrency often referred to as "digital gold."

The reserve will be funded with Bitcoin owned by the federal government, obtained through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.

The executive order creates a US digital asset stockpile but the US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve.

The government will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

As a result Bitcoin slumped below $US85,000 on Friday. It's still trading down more than 3 per cent at US$87,042.06.

My colleague David Chau did a nice read in December on the promises Trump's been making on crypto and what a strategic reserve actually means. You can read that here:

Household spending rose 0.4 per cent in January, driven by Aussies spending more on areas including doctors visits and travel.

This follows a 0.2 per cent rise in December and a 0.8 per cent rise in November, according to seasonally adjusted figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

But nominal household spending slowed sharply to 2.9 per cent over the year to January, the slowest rate since September 24.

ABS head of business statistics Robert Ewing said that while spending on goods pushed up overall spending in late 2024, a 1.5 per cent rise for services drove the January growth.

In this category, health had the largest rise (+2.5 per cent), as households spent more on doctor and hospital visits.

Transport spending rose 1.1 per cent, driven by air and sea transport, as households booked in their travel plans for the year ahead.

Spending on the operation of vehicles, including petrol and motor vehicle repairs, also contributed to the rise.

But lower spending on new vehicle purchases reduced overall growth in household spending.

Also partly offsetting these rises were 1.5 per cent falls for furnishings and household equipment and clothing and footwear.

Overall goods spending fell 0.6 per cent in January, after rising for three months in a row.

Mr Ewing said the fall comes after households took advantage of promotional activity like Black Friday sales, which drove strong goods spending at the end of 2024.

The Albanese government recently introduced changes to ensure that telecommunication providers who are caught breaching industry codes will no longer be warned before being slapped with new multi-million dollar fines.

The changes allow the Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) to take direct and immediate enforcement against telcos that have breached their obligations to customers.

Currently, ACMA must respond to breaches of co-developed industry codes with a direction to comply before taking enforcement action with fines capped at $250,000.

The Albanese government's proposed change would allow ACMA to take enforcement action immediately and seek fines of up to $10 million for industry code breaches.

But a group of 22 consumer advocates known as the Fair Call Coalition has written to ACMA urging the regulator to refuse to register the Telecommunications Consumer Protections (TCP) Code and instead support direct regulation of Australia's telco industry.

Consumer Action Law Centre CEO Stephanie Tonkin said the telco industry's self-regulating code "has manifestly failed to protect consumers, especially those who are in vulnerable situations".

"It is out of step with community expectations and other essential services sectors like energy," Ms Tonkin said.

Ms Tonkin acknowledged that Communications Minister Michelle Rowland had taken some welcome steps in strengthening the ACMA's enforcement powers but said "the time has come to turn the page on the Code".

"We continue to hear from callers to our frontlines of egregious examples of telco mis-selling and harm due to poor sales practices and credit assessment requirements," she said.

"The low standard of consumer protections in many areas of the Code has not changed and its time this Code was thrown in the bin and direct regulation implemented."

Peter Gartlan, co-CEO of Financial Counselling Australia, added that everyone needs access to telecommunications services and said consumers aren't getting adequate protection.

"A self-regulating code just doesn't cut it," Mr Gartland said.

Tony Sycamore from IG has circulated a note that highlights how dire the price action has been on the stock market in recent weeks.

Here's what he's written:

"The horrific price action in the ASX200 has continued today, slipping below 8,000 for the first time in almost six months.

"This week's fall has seen the correction in the ASX200 from its 8615 high deepen to approximately 7.25%, a move that has unfolded in just four weeks. 

And he continues:

The falls this week have been driven by several factors, including US trade policy uncertainty at a time when fears of a looming US recession are rising. Locally, the falls have been exacerbated by more weakness in the big banks and worsened after BHP, RIO, South32, and energy giant Woodside all traded ex-dividend.

If the break below the psychologically important 8000 level is confirmed at the close of business today, it would open the way for the sell-off to extend towards 7600. A pullback to 7600 would be an 11% correction from the February 8615 high.

As for a potential catalyst for a turnaround in the ASX200, there isn't a clear one currently. US trade and tariff policy appears likely to remain volatile, and the upcoming Federal Election adds to the uncertainty, with the possibility of a hung parliament.

Mr Sycamore circulated that note 20 minutes ago. When he wrote it, the ASX200 index was trading at 7,996 points having lost 98 points (-1.22%).

But as I write, the ASX200 index is lower again, at 7,977 points (-1.45%).

Embattled casino operator Star Entertainment says it has been unable to reach a deal with Hong Kong investors to buy its stake in Brisbane's Queen's Wharf development.

Yesterday, there were media reports that Star was "on the brink" of inking a deal with its joint venture partners Chow Tai Fook and Far East Consortium, to buy its 50 per cent interest in the development.

This morning Star confirmed it has been in discussions, as it flagged in mid-February, but said it has been "unable to reach an agreement" to date.

The European Central Bank has cut interest rates as expected on Thursday and kept the door ajar to more, even as a looming trade war with the US and plans to boost military spending drive Europe's biggest economic policy upheaval in decades.

ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters in Frankfurt “we have huge uncertainty. Some people have used the adjective phenomenal uncertainty and we debated as to whether it was high, high and rising.”

Easing for the sixth time since June, the ECB lowered its deposit rate to 2.5% in a nod to slowing inflation and faltering growth, and said that rates were still restricting growth, even if less so than in the past.

That wording suggests that more rate cuts may be coming as the bank has long declared that restriction is no longer necessary while inflation, at 2.4% last month, is safely heading back to its 2% target this year.

The ECB lowered its 2025 economic growth forecast for the fourth straight time on Thursday, putting expansion in 2025 at just 0.9, only slightly above the 0.7% pace recorded last year.

Inflation was meanwhile seen at 2.3% this year, above the 2.1% seen three months ago.

The Australian share market is off to a gloomy start on Friday.

The ASX 200 index lost 81 points or 1 per cent to 8,014, by 10:15am AEDT.

Ten out of the 11 sectors are in the red, with basic materials (+0.1pc) the only sector that's bucking the trend.

Real estate (-1.8pc), financials (-1.7pc) and tech (-1.5pc) led the losses in the first 15 minutes of trade.

Shares of wealth manager Insignia rose 12% to $4.76, as Bain Capital and CC Capital raised their respective takeover bids to $3.34 billion, marking a pivotal moment in an escalating bidding war.

Shares of Star Entertainment were still suspended.

Here are the top and bottom movers at the open.

Insignia Financial has granted two key suiters access to its books after both Bain Capital and CC Capital raised their respective takeover bids to $3.34 billion, marking a pivotal moment in an escalating bidding war.

Insignia said on Friday the two firms now vying for control of one of Australia's largest wealth management firms had increased their per-share offers to $5 each — an 8.7% premium over their previous $4.60 bids.

Bain, best known in Australia for acquiring Virgin Australia out of administration, and CC Capital, a Wall Street-based private equity firm, now appear to have the upper hand after investment giant Brookfield entered the contest last month with a matching bid.

Insignia, formerly known as IOOF, oversees approximately $327 billion in client assets, making it the third-largest player in Australia's superannuation sector. 

Australia's publicly traded wealth management firms are drawing interest from investors attracted to the country's thriving pension system.

The embattled casino operator Star Entertainment seems to have lost a major shareholder.

The company posted a statement on the stock exchange last night, saying it's become aware that State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries ceased to be a substantial shareholder on 4 March 2025.

"The Company’s Constitution, as well as certain agreements entered into with Liquor and Gaming New South Wales and the Queensland Office of Liquor and Gaming Regulation, contain restrictions prohibiting an individual from having a voting power of more than 10% in the Company," Star said in an ASX announcement.

"The Company may refuse to register any transfer of shares which would contravene these shareholding restrictions or require divestiture of the shares that cause an individual to exceed the shareholding restrictions."

Shares in Star Entertainment have been suspended since Monday because it failed to report half-yearly profit results to the ASX by last Friday's deadline.

The company previously said that it couldn't finalise the results unless it received a substantial cash injection to stave off financial collapse.

The Australian Financial Review reported yesterday that Hong Kong investors have offered $50 million in exchange for the Brisbane casino and the rest of its Queensland operation.

So how did Star get here? Watch this short explainer video.

US President Donald Trump said Thursday he planned to visit Saudi Arabia, suggesting a deal for major investment from the kingdom that has become the key venue for US diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine.

Trump, asked if he would meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia, confirmed his intention to visit the oil-rich Gulf nation but suggested that business was the main motive. 

"I'm going to Saudi Arabia," Trump told reporters, without mentioning a date.

"I said, I'll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies, (spreading) the purchase over a four-year period, of a trillion dollars," he said, referring to the duration of his presidency.

"They've agreed to do that, so I'm going to be going there."

Trump, who has yet to travel overseas since returning to the White House, made Saudi Arabia his first foreign destination after he took office in 2017.

He said recently that he decided to visit Saudi Arabia rather than Britain on his first trip in 2017 because the Arab kingdom promised to buy $450 billion worth of US products.

Trump has forged close business ties with Saudi Arabia, with the Trump Organization in December announcing a Trump Tower in Jeddah.

In his last term, Trump boasted of shielding Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from consequences over the killing of US-based Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, with the president citing the importance of Saudi purchases of US weapons.

Former president Joe Biden initially vowed to make the crown prince a "pariah" due to human rights but his administration later courted Saudi Arabia, including with a draft defense agreement, as it sought to encourage it to recognize Israel.

The Trump administration has vowed to move full-speed with trying to persuade Saudi Arabia to normalize with Israel, in what would be a landmark step as the kingdom is home to Islam's two holiest sites.

Walgreens Boots Alliance says it has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners as the struggling retailer looks to turn itself around after years of losing money. 

Walgreens said Thursday that Sycamore will pay $11.45 per share, giving the deal an equity value just under $10 billion. Shareholders could eventually receive up to another $3 per share under certain conditions. 

A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street's reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927. 

Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations. 

The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.

The company also said last August that it was reviewing a U.S. health care operation it had expanded aggressively, and it might sell all or part of its VillageMD clinic business. That announcement came less than two years after the company said it would spend billions to expand it. 

Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said. 

Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement. 

Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.

Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.

"Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan," the analyst wrote. "Without cash flow, none of the value cases work."

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.

The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Remaining publicly traded drugstore operators include the nation's largest, CVS Health Corp., and retailers like Walmart and the grocer Kroger that run pharmacies at many of their locations.

"This lawsuit is an affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact," writes Thomas Riney, a lawyer for CBS, in the filing.


							By 

	Winston Cho



	Without a settlement in sight, Paramount Global is looking to dismiss President Trump’s lawsuit against its CBS News unit from a federal court in Texas, which has become a hot spot for legal battles advancing conservative legal causes.


	CBS is incorporated in New York, but Trump’s legal team chose to sue in the Northern District of Texas, prompting concerns that he’s cherry-picking judges by filing the lawsuit at a court where a sympathetic judge is likely to oversee the case. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who’s overseeing the litigation, was nominated to his position by Trump in 2017 and has been a member of the Federalist Society since 2012. In his five years on the bench, he’s issued rulings to block Biden-era rules regarding immigration, health care and discrimination. He’s the only judge in the Amarillo division of the court, making it a near certainty that he’s assigned cases filed at that location.

	“This lawsuit is an affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact,” writes Thomas Riney, a lawyer for CBS, in the filing. Trump seeks to “punish a news organization for constitutionally protected editorial judgments they do not like.”


	Last month, Trump revised his lawsuit to add Republican U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, his former doctor who lives in Texas, as a plaintiff to keep the case in Texas federal court. The case revolves around allegations that CBS News aired a “heavily tampered interview” with former Vice President Kamala Harris to help her in the election by editing certain answers in a way that misled consumers. This manipulation of the interview, Trump alleged, constitutes a violation of Texas’ consumer protection law covering deceptive advertising and the unfair competition prong of the Lanham Act, a trademark law.


	In Thursday’s filing, CBS argues that the inclusion of Jackson in the lawsuit is a “vain effort to manufacture a connection to this District.” It stresses that Jackson has spent the majority of the last decade based in Washington, D.C. and that the complaint doesn’t sufficiently allege that he watched or suffered an injury from the 60 Minutes segment at the center of the legal battle in the state.


	CBS also says that the lawsuit doesn’t belong in Texas because the 60 Minutes segment, which was focused on the national presidential election, didn’t target Texans more than residents of other states.

	











	“The interview of Vice President Kamala Harris, excerpts of which aired on Face the Nation and 60 Minutes, was not filmed, edited, or produced in Texas, nor was Texas in any way the subject of the interview,” the filing states. “If this district has personal jurisdiction merely because CBS programs are broadcast nationwide, so too does every district court in the country. That is not the law.”


	If the lawsuit isn’t dismissed, CBS claims that it should be moved to federal court in New York.


	Paramount declined to comment.

Much like all the upheaval shaking the world, the huge swings rocking Wall Street may feel far from normal

You May Want to Jump off Wall Street's Wild Ride, but Remember: This Is What the Market Does

NEW YORK (AP) — Much like all the upheaval shaking the world, the huge swings rocking Wall Street may feel far from normal. But, for investing at least, all this is typical.

Sharp moves for the U.S. stock market, like its recent 6% drop in just a couple of weeks, happen regularly. Stomaching them is the price investors have to pay for the bigger returns that stocks can offer over other investments in the long term. 

This time doesn't look much different, experts say. Here's a glimpse at what's behind the market's wild moves and what experts are advising investors young and old to consider: 



  THE MARKET IS BAD, RIGHT?
 

It has certainly struggled. The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, has been dropping since setting an all-time high last month, largely because of worries about President Donald Trump's tariffs and signals that the U.S. economy is running less powerfully than economists expected. 

Any kind of uncertainty around the economy will give Wall Street pause. These tariffs have had a particularly jostling effect because no one knows how long Trump will go through with them. When worries are high, stocks sink sharply. When Wall Street goes back to thinking Trump is using tariffs as just a negotiating tactic, stocks have bounced back, such as on Wednesday. 



  STOCKS DO THIS OFTEN?
 

Yes. The S&P 500 has regularly seen declines bigger than this recent one, of 10% or more, every year or so. Often, experts view them as a culling of optimism that can otherwise run overboard, driving stock prices too high. 

Before this recent stumble, many critics were already saying the U.S. stock market was too expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits. They also pointed to how only a handful of companies was driving so much of the market's returns. A group of just seven Big Tech companies accounted for more than half of the S&P 500's total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. 



  SHOULD I SELL AND GET OUT? 
 

Anytime an investor sees they’re losing money, it feels bad. This recent run feels particularly unnerving because of how incredibly calm the market had previously been. The S&P 500 is coming off a second straight year where it shot up by more than 20%, the first time that's happened since baggy pants were last in style before the millennium. 

Selling may offer some feeling of relief. But it also locks in losses and prevents the chance of making the money back over time. Historically, the S&P 500 has come back from every one of its downturns to eventually make investors whole again. That includes after the Great Depression, the dot-com bust and the 2020 COVID crash. 

Some recoveries take longer than others, but experts often recommend not putting money into stocks that you can't afford to lose for several years, up to 10. 

“Data has shown, historically, that no one can time the market,” said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of WalletHub. “No one can consistently figure out the best time to buy and sell.”

Put another way: “Keep on keeping on,” suggests Chris Fasciano, vice president, investment management and research, and chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.



  SHOULD I CHANGE ANYTHING WITH MY INVESTMENTS?
 

Even as the overall U.S. stock market has dropped, some corners outside the Magnificent Seven have done much better, Fasciano said. So have stocks outside the United States.

It could all be a reminder that investors often do best when they have a mixed set of investments rather than going all-in on just a few. And investors may no longer be as diversified as they thought after years of sheer dominance by the Magnificent Seven over the U.S. stock market and by Wall Street over global markets. 

“Now’s the time to revisit some of the old tried-and-true of portfolio construction, like diversification,” Fasciano said. 



  I JUST STARTED INVESTING IN STOCKS. WHAT SHOULD I DO?
 

The proliferation of online trading platforms and the ease of smartphones has helped create a new generation of investors who may not be used to such volatility. 

But the good news is younger investors often have the gift of time. With decades to go until retirement, they can afford to ride the waves and let their stock portfolios hopefully recover before compounding and eventually growing even bigger. 

“We would advise younger investors to not worry about this at all,” said Phil Battin, CEO of Ambassador Wealth Management. "It’s just background noise. If you have 30 to 50 years until you need the money, the economy has survived world wars, oil embargoes, presidential assassinations, Y2K, and a global pandemic. It will survive the Trump tariffs as well.”



  WHAT ABOUT CRYPTO?
 

This is a little trickier. “In theory, part of the appeal of crypto is that it’s supposed to be a hedge investment that isn’t correlated with the stock market or the fiat-currency economy,” said Sam Taube, lead investing writer for NerdWallet. 

But in reality, at least recently, crypto has often gone down in price when stocks have gone down, instead of offering that hoped-for protection during Wall Street's sell-offs. "So, young investors may need to rethink the idea that crypto’s value is completely independent of the stock market and broader economy,” Taube said.



  WHAT IF I'M NEAR RETIREMENT?
 

Older investors have less time than younger ones to allow their investments to bounce back. But even in retirement, some people will need their investments to last 30 years or more, said Niladri “Neel” Mukherjee, chief investment officer of TIAA Wealth Management.

People who have already retired may want to cut back on spending and withdrawals after sharp market downturns, because bigger withdrawals will remove more potential compounding ability in the future. But even retirees, at least in the early part of retirement, should still be invested in stocks to prepare for the possibility of decades of spending ahead. 

“You may want to slow that down and pick that back up once the market recovers,” Mukherjee said, “but it all comes down to having that conversation with your adviser and your portfolio manager.”



  HOW LONG WILL THIS LAST?
 

No one knows, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

What if the key to economic success isn’t just supporting entrepreneurs but thinking like one? 

Communities focus on attracting high-growth companies, but the real advantage comes when they adopt the same mindset as the innovators they seek to attract.

Legendary basketball coach John Wooden wisely noted, “Don’t mistake activity for achievement.” Entrepreneurs embody this principle. They don’t measure success by how many meetings they attend or how many pitches they make. Instead, they define bold visions, set clear milestones and track tangible progress. When something isn’t working, they adjust. Their success depends not on effort alone but on measurable results.

Economic development organizations and the communities they serve should adopt a similar approach. Often, there’s a focus on reporting past activities like companies recruited, jobs promised and capital invested without setting long-term outcome goals or assessing whether these efforts are the best way to strengthen the local economy. Key questions to consider include: Is household wealth increasing? How does our economy compare to peer communities? Are we positioned for future economic success? These are the real measures of economic health.

Venture capitalist John Doerr advocates for objectives and key results, a framework employed by leading innovative companies around the world. The concept is straightforward: set ambitious, measurable goals and adjust based on outcomes, not activities. Entrepreneurs thrive using this model and communities can, too.

Embracing this mindset is essential. Economic development must be as agile as the businesses it supports. By setting clear goals, tracking progress, and adjusting as needed, communities can move from activity to real achievement. Those that think like entrepreneurs won’t just attract innovators — they’ll become centers of innovation themselves.

John Moore is a principal with Momenteum Strategies, an Upstate-based consulting firm specializing in helping communities and their economic development organizations build thriving, impactful innovation ecosystems.

			1.41pm 6th March 2025	 -

La Cala Resort has unveiled a series of renovations and new experiences that further enhance the world-class facilities at the luxury golf and lifestyle destination located on Spain’s Costa del Sol. 

The resort, which is owned by FBD Hotels & Resorts, undertook an extensive renovation project over the winter, transforming half of its 107 rooms with a modern and stylish redesign. Guests will now enjoy more spacious rooms equipped with modern furnishings and a décor that reflects the essence of Andalusian heritage. 

Each room features balconies or terraces, air conditioning, twin or double beds, and USB sockets for charging devices. Golfers will particularly appreciate the golf bag racks in the newly designed walk-in closets.

“We’re delighted to announce that the first part of our room renovations is complete, and we are now ready to welcome guests to experience both the comfort of our updated rooms and the fantastic facilities we offer,” said Sean Corte-Real, General Manager of La Cala Resort. “With everything in place, it’s the perfect time to escape to the Costa del Sol, where guests can enjoy our three championship golf courses, which have been extensively improved over the last five years.”

La Cala Resort has also introduced a golf simulator featuring the latest sensor technology for unparalleled precision. Guests can now play a few holes in the Sports Lounge, located in the clubhouse, and experience the thrill of playing at famous courses like Pebble Beach or preparing for their next day’s game on the La Cala courses.

In addition to its new rooms and golf experiences, La Cala Resort continues to deliver exceptional dining options. The newly renovated La Terraza restaurant now features a large terrace area offering stunning views of the pool, a private dining area and a new buffet section for breakfast. La Terraza will serve a new Tapas & Mediterranean inspired menu to guests in the evening. 

A second addition to the dining lineup is the new Steakhouse restaurant, which has been crafted for salad and steak lovers alike. While its main feature will be steaks cooked on charcoal, the menu will also feature a selection of succulent salads based on seasonal ingredients. All this is accompanied by carefully selected beers, IPAs, and vermouths that are perfect for every taste.

Canadian provinces pulling US alcohol off store shelves in response to Trump trade policy is "worse than tariffs", the boss of Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman has said.

Several Canadian provinces, including Ontario, which is by far the most populated, took action this week in retaliation for US tariffs on Canadian goods.

The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), one of the largest buyers of alcohol in the world, removed US-made alcoholic drinks from its shelves on Tuesday.

Brown-Forman boss Lawson Whiting said the Canadian response was "disproportionate" to the 25% levies on Canadian goods imposed by the Trump administration.

"I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves," Mr Whiting said.

In response to the tariffs, Canada has retaliated with 25% levies on goods imported from the US, including beer, spirits, and wine.

Some provinces also took action themselves, including Ontario and Nova Scotia.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the LCBO sells nearly $1bn of US alcohol per year. "As of today, every single one of these products is off the shelves," Mr Ford said on Tuesday.

The LCBO is the exclusive wholesaler in Ontario, which means other retailers, bars and restaurants in the province will no longer be able to restock US products, Mr Ford said.

Nevertheless, Mr Whiting said Canada makes up only 1% of Brown-Forman's total sales, so the firm can withstand the hit.

Canadians are being advised by the LCBO to buy products made in Canada. Some Canadians have been turning to local goods anyway in response to the Trump tariffs.

Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, criticised the US tariffs on Tuesday, saying imposing them was "a very dumb thing to do".

He also accused the US president of planning "a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us".

Trump has made a number of remarks about making Canada the 51st state of his country, which Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has said she takes "very seriously".

Washington has also placed 25% tariffs on Mexico, although Trump has said he will temporarily spare carmakers in both Canada and Mexico from the taxes.

Trump has accused both Canada and Mexico of failing to do enough to stem the flow of the fentanyl opioid into the US, an argument that has been rejected by both countries.

Mr Whiting said Brown-Forman was going to see what happens in Mexico, which accounted for 7% of its sales in 2024.

Pharmaceutical giant Merck received a $30.2 million grant from the state in an effort to sway the company to build its $900 million manufacturing facility in the Wilmington area.

The taxpayer-funded grant is the highest amount that has been doled out to a company since Bloom Energy’s approval in 2011.

Merck & Co. has not confirmed whether or not it will choose Delaware as its place to expand, but business leaders in Delaware are optimistic about what the potential move could mean for the state.

Merck & Co. is a global health care company that specializes in the production and distribution of vaccines, pharmaceuticals and animal health care products.

Merck has been looking for a location to set up their newest manufacturing facility, which will produce drug substances and products with a targeted operational start date of 2030.

According to plans shared with Delaware Online/The News Journal via a Freedom of Information Act request, the company is considering constructing a $900 million multi-building complex for labs, manufacturing and distribution operations at the Chestnut Run Innovation and Science Park near Greenville.

Under the conservative estimates listed in the plans, the facility would bring roughly 375 full-time jobs to the area.

The company is reportedly still considering other locations, but is bound by nondisclosure agreements to reveal more about the other possibilities, as reported by the Delaware Business Times.

If Merck chooses the Delaware site, the company would be locked into a 20-year lease at the CRISP campus.

This wouldn’t be Merck’s first venture into the First State, however. The company already has an animal health facility in Millsboro.

The Delaware Council on Development Finance unanimously approved the grant application on Monday, Feb. 24.

The grant was divided into $4.7 million worth in job performance grants and $25.5 million in capital expenditure grants. The performance grants are dispersed after the company makes its investments into the facility and workforce.

Although nothing is promised yet, Michael Fleming, president and CEO of the Delaware Bioscience Association, remains optimistic and said that this deal could cement Delaware as a winner in the area in terms of attracting industrial and scientific investment.

“This new facility would be a tremendous boost for and validation of the growth and momentum of our dynamic life science industry,” Fleming said. “We look forward to welcoming Merck and applaud their interest in strengthening U.S. manufacturing and our supply chain right here in Delaware.

Susan Colby, senior manager of communications for the Delaware Prosperity Partnership echoed that the move would boost Delaware’s portfolio.

“This project would reinforce Delaware’s standing in the global biopharmaceutical ecosystem, and we are excited by the potential opportunities it would provide Delaware residents and businesses,” Colby said.  

As for what Merck has to say about the grant, Ned Ehrbar, associate director of Merck’s global media relations kept it vague, stating via email: Merck is considering Delaware as a potential location to develop a new commercialization and launch facility.

The CRISP campus, located at 984 Centre Road just outside of Greenville, has long been a mainstay in the state’s evolving life sciences investment.

Formerly a site for DuPont research, the 164-acre site was purchased by MRA Group in 2021 with hopes of transforming the site into the leading campus for Delaware’s life science laboratories and research facilities.

Amenities for the campus will include a hotel, childcare and fitness centers, an outdoor amphitheater and accommodations for restaurants.  

Chemical manufacturing company Solenis expanded its research and development facilities into the CRISP campus in late 2022 and precision oncology company Prelude Therapeutics cut the ribbon on their new headquarters at CRISP in February, 2024. DuPont is also leasing 190,000 square-feet of space at its former space.

Last month, the developer group broke ground on the Marriott Residence Inn, which will feature 127 rooms with both short- and long-term stay options, food services, a full-service bar, meeting spaces and outdoor patios

MRA Group declined to comment on the recently approved grant for Merck.

Awarding these grants worth tens of millions of dollars involves a process that is relatively new, with various “checks and balances” in place, but limited transparency at times.  

The Delaware Economic Development Authority was created by the General Assembly under former Gov. John Carney, intended to promote economic activity in Delaware. It is chaired by CJ Bell, the director of the Delaware Division of Small Business.

The Council on Development Finance is an advisor to the Delaware Economic Development Authority, and is responsible for conducting public hearings before the authority issues any financial support to potential projects.

The Delaware Prosperity Partnership, a nonprofit state economic development agency, often vets applications or potential investment opportunities and brings them to the Council. As previously reported by DelawareOnline, since DPP is not technically a part of the state government, it is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.

In the seven years of its existence, the Council on Development Finance has approved every Strategic Funds application that has been brought to it by the Delaware Prosperity Partnership.

The $30 million grant offered to Merck will be reimbursed after the company makes its investment – in this case, a nearly $1 billion one.

In 2021, the Council on Development Finance approved $19 million for WuXi AppTec, a Shanghai-based company that develops and manufactures drugs for pharmaceutical clients, to build its manufacturing campus near Middletown’s Amazon fulfillment center.

Gov. Matt Meyer has gone on record against these types of taxpayer-funded grants, announcing during a Delaware State Chamber of Commerce annual dinner that his administration will see “the use of cash assistance de-emphasized,” as reported by Spotlight Delaware.

Meyer’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the most recent grant funding.
