                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It might be an everyday occasion for many, but July 28 marked National Soccer Day. From hosting major tournaments like the Club World Cup, Copa America and more to the rise of Major League Soccer with Lionel Messi and more stars involved, the state of soccer is in formidable shape heading into next year's World Cup. Get top local stories delivered to you every morning with NBC DFW's News Headlines newsletter. "It's great that Lowe's is making an initiative to to really back a sport that in one year it feels like we're reaching a junction point," Nico said. "And for somebody that has family that has been seeing the growth of soccer in this country forever, it's incredible to see that a brand as big as Lowe's is ready to take the next step and accompany the growth of this sport, into a new age." Andres, who will be a focal point of Telemundo's 2026 World Cup coverage, has been in the broadcasting business for several decades, while he played a key role in helping his son find his voice. Nico got his first role at age 15 in high school through Andres' radio network Futbol de Primera, where he was assigned sideline reporting gigs. Fast forward to today, Nico has covered the Champions League, Europa League and more with CBS Sports Golazo, as well as even commentating games with his dad. Andres discussed what it meant to him seeing his son flourish in the industry. "I knew that was going to be natural for him," Andres said. "But obviously seeing him every morning on national television and doing all his stuff, calling games in Spanish and English and doing the incredible job that he does for Golazo network with the wrap around show around the Champions League and the Europa League and now Conference League, it's really touching because I can't separate my feelings because after all, he's my son. And, you know, I really admire what he's doing at the professional level." But while Andres has been made proud by his son, the U.S. men's national team, a side he routinely covers, there's a slightly different feeling following the Gold Cup runner-up finish to Mexico despite Mauricio Pochettino's squad missing several key players. "It's a pity that Pochettino didn't have his full squad in this tournament because it's the last official tournament before they go into the World Cup. "So, he had way too many absentees in this Gold Cup. So, I think it's a work in progress and I hope that, you know, come the next one, double window in September, that he gets the team together and starts winning." "If I may be a little bit harsher, if there are certain check points that you want to be hitting a year out from the World Cup," Nico started. They're not wrongs that you can't right in a year's time from now. But we were so hopeful for a top performance that would really inspire for U.S. men's national team fans a year out from the World Cup. And I don't think we got that fully, especially with the absences of several players.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Technology, hydration, and business: a new model of football entertainment Another major change under consideration is expanding the use of VAR. Currently limited to decisions involving goals, penalties, straight red cards, or mistaken identity, the proposal would allow VAR to intervene in corner kicks, throw-ins, goal kicks, and even plays that could lead to a second yellow card. This expansion raises an ongoing debate: how far should technology go in football? Some argue that too much interference could disrupt the natural rhythm of the game, while others see it as a necessary tool to improve fairness and reduce human error. Additionally, FIFA is reportedly considering doubling the number of hydration breaks during matches. Instead of two, there would be four: in the 15th, 30th, 60th, and 75th minutes. What stands out is that these breaks could also be used for commercial purposes, similar to what happens in basketball or American football. The 2026 World Cup will be the first with 48 national teams and 104 matches, and it's shaping up to be a testing ground for new rules that could shape football's future. No official decisions have been made yet, but the discussion is already underway. Are fans, players, and coaches ready to embrace these changes?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer's most anticipated tournament is still a year away, but when the 2026 FIFA World Cup sweeps across North America, experts are expecting to see fans in record numbers descending on the 16 host cities. Expedia's trove of booking data shows just how much the World Cup is already driving travel trends: searches for travel in host cities in the US, Canada, and Mexico are up 125 percent compared to this time last year. It's both Americans and international travelers searching for reservations, according to Expedia Travel Expert Melanie Fish, with searches to host cities from domestic travelers up 120 percent year-over-year across the board. Expedia's data shows that spikes in searches (and accompanied price surges) are noticeable on match days, not spread across the whole summer. That indicates searches are tied to World Cup travel, rather than reflecting a general growing interest in those cities. In Seattle, hotel interest soared 185 percent for the June 19 group-stage match. Fish has advice for Matador Network readers thinking about booking World Cup travel: “Turn on Price Alerts in the Expedia app so you'll get notified when prices drop.” Demand has already started driving up hotel searches and rates for tournament dates, according to Expedia's data. Fish advises that fans keep an eye on schedules and try to beat the rush. “Fans are already scouting out where their teams will play, and once the matchups are finalized, we'll likely see a big spike in travel planning,” she told Matador Network. Because of this, she advises booking stays now, and making sure they're refundable. That way, you'll have a reservation lined up if your team of choice is playing. If you wait, expect prices to climb further, even this far out. “Demand is heating up, so now's the moment to be strategic,” she adds. As of now, Mexico's three host cities offer the most affordable hotels and flight prices. For cost-conscious fans, Mexico is the “budget-friendly MVP,” according to Fish. They're significant differences, with the data showing that average hotel rates over game days are about 50 percent lower than US host cities, and 55 percent lower than Vancouver and Toronto. That means savvy fans could feasibly attend multiple matches in Mexico across different cities for the cost of attending one game in a more expensive city, like Vancouver. And Fish notes that the distinct local culture in each city, combined with an abundance of lodging options, makes them a great pick for people who want to experience more than just a soccer match. Cities like Fort Lauderdale (near Miami) offer good proximity and lower hotel costs. Travelers can stretch their dollars by booking hotels just outside, rather than in, host cities. Places like Fort Worth (40 minutes from Dallas) or Fort Lauderdale (45 minutes from Miami) are likely to have comparable quality hotels and resorts,  but at much lower rates. Cities that are close to stadiums “can save you $50 or more per night,” Fish advises. While you may expect cities like Vancouver or San Francisco to be the most expensive, it's actually Dallas that stands as the priciest destination for fans, outpacing all other host cities when it comes to hotel rates and overall expenses. Dallas also has fewer hotel options than places like New York, LA, or Miami, creating noteworthy price differences. It could also be that travelers are realizing Dallas' convenience, especially if they plan to attend multiple matches. Interestingly, Kansas City is seeing a massive 380 percent increase in travel searches over the World Cup. “It's also smack dab in the middle of the country,” she says, “so it takes less time to get there by air or car for a lot of fans.” However, the number one takeaway based on Expedia data and expert advice is to make your plans soon — but also plan for flexibility. As Fish recommends, “book your stays early, but just make sure they're refundable. That way, you lock in a good deal now but still have the flexibility to change plans later if needed.” With demand only expected to intensify as kickoff approaches, those who plan ahead will be in the best position to watch their team while avoiding the worst sticker shock on World Cup travel.</p>

South Korea and Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-Min hinted at retirement after the 2026 FIFA World Cup, while announcing his exit from Tottenham Hotspur before the 2025-26 season, on Friday. The 33-year-old won the Europa League with Spurs last season, their first major trophy in 17 years, and has spent a decade at the Premier League side, scoring 173 goals in 454 appearances. “When I first arrived at Tottenham 10 years ago, I was a young boy who couldn't even speak English well. I believe timing is crucial in saying goodbye, and now feels like the right time,” Son said.

Son made his senior international debut against Syria before the 2011 AFC Asian Cup and has 51 international goals, the second-highest in South Korean football, after Cha Bum-kun.
