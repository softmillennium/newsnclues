                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CANNES — Ten years ago, Vitalik Buterin and a small band of developers huddled in a drafty Berlin loft strung with dangling lightbulbs, laptops balanced on mismatched chairs and chipped tables. They weren't corporate titans or venture-backed founders — just idealists working long nights to push a radical idea into reality. From that sparse office, they launched "Frontier," Ethereum's first live network. But it could mine, execute smart contracts, and let developers test decentralized applications. It was the spark that transformed Ethereum from an abstract concept into a living, breathing system. Bitcoin had captured headlines as "digital gold," but what they built was something else entirely: programmable money, a financial operating system where code could move funds, enforce contracts, and create businesses without banks or brokers. One year earlier and 520 miles away in Zurich, Paul Brody got a call from IBM security: A kid was wandering the lab unattended. The blockchain was still in its alpha stage, an early version of what would become a $420 billion platform rewiring Wall Street and powering decentralized finance, NFTs, and tokenized markets across the globe. Brody, then leading a research team at IBM, remembers how quickly the idea clicked. He's got a really cool idea...It's like a version of bitcoin, but we're going to make it much faster and programmable,'" he said. "And when he said that to me, I thought, 'That's it. With Buterin's help, IBM built its first blockchain prototype on Ethereum's early code, unveiling it at CES in 2015 alongside Samsung. "That was how I ended up down this path," Brody said. "I was done with all other technology and basically made the switch to blockchain." Even now, as EY's global blockchain leader, Brody remembers feeling a pang of envy. "This is a kid, and it doesn't matter," he said. Now, a decade later, that experiment has quietly rewired global markets. Since then, Ethereum has become "this big thing," Buterin reflected, with major corporations now launching assets on both its base layer and layer-two networks. Parts of national economies are beginning to run on Ethereum infrastructure, a far cry from its cypherpunk origins. One concern is that if too few issuers or intermediaries dominate, they could become "de facto controllers of the ecosystem." He described a scenario where Ethereum might appear open, but, in practice, all the keys are managed by centralized providers. Two years earlier in Prague, CNBC met Buterin at Paralelní Polis, a sprawling industrial complex turned anarchist tech hub in the city's Holešovice district. The building's labyrinthine staircases and shadowed corridors felt like a physical map of the crypto world itself — part resistance movement, part experiment in reimagining power. It was a place built on Václav Benda's concept of a "parallel society," where decentralized technologies offered refuge from state surveillance and control. It's the kind of place where Buterin, a self-described nomad, found himself at home among cypherpunks and cryptographic idealists. "Just being able to plug into the international economy — these are things that they don't have, and these are things that provide huge value for people there." Even in Prague, where coders worked to make payments fast and censorship-resistant, the technology felt like a resistance movement — privacy-preserving, anti-authoritarian, a lifeline in countries where banking collapses were common and money couldn't be trusted. This year, Buterin keynoted Ethereum's flagship conference at the Palais des Festivals — the same red carpet venue that hosts movie stars each spring. It was a fitting symbol of Ethereum's journey: from underground hacker dens to a network that governments, banks, and brokerages are now racing to build upon. "The global financial system is really nicely described as a whole network of pipes," he said. "What's happening now is that Ethereum is getting plumbed into this infrastructure," Brody continued, noting that until recently, crypto operated on entirely separate rails from traditional finance. Now, he said, Ethereum is being wired directly into core transaction systems, setting the stage for massive financial flows — from investors to everyday savers — to migrate away from older mechanisms toward Ethereum-based platforms that can move money faster, at lower cost, and with more advanced functionality than legacy systems allow. Stablecoins — digital dollars that live on Ethereum — power trillions in payments, tokenized assets and funds are moving on-chain, and Robinhood recently rolled out tokenized U.S. equities via Arbitrum, an Ethereum-based layer two. Circle's USDC — the second-largest stablecoin — still settles around 65% of its volume on Ethereum's rails. Between Circle's IPO and the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, now signed into law by President Donald Trump, regulators have new reason to engage with, rather than fight, this transformation. Data from Deutsche Bank shows stablecoin transactions hit $28 trillion last year — more than Mastercard and Visa combined. The bank itself has announced plans to build a tokenization platform on zkSync, a fast, cost-efficient Ethereum layer two designed to help asset managers issue and manage tokenized funds, stablecoins, and other real-world assets while meeting regulatory and data protection requirements. As part of its quarterly earnings release, Coinbase said this week it's launching tokenized stocks and prediction markets for U.S. users in the coming months, a move that would diversify its revenue stream and bring it into more direct competition with brokerages like Robinhood and eToro. Kraken announced plans to offer 24/7 trading of U.S. stock tokens in select overseas markets. BlackRock's tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, launched on Ethereum last year, offering qualified investors on-chain access to yield with real-time redemptions settled in USDC. Even as newer blockchains tout faster speeds and lower fees, Ethereum has proven its staying power as the trusted network for global finance. Buterin told CNBC in Cannes that there's a misconception about what institutions actually want. "A lot of institutions basically tell us to our faces that they value Ethereum because it's stable and dependable, because it doesn't go down," he said. He added that firms frequently ask about privacy and other long-term features — the kinds of concerns that institutions, he said, "really value." Institutions are choosing various layer twos to meet specific needs — Robinhood uses Arbitrum, Deutsche Bank zkSync, Coinbase and Kraken Optimism — but they all ultimately settle on Ethereum's base layer. He said that in most technology standards wars, one platform ultimately dominates. In his view, Ethereum is likely to become that dominant programmability layer, while Bitcoin plays a complementary role as a risk-off, scarcity-driven asset. Ten years of upgrades with a huge dedication to security and censorship resistance." When institutions send an order to the market, they want to be sure that it's treated fairly, that nobody has preference, and that the transaction is executed at the time when it's delivered. Those assurances have become more valuable as traditional finance moves on-chain. The network has weathered spectacular booms and busts, rivals promising faster speeds, and criticism that it's too slow or expensive for mass adoption. In 2022, Ethereum replaced its old transaction validation method, proof-of-work — where armies of computers competed to solve puzzles — with proof-of-stake, where users lock up their ether as collateral to help secure the network. The shift cut Ethereum's energy use by more than 99% and set the stage for upgrades aimed at making apps faster and cheaper to run on its base layer. The next decade will test whether Ethereum can scale without compromise. Implementing those, Buterin said, is part of the path to making Ethereum "a really valuable part of global infrastructure that helps make the internet and the economy a more free and open place." Buterin believes the real change won't come with fireworks. "This type of disruption doesn't feel like overturning the existing system," he said. "It feels like building a new thing that just keeps growing and growing until eventually more and more people realize you don't even have to look at the old thing if you didn't want to." Wire transfers are moving on-chain, assets like stocks and real estate are being tokenized, and eventually, he said, businesses will run entire contracts — the money, the products, the terms and conditions — automatically on a single, shared infrastructure. That shift, Brody added, won't simply copy old financial systems onto new technology. My key hypothesis is that as we build new financial products, it will be attractive to build them on blockchain rails — and we'll try to do things on blockchain rails that we can't do today." If Brody and Buterin are right, the real disruption won't make headlines. It'll simply become the way money moves, unseen and unstoppable.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SpaceX delivered a fresh crew to the International Space Station on Saturday, making the trip in a quick 15 hours. The four U.S., Russian and Japanese astronauts pulled up in their SpaceX capsule after launching from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. They will spend at least six months at the orbiting lab, swapping places with colleagues up there since March. Moving in are NASA's Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov — each of whom had been originally assigned to other missions. Cardman and another astronaut were pulled from a SpaceX flight last year to make room for NASA's two stuck astronauts, Boeing Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose space station stay went from one week to more than nine months. Fincke and Yui had been training for the next Starliner mission. But with Starliner grounded by thruster and other problems until 2026, the two switched to SpaceX. Platonov was bumped from the Soyuz launch lineup a couple of years ago because of an undisclosed illness. Their arrival temporarily puts the space station population at 11. "It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time," Cardman said once on board. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for alleged political violations of the Hatch Act, an accusation levied by President Donald Trump and other prominent Republicans but one, as publicly presented, void of specific evidence of wrongdoing. Notably, the OSC, which is different than an office of a special counsel appointed by the Department of Justice, lacks the authority to bring criminal charges and prosecute individuals who violate the Hatch Act. The OSC may seek disciplinary action for a federal government employee, such as removal from the civil workforce, or refer its findings of Hatch Act violations to the DOJ for investigation. On Wednesday, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., requested that the OSC investigate Smith for "unprecedented interference in the 2024 election." The OSC confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that it is investigating the alleged violations, and a source familiar says the OSC affirmed to Cotton that it is proceeding with its inquiry after his request. Smith was tapped as special counsel by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to oversee the federal investigations into Trump, who announced his candidacy for the presidency three days before Smith's appointment. Smith would go on to bring two criminal indictments against then-candidate Trump in 2023 but resigned just over one week before Trump's inauguration in January 2024 — without ever having brought the two cases to trial. "Jack Smith's legal actions were nothing more than a tool for the Biden and Harris campaigns," Cotton wrote on X, this week. "This isn't just unethical, it is very likely illegal campaign activity from a public office." The Republican lawmaker has not publicly presented evidence that details how Smith's actions were illegal in nature. Hatch Act violations are not typically referred to the Department of Justice. A White House official told NBC News that Paul Ingrassia, a former podcast host with a history of incendiary commentary, is meeting with senators in one-on-one meetings over the next month before a confirmation vote takes place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway posted a 4% drop in operating earnings to $11.2 billion in its first quarterly earnings report since the legendary investor revealed he plans to step down as CEO. Second-quarter earnings fell from the same period a year ago as slimmer insurance underwriting profits offset higher income from BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and the manufacturing, service, and retailing division. Another key driver of the decline was an $877 million foreign currency exchange loss tied to non-dollar debt — a sharp swing from a $446 million gain in the same period last year. Berkshire is now sitting on a $344 billion cash pile, the filings show. Buffett, who turns 95 this month, refrained from repurchasing any Berkshire shares last quarter. The company wrote down its 27% stake in Kraft Heinz by about $5 billion, reducing its carrying value to $8.4 billion. David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and longtime Buffett blogger, told Business Insider that the earnings were "business as usual" other than the Kraft Heinz impairment, which he called "surprising" and said "might be related" to Buffett's impending departure. Buffett and his team have been thwarted by high valuations for public stocks, private companies, and Berkshire's own shares in recent years. The lack of buying opportunities — and Berkshire paring key stock bets including Apple and Bank of America last year — have boosted its cash pile to all-time highs. Berkshire stock was trouncing the benchmark S&P going into the annual meeting in May, when Buffett announced his planned successor, Greg Abel, would take over as CEO in the new year.</p>

Canada's decision to retaliate against US tariffs earlier this year appears to be driving a divergence in how President Donald Trump is dealing with America's neighbors. 

Until this week, Canada and Mexico received similar treatment in White House trade actions. Each was subject to a 25% base tariff, with a large exemption for goods shipped under the North American free trade pact known as USMCA.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I know this is my fault," she tells CNBC Make It. "I was always the friend that'd be like, 'Shots on me,' or 'Oh, don't worry, I got it' or 'Just pay me next time,'" she says, adding that she wouldn't always follow up on requesting friends pay her back. Nearly 60% of millennials and Gen Zers say their financial goals have been impacted by social spending, according to a new survey from Ally Bank. Spending money on time with friends isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, "you're going to get the highest return on your well-being doing that," says Jack Howard, head of money wellness at Ally. "But then we're getting into trouble, because we're finding that 42% of folks are overspending," she adds, citing the survey, which found that 42% of millennials and Gen Zers report overspending on their social budgets several months out of the year. American adults seem to prioritize social time, with 69% of survey respondents saying they try to connect with their friends in-person at least once a week. But few adults seem to properly budget for social spending. Just 18% of Gen Zers and millennials say they have a strict budget for activities with friends, Ally found. "You gotta just put it in your budget," Howard says. "I think a lot of people just don't realize that cocktails with my girlfriends this day and brunch this day, and then I DoorDash with my partner another day, all of those expenses add up." Outside of making budget adjustments to allow for more social spending, Howard also recommends finding cheap or free activities to do with your friends — something only 23% of millennials and Gen Zers say they prioritize, Ally found. What you really want is the time with your friend," Howard says. Emmy is working on "adjusting the language with my friends" to suggest free or cheaper hangouts as she focuses on paying down her credit card debt. "I can confidently say that they would not judge me if they knew what I was doing, but I still just [have] the fear of being perceived by the people that you love," she says. That kind of shame is common, Howard says, and can contribute to continued overspending. It's a money mindset that often stems from how you were raised or something that happened in your early years, Howard says. "Until you really connect that past to the present, you tend to do those things over and over again, which will show up not only in how you spend on yourself, but also in how you spend in your relationships with friends and family," she says. If you're struggling to figure out how to better manage your money, consider working with a professional like a certified financial planner or a financial therapist who can offer guidance on your specific situation.

President Donald Trump suddenly has a chance to fill an opening at the Federal Reserve earlier than expected, after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler announced her resignation Friday. 

It may also force him to pick the next Fed chair months sooner than he'd anticipated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday reported a small decline in second-quarter operating earnings as Warren Buffett's conglomerate warns of negative impacts from steep U.S. tariffs. Berkshire's operating profit — those from the company's wholly owned businesses including insurance and railroads — dipped 4% year over year to $11.16 billion in the second quarter. The results were impacted by a decline in insurance underwriting, while railroad, energy, manufacturing, service and retailing all saw higher profits from a year ago. The Omaha-based conglomerate once again issued a stern warning of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the potential impact on its various businesses. "The pace of changes in these events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first six months of 2025," Berkshire said in its earnings report. "Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events." "It is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences on most, if not all, of our operating businesses, as well as on our investments in equity securities, which could significantly affect our future results," it said. Buffett's cash hoard of $344.1 billion remained near a record high, though slightly lower than the $347 billion level at the end of March. The conglomerate also didn't repurchase any stock in the first half of 2025 even as shares declined more than 10% from a record high. Berkshire wrote down a loss of $3.8 billion from its Kraft Heinz stake, a longtime underperformer for the conglomerate. The consumer goods giant has been eyeing a spinoff of its grocery business. Two Berkshire executives resigned as directors from Kraft Heinz's board in May. Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice-chairman of non-insurance operations, is set to take over as CEO, while Buffett will remain as chairman of Berkshire's board.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's far from finished but the new, $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at John F. Kennedy International Airport is taking shape. Its first phase is slated to open in mid-2026. It will replace the current terminal, which opened in 1998. The terminal, which will be JFK's largest, is now weathertight. Winding baggage conveyor belt structures have been installed, and you can make out future ticket counters, where customers flying carriers like Turkish Airlines, Air New Zealand, Etihad Airways, Air China, Taiwan's China Airlines and others will set down their luggage and show their passports to ticket agents. CNBC and other media got a look at the construction progress, led by Aument, in early July as part of what the company said will likely be among the last hardhat tours of the facility before opening day. In addition to Terminal 1, the current Terminal 7, currently home to Alaska Airlines and Ireland's Aer Lingus, will be knocked down for a new Terminal 6, whose first gates are set to open next year. LaGuardia Airport's revamp, in comparison, was about $8 billion. As air traffic grows, airports around the country are racing to replace aging infrastructure. U.S. airports need at least $173.9 billion for infrastructure upgrades from this year through 2029, according to a report earlier this year by the Airport Council International-North America. "These investments – averaging nearly $35 billion annually – are essential to accommodate airlines and passengers, improve operational efficiency, elevate service quality and customer experience, and fulfill airport resiliency needs," it said. The new JFK Terminal 1 is set to open around the start of the 2026 World Cup, when some games will be held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, about 30 miles away. One thing she pointed to with the new design: "a terminal flooded with light." That means no basement customs lines. The departures hall, security lanes and customs will be on the same level of the three-floor terminal, which features a wall of slanted windows. Terminal 1's mid-2026 open will include the departure and arrival areas and the first 14 gates, all capable of receiving wide-body aircraft that are used for long-haul flights, and will have a capacity for 14 million passengers a year. There will be 23 gates — 22 wide-body gates and one narrow-body gate — for planes like an Airbus A320 or a Boeing 737s — when the rest of the project is complete, currently scheduled for 2030. The final version of Terminal 1 will also have more than 300,000 square feet of dining, retail, lounge and recreational space, with more than half, 180,000 square feet, just for retail and dining. Generally, customers will make duty-free purchases that are then returned to them before they board their flights, but in this format, they can take them right away. We want to hear from you.

Pierre Andurand

Famed oil trader Pierre Andurand has pulled back from a bullish bet on cocoa after a series of mistimed trades led to deep losses, according to a letter sent to investors that was seen by Bloomberg. 

The gyrations underscore the risk for fund managers that drift away from their core expertise into other markets that carry unfamiliar risks. Andurand, whose main fund was down over 57% through the end of June, began trading cocoa in early 2024 after more than a decade focused primarily on oil. </p>
