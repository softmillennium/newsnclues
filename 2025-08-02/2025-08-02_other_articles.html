                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The comedian and his friend purchased, but do not legally own, the paranormal investigators' home, museum and entire artifact collection Matt Rife may be known for his comedy, but he's a horror lover through and through — and now he's got the haunted collection to prove it. On Friday, Aug. 1, the comedian announced on TikTok that along with his friend, YouTube creator Elton Castee, he has “officially purchased” the home and museum of Ed and Lorraine Warren. “I know a lot of you guys don't know [what] any of this means whatsoever, but if you follow ghost stuff, this is about as big as it gets.” But they don't have permanent ownership, he clarified. A rep for Rife confirmed the purchase as “legit” in a statement to PEOPLE on Saturday, Aug. 2, while reps for the museum did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment. The comedian also shared big plans for the Warrens' Occult Museum, whose doors have been closed for several years. “I should probably collect stamps or something — might be a little safer.” Rife also revealed that he and Castee have been in the Annabelle doll's presence, sharing a photo of the pair with the horror icon, a real antique Raggedy Ann doll supposedly possessed by an inhuman spirit. The New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), which was founded by the Warrens, previously described it as “demonically possessed.” Months into the tour, Rivera died at a hotel in Gettysburg, Pa. At the time, Adams County Coroner Francis Dutrow confirmed to PEOPLE that the doll was not present when he arrived at the scene on July 13, when authorities were notified about Rivera's death.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matt Rife is taking his crowd work to a new…dimension. “You also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time. So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history.” “What this means for you guys is, you are going to soon be able to book a night or a weekend and stay at the Warrens' house and investigate the house” he revealed. “This is the most random hobby ever but it's so f--king cool, man. I should probably collect stamps or something—might be a little safer.” The 29-year-old's chilling purchase comes less than a month after Dan Rivera—who was hosting a national tour of the original Annabelle doll—died suddenly following a stop with the New England Society of Psychic Research (NESPR). "It's with deep sadness that Tony, Wade, and I share the sudden passing of our close friend and partner, Dan Rivera," NESPR lead investigator Chris "Jeek" Gilloren wrote on the group's Facebook page July 14. "Dan truly believed in sharing his experiences and educating people on the paranormal. His kindness and passion touched everyone who knew him." "That needs to stop," fellow paranormal investigator Jason Hawes wrote on Facebook of the online rumors surrounding Dan's death. "His family shouldn't have to read that kind of nonsense while they're grieving." Before Dan Rivera's sudden death on July 13, he had dedicated much of his life to investigating the supernatural. "Dan truly believed in sharing his experiences and educating people on the paranormal," the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR) wrote in a July 14 Facebook post announcing his passing. "His kindness and passion touched everyone who knew him. "Born and raised in Connecticut, Rivera spent years working closely with Lorraine Warren, who along with her husband Ed Warren investigated spirits and demonology.Later on, Rivera brought his passion to the screen—appearing on Travel Channel's Most Haunted Places and producing Netflix's 28 Days Haunted. However, paranormal investigations were only part of world. He also served in the U.S. Army and was a family man. "We understand that Dan's work inspired fascination and curiosity for man," NESPR's July 15 press release noted, "but above all, he was a father, devoted husband, and loyal friend, someone who meant the world to those closest to him." Warning: This may give you nightmares.According to NESPR's website, Annabelle dates back to around the early 70s when a mom purchased the doll from a hobby store and gave it to her college-aged daughter Donna. What Were Dan Rivera's Interactions With the Annabelle Doll? "I take great precautions of moving that doll," Rivera told radio station i95Rock in 2022. To be clear, an official cause of death has yet to be revealed.Rivera was on tour with the Annabelle doll when he was found in a hotel room in Gettysburg, Pa., on July 13, Adams County Chief Deputy Coroner Scott Pennewill told Today.com. And as Pennewill told the outlet, Rivera's "death was nothing suspicious. What Have Paranormal Investigators Said About Annabelle and Dan Rivera's Death? Paranormal investigators have shared their own personal experiences with Annabelle.Like Zak Bagans. "I got very affected by her and it kinda caused me to touch the doll. The owner didn't like that too much. "Meanwhile, Ghost Hunters alum Jason Hawes reminded fans to not spread conspiracy theories. "Recently the World lost a good man," he wrote on Facebook July 15. What's even harder to see right now are the posts blaming his death on things like the Annabelle doll and attacking places like Ghostly Images of Gettysburg Tours and other locations for having events. His family shouldn't have to read that kind of nonsense while they're grieving. "Some people are using his passing to push an agenda for profit, and it's just disgusting," Jason added. Let's focus on remembering Dan for who he was, not turning his death into some made up bulls--t story to get clicks or attention." What Has Dan Rivera's Family Said About His Death? Following Rivera's death, his son David created a GoFundMe page, noting the money raised would go to covering costs of the funeral and care for Rivera's four kids. "He was famous for his work as lead paranormal investigator of NESPR, where he helped countless people out of dark times and brought comfort and a sense of safety to those who needed it," David wrote in a message posted to the site. "But more importantly, he was my father, a great man who loved deeply and lived fully. "He had a passion for working on classic cars while listening to classic rock and old school hip hop, enjoyed camping, and cherished spending time with family," he added. "He lit up every room with his smile, kindness and sarcastic witty humor. I was only blessed to spend time with my dad for 25 years and I wasn't prepared mentally, physically or financially to let him go this young."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to the cast of Supernatural, they're staying booked and busy with gigs across a variety of programming and streaming platforms. Whether it's The Boys, Gen V, Tracker, or Fire Country, there's no shortage of shows for fans to sink their teeth into. For a deep-dive into 20 years of Supernatural, from behind-the-scenes scoop to exclusive cast interviews, photos, and fan stories, pick up a copy of TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special issue, available on newsstands and for order online at Supernatural.TVGM2025.com. Season 5 of Prime Video‘s hit series about the titular vigilante group tasked with keeping “Supes” in line “just got a bit more supernatural,” the show teased earlier this year. Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles and Misha Collins will reunite when the drama, created by Supernatural‘s Eric Kripke, returns in 2026. Ackles joined in Season 3 as Soldier Boy, who it turns out is the father of lab-bred series antagonist Homelander (Antony Starr). Of the upcoming season, Kripke says, “Having us back together on set filming was just so fun.” —Meaghan Darwish “Saving people, fighting fires, the family business.” A twist can be put on the Winchesters' motto — no monsters to hunt here — for Padalecki's character on this fiery drama. Camden Casey, who, like Supernatural‘s Sam, lost his brother on the job. As Bode Leone's (Max Thieriot) new boss, he sees the former inmate's talent as he trains to become part of Cal Fire. “The part was written for Jared,” executive producer Tia Napolitano shares. Everybody enjoyed having him be part of the family.” —Meredith Jacobs Alexander Calvert traded his godly gig as Jack Kline for a new Supe role in The Boys‘ college-set 2023 spinoff, portraying Rufus, a student at Godolkin University. The school trains students with superpower abilities, his being telepathy, which includes hypnosis and astral projection. Rufus abuses his powers to take advantage of women at Godolkin, among them protagonist Marie (Jaz Sinclair). It's safe to say, you'll see Calvert in a whole new light with this boundary-pushing part. Ackles is at the center of another complex fraternal relationship in this CBS drama following Colter Shaw (Justin Hartley), who searches for missing people. Ackles plays Colter's brother, Russell, and the two are estranged until the end of Season 1 because Colter thinks Russell had something to do with their father's death. (Russell convinces him otherwise and subsequently adds clues to the mystery surrounding that family tragedy.) Ackles comes in with preexisting relationships with both showrunner Elwood Reid (Big Sky) and Hartley (from their CW days on Supernatural and Smallville, respectively), though this is the first time they're working together. “Jensen texted me when he was watching football: ‘I'm trying to watch the game. Will you please get your mug off my screen?' And I texted him back, ‘Do you want to come play my brother?' Ruth Connell traded in Rowena's spellbooks on Supernatural for the Afterlife's Lost and Found Department in Netflix‘s short-lived (no pun intended) series Dead Boy Detectives. As an assistant to Death herself, Connell's Night Nurse made sure the ghosts of dead children found their proper resting places. The uptight, rule-abiding eternal chased after young detectives Edwin (George Rexstrew) and Charles (Jayden Revri) for decades. Since, Negan has evolved into a bit of an antihero and now stars on spinoff Dead City opposite Lauren Cohan (who played thief Bela in a Season 3 SPN arc!) You can almost call Negan one of the good guys now. “John was really my introduction to [the horror] world,” Morgan told TV Guide Magazine in 2020. And like Supernatural‘s Castiel, Gotham City's district attorney was a good guy capable of bad behavior, mostly due to his split personality. Remembered for his role as Lucifer on Supernatural, Mark Pellegrino has appeared in shows ranging from Lost to YA fare like 13 Reasons Why, and recently the actor stepped into the shoes of Virgil Poe in this crime drama set in Pennsylvania's Rust Belt. The 2021–24 series aired on Showtime before moving to Prime Video for its second and final season and featured Pellegrino's Virgil as the father of Alex Neustaedter‘s Billy Poe, a young man who finds himself accused of a murder he didn't commit. Ladies' man Virgil has a flirty relationship with his ex, Grace (Maura Tierney), Billy's mom. His unwillingness to quit Grace puts him at odds with her beau, Police Chief Del Harris (Jeff Daniels). “The good part about playing Virgil is you just have to tap that inner 6-year-old and let him come out and play,” Pellegrino told That Hashtag Show. Ackles arrived in the Season 2 finale of ABC's Montana-set crime drama as Sheriff Beau Arlen, then stuck around as a series regular for the third and final season in 2023. “I tried to hit those notes and bring a little levity to what's essentially a pretty grim basis for a show, which is murder mystery constantly.” His character fit right in alongside ex-cop Jenny Hoyt (Katheryn Winnick) and private detective Cassie Dewell (Kylie Bunbury), and the sparks between Beau and Jenny spiced things up considerably. Even better, the show gave a nod to Supernatural when Beau gives Cassie salt for her new house so she's “always protected.” She responds, “Oh, from demons.” “I can't remember if that was in the script. As LAPD detective Mark Meachum, Ackles' current role sees him joining a top-secret task force racing to save L.A. from a nuclear nightmare. But amid all the action and nail-biting bursts of suspense are moments of quick-witted humor that are a familiar fit for the Ackles we loved during his run as Dean Winchester. There was a lot of ad-libs and playful banter between us.” Ever the prankster, Ackles confesses that he called on his and Padalecki's past to mess with his new castmates. “I felt it my duty to really challenge a lot of the other actors to keep a straight face…and I had 15 years of practice with my brother!” —Damian Holbrook As an executive producer with creator Anna Fricke, he was drawn to the role of grieving widower and Texas Ranger Cordell Walker. “I really wanted to be a part of [it],” he told TV Guide Magazine. “Now I get to be here with my wife and kids. I don't think I dared to dream this big.” Walker ran from 2021 to 2024 and even staged a mini-SPN reunion when Ackles directed Season 2's “No Such Thing as Fair Play,” which saw Cordell enduring a series of mishaps at the Texas Rangers' annual carnival. “I wanted to make the whole [episode] a Tough Mudder for him,” Ackles joked about tormenting his buddy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some Nobel Prize winners are known to have turned towards psychics, mediums and the paranormal after winning. There are many examples of such people in historical records. Nobel Prize winners are people who have excelled in their respective fields. You would think that they are extremely smart people, but some of them have reported to have been afflicted by what is called the "Nobel disease" or "Nobelitis". There is a long list of Nobel Prize winners who are said to have suffered from it. Before you think it's a real physical disease, let us tell you that it is something very different and one that has no real explanation. However, most of them strangely got interested in psychic research and the paranormal world. Also Read: Scientist reveals HOW and WHEN alien 'mothership' could attack Earth, warns governments to take action Another Nobel winner in Physics, Joseph Thomson, also started leaning towards the psychic phenomena. Charles Richet, a Nobel winner in physiology or medicine, was pulled towards seances and mediums and coined the word "ectoplasm", used for the release of a substance from mediums (people who claim they talk to spirits). Then there were others who totally dismissed scientific beliefs, despite being science people themselves. Once, he said, a glowing green raccoon visited him at his cabin in California. Also Read: Texans warned about sea creature with poisonous sting that feels like fire for hours, even days Paul Nurse, a Nobel Prize winner, says this behaviour could boil down to the pressures these people face after winning. He said, that everyone starts seeing you as a "world-leading expert on almost everything." Nurse thinks this builds pressure on them to learn about other things besides their field of expertise, something he cautions Nobel winners against. Even Isaac Newton had a thing for alchemy and strange religious beliefs.</p>

So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history. “The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time,” Rife shared. “So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history.” Rife did not reveal how much he spent on his purchase. Haunted relics from the Warrens' adventures remained on the property after their death including fragments of crashed Eastern Airlines Flight 401 and an organ that can play on its own. The museum also houses Annabelle, the giant Raggedy Ann doll, which was kept locked in a case labeled “Warning: Positively Do Not Open.” The doll is believed to have a “demonic” presence attached to it after it allegedly terrorized two roommates in the 1970s by mysteriously moving by itself, leaving creepy notes and it was accused of trying to strangle a friend sleeping in the apartment. Most recently, it was part of the “Devils on the Run Tour,” hosted by paranormal investigator Dan Rivera, who died suddenly in his hotel room on July 13. Rivera was traveling around the US with other members of the New England Society for Psychic Research to show off Annabelle as part of his tour. The recent incident has not stopped Rife from leaning into his new “hobby.” “This is the most random hobby ever, but it's so f—ing cool, man. “Still can't believe we're the new owners… Sitting on their porch now looking at all the photos of them at this house.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice President JD Vance made it known that he is “obsessed” with and “particularly focused” on UFOs — announcing on a recent podcast that he will spend time in the next weeks looking into the subject matter. “Like I'm obsessed with the whole UFO thing. ‘What were those videos all about?' “I haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet but we're only six months in, we've been very busy,” Vance said with a chuckle. It is unclear whether the Ohio native was referring to the New Jersey drone phenomenon that began on Nov. 13 last year with sightings of unidentified aircraft reportedly the size of cars hovering over a Picatinny Arsenal. Ruthless Podcast cohost Michael Duncan then opened up about his own interest in the once-taboo subject matter. “I've been to Roswell,” Duncan confessed. “Did you see any aliens?” Vance asked. I saw the hangar where they were,” Duncan responded sincerely. “Once I get to the bottom of it, if there's anything there, I'll make sure you're the first to know,” Vance replied. Another member of the Trump administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, takes UFOs very seriously.Then-senator Rubio claimed top US officials have “first-hand knowledge” of a secret Pentagon crash retrieval program back in a 2023 interview with NewsNation. Rubio sat down for an interview for upcoming documentary “Age of Disclosure” which has been much ballyhooed by disclosure advocates.The VP's office did not respond to The Post's request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural has had so many great episodes that it can be hard to decide what the best ones are, and while the #1 episode is arguably undeniable, there is another that comes awfully close to surpassing it. Running for 15 seasons, Supernatural is often considered the best CW show of all time, leaving a lasting legacy across 327 episodes. During its long run, Supernatural experienced a lot of highs and some lows, but always remained engaging, blending great action with incredible scares and hilarious moments. The absolute best episode of Supernatural has been hotly debated over the years, with most settling on two that prove just how great a show Supernatural is. Season 6, episode 15, "The French Mistake" sees Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) sent to an alternate dimension where their alternate selves are TV actors on a show called Supernatural. It's all very meta and gives both Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles a chance to play "themselves," pulling in some of their personal lives into the storyline. With such a silly premise, "The French Mistake" could have been terrible, but the show is so good at often taking silly concepts and making them into something spectacular. With such a silly premise, "The French Mistake" could have been terrible, but the show is so good at often taking silly concepts and making them into something spectacular. In fact, Supernatural was only envisioned to be five seasons when it began. I knew that we were closing this chapter and opening a new one. The episode ends with Sam sacrificing himself to trap Lucifer back in Hell, while Dean attempts to live a normal life in the aftermath. "Swan Song" was spectacular from start to finish, with a lot of fans ranking it at the top of the list when it comes to Supernatural's best episodes. There will always be discussions about whether Supernatural should have continued past season 5, but if it had, "Swan Song" would have easily been the best episode the show ever produced. That being said, "Swan Song" does do something better than "The French Connection." Supernatural was arguably at its peak when the season 5 finale rolled around, and it largely wrapped up all the major threads that had been built up during its entire run at that point. This resulted in some of the most emotionally resonant moments in the series overall, especially when it comes to Sam and Dean. "Swan Song" is actually the highest-rated episode of Supernatural on IMDb with 9.7/10. Sam's character arc was nearly perfect by the time "Swan Song" wrapped up, and his sacrifice was poetic in a number of ways. Seeing Dean living a normal life, finally away from hunting, was incredibly touching. Supernatural wasn't afraid to be meta or have a number of self-referential moments throughout, but "The French Connection" is when the show really began to lean into it, which also helped make it a defining characteristic of the series. Supernatural will always be iconic, leaving a lasting legacy after 15 years of the Winchester brothers fighting monsters, gods, ghosts, and everything else spooky. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. One standout moment was the DC's Jim Lee & Friends panel, where James Gunn made a surprise appearance that sparked cheers from the crowd. Resident Alien season 5's potential future after its cancellation on Syfy and USA gets an update from star Alan Tudyk and creator Chris Sheridan. Gambit is a strong candidate to become Doctor Doom's successor thanks to one powerful weapon, which may also turn him into a supervillain. The Marvel Cinematic Universe officially has a new version of Iron Fist, as an actor has been cast for an upcoming Marvel Studios release.</p>
