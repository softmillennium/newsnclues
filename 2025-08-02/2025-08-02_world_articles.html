Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures. The health sector's interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums. But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public. Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don't have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing. Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems' stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. “When the County supported Erlanger's transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn't envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement. Erlanger's president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages. “We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts' incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said. “It's an economic signal of strength but it's also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations. After the nonprofit Valley Children's Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations. “While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children's staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.” But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports. A Valley Children's spokesperson told Stateline that game-day entitlements at the stadium, such as the tailgates, catering and suite, have been used for patients and their families. The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital's use of state funding. In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. “Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you're giving back to the community.” For example, it can allow a hospital's providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. And sports sponsorship more broadly isn't a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes. “There's a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Since 2008, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault — set deep in frozen soil known as permafrost — has accepted nearly 1.4 million samples of more than 6,000 species of critical crops. Indeed, in 2017, an access tunnel to the vault flooded as permafrost melted, though the seeds weren't impacted. This February, a team of scientists was working on Svalbard when irony took hold. These microbes munch on organic matter and burp methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas and significant driver of global warming. In some parts of Svalbard, though, the scientists didn't need to drill. Snow vanished in places, leaving huge pools of water. “I brought my equipment to drill into frozen soil and then ended up sampling a lot of soil just with a spoon, like it was soft ice cream,” said Donato Giovannelli, a geomicrobiologist at the University of Naples Federico II and co-lead author of a paper describing the experience, published last week in the journal Nature Communications. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. Scientists can now dig with silverware in the Svalbard winter because the Arctic has descended into a crisis of reflectivity. But as the planet has warmed, that ice has been disappearing, exposing darker water, which absorbs sunlight and raises temperatures. For one, warmer seawater evaporates more readily, adding water vapor to the air. And two, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. During the winter, Svalbard's soils have historically frozen solid, and scientists assumed this made microbial activity grind to a halt. Reindeer could push through the snow to graze on vegetation. But February's heat and rain melted the snow, forming vast pools of water that froze once temperatures dropped again. That ground remained frozen, so the water didn't have too many places to drain away to, so what we also saw was huge pooling of liquid water over the tundra.” This new climate regime could be profoundly altering the soil microbiome. Scientists assumed that methane-producing bacteria, known as methanogens, stopped proliferating when Svalbard's soils froze in the winter, just like food in your freezer keeps for months because it's in a hostile environment for microbes. But with warm spells like this, thawing could awaken methanogens, which could still produce that greenhouse gas even if it then rains and a layer of ice forms at the surface. “In some areas, deeper layers might never freeze completely, which means the methanogens and microbes at depth remain active,” Giovannelli said. Vegetation, too, is changing up there, a phenomenon known as Arctic greening. As temperatures rise, trees and shrubs are creeping north to conquer new territory. The good news is that those plants capture carbon as they grow, mitigating global warming to a certain extent. “And on the other side, we've probably been a bit too cautious with our warnings regarding the climate. It's not something for the next generation. Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining. As we face mounting repression, Truthout appeals for your support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Texas House panel on Saturday advanced a new congressional map as state Republicans power ahead with a strategy backed by President Donald Trump to help the GOP maintain the US House majority in the 2026 midterms. Texas Democratic Party Chair Kendall Scudder said Saturday the party will file a lawsuit if the map passes, adding that state Republicans are “silencing voters on behalf of Donald Trump.” “Democrats must fight this Trump power grab through any means necessary, and blue states across the country should use this as a signal flare to start carving up their own states and make these authoritarian wannabe Republican lawmakers regret ever opening up this redistricting discussion in the first place,” Scudder said in a statement. Democratic governors in states like California have already warned they will attempt the same tactics to help their party win more seats, in what one US House Democrat described to CNN as a “redistricting arms race.” US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his political team are exploring similar plans in California, New York, New Jersey, Minnesota and Washington state in hopes of flipping at least a handful of Republican seats next November. In total, there are five more seats that Trump won by more than 10 percentage points, according to data from the Texas Legislative Council. Multiple people close to Doggett have told CNN they do not expect him to bow out quietly and instead foresee the two battling it out in a primary. One of those people close to the senior House Democrat pointed out that he has $6.2 million cash on hand. In a statement this week, Doggett did not address the question of his future and said his “sole focus” is defeating the new GOP map. Casar, for his part, vowed in a statement to “fight back with everything we've got,” calling for voters to “mobilize against this illegal map.” Republicans also propose merging the Houston-area seat of Rep. Al Green with a vacant seat held by the late Rep. Sylvester Turner, who died in office earlier this year. Green's district was altered more than any other sitting member in the plan. The map would also make two southern Texas seats — held by Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez — more Republican-leaning. But multiple Democrats view the seats as still in reach for the two centrist members who typically performed ahead of statewide or national Democrats. Trump has not yet weighed in on the proposed Texas map. CNN's Sarah Ferris and Ethan Cohen contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Democracy has died in El Salvador today,” said opposition Congressmember Marcela Villatoro. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! El Salvador's Legislative Assembly — which is controlled by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele's New Ideas party — on Thursday approved a series of constitutional reforms, including abolition of presidential term limits, that critics warned pose a grave threat to the Central American nation's fragile democracy. New Ideas Congresswoman Ana Figueroa, who proposed the reforms, argues that if other elected offices in El Salvador do not have term limits, why should the presidency? Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. However, opposition lawmakers, journalists, human rights defenders, and others condemned the measures, which come amid an ongoing “state of emergency” that, while dramatically reducing crime in what was once the world's murder capital, has seen widespread repression of human and civil rights. “Democracy has died in El Salvador today,” said Congresswoman Marcela Villatoro of the opposition ARENA party, who argued that the reforms were “approved without consultation, in a gross and cynical way.” Chilean pollster Marta Lagos argued on social media that El Salvador is being transformed into “an electoral dictatorship” that “excludes an essential element of democracy: respect for minorities, the rule of law, the separation of powers, and civic and political freedoms.” Juanita Goebertus, director of the Americas division at Human Rights Watch (HRW), argued that New Ideas is “following the same path as Venezuela.” “It starts with a leader who uses their popularity to concentrate power, and ends in dictatorship,” Goebertus warned. Like Trump, Bukele has shrugged off — and at times even embraced — the “dictator” label. Trump — who has himself flirted with the concept of being president for life, or at least for a third term — has remained silent about Bukele's democratic backsliding, even as his administration imposes staggering tariffs on Brazil and punitive sanctions on a leading member of its judiciary for defending democracy. Such actions, along with the Trump administration's record of targeting certain authoritarian governments while courting and coddling others, drew stinging rebuke by social media users in El Salvador and beyond. Thursday's reforms — which must still be ratified by lawmakers — mark the second major modification of presidential term limits in El Salvador. The court subsequently ruled Bukele was eligible to run again, and he won last year's election in a landslide. Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US star extends record with seventh world 800m title Katie Ledecky once again proved untouchable in her signature event, holding off a star-studded field to win her seventh world title in the 800m freestyle on Saturday in Singapore, a feat no swimmer has ever achieved in a single event. The  heats start at 10am local time (2am GMT, 10pm ET). The semi-finals and finals start at 7pm local time (11am GMT, 7am ET). In the United States, coverage will be available on NBC and streaming service Peacock. Additionally, the World Aquatics Recast channel will re-air all sessions of the meet, heats and finals for a fee. Ledecky trailed McIntosh by just 0.14 seconds at the 700m mark but surged ahead in the closing stretch, then held off a furious challenge from Pallister to touch first. The lead had changed hands multiple times, with Pallister taking a remarkable five seconds off her personal best and McIntosh – the 17-year-old phenom who ended Ledecky's 13-year unbeaten streak earlier this year – appearing poised to complete a historic title sweep. With the win, Ledecky extended her perfect record in global 800m freestyle finals to 11 wins from 11, dating back to her breakout Olympic gold in 2012 at just 15 years old. “I was really happy, obviously,” Ledecky said afterward. “It's the fastest I've ever been at a world championships. It's been a great season, and coming into tonight, I knew I was going to be happy with it no matter the outcome. “They pushed me all the way,” she added. “That's pretty incredible, three of us going under 8:10. Everyone in that heat is the next generation of swimmers coming up. Just proud to be a part of it.” Saturday's showdown had been billed as a changing-of-the-guard moment, with McIntosh seeking to match Phelps's record of five individual titles at a single world championships, a milestone no female swimmer has ever reached. McIntosh entered the meet in white-hot form, having broken three world records in five days at the Canadian trials and posted the third-fastest 800m time ever in June. “I think this is a really big learning lesson for me,” McIntosh said. “I went into the 800 free with full confidence … but I'll try to get this out of my mind quickly and finish strong in the IM.” The Canadian will look to close her remarkable week with a fourth gold in Sunday's 400m individual medley, where she is the prohibitive favorite. “I didn't think I'd be 8:05 here, but now I'm really thrilled with that.” The 22-year-old credited her previous races next to Ledecky for building her confidence in the distance events. Ledecky's gold came on a triumphant night for the United States team, which has endured both illness and criticism throughout the week in Singapore. With Phelps and Ryan Lochte publicly questioning the team's management amid a stomach bug outbreak, the Americans responded with their best day of the meet by winning three golds on Saturday and setting a world record in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay. That team – Jack Alexy, Patrick Sammon, Kate Douglass and Torri Huske – clocked 3:18.48, breaking Australia's 2023 mark. Gretchen Walsh also claimed the women's 50m butterfly title in 24.83, completing a sprint double after earlier winning the 100 fly. But no victory resonated more than Ledecky's, a race that reaffirmed her place atop the sport and reminded the world, yet again, that the queen of distance freestyle still reigns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Media reports on Friday had suggested India, a big energy importer, would stop buying cheap Russian oil. “I understand that India is no longer going to be buying oil from Russia,” he said. However, official sources in India, quoted by the news agency ANI, rebutted Trump's claim, saying Indian oil companies had not paused Russian imports and that supply decisions were based on “price, grade of crude, inventories, logistics and other economic factors”. Trump's remarks came a day after the White House announced tariffs of 25% on all Indian goods, along with a penalty for buying arms and energy from Russia amid the war in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Indian state-owned refineries had suspended Russian oil purchases amid the tariff threats and narrowing price discounts. But on Saturday, the New York Times cited two unnamed senior Indian officials who said there had been no change in Indian government policy related to importing Russian oil. The sources cited by ANI said Indian oil refineries operated in full compliance with international norms, and that Russian oil had never been directly sanctioned by the US or EU. They added: “India's purchases have remained fully legitimate and within the framework of international norms.” India says that as a major energy importer it must find the cheapest supplies to protect its population against rising costs. Jaiswal added that India had a “steady and time-tested partnership” with Russia. This partnership has been a point of contention for the White House, with Trump posting on Truth Social on 30 July that while India was “our friend”, it had always bought most of its military equipment from Russia and was “Russia's largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE – ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!” In a second post, Trump added: “I don't care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India is on track to become the world's third-largest economy, despite global instability, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after US President Donald Trump's statements about the country's "dead economy." "There is an atmosphere of global instability in the world. All countries are focused on their own interests. India is set to become the world's third-largest economy, which is why it must be vigilant about its economic interests," the prime minister emphasized. Modi also stressed the importance of supporting domestic production and promoting the "Made in India" initiative. "We will buy only what Indians produce. We must support local producers," the prime minister emphasized. The US president pointed out that India has always purchased most of its military equipment from Russia and is also, along with China, is also the largest buyer of Russian energy resources. According to Trump, India will pay a 25% tariff in this regard. The US leader later stated that he does not care about the economic and trade ties between India and Russia, calling their economies "dead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India's purchases of Russian oil have made a positive contribution to global energy stability, a source in the Indian government told TASS. "India's energy decisions were dictated by national interests, but they also contributed positively to global energy stability," he said. "Had India not accepted Russian oil at a discount and had OPEC+ not cut production by 5.86 million barrels per day, global oil prices could have significantly exceeded the March 2022 peak of $137 per barrel, intensifying inflationary pressure around the world," he emphasized. According to the source, "India's pragmatic approach ensured oil supplies, price stability, and market balance while fully complying with the international framework." "India, the world's third-largest energy consumer and 85% dependent on crude oil imports, has strategically diversified its supply sources to ensure energy security," the source pointed out. Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that despite friendly relations between the two countries, the US has relatively little trade with India because tariffs are "far too high, among the highest in the world." The US president pointed out that India has always purchased most of its military equipment from Russia and is also, along with China, is also the largest buyer of Russian energy resources. According to Trump, India will pay a 25% tariff in this regard. The US leader later stated that he does not care about the economic and trade ties between India and Russia, calling their economies "dead." On July 14, Trump said that the US would impose tariffs of about 100% on Russia and its trading partners if the Ukrainian settlement is not reached within 50 days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The great ongoing American conversation escalated into a great American bar fight this summer, as a long and increasingly unhinged national back-and-forth about race, politics, sexuality, the nature of both the Trump administration and fame itself was triggered by … a jeans ad. American Eagle released a campaign starring the exceedingly charismatic actress Sydney Sweeney. In one ad, she is seen clad in a revealing version of the Canadian tuxedo, veritably busting out of a not really buttoned jean jacket. But though the mere facts of her physical existence have ignited multiple national debates previously, in this case, the reason people are talking (and talking!) is that the ad's script had her making puns about genes and jeans. “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring,” she says in one ad. Some viewers immediately connected the genetics commentary to her brilliant blue eyes and blonde, fine hair. After all, it was just last October that Donald Trump was identifying “bad genes” as a cause of invented or real crime committed by immigrants. Many felt that the ad was playing into this dark, not-very-concealed conversation about genetics in America. This is pointed, and you're calling out to the consumers that you hope to attract here,” said Cheryl Overton, a long-time brand strategist and communications executive. That calling-out was quickly followed by a louder and nastier wave of disdain that people would dare suggest the ad was intentionally about race — or that everyone was being stupid for talking about jeans anyway. “But I think that that just plays also on stereotypes of fashion being frivolous, and this just being jeans. At last, as the week wound down, American Eagle issued a statement that was bound to make everyone a little unhappy. “Great jeans look good on everyone,” they assured us. While American Eagle enjoyed a brief $2-a-share surge in its stock price during the controversy, all the rest of us got were a bunch of questions. “Our leadership team passed around some articles about it, and we were discussing whether we thought the American Eagle team when it first came out, did they understand? Were they trying to do something edgy and sexy that came across racist and didn't recognize that?” asked Kimberly Jefferson, senior vice president of client relations at PANBlast, a public relations firm that serves brands in the tech sector. Or is this intentionally playing to at best, a conservative, at worst, a racist ideal system that is pervasively growing in America? “It seemed clear to me that they were aligning themselves with a white nationalist, MAGA-friendly identity,” said Shalini Shankar, an anthropology professor at Northwestern University who studies youth and advertising. “I think that this is them trying to rebrand themselves for the present moment, and language is very deliberately used here. “This one is just the consequences of bad and, dare I say, lazy writing. I don't think it was funny or clever,” said Alyssa Vingan, fashion writer and former editor of Nylon and Fashionista. “And I do think obviously it's cheap humor to have somebody like Sydney Sweeney, who's blonde with large breasts and a small waist, say she has good genes because she's hot. “There's something to the fact that this company is called American Eagle, she's in jeans, with a car, with a dog,” said McClendon, the fashion professor. “In the current political climate, and then with the invocation of genetics, it feels like it's just playing on this broader, larger cultural social grappling we're having right now with what it means to be American.” They absolutely did mean it, said Emily Keegin, a freelance photo director — and lots of us are just pretending otherwise. “It's interesting to see how the news organizations that we consider to be left or more liberal, like the New York Times, The Atlantic, New York Magazine, their op-eds about this from yesterday and the day before are downplaying the situation or saying that it's not a big deal, or that it was just a mistake, or something, like it was overlooked. It means that the institutions are willing to give a pass to these things that maybe they shouldn't be.” Probably not, but do you even remember all that now? It was such a huge thing, and now everyone's moved past that,” said Hailey Knott, who is a social media manager for a global nonprofit and who worked at American Eagle for two years. And now nobody even — in my opinion — cares about that anymore.” “Rarely do you ever see something blow up so quickly as the kiss cam incident,” said Cyndee Harrison, a reputation and branding strategist and crisis communications specialist. “But their response, I thought it was masterfully done. In my opinion, American Eagle had a perfect opportunity to follow that same playbook: Acknowledge, reframe and move forward with clarity.” The jury is still out on whether it's good for their business, whether it's going to increase sales, or whether it's bad for their business,” said Alison Weissbrot, executive editor at Adweek. “I feel like this is a masterclass in attention economy,” said Sam Gauchier, a vice president at Michele Marie PR. You know, people are getting laid off for a reason, and it's not just AI. It's incredibly hard to make a dent in our media landscape,” said Keegin, the photo director. “This is the modern formula for outrage marketing,” said Molly McPherson, crisis and reputation strategist. “This wasn't a mistake per se as much as a kind of provocation that I think landed as it was intended to and that we should expect to probably see more of this type of messaging, given how — in many ways — successful this one was,” Shankar said. She means because someone always has to clean up the consequences. The senior leadership team, they don't have to see that. Until Friday's company statement, the company's top post on Instagram, for around five days, was of a Black woman in American Eagle clothing. Some of the comments were “keep it white ❤️ ❤️🇺🇸” and “Love me some lib tears” and a lot of people saying “damage control.” “I think it's extremely telling that American Eagle hasn't posted on social media since Sunday or said anything, because in my experience, when I worked there, they're posting at least three times a day on social media platforms,” said Knott, of the week before Friday evening's statement. “I think if this had been a client of mine, I feel like the first thing I would say is don't rush — take a beat, read the room, get curious about what people are upset about,” said Gauchier. The brand silence “also helps me think that this is calculated,” she said. “I think we're all so sick of these brand apologies that feel very AI-written or written by the law firm, and don't really have any heart or soul. I think what people want to hear is: How'd you get here? But if this is a strategy to give the middle fingers up to those of us who are quote, unquote, woke, message received. But “the Brooke Shields ads were really purely about sex. (Interestingly, Shields herself said she did not see her Calvin Klein ads as overly sexualized.) “You can absolutely celebrate someone's body, and I mean, she is a beautiful specimen of humanity. Highly sexualized ads are on brand for the moment, said Adweek's Weissbrot. Do we appeal to what is the current zeitgeist, for better or worse? American Eagle might, however, have scared other brands off sexy campaigns, or at least might have put a fork in this campaigns '90s-basement slightly porny aesthetic. We gotta, like, rethink this,'” said Keegin. Genetics.” (Among many linking that campaign to the American Eagle campaign was a Dunkin' account Instagram commenter, who wrote: “I'll be walking into Dunkin' sporting my AE jeans.”) “Whenever I'm working with clients and they have a new campaign coming, I always ask them, like, ‘Okay, what is the goal of your campaign? And if visibility is what they're looking for, then, you know, obviously I wouldn't gear them towards this specific strategy. But I wouldn't be surprised if other brands say visibility is what we're looking for, and someone might have the idea of doing something that blurs the line,” said Gauchier. Experts agree that Sydney Sweeney is always winning. She emerges from this national dust-up only more powerful than ever. “Certainly, it makes me very uncomfortable to think that Sydney Sweeney, this particular human being, should be targeted,” said Sayantani DasGupta, a senior lecturer in narrative medicine at Columbia University who went to TikTok to talk about the ads. It's about saying, we all live in this society. We all are both creating and perceiving these images, and we're all ultimately going to be impacted by them.” But she's not,” said Sam Bodrojan, a freelance film critic. “She is able to create conversation around her and create controversy around her, while also fundamentally never being a subject of ire directly. She is a subject of jealousy or envy or a broader symbol of something else — but nobody is ever really asserting that she is a bad person, and if they are, it just makes her more marketable.” Rachel Rodgers, an associate professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University, did a study on the ads for American Eagle's flagship brand, Aerie, and how those ads impacted body image in 2019. The answer was: It made them feel good about themselves! They liked the “best friend vibe” and seeing women whose diverse bodies looked like their own. Her belief was that the new ads featuring Sweeney would succeed — by making women feel bad and ugly. “We know that typically, idealized and sexualized media images are detrimental to body image and to mood,” she said. “They typically make people feel worse about themselves and are designed to do so, because that's one of the things that drives consumption.” “The thing that has been lost, for me, is that this whole initiative is to benefit domestic violence and a domestic violence charity,” said Overton.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK, August 2. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has erased the names of US President Donald Trump and a number of other prominent individuals from documents related to the case of financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of sexually abusing minors, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. According to the news agency, the documents were edited while the FBI was preparing them for potential publication. As Trump and some of the other individuals mentioned in the documents were private individuals when the federal investigation into Epstein began in 2006, it was decided that their names should be concealed. Subsequently, the FBI and the US Department of Justice decided that the release of these papers would not be "appropriate or justified." The news agency emphasized that being mentioned in the documents cannot be considered evidence of involvement in the financier's criminal activities. Epstein was arrested by New York state law enforcement agencies on July 6, 2019. Prosecutors said there was evidence that, from 2002 to 2005, he had arranged for dozens of underage girls, the youngest of whom was 14, to visit his Manhattan home. Epstein's circle of friends and acquaintances included many current and former officials from the US and other countries, including former heads of state, prominent businesspeople, and celebrities. Criminal proceedings against the financier were terminated after his suicide in a prison cell on August 10, 2019.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While several African countries saw their planned U.S. tariffs reduced significantly this week, the White House refused to ease its rate for South Africa.Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images After months of intense effort to negotiate a U.S. trade deal, South Africa has been left out in the cold, facing a renewed 30-per-cent tariff as the Trump administration snubbed its offer of multibillion-dollar concessions. According to South Africa's central bank, it could trigger the loss of 100,000 jobs, a potentially disastrous setback for an already fragile economy. For months, Mr. Trump has falsely accused South Africa of seizing farmland and perpetrating a “genocide” against its white minority. Earlier this week, he complained again of “very bad policies” in the country, revealing that he might boycott the November G20 summit in Johannesburg. G20 finance chiefs meet under tariff cloud in South Africa While several African countries saw their planned U.S. tariffs reduced significantly in this week's announcement, the White House refused to ease its rate for South Africa, which had been set at 31 per cent in April. It proposed that its businesses would invest US$3.3-billion in the U.S. mining industry and other sectors, and it offered to import US$12-billion in liquefied natural gas over a 10-year period. It sought an extension of the Aug. 1 deadline, but did not get one. “They suggested that maybe we present a revised offer,” Mr. Tau said. Key industries such as auto manufacturing and citrus farming are expected to be badly hit. President Cyril Ramaphosa said he noted the U.S. tariff announcement “with concern.” In a statement on Friday, he pledged to pursue “all diplomatic efforts” to reach a trade deal, while also promising an intensified effort to diversify South Africa's trade markets. The 30-per-cent tariff is highly unequal, since the average tariff on U.S. goods entering South Africa is just 7.6 per cent, according to Mr. Ramaphosa. His trade minister, Mr. Tau, promised an urgent set of aid measures for South African businesses, including an export support desk and possible tax incentives. His previously announced 25-per-cent tariff on automobiles has severely damaged South Africa's car exports to the United States. Lesotho, the small mountainous kingdom that was inexplicably hit with a 50-per-cent tariff in April, saw its rate reduced to 15-per-cent on Thursday. But it might be too late to undo the damage, since some textile factories there have already laid off thousands of workers. The factories had been beneficiaries of a U.S.-Africa free-trade agreement that now seems dead. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>
