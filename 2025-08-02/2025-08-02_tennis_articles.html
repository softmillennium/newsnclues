                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The path is there for Alexander Zverev to win his first Masters 1000 title of 2025. You need to be careful not to project too far ahead, but Zverev would fancy his chances against any of the potential opponents out of the second quarterfinal in the semifinals. Tennis Abstract gives Zverev just about a 1-in-4 chance of winning the title at ATP Toronto, but the German does have a habit of muddying up these opportunities lately. The Argentinian has cemented his spot in the top 30, and he does have three career titles, but more has been expected of the 26-year-old, at least in terms of trophies. What's even more confusing is that Cerundolo's has never had too much of an issue punching up. Cerundolo will draw even more confidence from the fact that he is 3-0 against Zverev in his career, and he's catching the German at a good time. 3 didn't make things easy on himself in Round 1 of this tournament against Matteo Arnaldi either. Cerundolo can be an infuriating opponent with his relentlessness and ability to defend, and that should give Zverev plenty of chances to spiral.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zverev lost to Arthur Rinderknech over five sets in the first round at the All England Club, and said in his post-match press conference that he had ‘never felt this empty'. Despite making deep runs at Grand Slams this season, including a final appearance at the Australian Open, 2025 hasn't been the German's best year on tour by any stretch, having picked up just one ATP title. Though the disappointing result in South West London was a tough one for Zverev to take, it may just have been for the best. The packed calendar in professional tennis does not allow much rest for players, with the short off-season typically lasting from late November through December. Zverev has felt the full force of the busy schedule this year, playing in every Masters event so far, as well as all three majors. Losing in the first round at Wimbledon and opting not to play at the Washington Open meant he had an entire month off from playing tour-level events. As well as being able to recover in his time away from the sport, Zverev was able to train with Toni Nadal at the Rafael Nadal academy, and appeared to be looking a lot happier in practice. With a Grand Slam title still eluding him, Zverev's break may have just provided him with exactly what he needs to go all the way at the upcoming US Open. Alcaraz and Sinner may look set to dominate men's tennis for years to come, but they are not unbeatable, and Zverev has recorded wins against both of them. Should he meet either of the two young stars in New York, he may now be more prepared than ever to snap their streak at Grand Slams.</p>

There is no doubt that most fans and insiders expected brighter results from Joao Fonseca in recent months, but the young Brazilian talent is having more difficulty than expected playing his best tennis and some criticism has also begun to circulate on social media.

He had been amazing between the end of last season and the beginning of 2025, in which he took away the satisfaction of winning the Next Gen ATP Finals in Saudi Arabia thanks to a perfect run and defeating an experienced opponent like Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open, proving that he did not suffer from the pressure in the slightest.

Subsequently, the South American star won his first ATP title on the red clay of Buenos Aires and some thought that he would enter the Top 20 of the ATP rankings already by the end of this year.

However, Fonseca did not play in the best way during the red clay season and had too little experience on the grass to go far at the Wimbledon Championships, where he still put in a series of good performances.

Everyone thought Joao would shine again at the Toronto Masters 1000, which is played on a surface that is very suitable for his game and four of the top six players in the world are not present. His run in Canada – on the other hand – immediately ended against Australian ace Tristan Schoolkate, who was very skilled at exploiting the weaknesses of his young rival.

Speaking on 'Tennis Channel', former WTA No.1 and top analyst Lindsay Davenport analyzed Fonseca's current struggles in detail: "His season has been excellent so far considering that he is only 18, but he has to get used to the fact that expectations have increased and people don't expect him to be eliminated in the first round. 

Now he has some time before the Cincinnati Masters 1000 starts and it will be important for him to train with the right intensity, but I don't know if he plans to return to Brazil or not."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek has taken aim at “ridiculous” reporting in the Polish media, having previously criticised articles about herself and her team following her Wimbledon triumph. World No 3 Swiatek is still riding high off the back of her stunning SW19 success last month, double-bagelling Amanda Anisimova in the final to win her sixth Grand Slam title. The Pole's form had been heavily scrutinised amid a drop in results, with Swiatek failing to make a final between the French Open in June 2024 and the Bad Homburg Open over twelve months later. Speaking after her Wimbledon success, the former world No 1 told the Polish media to “leave me alone” after heavy scrutiny of herself and her team. Naomi Osaka closing in on significant rankings breakthrough after split from Patrick Mouratoglou Jessica Pegula makes ‘sloppy' admission after shock Canadian Open defeat “For sure, the past months, how the media sometimes describe me – and I've got to say, unfortunately, Polish media, how they treated me and my team, it wasn't really pleasant,” said Swiatek. Following her SW19 victory, the world No 3 has returned to action at the Canadian Open this week, with wins over Guo Hanyu and Eva Lys to start her campaign. And, after her comprehensive victory against Lys on Friday night, Swiatek has again heavily criticised those she deemed to place her under unfair scrutiny. The 24-year-old revealed that she rarely read reporting about – but was shocked by what was written when she did take a look. “But besides that, I don't read at all. Swiatek is searching for her maiden Canadian Open title this fortnight, and is now riding a nine-match win streak after winning her opening two matches in Montreal. Swiatek is the second seed in Montreal and is currently projected to face world No 2 and top seed Coco Gauff in the final, should both women hold their seeding. Swiatek dispatched Eva Lys in straight sets to continue an impressive run of form at WTA 1000 tournaments. A former Polish player has made some harsh comments on Iga Swiatek's Wimbledon win.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Zverev has faced many different players during his time on the ATP Tour. Over the past decade the German has faced tennis' greatest icons such as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. On the other hand, Zverev is competing against Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, the brightest stars of today. The 28-year-old has had varying degrees of success against those players, but there are two in particular that he finds more difficult to beat. It would be no surprise if he named the likes of Djokovic or Sinner. But Zverev's two most annoying players to face are Daniil Medvedev and Francisco Cerundolo, and he explained why. “For me the most obvious answer is Daniil Medvedev. I have lost to him like 78 times,” Zverev said. “Even now I am ranked three in the world and he is ranked 14 and I still lose to him in Halle. Zverev has faced Medvedev on 20 occasions, and he made a bright start to their rivalry by winning five of their first six meetings. Zverev has only faced Cerundolo on three occasions, but he has yet to secure a victory against the Argentinian. Zverev will face Cerundolo for a fourth time when they do battle at the Canadian Open, which will be their first meeting on a hard court.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek has shown no signs of slowing down after her Wimbledon title last month, as she has cruised into the Canadian Open Round of 16. There, she will meet Clara Tauson, in what promises to be a tough, gritty encounter for the 23-year-old. A powerful ball-striker, she has yet to beat Iga Swiatek in her career, despite coming close many years ago at Indian Wells. Their only meeting this year came at Wimbledon, as Tauson was one of the seven players brushed aside during Swiatek's unprecedented title conquest. She told reporters: “Well, that's going to be the first time I play a heavy hitter here. “When we played, I feel like I was solid enough for her to miss a bit more, but I know that she's this kind of player that when she feels it, you know, she's going to play well. Yeah, I'll prepare tactically as before any other match, and that's it.” Whilst Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz both opted out of Washington and now the Canadian Open, Swiatek is still going strong in North America despite having also reached the final of Wimbledon, where she won her maiden title at the All-England Club. And, she is showing no signs of fatigue either, with the Polish tennis star having breezed through her first few rounds in Montreal. Qualifier Guo Hanyu posed little threat, before the talented youngster Lys was brushed aside in straight sets as well. Tauson, however, should provide the first semblance of adversity since that Wimbledon final, especially given how Swiatek clearly rates her upcoming Danish opponent. However, given her current form, she should fear no one.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams recently enjoyed a successful return to competition in Washington, where she became the oldest woman to win a match since 2004 before going out in the second round. The seven-time Major winner is a tennis icon and knows she has “nothing left to prove”, but she still loves the sport and will be ramping up her comeback in Cincinnati later this month. The 45-year-old was a trailblazer when it came to getting equal pay at the Grand Slam tournaments. She spent years holding meetings with tournament bosses to fight for equality, and one meeting at Wimbledon proved crucial. Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. One day before competing in the 2005 Wimbledon final, which she went on to win, Williams found herself in a room with members of the Grand Slam Board, continuing her fight for equal prize money. And she had a mic-drop moment, as she forced everyone present to close their eyes and reflect before walking out. Two years later, she got her wish, and the men's and women's singles champions at Wimbledon were offered the same winners' cheque. I said, ‘Now that your eyes are closed, you don't know if that person next to you is a man or a woman, but everyone's heart beats the same way. I didn't stay for the whole meeting. Lots of people think that was impactful. I think that's why I spoke out -- because my mum said, ‘There's something wrong, you stand up for it'.” At the time, there was a £30,000 difference in prize money for men's and women's singles champions. She wrote: “I'm disappointed not for myself but for all of my fellow women players who have struggled so hard to get here and who, just like the men, give their all on the courts of SW19. “I'm disappointed for the great legends of the game, such as Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who have never stopped fighting for equality. And disappointed that the home of tennis is sending a message to women across the world that we are inferior.” Her efforts paid off, and a year later, Wimbledon offered equal prize money. Fittingly, it was Williams who lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish in 2007, earning the exact same cash prize as male champion Roger Federer, £700k. And when Williams returned to competition in Washington last week, she urged the next generation of players to continue her work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This June, Carlos Alcaraz claimed his fifth Major title at Roland Garros. The 22-year-old scored a memorable 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 victory over world no. 1 Jannik Sinner after a massive turnaround and three match points saved. Carlos revisited one of his career-high victories in a clash that will be remembered for its breathtaking twists and turns. Facing the exit door, Alcaraz relied on unwavering belief and mental fortitude that brought him tennis glory. The young gun focused on winning one point at a time while steadily climbing back. The full 5th set super tiebreak between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner ↘️#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/SZwLyNgYSh Carlos knew that closing out a Major final can weigh heavily on any player, even someone composed and monolith one as Jannik. His refusal to panic slowly turned the tide, propelling him to one of the most remarkable comebacks in Major finals. The victory cemented Carlos' status as one of tennis' fiercest competitors. "I simply thought about coming back little by little: one point at a time, especially on those three match points. I knew things would not be easy for Jannik. As soon as you show weakness, there's no chance of coming back - you are lost," Carlos Alcaraz said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Briton wins just eight points on her own serve in 6-2, 6-1 defeat by Amanda Anisimova at the Canadian Open Emma Raducanu won just three games in her 6-2, 6-1 defeat by Amanda Anisimova at the Canadian Open in a match that lasted only 64 minutes. Following her impressive run to the semi-finals at last week's Washington Open, Raducanu comfortably won the opening two rounds in Montreal before coming up against Anisimova, who lost this year's Wimbledon final 6-0, 6-0 in under an hour. The British No 1 had won both her previous meetings with Anisimova, in Miami and Australia this year, on hard courts. On both those occasions, it was over in straight sets. Her serve has been a key weapon at times to get her out of trouble in this US swing, notably against Naomi Osaka in Washington. But against Anisimova she managed to hold her serve just once in each set. Although there was only one double fault in the match, Raducanu only won 50 per cent of points on her first serve, and 26.7 per cent on her second serve, all while producing no aces. “Emma is such a tough player and she's in such good form and we've had a lot of tough battles so I'm really happy to be through this one but it's not easy playing her.” On that occasion in July, Anisimova made a flurry of errors, winning just nine points in the opening set, and finished with 28 unforced errors and five double faults, a far cry from her on-court performance that proved too much for Raducanu in Montreal. Raducanu has some time off before going to play in Cincinnati, where she will be seeded and receive a bye in the first round.</p>
