Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.

Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.

The health sector's interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.

“One of the prominent themes we've been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.

But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.

Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don't have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.

Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems' stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.

But some officials remain unconvinced.

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.

That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.

“When the County supported Erlanger's transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn't envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.

“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.

While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn't disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts' $1 million annual lease payment.”

Erlanger's president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.

“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts' incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.

“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”

Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system's name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician's office sponsoring a Little League team's jerseys.

“It's an economic signal of strength but it's also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”

But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.

After the nonprofit Valley Children's Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.

Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.

“Valley Children's relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children's Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.

“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children's staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”

But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.

A Valley Children's spokesperson told Stateline that game-day entitlements at the stadium, such as the tailgates, catering and suite, have been used for patients and their families.

The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital's use of state funding.

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.

In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.

And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn't yet finalized details of the deal with the state's flagship university.

Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system's marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.

“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you're giving back to the community.”

For example, it can allow a hospital's providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women's health and on preventing strokes.

And sports sponsorship more broadly isn't a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.

“There's a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It's a cultural talking point.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Arctic environments are entering dangerous feedback loops that accelerate the climate crisis.

The Arctic island of Svalbard is so reliably frigid that humanity bet its future on the place. Since 2008, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault — set deep in frozen soil known as permafrost — has accepted nearly 1.4 million samples of more than 6,000 species of critical crops. But, the island is warming six to seven times faster than the rest of the planet, making even winters freakishly hot, at least by Arctic standards. Indeed, in 2017, an access tunnel to the vault flooded as permafrost melted, though the seeds weren't impacted.

This February, a team of scientists was working on Svalbard when irony took hold. Drilling into the soil, they gathered samples of bacteria that proliferate when the ground thaws. These microbes munch on organic matter and burp methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas and significant driver of global warming. Those emissions are potentially fueling a feedback loop in the Arctic: As more soil thaws, more methane is released, leading to more thawing and more methane, and on and on. 

In some parts of Svalbard, though, the scientists didn't need to drill. Air temperatures climbed above freezing for 14 of the 28 days of February, reaching 40 degrees Fahrenheit, when the average temperature at this time of year is 5 degrees. Snow vanished in places, leaving huge pools of water. “I brought my equipment to drill into frozen soil and then ended up sampling a lot of soil just with a spoon, like it was soft ice cream,” said Donato Giovannelli, a geomicrobiologist at the University of Naples Federico II and co-lead author of a paper describing the experience, published last week in the journal Nature Communications. “That was really pretty shocking.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Scientists can now dig with silverware in the Svalbard winter because the Arctic has descended into a crisis of reflectivity. Until recently, the far north had a healthy amount of sea ice, which bounced much of the sun's energy back into space, keeping the region cool. But as the planet has warmed, that ice has been disappearing, exposing darker water, which absorbs sunlight and raises temperatures. This is yet another Arctic feedback loop, in which more warming melts more sea ice, leading to more local warming, and on and on. 

Making matters worse, as temperatures rise in the far north, more moisture enters the atmosphere. For one, warmer seawater evaporates more readily, adding water vapor to the air. And two, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. This leads to the formation of more low-level clouds, which trap heat like blankets — especially in the dark Arctic winter — amplifying the warming. That, combined with the loss of sea ice, is why the Arctic is warming up to four times as fast as the rest of the planet, with Svalbard warming even faster than that. 

During the winter, Svalbard's soils have historically frozen solid, and scientists assumed this made microbial activity grind to a halt. Reindeer could push through the snow to graze on vegetation. But February's heat and rain melted the snow, forming vast pools of water that froze once temperatures dropped again. That created a layer of ice that reindeer couldn't break through. “What we encountered was just so powerful, to be in the middle of this event,” said James Bradley, a geomicrobiologist at the Mediterranean Institute of Oceanography and Queen Mary University of London, co-lead author of the paper. “It really almost all melted over large, large, large areas of the ground. That ground remained frozen, so the water didn't have too many places to drain away to, so what we also saw was huge pooling of liquid water over the tundra.”

This new climate regime could be profoundly altering the soil microbiome. Scientists assumed that methane-producing bacteria, known as methanogens, stopped proliferating when Svalbard's soils froze in the winter, just like food in your freezer keeps for months because it's in a hostile environment for microbes. But with warm spells like this, thawing could awaken methanogens, which could still produce that greenhouse gas even if it then rains and a layer of ice forms at the surface. In addition, that solid cap on the soil will stop the exchange of atmospheric gases into the ground, creating anaerobic, or oxygen-poor, conditions that methanogens love. “In some areas, deeper layers might never freeze completely, which means the methanogens and microbes at depth remain active,” Giovannelli said. “There's no real winter period.”

Vegetation, too, is changing up there, a phenomenon known as Arctic greening. As temperatures rise, trees and shrubs are creeping north to conquer new territory. The good news is that those plants capture carbon as they grow, mitigating global warming to a certain extent. But the bad news is that dark-colored vegetation absorbs more of the sun's energy and raises temperatures, just like the exposed ocean does. And shrubs trap a layer of snow against the landscape, preventing the chill of winter from penetrating the soil and keeping it frozen.

The speed of transformation in the Arctic is shocking, even for stoic scientists. And as nations keep spewing greenhouse gases, the feedback loops of the far north are threatening to load the atmosphere with still more methane. “We call this the new Arctic — this is not something that is a one-off,” Giovannelli said. “And on the other side, we've probably been a bit too cautious with our warnings regarding the climate. It's not something for the next generation. It's something for our generation.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

            A Texas House panel on Saturday advanced a new congressional map as state Republicans power ahead with a strategy backed by President Donald Trump to help the GOP maintain the US House majority in the 2026 midterms.
    


            The map, unveiled earlier this week, attempts to make five Democratic congressional seats more favorable to Republicans. Texas Republicans argue the move is necessary over concerns that the current maps are unconstitutional and racially gerrymandered. Democrats have said it would suppress the votes of people of color.
    


            The Texas House redistricting committee voted along party lines Saturday to approve the map, setting up a full House vote.
    


            Texas Democratic Party Chair Kendall Scudder said Saturday the party will file a lawsuit if the map passes, adding that state Republicans are “silencing voters on behalf of Donald Trump.”
    


            “Democrats must fight this Trump power grab through any means necessary, and blue states across the country should use this as a signal flare to start carving up their own states and make these authoritarian wannabe Republican lawmakers regret ever opening up this redistricting discussion in the first place,” Scudder said in a statement.
    


            Democratic governors in states like California have already warned they will attempt the same tactics to help their party win more seats, in what one US House Democrat described to CNN as a “redistricting arms race.”
    


            US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his political team are exploring similar plans in California, New York, New Jersey, Minnesota and Washington state in hopes of flipping at least a handful of Republican seats next November. Democrats need a net gain of just three seats to win the House in the midterms.
    


            The new Texas map features 30 districts that Trump would have won in 2024 if the map was in place, up from 27 under the current district lines. In total, there are five more seats that Trump won by more than 10 percentage points, according to data from the Texas Legislative Council.
    


            The proposed map eliminates the Austin-area seat of Rep. Greg Casar, who would likely be forced into a primary with another liberal Democrat, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, in the Austin area.
    


            Multiple people close to Doggett have told CNN they do not expect him to bow out quietly and instead foresee the two battling it out in a primary. One of those people close to the senior House Democrat pointed out that he has $6.2 million cash on hand.
    


            In a statement this week, Doggett did not address the question of his future and said his “sole focus” is defeating the new GOP map.
    


            Casar, for his part, vowed in a statement to “fight back with everything we've got,” calling for voters to “mobilize against this illegal map.”
    


            Republicans also propose merging the Houston-area seat of Rep. Al Green with a vacant seat held by the late Rep. Sylvester Turner, who died in office earlier this year. Green's district was altered more than any other sitting member in the plan. Democrats expect Green to run in the new seat, though he may have to battle it out with some of the Democrats who were already running for the Turner seat.
    


            The map would also make two southern Texas seats — held by Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez — more Republican-leaning. But multiple Democrats view the seats as still in reach for the two centrist members who typically performed ahead of statewide or national Democrats.
    


            Trump has not yet weighed in on the proposed Texas map.

“Democracy has died in El Salvador today,” said opposition Congressmember Marcela Villatoro.

El Salvador's Legislative Assembly — which is controlled by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele's New Ideas party — on Thursday approved a series of constitutional reforms, including abolition of presidential term limits, that critics warned pose a grave threat to the Central American nation's fragile democracy.

As El Faro reported, lawmakers approved measures allowing for indefinite presidential terms, expanding the current five-year presidential terms to six years, eliminating the second round of presidential elections, and advancing the end of Bukele's term from 2029 to 2027 in order to synchronize presidential, legislative, and municipal elections.

New Ideas Congresswoman Ana Figueroa, who proposed the reforms, argues that if other elected offices in El Salvador do not have term limits, why should the presidency?

“This is quite simple, Salvadoran people. Only you will be able to decide how long you support your president,” Figueroa said Thursday.

Congressional Vice President Suecy Callejas, also of New Ideas, contended that “power has returned to the only place to which it truly belongs… to the Salvadoran people.”

However, opposition lawmakers, journalists, human rights defenders, and others condemned the measures, which come amid an ongoing “state of emergency” that, while dramatically reducing crime in what was once the world's murder capital, has seen widespread repression of human and civil rights.

“Democracy has died in El Salvador today,” said Congresswoman Marcela Villatoro of the opposition ARENA party, who argued that the reforms were “approved without consultation, in a gross and cynical way.”

Nuevas Ideas firman iniciativa para reformar Constitución con dispensa de trámite:✅Ampliar período presidencial a 6 años✅Permitir reelección presidencial indefinida✅Eliminar segunda vuelta en elección presidencial. Ganará presidencia quien tenga más votos en primera vuelta pic.twitter.com/Z9dq43pFH4

Thiago Süssekind, a Brazilian scholar and professor at the University of Oxford in England, called the reforms' passage “the moment when El Salvador buried its democracy.”

“Nayib Bukele — the darling dictator of the Latin right — can now govern forever,” Süssekind added. “The discourse, paradoxically, is about democracy — deliberately conflating it with the will of the majority.”

Chilean pollster Marta Lagos argued on social media that El Salvador is being transformed into “an electoral dictatorship” that “excludes an essential element of democracy: respect for minorities, the rule of law, the separation of powers, and civic and political freedoms.”

Lagos noted “the detention of thousands of people without due process,” an apparent reference to prisons including the notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, where the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump — an erstwhile critic-turned-ally of Bukele — is sending deported migrants, including innocent people, to face abusive and sometimes deadly imprisonment.

Juanita Goebertus, director of the Americas division at Human Rights Watch (HRW), argued that New Ideas is “following the same path as Venezuela.”

HRW and other human rights groups accuse the United Socialist Party government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of grave human rights and electoral abuses, and many leftists in Venezuela and beyond feel the Bolivarian Revolution launched under former President Hugo Chávez has been betrayed.

“It starts with a leader who uses their popularity to concentrate power, and ends in dictatorship,” Goebertus warned.

Like Trump, Bukele has shrugged off — and at times even embraced — the “dictator” label. He once called himself the “coolest dictator in the world.”

Trump — who has himself flirted with the concept of being president for life, or at least for a third term — has remained silent about Bukele's democratic backsliding, even as his administration imposes staggering tariffs on Brazil and punitive sanctions on a leading member of its judiciary for defending democracy.

Plaudits for Bukele, Magnitsky sanctions for de Moraes. The Rubio way.

Such actions, along with the Trump administration's record of targeting certain authoritarian governments while courting and coddling others, drew stinging rebuke by social media users in El Salvador and beyond.

Comments from Latin American X users included:

Thursday's reforms — which must still be ratified by lawmakers — mark the second major modification of presidential term limits in El Salvador. Although the country's constitution prohibits presidential reelection, New Ideas purged the constitutional court's judges and replaced them with ones loyal to Bukele. The court subsequently ruled Bukele was eligible to run again, and he won last year's election in a landslide.

Bukele wasn't always so keen on presidential reelection. In a 2013 interview, he said that “in El Salvador, a president cannot be reelected.”

Como el criminal que anticipa su delito… Con una sonrisa…En el 2013 Nayib Bukele dijo que la reelección presidencial estaba prohibida en El Salvador para garantizar que un aspirante a dictador no se mantuviera en el poder y ocupara ese poder para seguir en el poder…Es… pic.twitter.com/J0jXPgoWVR

“This is to ensure that he… doesn't use his power to remain in power,” Bukele added.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

The UN treats the Polisario as the legitimate representative of the Western Sahara people. The US is now vilifying it.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Washington's designation of armed groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) has always been politicized, but it may now reach a new level of absurdity thanks to a bipartisan resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced by Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina) and Jimmy Panetta (D-California) targeting the Frente Polisario, the government of Western Sahara, officially known as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Morocco, an important U.S. ally, invaded Western Sahara in 1975 on the eve of its independence from Spain and currently occupies nearly 80 percent of the territory, while the Polisario appears to governroughly 40 percent of the Western Saharan population in the liberated zones and in refugee camps in western Algeria.

According to the UN Security Council, terrorism is defined as:

…criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.

Most nations, including the United States, have traditionally only applied that label to irregular forces. But the U.S. has broken with that practice in recent years, with Washington designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) — the largest branch of the country's armed forces — as a terrorist group. Since the IRGC controls major sectors of Iranian industry, colleges, and other non-military institutions, large segments of the Iranian population, as a result of military conscription or simply taking classes and going to civilian jobs at IRGC-affiliated institutions, are now deemed to have terrorist affiliations.

The Houthis of Yemen, who constitute the de facto government of three-quarters of that country's population, have also been labeled a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States, thereby complicating desperately-needed relief efforts to starving Yemenis who live under Houthi-governed areas.

This new legislation targeting the Polisario — which would classify as a terrorist group the entire ruling body of a nation-state which has been recognized at various points by more than 80 countries and is a full member state of the African Union — may constitute the most extreme politicization of the FTO designation to date. 

Morocco invaded Western Sahara in 1975, just prior to the territory's scheduled independence from Spain in direct defiance of a landmark ruling by the International Court of Justice and series of United Nations resolutions. The Security Council unanimously called on Moroccan forces to immediately withdraw from the territory and allow the people of Western Sahara to determine their own destiny. However, both France and the United States, wanting to support the pro-Western king and wary of a leftist revolutionary movement coming to power, prevented the Security Council from enforcing its mandate.

The Polisario, which had been fighting Spain for independence, was forced to then fight off the Moroccan invaders. By 1982, they had liberated most of the country. However, the United States and France dramatically increased their assistance to Morocco's conquest, reversing the Polisario's gains and created a military stalemate. In 1991, the Polisario agreed to a ceasefire in return for Morocco accepting a UN-supervised referendum on the fate of the territory. Morocco never allowed the referendum to go forward, however. They were again supported by the U.S. and France, which blocked the UN from forcing Morocco to proceed with the plebiscite, which most observers believe would have resulted in an overwhelming majority supporting independence. 

After nearly three decades of futile diplomatic efforts, sporadic nonviolent resistance in the occupied territory, and ongoing Moroccan violations of the ceasefire, the Polisario resumed the armed struggle in November 2020. 

The following month, during the final weeks of his first administration, Donald Trump made the United States the first country to formally recognize Morocco's annexation of Western Sahara. In return, Morocco gave in to U.S. pressure to recognize Israel, becoming one of the nations to break with the longstanding Arab League position of refusing to establish formal diplomatic relations until Israel withdrew from occupied Arab territories, including the Golan Heights, West Bank, and Gaza Strip. 

While Biden did not formally endorse Trump's decision, he allowed it to stand. U.S. government maps under Biden began depicting Western Sahara as part of Morocco, with nothing delineating the two. Reports by the State Department and other federal agencies, which until then had treated Western Sahara as a separate entity, began including the territory as a part of Morocco. While the administration claimed it still supported the UN-led peace process, its recognition emboldened the Moroccans to take an even more hardline posture, arguing that U.S. recognition essentially resolved the issue. 

In 2023, Israel became the second country to recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, no doubt encouraged by the precedent of the world's most powerful nation breaking with the UN's longstanding prohibition against recognizing the expansion of territory by military force. 

During the 50 years of resistance against Moroccan occupation forces, the Polisario has never engaged in any acts of terrorism. They have formally ratified the Geneva Conventions and their protocols and they are a party to the African Union's Convention on Counter-Terrorism.

The United Nations recognizes the Polisario as the legitimate representative of the Western Sahara people and the African Union recognizes Western Sahara as a full member state. Neither they nor any other credible international legal entity classify the Polisario as a terrorist group.

Supporters of Morocco's autocratic monarchy have tried to link the Polisario — which is a democratic, secular, moderately left-leaning liberation movement — with Islamist groups like Hezbollah, in addition to the Iranian government. This is a ludicrous claim, especially as the U.S. State Department has found no indication that the Polisario has any operational ties with such entities. Moreover, I have spoken to Polisario leaders who have been quite explicit that their interpretation of Islam is more liberal than the model espoused by Iran's leaders.

Even former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, one of the most extreme critics of Iran, recently noted that allegations of Iranian influence on the Polisario were groundless. Similarly, former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker said the Polisario-governed refugee camps and liberated zones of Western Sahara have “exercised a degree of democracy, maintained a high literacy rate, and never resorted to terrorism.”

The Western Saharan liberation struggle is unified, democratic, has never questioned Morocco's right to exist, and has never targeted civilians, yet they are still being denied their right to self-determination and are now being labeled as terrorists.

As with the Russian and Israeli annexations of neighboring territories, Morocco's 1975 annexation of Western Sahara is a flagrant violation of international law. As long as civilians are not targeted, it is not terrorism for a people to engage in armed resistance to a foreign belligerent occupation.

Morocco's claim on Western Sahara is rejected by the United Nations, the International Court of Justice, the African Union, and a broad consensus of international legal scholars that consider the region a non-self-governing territory that must be allowed self-determination. The Sahrawis have a distinct dialect, kinship system, dress, cuisine, and colonial history and have no desire to live under the rule of their autocratic neighbor. 

Unlike the Polisario-controlled areas, those living in the Moroccan-occupied parts of Western Sahara suffer under brutal repression. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and other reputable human rights groups have documented widespread suppression of peaceful pro-independence activists by Moroccan occupation forces, including torture, beatings, detention without trial, and extrajudicial killings.

If the effort to get the Polisario classified as a Foreign Terrorist Organization succeeds, it would jeopardize the U.S.-backed United Nations peace process. U.S. officials could no longer be part of the negotiations if one of the parties is labeled a terrorist group.

And, as with the FTO designation against the Houthis, the 170,000 Sahrawi civilians living in Polisario-governed refugee camps would no longer be able to receive much of their desperately needed humanitarian aid. It would criminalize many of the interactions and transactions on which the refugees are dependent to survive.

The irony is that the establishment of a democratic secular Arab nation like the Polisario-led Western Sahara is what the U.S. government has long claimed to support. In reality, however, they are siding with a conservative and repressive monarchy against those very same forces of democracy and secularism. 

One possible motivation for pursuing an FTO designation is that it would likely lead the United States to place strict sanctions on the Polisario's two biggest supporters — Algeria and South Africa — on the grounds that they were “state sponsors of terrorism.” Algeria is the last of the left-leaning secular nationalist Arab governments that once dominated the region and is a historical rival of the U.S.-backed Moroccan monarchy. And the Trump administration has been going after South Africa, a leading power in the Global South challenging U.S. hegemony, since its return to the White House, including makign false charges of a “genocide” against that country's relatively well-off white minority. 

Targeting the Polisario also underscores how Washington's opposition to Palestinian rights is not really about concerns over terrorism or Israel's security. The Western Saharan liberation struggle is unified, democratic, has never questioned Morocco's right to exist, and has never targeted civilians, yet they are still being denied their right to self-determination and are now being labeled as terrorists.

By labeling the Western Saharan nationalist movement as terrorist, it makes it easier for Washington to ignore the flagrant double standards in its policies of opposing Russia's expansionism in Ukraine as a violation of the “rules-based international order” while defending Morocco for doing the same thing.  

Terrorism is a real threat in North Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere. Yet Washington's willingness to label a popular movement and even a recognized government as a “terrorist organization” simply for pursuing their recognized right to national self-determination through legal means further underscores how politicians are willing to manipulate legitimate concerns about terrorism in order to undermine longstanding international legal principles. 

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Ledecky wins 800m freestyle in 8:05.62 CR time

McIntosh settles for bronze behind Pallister

US star extends record with seventh world 800m title

Katie Ledecky once again proved untouchable in her signature event, holding off a star-studded field to win her seventh world title in the 800m freestyle on Saturday in Singapore, a feat no swimmer has ever achieved in a single event.

The 28-year-old American delivered a championship-record 8:05.62 to edge Australia's Lani Pallister (8:05.98) and Canada's Summer McIntosh (8:07.29) in one of the most anticipated races of the world swimming championships. The trio are the three fastest women in history over 800m, and the amply hyped final more than lived up to the billing, producing the fastest field ever assembled in the event.

Ledecky trailed McIntosh by just 0.14 seconds at the 700m mark but surged ahead in the closing stretch, then held off a furious challenge from Pallister to touch first. The lead had changed hands multiple times, with Pallister taking a remarkable five seconds off her personal best and McIntosh – the 17-year-old phenom who ended Ledecky's 13-year unbeaten streak earlier this year – appearing poised to complete a historic title sweep.

With the win, Ledecky extended her perfect record in global 800m freestyle finals to 11 wins from 11, dating back to her breakout Olympic gold in 2012 at just 15 years old. It marks her 23rd career world title, trailing only Michael Phelps' 26, and her 30th world championship medal overall. She also won gold in the 1,500m and bronze in the 400m earlier in the week, her 800–1,500 double once again underscoring her dominance in distance freestyle.

“I was really happy, obviously,” Ledecky said afterward. “It's the fastest I've ever been at a world championships. It's been a great season, and coming into tonight, I knew I was going to be happy with it no matter the outcome. That really took the pressure off and allowed me to enjoy the race and appreciate the moment.”

“They pushed me all the way,” she added. “That's pretty incredible, three of us going under 8:10. I just kept telling myself to trust my legs, because I've gotten a bit better at kicking. Just running home at the end.”

Ledecky also reflected on her mindset at this stage of her decorated career. “I don't think I have anything to lose at this point. I'm just enjoying the crowd, swimming against the best in the world. Everyone in that heat is the next generation of swimmers coming up. Just proud to be a part of it.”

Saturday's showdown had been billed as a changing-of-the-guard moment, with McIntosh seeking to match Phelps's record of five individual titles at a single world championships, a milestone no female swimmer has ever reached. But beating Ledecky in the 800 always loomed as the toughest obstacle.

McIntosh entered the meet in white-hot form, having broken three world records in five days at the Canadian trials and posted the third-fastest 800m time ever in June. She also handed Ledecky a rare defeat earlier this year at a sectional meet in Florida.

“I think this is a really big learning lesson for me,” McIntosh said. “I went into the 800 free with full confidence … but I'll try to get this out of my mind quickly and finish strong in the IM.” The Canadian will look to close her remarkable week with a fourth gold in Sunday's 400m individual medley, where she is the prohibitive favorite.

Pallister, who also earned bronze in the 1,500m and finished fourth in the 400m, said the performance exceeded even her own expectations. “I knew I had a sub-8:10 in me,” the Australian told Nine Network. “I didn't think I'd be 8:05 here, but now I'm really thrilled with that.” The 22-year-old credited her previous races next to Ledecky for building her confidence in the distance events.

Ledecky's gold came on a triumphant night for the United States team, which has endured both illness and criticism throughout the week in Singapore. With Phelps and Ryan Lochte publicly questioning the team's management amid a stomach bug outbreak, the Americans responded with their best day of the meet by winning three golds on Saturday and setting a world record in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay.

That team – Jack Alexy, Patrick Sammon, Kate Douglass and Torri Huske – clocked 3:18.48, breaking Australia's 2023 mark. Gretchen Walsh also claimed the women's 50m butterfly title in 24.83, completing a sprint double after earlier winning the 100 fly.

The United States now lead the medal table with eight golds heading into the final day of competition. But no victory resonated more than Ledecky's, a race that reaffirmed her place atop the sport and reminded the world, yet again, that the queen of distance freestyle still reigns.

No pause on Russian imports by Indian oil firms who base decisions on ‘price, grade of crude, logistics and economic factors'

Indian oil refineries will continue to buy oil from Russia, officials have said, before threatened US sanctions next week against Moscow's trading partners over the war in Ukraine.

Media reports on Friday had suggested India, a big energy importer, would stop buying cheap Russian oil. Trump later told reporters that such a move would be “a good step” if true.

“I understand that India is no longer going to be buying oil from Russia,” he said. “That's what I heard. I don't know if that's right or not. That is a good step. We will see what happens.”

However, official sources in India, quoted by the news agency ANI, rebutted Trump's claim, saying Indian oil companies had not paused Russian imports and that supply decisions were based on “price, grade of crude, inventories, logistics and other economic factors”.

Trump's remarks came a day after the White House announced tariffs of 25% on all Indian goods, along with a penalty for buying arms and energy from Russia amid the war in Ukraine.

Trump has given an 8 August deadline for Vladimir Putin to stop the war or risk further sanctions on tariffs on countries that import Russian oil.

Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Indian state-owned refineries had suspended Russian oil purchases amid the tariff threats and narrowing price discounts.

But on Saturday, the New York Times cited two unnamed senior Indian officials who said there had been no change in Indian government policy related to importing Russian oil. One said the government had “not given any direction to oil companies” to cease buying oil from Russia.

“These are long-term oil contracts,” one of the sources said. “It is not so simple to just stop buying overnight.”

The sources cited by ANI said Indian oil refineries operated in full compliance with international norms, and that Russian oil had never been directly sanctioned by the US or EU. “Instead, it was subjected to a G7-EU price-cap mechanism designed to limit revenue while ensuring global supplies continued to flow.”

They added: “India's purchases have remained fully legitimate and within the framework of international norms.”

The sources also noted that if India had not “absorbed discounted Russian crude combined with Opec+ production cuts of 5.8 mb/d [millions of barrels a day], global oil prices could have surged well beyond the March 2022 peak of US$137/bbl [a barrel], intensifying inflationary pressures worldwide”.

Russia is the top oil supplier to India, responsible for about 35% of the country's supplies. India says that as a major energy importer it must find the cheapest supplies to protect its population against rising costs.

On Friday, India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, said: “We look at what is available in the markets, what is on offer, and also what is the prevailing global situation or circumstances.”

Jaiswal added that India had a “steady and time-tested partnership” with Russia.

This partnership has been a point of contention for the White House, with Trump posting on Truth Social on 30 July that while India was “our friend”, it had always bought most of its military equipment from Russia and was “Russia's largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE – ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!”

In a second post, Trump added: “I don't care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”

Ukraine's military said on Saturday it had hit oil facilities inside Russia, including a refinery in Ryazan, causing a fire on its premises. The strike also hit an oil storage facility, a military airfield for drones and an electronics factory.

NEW DELHI, August 2. /TASS/. India is on track to become the world's third-largest economy, despite global instability, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after US President Donald Trump's statements about the country's "dead economy."

"There is an atmosphere of global instability in the world. All countries are focused on their own interests. India is set to become the world's third-largest economy, which is why it must be vigilant about its economic interests," the prime minister emphasized.

Modi also stressed the importance of supporting domestic production and promoting the "Made in India" initiative.

"We will buy only what Indians produce. We must support local producers," the prime minister emphasized.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that despite friendly relations between the two countries, the US has relatively little trade with India because tariffs are "far too high, among the highest in the world." The US president pointed out that India has always purchased most of its military equipment from Russia and is also, along with China, is also the largest buyer of Russian energy resources. According to Trump, India will pay a 25% tariff in this regard. The US leader later stated that he does not care about the economic and trade ties between India and Russia, calling their economies "dead.".

NEW DELHI, August 2. /TASS/. India's purchases of Russian oil have made a positive contribution to global energy stability, a source in the Indian government told TASS.

"India's energy decisions were dictated by national interests, but they also contributed positively to global energy stability," he said.

"Had India not accepted Russian oil at a discount and had OPEC+ not cut production by 5.86 million barrels per day, global oil prices could have significantly exceeded the March 2022 peak of $137 per barrel, intensifying inflationary pressure around the world," he emphasized.

According to the source, "India's pragmatic approach ensured oil supplies, price stability, and market balance while fully complying with the international framework." "India, the world's third-largest energy consumer and 85% dependent on crude oil imports, has strategically diversified its supply sources to ensure energy security," the source pointed out.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that despite friendly relations between the two countries, the US has relatively little trade with India because tariffs are "far too high, among the highest in the world." The US president pointed out that India has always purchased most of its military equipment from Russia and is also, along with China, is also the largest buyer of Russian energy resources. According to Trump, India will pay a 25% tariff in this regard. The US leader later stated that he does not care about the economic and trade ties between India and Russia, calling their economies "dead." On July 14, Trump said that the US would impose tariffs of about 100% on Russia and its trading partners if the Ukrainian settlement is not reached within 50 days.

            The great ongoing American conversation escalated into a great American bar fight this summer, as a long and increasingly unhinged national back-and-forth about race, politics, sexuality, the nature of both the Trump administration and fame itself was triggered by … a jeans ad.
    


            What happened? American Eagle released a campaign starring the exceedingly charismatic actress Sydney Sweeney. In one ad, she is seen clad in a revealing version of the Canadian tuxedo, veritably busting out of a not really buttoned jean jacket. But though the mere facts of her physical existence have ignited multiple national debates previously, in this case, the reason people are talking (and talking!) is that the ad's script had her making puns about genes and jeans.
    


            “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring,” she says in one ad. In another cut, in which the camera aggressively zooms in on her cleavage, she claims: “My body's composition is determined by my genes.”
    


            Some viewers immediately connected the genetics commentary to her brilliant blue eyes and blonde, fine hair. After all, it was just last October that Donald Trump was identifying “bad genes” as a cause of invented or real crime committed by immigrants. Many felt that the ad was playing into this dark, not-very-concealed conversation about genetics in America.
    


            “This is intentional. This is pointed, and you're calling out to the consumers that you hope to attract here,” said Cheryl Overton, a long-time brand strategist and communications executive. “If American Eagle is really out there trying to target Americans to the right or to the far right, so be it. If that's who the product is designed for now, that is their right as a company to do that. But you have to know that folks are educated, folks are nuanced, and folks are willing to call brands out.”
    


            That calling-out was quickly followed by a louder and nastier wave of disdain that people would dare suggest the ad was intentionally about race — or that everyone was being stupid for talking about jeans anyway. “There's been a lot of conservative finger-wagging, like, ‘This is just a jeans ad,' said Emma McClendon, a fashion historian and assistant professor of fashion studies at St. John's University, who literally teaches a class on denim. “But I think that that just plays also on stereotypes of fashion being frivolous, and this just being jeans. The reality is that there's nothing more intimate to our identity than how we outfit our bodies.”
    


            At the beginning of this week, a spokesperson for the White House weighed in, saying that all this ruckus was why Trump got elected, calling the criticism “cancel culture run amok.” US Vice President JD Vance finally entered the fray at the end of the week, suggesting that the lesson Democrats “have apparently taken is we're going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful.”
    


            At last, as the week wound down, American Eagle issued a statement that was bound to make everyone a little unhappy. “Great jeans look good on everyone,” they assured us. Do they?
    


            While American Eagle enjoyed a brief $2-a-share surge in its stock price during the controversy, all the rest of us got were a bunch of questions. Here are some answers.
    


            “Our leadership team passed around some articles about it, and we were discussing whether we thought the American Eagle team when it first came out, did they understand? Were they trying to do something edgy and sexy that came across racist and didn't recognize that?” asked Kimberly Jefferson, senior vice president of client relations at PANBlast, a public relations firm that serves brands in the tech sector. “A quick look at their leadership team: They're a very white organization. So did they just miss it? Or is this intentionally playing to at best, a conservative, at worst, a racist ideal system that is pervasively growing in America? We went back and forth on that. How intentional was this?”
    


            “It seemed clear to me that they were aligning themselves with a white nationalist, MAGA-friendly identity,” said Shalini Shankar, an anthropology professor at Northwestern University who studies youth and advertising. “I think that this is them trying to rebrand themselves for the present moment, and language is very deliberately used here. People don't invoke genetics casually. It's just, it's very, very easy to sell denim without ever referencing it.”
    

Master of tension. And engines. Grab Syd's jeans before they're gone.


            “This one is just the consequences of bad and, dare I say, lazy writing. I don't think it was funny or clever,” said Alyssa Vingan, fashion writer and former editor of Nylon and Fashionista. “And I do think obviously it's cheap humor to have somebody like Sydney Sweeney, who's blonde with large breasts and a small waist, say she has good genes because she's hot. I don't think that it was much deeper than that. Unfortunately due to the climate we're in and things going on in America at large, it does read very, very, very poorly and insensitively.”
    


            “There's something to the fact that this company is called American Eagle, she's in jeans, with a car, with a dog,” said McClendon, the fashion professor. “In the current political climate, and then with the invocation of genetics, it feels like it's just playing on this broader, larger cultural social grappling we're having right now with what it means to be American.”
    


            They absolutely did mean it, said Emily Keegin, a freelance photo director — and lots of us are just pretending otherwise. “It's interesting to see how the news organizations that we consider to be left or more liberal, like the New York Times, The Atlantic, New York Magazine, their op-eds about this from yesterday and the day before are downplaying the situation or saying that it's not a big deal, or that it was just a mistake, or something, like it was overlooked. It means that the institutions are willing to give a pass to these things that maybe they shouldn't be.”
    


            Probably not, but do you even remember all that now? “Maybe two weeks ago? It was such a huge thing, and now everyone's moved past that,” said Hailey Knott, who is a social media manager for a global nonprofit and who worked at American Eagle for two years. “You know that CEO stepped down because of all of that controversy. And now nobody even — in my opinion — cares about that anymore.”
    


            “Rarely do you ever see something blow up so quickly as the kiss cam incident,” said Cyndee Harrison, a reputation and branding strategist and crisis communications specialist. “But their response, I thought it was masterfully done. They had humor and they were creative and they just brought everything back into brand alignment. In my opinion, American Eagle had a perfect opportunity to follow that same playbook: Acknowledge, reframe and move forward with clarity.”
    


            They did not.
    


            “Did it achieve the goal of getting people to talk about them and think about them? It did. The jury is still out on whether it's good for their business, whether it's going to increase sales, or whether it's bad for their business,” said Alison Weissbrot, executive editor at Adweek.
    


            “I feel like this is a masterclass in attention economy,” said Sam Gauchier, a vice president at Michele Marie PR. “I feel like American Eagle is riding the wave of controversy on purpose, just knowing that the outrage has become a form of its own currency — because everything at the end of the day is about how much money we can make as a brand, the amount of sales, the amount of clicks on an article, all of those things.”
    


            “Advertising is having a really hard time for a reason. You know, people are getting laid off for a reason, and it's not just AI. It's incredibly hard to make a dent in our media landscape,” said Keegin, the photo director.

            “This is the modern formula for outrage marketing,” said Molly McPherson, crisis and reputation strategist. “You spark debate, you drive engagement, you ride the wave. And then when the dust settles, American Eagle gets the clicks, the coverage and also the crash.”
    


            “This wasn't a mistake per se as much as a kind of provocation that I think landed as it was intended to and that we should expect to probably see more of this type of messaging, given how — in many ways — successful this one was,” Shankar said.
    


            “I'm honestly not a believer in all press is good press,” said Knott, the former American Eagle employee. She means because someone always has to clean up the consequences. “This is a PR crisis for them, and it's coming at them from social media. The senior leadership team, they don't have to see that. The social media team does. So they're the ones taking the brunt of that.”
    


            Until Friday's company statement, the company's top post on Instagram, for around five days, was of a Black woman in American Eagle clothing. Some of the comments were “keep it white ❤️ ❤️🇺🇸” and “Love me some lib tears” and a lot of people saying “damage control.”
    


            “I think it's extremely telling that American Eagle hasn't posted on social media since Sunday or said anything, because in my experience, when I worked there, they're posting at least three times a day on social media platforms,” said Knott, of the week before Friday evening's statement. “So if they're scaling back to zero times a day, it's a problem.”

            Not posting was probably wise. “I think if this had been a client of mine, I feel like the first thing I would say is don't rush — take a beat, read the room, get curious about what people are upset about,” said Gauchier. She also found it telling. The brand silence “also helps me think that this is calculated,” she said.
    


            “I think we're all so sick of these brand apologies that feel very AI-written or written by the law firm, and don't really have any heart or soul. I think what people want to hear is: How'd you get here? Do you hear why folks are concerned? What will you do moving forward to make sure that your storytelling is welcoming to all? But if this is a strategy to give the middle fingers up to those of us who are quote, unquote, woke, message received. Mission accomplished,” said Overton.
    


            “They are immediately very clearly pulling directly from the visual vocabulary of the Brooke Shields ad,” said McClendon, referencing the controversial 1980 Calvin Klein ad campaign. But “the Brooke Shields ads were really purely about sex. The whole genes/jeans thing –– that's new,” she said. (Interestingly, Shields herself said she did not see her Calvin Klein ads as overly sexualized.)
    


            “You can absolutely celebrate someone's body, and I mean, she is a beautiful specimen of humanity. But you can still celebrate that while being mindful of the narrative that you're shaping,” said Harrison. “This isn't necessarily ‘woke messaging,' it's just modern mindfulness around concepts like identity and beauty and belonging.”
    


            Highly sexualized ads are on brand for the moment, said Adweek's Weissbrot. “We're kind of seeing a return of male gazey advertising,” she said. “So I do think that, as the country kind of grapples with this rightward shift, advertisers are trying to figure out: What is the mood of the country? Do we appeal to what is the current zeitgeist, for better or worse? Or are we still going to try to meet different groups where they are?”
    


            American Eagle might, however, have scared other brands off sexy campaigns, or at least might have put a fork in this campaigns '90s-basement slightly porny aesthetic. “If I was Gap and I had a campaign coming out and someone was like, ‘Wow, that looks just like the Sydney Sweeney campaign,' I'd be like, ‘Okay, no, like, we gotta redo this. We gotta, like, rethink this,'” said Keegin.
    


            Surprise, we already are. Dunkin' posted an ad this week with a sexy youthful star saying “This tan? Genetics.” (Among many linking that campaign to the American Eagle campaign was a Dunkin' account Instagram commenter, who wrote: “I'll be walking into Dunkin' sporting my AE jeans.”)

            “Whenever I'm working with clients and they have a new campaign coming, I always ask them, like, ‘Okay, what is the goal of your campaign? Do you want more visibility? Do you want more sales? Do you want more conversion? Like, what is it exactly?' And if visibility is what they're looking for, then, you know, obviously I wouldn't gear them towards this specific strategy. But I wouldn't be surprised if other brands say visibility is what we're looking for, and someone might have the idea of doing something that blurs the line,” said Gauchier.
    


            Experts agree that Sydney Sweeney is always winning. She emerges from this national dust-up only more powerful than ever.
    


            “Certainly, it makes me very uncomfortable to think that Sydney Sweeney, this particular human being, should be targeted,” said Sayantani DasGupta, a senior lecturer in narrative medicine at Columbia University who went to TikTok to talk about the ads. “It's not about blaming or pointing fingers. It's about saying, we all live in this society. We all are both creating and perceiving these images, and we're all ultimately going to be impacted by them.”
    


            “She is a massive movie star who is very smart about who she positions herself next to, the business decisions she makes, and also she is not really a public-facing figure in any way. She remains enigmatic in a way that if she was more personally online, if she expressed her feelings more, then I think she could easily get herself into trouble with stuff like this. But she's not,” said Sam Bodrojan, a freelance film critic. “She is able to create conversation around her and create controversy around her, while also fundamentally never being a subject of ire directly. She is a subject of jealousy or envy or a broader symbol of something else — but nobody is ever really asserting that she is a bad person, and if they are, it just makes her more marketable.”
    


            These ads are a throwback to advertising that is proven to work because of reasons we might not like. Much of this type of advertising went out of fashion, but the success of this campaign means we might see more again.
    


            Rachel Rodgers, an associate professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University, did a study on the ads for American Eagle's flagship brand, Aerie, and how those ads impacted body image in 2019. The answer was: It made them feel good about themselves! They liked the “best friend vibe” and seeing women whose diverse bodies looked like their own. Her belief was that the new ads featuring Sweeney would succeed — by making women feel bad and ugly. “We know that typically, idealized and sexualized media images are detrimental to body image and to mood,” she said. “They typically make people feel worse about themselves and are designed to do so, because that's one of the things that drives consumption.”
    


            For the campaign, the brand also made a limited run of jeans for Sweeney for which the proceeds would go to benefit the Crisis Text Line. “The thing that has been lost, for me, is that this whole initiative is to benefit domestic violence and a domestic violence charity,” said Overton. “That is something that has really been lost in the sauce with all of the accolades and criticism. If that was the talent's intention, if that was the brand's intention, they're failing on that.”
    


            No. We are done. May we suggest next learning about the demise of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or the sport of wife-carrying?

NEW YORK, August 2. /TASS/. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has erased the names of US President Donald Trump and a number of other prominent individuals from documents related to the case of financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of sexually abusing minors, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.

According to the news agency, the documents were edited while the FBI was preparing them for potential publication. As Trump and some of the other individuals mentioned in the documents were private individuals when the federal investigation into Epstein began in 2006, it was decided that their names should be concealed. Subsequently, the FBI and the US Department of Justice decided that the release of these papers would not be "appropriate or justified."

The news agency emphasized that being mentioned in the documents cannot be considered evidence of involvement in the financier's criminal activities.

Epstein was arrested by New York state law enforcement agencies on July 6, 2019. Prosecutors said there was evidence that, from 2002 to 2005, he had arranged for dozens of underage girls, the youngest of whom was 14, to visit his Manhattan home. Epstein's circle of friends and acquaintances included many current and former officials from the US and other countries, including former heads of state, prominent businesspeople, and celebrities. Criminal proceedings against the financier were terminated after his suicide in a prison cell on August 10, 2019.

While several African countries saw their planned U.S. tariffs reduced significantly this week, the White House refused to ease its rate for South Africa.Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images

After months of intense effort to negotiate a U.S. trade deal, South Africa has been left out in the cold, facing a renewed 30-per-cent tariff as the Trump administration snubbed its offer of multibillion-dollar concessions.

The tariff, virtually unchanged from a levy that was announced in April and then suspended, is the latest punishing blow against South Africa from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has campaigned relentlessly against the country since the beginning of his second term in office this year.

The tariff was among the highest to be imposed on any U.S. trading partner in the latest round of White House announcements on Thursday night. According to South Africa's central bank, it could trigger the loss of 100,000 jobs, a potentially disastrous setback for an already fragile economy.

For months, Mr. Trump has falsely accused South Africa of seizing farmland and perpetrating a “genocide” against its white minority. Earlier this week, he complained again of “very bad policies” in the country, revealing that he might boycott the November G20 summit in Johannesburg.

While several African countries saw their planned U.S. tariffs reduced significantly in this week's announcement, the White House refused to ease its rate for South Africa, which had been set at 31 per cent in April.

In their talks since then, South Africa has offered billions of dollars in trade concessions. It proposed that its businesses would invest US$3.3-billion in the U.S. mining industry and other sectors, and it offered to import US$12-billion in liquefied natural gas over a 10-year period.

But after submitting the offer, the country failed to obtain even a reply from the Trump administration. It sought an extension of the Aug. 1 deadline, but did not get one.

“We engaged with the U.S. trade representative's office and they're unable to give us a firm indication as to what it is that we need to do now to get to the point of a decision,” Trade and Industry Minister Parks Tau told the national broadcaster SABC on Thursday.

“They suggested that maybe we present a revised offer,” Mr. Tau said.

While still hoping to revive the negotiations before the tariff takes effect on Aug. 7, the South African government is meanwhile scrambling to provide help to its exporters. Key industries such as auto manufacturing and citrus farming are expected to be badly hit.

President Cyril Ramaphosa said he noted the U.S. tariff announcement “with concern.” In a statement on Friday, he pledged to pursue “all diplomatic efforts” to reach a trade deal, while also promising an intensified effort to diversify South Africa's trade markets. China, already the country's biggest trading partner, could be a beneficiary of the strategy.

The 30-per-cent tariff is highly unequal, since the average tariff on U.S. goods entering South Africa is just 7.6 per cent, according to Mr. Ramaphosa.

His trade minister, Mr. Tau, promised an urgent set of aid measures for South African businesses, including an export support desk and possible tax incentives. “This tariff hike poses a direct threat to our export capacity,” he said in a statement.

The Democratic Alliance, the second-biggest party in South Africa's parliament and a member of the country's governing coalition, said the announcement of the 30-per-cent tariff is “a devastating outcome for South Africa.”

The new tariff is just one of the blows that South Africa has suffered at Mr. Trump's hands this year. He has also terminated all U.S. foreign aid to the country and threatened to impose an additional 10-per-cent tariff on South Africa and other members of the BRICS partnership, which was originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa and has since expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. His previously announced 25-per-cent tariff on automobiles has severely damaged South Africa's car exports to the United States.

Elsewhere in Africa, many countries saw a reduction in their U.S. tariffs this week, but others are still left with significant rates. Algeria and Libya were hit with 30-per-cent levies, Tunisia is facing a 25-per-cent rate, and many others were given 15-per-cent tariffs.

Lesotho, the small mountainous kingdom that was inexplicably hit with a 50-per-cent tariff in April, saw its rate reduced to 15-per-cent on Thursday. But it might be too late to undo the damage, since some textile factories there have already laid off thousands of workers. The factories had been beneficiaries of a U.S.-Africa free-trade agreement that now seems dead.

BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) — Federal officials have opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who investigated then-candidate Donald Trump before his reelection to a second term.

The Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, on Saturday confirmed the investigation after reporting by other news organizations. Smith was named special counsel to investigate Trump in by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022. 

Trump and his Republican allies, including Sen. Tom Cotton, have — without offering evidence of wrongdoing— accused Smith of violating the Hatch Act, a federal law that bans certain public officials from engaging in political activity.

Smith prosecuted two federal cases against Republican candidate Trump in the lead-up to the November 2024 presidential election. Smith ultimately dropped the cases — neither one had gone to trial — after Trump was reelected, which would have shielded him from prosecution according to longstanding Justice Department practice. Smith then subsequently resigned as special counsel. 

Cotton, R-Ark., on Wednesday asked the Office of Special Counsel to investigate Smith, alleging that his conduct was designed to help then-President Joe Biden and his vice president, Kamala Harris, both Democrats. Biden had dropped his own bid for reelection following his disastrous performance in a campaign debate against Trump and tapped Harris to succeed him on the ticket. 

Trump won the election. 

The New York Post was first to report on the investigation into Smith.

A generous plane passenger whose departure from South Carolina had been delayed for four hours tried to make the best of a frustrating situation by ordering pizza for everyone on the flight at Charleston International Airport.

America's busiest airports are quietly becoming unexpected food destinations — and smart travelers know just where to grab the best bite before takeoff.

Airport lounges have elevated their food offerings even as they remain pricey and require memberships or a certain credit card or frequent-flier status.

For the average traveler, regular airport restaurants are still costly, partly due to real estate costs and the challenge of getting staff and ingredients through security, Gary Leff, a Texas-based travel industry expert, told Fox News Digital. 

AMERICA'S 15 BEST GAS STATIONS FOR FOOD, ACCORDING TO ONLINE REVIEWS

They operate in tight spaces and are run by a single concession operator, leading to an "incredible sameness," Leff added. 

"It's not simple to run a restaurant inside an airport," noting it can be a "recipe for bad food."

While most airport sandwiches are pre-made and packaged, the Mexican "tortas" at Tortas Frontera by Rick Bayless are made to order. (HMSHost)

There is one exception, he said.

That would be Tortas Frontera, a Mexican restaurant at Chicago O'Hare International Airport in Illinois.

YOUR BEST FOOD AND DRINK CHOICES AT THE AIRPORT, ACCORDING TO DIETITIANS AND NUTRITIONISTS

"I even choose to connect through Chicago rather than another hub sometimes for it," Leff said.

Tortas Frontera by Rick Bayless, the well-known chef, is often named online as a favorite of frequent flyers; one Reddit user raved it offered the "best airport food I've ever had." Other favorites named include O'Hare's Publican Tavern, Wicker Park and Gold Coast Dogs.

And while Leff thinks One Flew South, a southern and sushi fusion restaurant at Georgia's Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), is "overrated," many tout that as their favorite flying pit stop.

"The most outstanding meal I have EVER had in an airport!" one woman wrote in a recent Yelp review.

ATL, which also houses the beloved Chicken and Beer, owned by rapper Ludacris, and the soul food institution Paschal's, won first place in the 2025 Food & Wine Global Tastemakers Awards for U.S. airport dining.

Another southern hub with sought-after food is Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) in Texas.

"Dallas-Fort Worth is a massive airport with numerous dining options," said Melanie Musson, an insurance expert from Montana who frequently travels with her husband and six kids.

"They have several Texas barbecue options, so even when you're just stopping for a layover, you can get a taste of Texas."

Justin Goldsberry, a business owner and seasoned traveler from New Jersey, also said he loves traveling through DFW for its barbecue and seafood.

"Since seafood is my favorite, I'm always on the lookout," Goldsberry said.

"Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen delivers every time."

Musson's other favorite place to stop is Root Down at Denver International Airport (DEN) in Colorado, where she and her family have been going for years.

"But Root Down isn't the only great eating establishment at DEN," Musson said. "It offers a wide array of chain restaurants and several local options."

Reddit users also say they appreciate the variety at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in California.

"SFO is a dream for anyone who loves Asian food," Maricel Gentile, owner of Maricel's Kitchen in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital. 

Gentile frequently travels for culinary events and often gets a bowl of udon or miso soup from Japanese restaurant Wakaba.

"It's simple, warm and soulful, perfect before a long flight," Gentile said.

After SFO and her hometown Newark Liberty International Airport, Gentile said she enjoys eating at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (SEA) in Washington.

SEA is home to Floret, a vegetarian spot that one recent Yelp reviewer said was "hands down … the best/cutest restaurant" she ever visited in an airport, and Beecher's Handmade Cheese, another favorite on the Reddit channels.

Gentile also recommended the fried chicken at The Country Cat at Oregon's Portland International Airport (PDX).

Employees at travel site The Points Guy also recommended PDX as well as Salt Lake City International Airport in Utah, according to its managing editor, Clint Henderson, in part because they're reasonable. Both prohibit restaurants and shops from charging more than they would outside the airport.

Henderson thinks dining at New York's LaGuardia Airport has improved lately.

"LaGuardia's Delta Terminal C is now full of some of my favorite restaurants, including Calista Taverna, Prime, Soleil Brasserie, Chuko Ramen and, of course, Bubby's," he told Fox News Digital.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli forces opened fire near two aid distribution sites run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation as crowds of hungry Palestinians again sought food, killing at least 10 people, witnesses and health workers said Saturday — a day after U.S. officials visited a GHF site and the U.S. ambassador called the troubled system “an incredible feat.”

Nearly a week has passed since Israel, under international pressure amid growing scenes of starving children, announced limited humanitarian pauses and airdrops meant to get more food to Gaza's over 2 million people, who now largely rely on aid after almost 22 months of war.

But the United Nations, partners and Palestinians say far too little aid is still coming in, with months' worth of supplies piled up outside Gaza waiting for Israeli approval. Trucks that enter are mostly stripped of supplies by desperate people and criminal groups before reaching warehouses for distribution.

Experts this week said a “worst-case scenario of famine” was occurring in the besieged enclave. On Saturday, Gaza's health ministry said seven more Palestinians had died of malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours, including a child.

Aid is “far from sufficient,” Germany's government said via spokesman Stefan Kornelius.

Families of the 50 hostages still in Gaza fear they are going hungry too, and blame Hamas, after the militants released images of an emaciated hostage, Evyatar David.

Near the northernmost GHF distribution site near the Netzarim corridor, Yahia Youssef, who had come to seek aid Saturday morning, described a panicked and grimly familiar scene. After helping carry three people wounded by gunshots, he said he saw others on the ground, bleeding.

“It's the same daily episode,” Youssef said. Health workers said at least eight people were killed. Israel's military said it fired warning shots at a gathering approaching its forces.

At least two people were killed in the Shakoush area hundreds of meters (yards) from where the GHF operates another site in the southernmost city of Rafah, witnesses said. Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Younis received two bodies and many injured.

Witness Mohamed Abu Taha said Israeli troops opened fire toward the crowds. He saw three people — two men and a woman — shot as he fled.

Israel's military said it was not aware of any fire by its forces in the area. The GHF said nothing happened near its sites.

GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to prevent deadly crowding. Israel 's military on Friday said it was working to make the routes under its control safer. Israel and GHF have claimed the toll has been exaggerated.

The GHF — backed by millions of dollars in U.S. support — launched in May as Israel sought an alternative to the U.N.-run system, which had safely delivered aid for much of the war but was accused by Israel of allowing Hamas to siphon off supplies. Israel has not offered evidence for that claim and the U.N. has denied it.

From May 27 to July 31, 859 people were killed near GHF sites, according to a United Nations report published Thursday. Hundreds more have been killed along the routes of U.N.-led food convoys. Hamas-led police once guarded those convoys and went after suspected looters, but Israeli fire targeted the officers.

Airdrops by a Jordan-led coalition — Israel, the UAE, Egypt, France, and Germany — are another approach, though experts say the strategy remains deeply inadequate and even dangerous for people on the ground.

“Let's go back to what works & let us do our job,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote Saturday on social media, calling for more and safer truck deliveries.

An Israeli strike hit a group of Palestinians trying to secure aid trucks entering northern Gaza from the Israeli-controlled Zikim crossing, killing at least three people, said Fares Awad, head of the health ministry's ambulance and emergency service.

Nasser Hospital said it received five bodies after two separate strikes on tents sheltering displaced people in Gaza's south.

The health ministry's ambulance and emergency service said an Israeli strike hit a house between the towns of Zawaida and Deir al-Balah, killing two parents and their three children. Another strike hit a tent near a closed prison where the displaced have sheltered in Khan Younis, killing a mother and her daughter.

Israel's top general Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir warned that “combat will continue without rest” if hostages aren't freed.

U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with hostages' families Saturday, a week after quitting ceasefire talks, blaming Hamas's intransigence.

“I didn't hear anything new from him. I heard that there was pressure from the Americans to end this operation, but we didn't hear anything practical,” said Michel Illouz, father of Israeli hostage Guy Illouz, whose body was taken into Gaza.

He said he asked Witkoff to exert pressure and set a time frame but got “no answers.”

Protesters called on Israel's government to make a deal to end the war, imploring them to “stop this nightmare and bring them out of the tunnels”

In part of Gaza City, displaced people who managed to return home found rubble-strewn neighborhoods unrecognizable. Most Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced, often multiple times, and are crowded into ever-shrinking areas considered safe.

“I don't know what to do. Destruction, destruction,” said Mohamed Qeiqa, who stood amid collapsed slabs of concrete and pointed out what had been a five-story building. “Where will people settle?”

The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,400 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians but says women and children make up over half the dead. The ministry operates under the Hamas government. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.

The ministry says 93 children have died from malnutrition-related causes in Gaza since the war began. It said 76 adults have died of malnutrition-related causes since late June, when it started counting adult deaths.

Authorities have launched a manhunt after a shooting at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, left four people dead. Public records show that the suspect lived next door to the bar.

Authorities were scouring a mountainous area of western Montana on Saturday for a military veteran who they say opened fire at a bar, killing four people.

Michael Paul Brown, 45, fled The Owl Bar in the small town of Anaconda in a white pickup truck but ditched it at some point, said Lee Johnson, administrator of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation, which is overseeing the case. He urged residents late Friday to stay at home and on high alert.

“While law enforcement has not received reports of Brown harming any other individuals, he is believed to be armed, and he is extremely dangerous,” Johnson said.

Authorities said they would release the names of the victims once all of their families have been notified. 

“This is a small tight-knit community that has been harmed by the heinous actions of one individual who does not represent what this community or Montanans stand for,” Johnson said.

Anaconda, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Butte, is hemmed in by mountains. The town of about 9,000 people, was founded by copper barons who profited off nearby mines in the late 1800s. A smelter stack that's no longer operational looms over the valley. 




Brown lived next door to The Owl Bar, said owner David Gwerder, who wasn't there during the shooting Friday morning. Gwerder told The Associated Press that the bartender and three patrons were killed and didn't think anyone else was inside. He also said he wasn't aware of any conflicts between Brown and any of the victims.

“He knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,” Gwerder said. “He didn't have any running dispute with any of them. I just think he snapped.”

Brown served in the U.S. Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, said Lt. Col. Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson. Brown was in the Montana National Guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said. He left military service in the rank of sergeant.

Brown's niece, Clare Boyle, told the AP on Friday that her uncle has struggled with mental illness for years and that she and her other family members repeatedly sought help.

“This isn't just a drunk/high man going wild,” she wrote in a Facebook message. “It's a sick man who doesn't know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn't know where or when he is either.” 

With no sign of Brown in the white pickup or his home, authorities converged on the Stumptown Road area west of Anaconda by ground and air Friday, locking it down so no one was allowed in or out. A helicopter hovered over a nearby mountainside as officers moved among the trees, said Randy Clark, a retired police officer who lives there.

The search continued Saturday morning, according to Chase Scheuer, a spokesman for Montana's DCI.

As reports of the shooting spread through town earlier Friday, business owners locked their doors and sheltered inside with customers. 

The owner of the Firefly Café in Anaconda said she locked up her business after a friend alerted her to the shooting. 

“We are Montana, so guns are not new to us,” Barbie Nelson said. “For our town to be locked down, everybody's pretty rattled.”

Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins has updates on the investigation into the September assassination attempt on then-candidate Donald Trump on 'Special Report.'

The man accused of trying to assassinate President Donald Trump in Florida last year was barred by a federal judge from seeing classified material related to the case. 

Judge Aileen Cannon wrote in a ruling Friday that "the United States has made a sufficient showing that the information at issue was classified" and that its disclosure "could cause serious damage or exceptionally grave damages to the national security of the United States."

"The Court finds that the United States properly invoked the provisions of [the] Classified Information Procedures Act and its classified information privilege as to the information referenced in the classified order," she added in granting a motion filed by federal prosecutors. 

Routh, 59, was recently granted approval to represent himself in his upcoming trial. He was charged with attempting to assassinate Trump, assaulting a federal officer and multiple firearms violations stemming from the Sept. 15, 2024 incident in Florida, the second attempted assassination plot against Trump in a matter of months. Routh has pleaded not guilty. 

TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT RYAN ROUTH CAN REPRESENT HIMSELF AT TRIAL, FEDERAL JUDGE RULES 

On Sept. 15, 2024, Ryan Routh allegedly hid in the bushes outside Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach with a rifle as Trump was playing. His son, Oran Routh, has pleaded guilty to a child porn charge.  

Prior to allowing Routh to represent himself, Cannon told him in late July that his court-appointed attorneys "will defend you far better than you can defend yourself" and "I strongly urge you not to make this decision." 

Fox News Digital also reported in July that Routh wrote an unusual letter to the judge asking why the death penalty isn't on the table—and proposing that he be included in a prisoner swap with U.S. adversaries, even suggesting he be sent to freeze in Siberia in exchange for a Ukrainian soldier. 

"Why is the death penalty not allowed? At nearly 60, a life of nothingness without love—what is the point? Why is it not all or nothing?" Routh wrote in the letter filed on the case docket.  

TRUMP ASSASSINATION SUSPECT FLOATS BIZARRE PRISONER SWAP IN LETTER TO JUDGE, ASKS WHY HE CAN'T BE EXECUTED

"I had wished for a prisoner swap with Hamas, Iran... or China for Jimmy Lai or one of the 40 others, or to freeze to death in Siberia in exchange for a Ukrainian soldier... so I could die being of some use and save all this court mess." 

He then sarcastically added that the judge could send him away, which would give Trump a symbolic win.  

"Perhaps you [Judge Cannon] have the power to trade me away... An easy diplomatic victory for Trump to give an American he hates to China, Iran, or North Korea... everyone wins."

Cannon is the same judge that was presiding over Trump's classified documents case, which she dismissed in July 2024. That case dealt with the FBI's investigation into Trump and its raid on his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022.

Former NYPD Lt. Darrin Porcher and Fox News' Chanley Painter join ‘Fox News @ Night' to discuss the tragic murder of two parents in Arkansas, who were killed while trying to protect their children during a violent attack.

Arkansas authorities say a peaceful family hike turned into a deadly ambush, when a 28-year-old schoolteacher allegedly stabbed a married couple to death in front of their children at Devil's Den State Park.

Arkansas State Police (ASP) arrested Andrew James McGann at a barbershop in Springdale at 4:57 p.m. Wednesday. Officials said that McGann was in the midst of a haircut when ASP officers tracked down the fugitive following the lethal attack on Saturday.

McGann was charged with two counts of capital murder in connection to the killings of Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, who were found dead on a walking trail. Their daughters, who are 7 and 9, were not hurt and are being cared for by family members, authorities said.

Here is a timeline of what we know so far about the suspect and the killings:

2:30 p.m. CDT — A 911 call was placed from Devil's Den State Park reporting an assault on a hiking trail. EMS and ASP respond.

Shortly after — Search crews found Clinton and Cristen Brink dead from apparent stab wounds. Their daughters are found nearby, safe but traumatized.

Evening — ASP confirmed that a double homicide occurred at the state park and issued a manhunt alert for an unidentified male suspect. 

"Let there be no mistake – we do not tolerate violent crime in Arkansas. If you target innocent people, law enforcement will hunt you down and bring you to justice," Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.

ASP released a sketch and description of the suspect, described as a white male in his late 20s wearing rolled-up long sleeves, gloves, and carrying a black backpack.

"Investigators are asking those who visited the park on Saturday to check cellphone photos and videos or GoPro footage for images of the suspect. They are also asking residents of the area surrounding the park to notify ASP if they have access to security and game camera footage," ASP said in a release on Monday.

"I want to thank the public and our media partners for their support as we pursue the man responsible for this heinous crime," ASP Col. Mike Hagar said. "We are using all available resources to apprehend this suspect and bring him to justice."

WATCH MCGANN'S ARREST:

2:30 p.m. CDT — Authorities arrested McGann at a barbershop in Springdale. Authorities said they received "over 500" tips and surveillance video leading to his capture.

Police recovered evidence from McGann's car and home linking him to the scene.

Approximately 7 p.m. CDT – McGann was booked into the Washington County Detention Center in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He was being held without bond.

McGann was a teacher in a small Oklahoma school district until May and then resigned to take a job in another state, according to a statement from Sand Springs Public Schools to Fox News Digital. They said that McGann had passed all background checks.

"The safety of our students and staff is our highest priority," said Lissa Chidester, director of communications. "While SSPS has not yet been contacted by authorities regarding this matter, the district has and will always comply with requests from law enforcement in any investigation. Our hearts are with the family and loved ones who have suffered this tragic loss."

McGann had not yet started his new job in Arkansas at Springdale Public Schools, Jared Cleveland, the district superintendent, confirmed to Fox News. Cleveland said that McGann "has not at any time" been in contact with students or their families. He declined to provide more information, citing the investigation.

"Our entire team extends our deepest condolences to the Brink family," he said. "Their children are especially in our thoughts and prayers."

The mother of a former student provided an email from the teacher's previous school district to Fox News. She said that in 2023, she filed a complaint with the superintendent after her son witnessed McGann behaving inappropriately toward younger females.

In response, parents received a letter from the district stating that McGann had been placed on administrative leave while officials investigated complaints of poor classroom management and professional judgment. 

While the investigation did not find evidence of inappropriate behavior toward a student, it concluded that McGann's classroom management and judgment fell below district expectations. Shortly afterward, McGann resigned.

"Mr. McGann, on Wednesday afternoon, notified our Human Resources Department of his decision to resign his position, effective immediately," the email said, in part. "We will have a substitute teacher in his class for the rest of the school year."

MANHUNT INTENSIFIES FOR ARKANSAS SUSPECT LIKELY INJURED IN FATAL ATTACK OF COUPLE

McGann was charged with two counts of capital murder. Police said he confessed during questioning. 

"Although everyone is innocent until proven guilty, we did confirm this morning that the suspect's DNA is a positive match to the DNA recovered at the crime scene," Hagar said. "During an interview with investigators, the suspect admitted to committing the murders. We also executed a search warrant at his residence and recovered items consistent with the crime."

WATCH THE NEWS CONFERENCE:

Authorities confirmed that the suspect has no known adult criminal history. Investigators have not uncovered any prior charges or convictions. Investigators believe the attack was random and have not identified a motive.

"It appears to be a completely random event," Hagar said. "We have no reason to believe there was any known association between our suspect and our victims."

Hagar revealed that McGann sustained "injuries" during the attack. The blood found at the scene helped authorities find the suspect, they said.

Police said that Clinton Brink was attacked first, and that Cristen ran the couple's two young children back to their vehicle and then returned to help her husband, where she was also fatally attacked.

"We believe that the mother took them to safety and then returned to help her husband," Major Stacey Rhodes said.

Natural disasters may cost more money, but they claim far fewer lives than in decades past.

From the wildfires that torched Los Angeles in January to the record-setting heat waves that cooked much of Europe in June, the first half of 2025 has been marked by what now seems like a new normal of ever more frequent extreme weather. It's easy to feel that we live in a constant stream of weather disasters, with one ending only so another can begin, thanks largely to the amplifying effects of climate change.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Yet behind the catastrophic headlines is a much more positive story. For all of the floods and the fires and the storms and the cyclones, it turns out that globally, fewer people died from the direct effects of extreme weather globally through the first half of 2025 than any six-month period since reliable records began being kept decades ago.

About 2,200 people worldwide died in storms, floods, heat waves and other “weather‐climate” disasters in the first six months of the year, according to the risk consultancy company Aon's midyear catastrophe report. They tallied 7,700 natural-hazard deaths overall, but if you take out the roughly 5,500 people who died in a single non-weather geological event — a major earthquake in Myanmar in March — you're left with the smallest January-to-June weather death toll since we began keeping records. (Hat tip to Roger Pielke Jr., whose Substack post was where I first saw these figures.)

More than 2,000 deaths is still too many, and it doesn't count more recent deadly disasters, like the terrible July floods in Texas's Hill Country that killed at least 135 people. But it's still remarkably low: The world has averaged 37,250 deaths in the first half of the year so far in the 21st century, and in previous centuries, far larger numbers of people often died because of extreme weather. Somehow, even as climate change has intensified many natural disasters and more people are living in harm's way, the actual human toll from these catastrophes has been falling.

All of which raises two questions: How have we managed this? And will this trend continue even in an ever-warmer world?

I've been writing this newsletter for a few months now, and if I were to boil down its message into one phrase, it'd be this: Wow, the past was much worse than you think.

That's certainly the case for deadly natural disasters and extreme weather. As you can see from the chart above, the first half of the 20th century regularly had years when the death rate from natural disasters was as high as 50 deaths per 100,000 people, and sometimes far higher. (In 2024, it was just 0.2 deaths per 100,000 people.) But annualized death rates hide just how bloody some of these events were.

In 1931, massive flooding in China's Yangtze and Yellow River killed perhaps 4 million people due to drowning, disease, and starvation. In 1970, a huge cyclone in Bangladesh killed 500,000 people, and perhaps far more. An earthquake that hit Tokyo in 1923 killed at least 143,000 people. Here in the US, a hurricane that hit Galveston, Texas, in 1900 killed as many as 12,000 people, making it the deadliest natural disaster in US history.

Until fairly recently, the Earth was a merciless killer. The 21st century has still been marked by the occasional mega-death toll disaster — though most of them have been earthquake related rather than weather-driven — but they've become far rarer. The frequency of storms and floods hasn't abated. The difference is our ability to protect ourselves.

There's a paradox in our improving response to natural disasters: Even as the deaths from extreme weather and other catastrophes have been falling, the cost of those events has been rising. The same Aon report that contained the good news about falling deaths also tallied up an estimated $162 billion in economic losses from global natural disasters — some $20 billion above the 21st century average.

These two trends are deeply connected. The single biggest factor behind the sharp increase in the economic costs of extreme weather is the simple fact that the world keeps getting richer and richer. That means more and more expensive property is at risk every time a hurricane spins up in the Atlantic or a flash flood swamps a major city. Yet at the same time, a richer society is one that can invest in warning systems and infrastructure adaptations that can and do vastly reduce the death toll from a disaster. Property in the path of a storm can't move — but people, if they're warned in time, can.

Take the terrible Los Angeles wildfires. The total economic impact from the fires may be as high as $131 billion, which would make it one of the costliest disasters in US history. That shouldn't be surprising: The fires ripped through some of the most valuable real estate in the country. The death toll, by contrast, was 30 people. That makes it the second-deadliest wildfire in California history, but it still had a far lower human toll than wildfires from a hundred years ago or more, which killed hundreds and even thousands of people.

It's a basic rule of disasters: A richer society has more to lose in property, but it also has the wealth to protect its people. And property, unlike people, can be restored.

From early warning text chains in Mozambique to cyclone shelters in Bangladesh to heat action plans in India, even some of the poorest countries in the world have built warning and response systems that can blunt the death toll of the worst extreme weather. The question for the rest of the decade is whether we can protect livelihoods as well as lives.

A new UN report estimates that when the full effects are counted, disasters cost the world over $2.3 trillion every year. We are getting brilliantly good at saving people; we have not yet figured out how to save their homes, crops and jobs. That will require the hard, unglamorous work of preparing for disasters before they happen. It's an investment that should pay off — that same UN report calculates that every dollar spent on risk reduction leads to at least four dollars in avoided losses.

Extreme weather and natural disasters have always been with us and always will be, and climate change will mostly make them worse. But we shouldn't lose sight of one of humanity's greatest triumphs: We are learning, year by year, how not to die when the planet turns against us. The arc of human ingenuity still bends toward safety.

            US President Donald Trump said Friday he was ordering two US Navy nuclear submarines to “appropriate regions,” in response to remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council.
    


            In what he called an effort to be “prepared,” Trump said in a Truth Social post that he had “ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that.”
    


            The president did not specify what type of submarines were being moved or where to, and the Pentagon usually reveals little about any of its subs' movements.
    


            The US Navy has three types of submarines, all of which are nuclear-powered, but only one of which carries nuclear weapons. Here's a look at the US submarine fleet:
    


            The US Navy has 14 Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarines (SSBNs), often referred to as “boomers.”
    


            SSBNs “are designed specifically for stealth and the precise delivery of nuclear warheads,” a Navy fact sheet on them says.
    


            Each can carry 20 Trident ballistic missiles with multiple nuclear warheads. Tridents have a range of up to 4,600 miles (7,400 kilometers), meaning they wouldn't need to move closer to Russia to hit it – in fact, they could do so from the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian or Arctic oceans.
    


‘Very risky business': John Bolton reacts to Trump's nuclear subs order



            SSBNs are strong nuclear deterrents as they are expected to survive an adversary's first strike. Their movements are among the Navy's most closely guarded secrets.
    


            At 560 feet (170 meters) long, the Ohio-class subs displace almost 19,000 tons submerged and have a crew of 159. They can reach a speed of 23 miles per hour.
    


            In the 1990s, the Pentagon determined the Navy didn't need as many Ohio-class SSBNs in the nuclear deterrent role, converting four of them into guided-missile submarines (SSGNs).
    


            Retaining the same overall specs as the boomers, the SSGNs carry Tomahawk cruise missiles instead of the Trident ballistic missiles.
    


            Each can carry 154 Tomahawks with a high-explosive warhead of up to 1,000 pounds, and a range of about 1,000 miles.
    


            They can also transport troops, who can be clandestinely deployed from lockout chambers in former ballistic-missile tubes, according to the Navy.
    


            Movements of the SSGNs are also highly classified, but in recent years the Navy made occasional note of their presence near military hotspots, to send a message of deterrence.
    


            These form the bulk of the US Navy's submarine fleet and are designed to hunt and destroy enemy subs and surface ships with torpedoes. They can also strike land-based targets with Tomahawk missiles, though they carry the Tomahawks in much smaller numbers than the SSGNs.
    


            Fast-attack subs come in three forms: the Virginia, Los Angeles and Seawolf classes.
    


            The Virginia class is the newest, with 23 commissioned as of July 1, according to a Navy fact sheet. They are 377 to 461 feet long, depending on their configuration, displace up to 10,200 tons, and have a crew of 145.
    


            The Los Angeles class is the oldest of the Navy's fast-attack subs, with 23 still in service. They are 360 feet long, displace 6,900 tons and carry a crew of 143.
    


            Finally, the Seawolf class is the smallest in the US fleet.
    


How did a $3 billion US Navy submarine hit an undersea mountain?



            Two of the subs, USS Seawolf and USS Connecticut – measuring 353 feet and displacing 9,100 tons – are more in line with standard attack boats, carrying torpedoes and cruise missiles.
    


            The third in the Seawolf class, the USS Jimmy Carter, is one of the most specialized craft in the Navy, with a hull extended 100 feet longer than the other two subs.
    


            “This hull section provides for additional payloads to accommodate advanced technology used to carry out classified research and development and for enhanced warfighting capabilities,” the Navy says.

House lawmakers have requested billions of dollars for special community funding projects, or earmarks, whose approval hinges on Congress's ability to pass all 12 appropriations bills by the end of September.

So far, the House has passed two appropriations bills: Military Construction/Veterans Affairs and Defense. The chamber has had difficulty passing all 12 bills in fiscal years past, so it is likely that, with lawmakers on August recess, Republican leadership will need to do a short-term spending deal ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline.

House lawmakers requested $23,394,859,447 in earmarks. Of that total, Republicans requested the most, just over $14 billion, while Democrats requested just over $9.3 billion. Earmarks make up just 0.5% of the overall House topline, per the Appropriations Committee.

The top five Republicans who requested the earmarks worth the most were Reps. John Rutherford (R-FL), Brian Mast (R-FL), Randy Weber (R-TX), Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA), and Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN).

The top five Democrats who requested the most costly earmarks were Reps. Chris Deluzio (D-PA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Melanie Stansbury (D-NM), Ed Case (D-HI), and Eric Sorensen (D-IL).

Each House member can request up to 15 projects, but not all are accepted. However, the inclusion of earmarks in the bills does not guarantee that money is on its way to their districts. The appropriations bill must pass the House and Senate and head to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature.

HOUSE EARMARKS ARE BACK — HERE'S WHAT MEMBERS REQUESTED FOR FISCAL 2026

Rutherford, 72, has been a member of Congress since 2017. He sits on the Appropriations and Ethics committees and is part of the Main Street Caucus. 

He requested the most earmarks of any Republican, totaling $795,942,500. His 15 requested projects fall under the Commerce, Justice, and Science, Interior and Environment, Transportation and Housing, Energy and Water, and Military Construction/Veterans Affairs bills. 

Among the projects is a $262 million request for a Multi-Aircraft Paint & Strip Facility Planning and Design in Jacksonville, Florida. A $374.6 million request is intended for an F-35 Aircraft Engine Repair Facility, and $45 million is requested for a Child Development Center Planning and Design, both in Jacksonville.

“The purpose of Community Project Funding (CPFs) is to give members of Congress, not Washington bureaucrats, the power to decide how a small percentage of discretionary funding is spent,” Rutherford said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “That means spending federal dollars on projects that local constituencies actually need and want.” 

Rutherford said he aims for funding that “helps protect our coastal communities and military installations, and enhances our transportation systems.” 

“I am proud to have requested, on behalf of my constituents, the funding that our district needs,” the Florida Republican added. “Anyone interested in learning more about the CPFs requested can find them all posted on my website.”

Mast is chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. He has been a member of Congress since 2017. 

The Florida congressman requested 15 projects, totaling $777,982,480. The earmarks are in the Commerce, Justice, and Science, Interior and Environment, Transportation and Housing, and Energy and Water bills.

The largest requested earmark is $725 million for the Everglades Restoration Plan. Of that $725 million, $446 million came at Trump's request in his fiscal 2026 budget recommendation. It was the largest presidential recommendation for Everglades restoration and the largest amount the Appropriations Committee has given to this project.

“Since coming to office, congressman Mast has always fought to protect Florida's waterways, which are vital to the economy and quality of life on the Treasure Coast, and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration is central to that fight,” Kate Constantini, Mast's spokeswoman, told the Washington Examiner.

Weber has served as Texas's 14th District representative since 2013. He sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. He is a member of the Republican Study Committee.

He requested $409,752,622 in earmarks for 15 projects. Of that roughly $410 million, $200 million is intended for the Sabine-Neches Waterway Channel Improvement Project for the U.S> Army Corps of Engineers. 

The congressman's website for earmarks states the project would deepen the waterway from an authorized depth of 40 feet to 48 feet. The waterway is also the United States's leading energy and military exporter and No. 1 LNG (liquefied natural gas) exporter. 

“Southeast Texas is a critical part of this nation's backbone, sitting right on the Gulf with key waterways and ports that keep America moving,” Weber said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “I'm proud to fight every day to secure Community Project Funding that supports projects advancing the President's priorities—projects that create good jobs, boost our economy, and protect our communities. My commitment is clear: I'll keep standing strong for Southeast Texas and the hardworking families who call this place home.”

Reschenthaler is the chief majority deputy whip and is in his fourth term as a House member. He sits on the Appropriations Committee. 

His earmark requests total $356,630,355 for 15 projects. His largest earmark request totals $257 million for the Upper Ohio Navigation Project, Montgomery Lock for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The funds would be used to physically complete the work, with the congressman noting that it is a valuable use of taxpayer dollars as it will “recapitalize a structurally deficient lock on the Ohio River in southwestern Pennsylvania.”

Other projects include $300,000 for the Somerset County Food Access Project to provide additional food supplies, walk-in cooler panels, box packaging for delivery and pick-up needs, and a refrigerated box truck to address food insecurity in southwest Pennsylvania. 

Roughly $643,354 will go toward upgrading technology for Westmoreland County law enforcement officials, and $3 million will go to Indiana University of Pennsylvania's College of Medicine for facility infrastructure, equipment, and other expenses for a School of Osteopathic Medicine to increase healthcare access in rural areas.

The Washington Examiner reached out to Reschenthaler for comment.

Fleischmann has represented Tennessee's 3rd District since 2011. He sits on the Appropriations and Science and Technology committees. 

He requested a total of $267,687,628 in earmarks for 15 projects. The largest one totals $213 million for the Chickamauga Lock Replacement Project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is a similar waterway project to those above, whose construction has been ongoing since 2004, per the congressman's letter to Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK). 

Fleischmann said in the letter that this project will increase job flow from Chattanooga to East Tennessee and make it easier for commercial and recreational vessels to pass through the dam. 

The Washington Examiner reached out to Fleischmann for comment.

Deluzio has represented Pennsylvania's 17th District since 2023. He sits on the Armed Services and Transportation committees. He is a member of the Progressive Caucus.

He requested the largest sum of earmarks for Democrats, totaling $278,069,682 for 15 projects. 

Of that sum, $275 million is intended to modernize the Montgomery Lock and Dam sites in Upper Ohio, Allegheny, and Beaver counties. Deluzio noted in his letter to Cole that the three lock and dam sites underwent significant rehabilitation in the 1980s, and modernizing the facilities would allow for larger and more efficient vessels to move through the river. 

Design of the locks and a significant portion of the construction were funded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law at a cost of over $857 million. But, due to “unanticipated cost escalation” from inflation and market conditions, additional funding is required. The congressman stated upgrading the three sites would bolster an area that supports over 180,000 jobs and brings in $4.8 billion in state and local tax revenue.

Other requested projects include $125,000 for a police patrol boat for the Allegheny Valley Regional Police Department, just over $500,000 for upgrades to the Ross Township Police Department's body-worn camera and fleet video equipment, and $1.5 million for an “all-inclusive playground” in Pittsburgh. The playground is intended to be an outdoor physical and social recreational space for all persons, regardless of limitations.

The Washington Examiner reached out to Deluzio for comment.

Lofgren is serving her 15th term in Congress, having been a member of the House since 1994. She is the ranking member of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and a member of the Judiciary Committee.

She requested $256,773,000 in earmarks for 15 projects. One project, totaling $226 million, would construct a levee at the Pajaro River in Watsonville, California, to prevent floods. 

“I am proud to have asked for enough funding to protect the proud, but poor, community of Pajaro from devastating floods,” Lofgren said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “I certainly know what my Central Coast constituents need more than the Trump administration does. I am disappointed that my request to provide life-saving funding has not yet been honored.” 

Stansbury is a House Democrat representing New Mexico's 1st District since 2021. She sits on the Natural Resources and the Oversight committees. She is a member of the Progressive Caucus.

She requested $140 million for 15 projects. Of that total, $20 million is for a wastewater treatment plant and $8 million is for the construction of a behavioral health center, both in the town of Bemalillo. Another $8 million is going to an acute care hospital in Valencia County.

The Washington Examiner reached out to Stansbury for comment.

Case has served as the representative for both of Hawaii's congressional districts, representing the 2nd District from 2002 to 2007. He left Congress to practice law and serve as a senior vice president to one of the state's oldest hotel companies. He then returned to Congress in 2019 as the representative of the 1st District and sits on the Appropriations Committee.

He requested $123,380,400 for 15 projects. Of that total, $90 million is intended for a water treatment facility for the Navy Department at the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Oahu. The Red Hill Water Treatment Facility would remove potential contaminants after approximately 14,00 gallons of water and fuel entered Pearl Harbor's drinking water system in 2021.

The incident displaced over 3,500 military families and sickened many residents. The military has stopped drawing drinking water from the shaft, despite the shaft supplying 15-20% of the drinking water for the base, per the congressman's website.

The Washington Examiner reached out to Case for comment.

Sorensen is an Illinois House Democrat representing the state's 17th District since 2023. He sits on the Agriculture and Armed Services committees.

The congressman's 15 requested projects total $111,042,218. The largest project is funding a Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program for the Army Corps of Engineers in Rock Island, Illinois. The program, totalling $73 million, would improve navigation and restore the ecosystem along the Upper Mississippi River. 

The Washington Examiner reached out to Sorensen for comment.

A philosopher on humanity's need for a new story — and a new way to defy where we're headed.

Humans are the dominant species on a dying planet, and we're still clinging to the idea that we can think our way out, invent our way out, maybe even upload our way out.

But what if the solution isn't more mastery or more control? What if the only way to survive is to become something else entirely?

Mark C. Taylor is a philosopher, a cultural critic, and the author of After the Human. It's a sweeping, sometimes dizzying book, one that moves from Hegel to quantum physics to the ethics of soil and fungi. It's packed with hand-drawn diagrams and photos of dirt and discussions of philosophy and the history of technology and day-to-day dilemmas like having too many books for your shelves.

I invited Taylor onto The Gray Area to talk about how all this coalesces into a uniquely ambitious attempt to explain what it is to be human, and why we need a new story, a new self, and, really, a whole new way of thinking and being in the world. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

At the very beginning of this book, you write, “How would your understanding of the meaning of your life change if you knew that next Friday at precisely 12 o'clock midnight, the human race would become extinct?” Why do you want us thinking about total extinction next Friday?

Because I think it's a realistic possibility. The real urgency of this book comes out of my concern about climate change, because there's absolutely no doubt that we are facing catastrophic effects in the very near future, and there's a complete blindness or unwillingness to confront the actuality of that problem and to address what needs to be done to dodge it if we can.

But it's not just that. It's also the intersection of new technologies and the ways those new technologies have transformed the social, economic, and political systems. And they're all interrelated. The problem isn't just that people are not connecting the dots; people do not know the dots that need to be connected.

What do you think it means to be “human”?

Part of what distinguishes the human is that we can ask the question of what it means to be human. That's a level of self-consciousness and self-reflectivity that is important and in some ways distinctive of the human.

And you think the problem is that we've come to think of human consciousness as something special, almost separate from nature?

Correct. The philosophical foundation to the Anthropocene [the era in which humans have been the dominant influence on the planet] begins with modern philosophy, which begins with Descartes: “I think, therefore I am.”

And what Descartes does is to identify being a human with thinking, and [identifying] everything else as a machine, including the human body. From that point on, there's always this effort to distinguish the human from the non-human. Descartes' identification of the human in terms of cognition becomes the heart of anthropocentrism [the idea that humans are at the center of things], and anthropocentrism is the basis of this Anthropocene.

How does that lead us to this situation where we are exploiting nature and wrecking our environment?

We view the individual as what is most concrete and most real, and we see groups as formed of individuals. That's wrong because there is no such thing as an isolated individual. Every individual is what it is by virtue of its interrelationship to other individuals and entities.

Why is the illusion that we are disconnected and separate so powerful? 

If you come back to the climate, we're parasites on the earth. It's a parasite-host relationship, and we are in the process of destroying the host upon which we depend. You cut down all the trees in order to serve the economy and we die. It's that simple. So in that sense, the interrelationship is confirmed. When the current politicians pull out of all climate accords, reinforce fossil fuel, they're destroying the planet without which we can't live.

So if that's the problem, what is the answer? What kind of vision of the self do we actually need, and what are the ideas that are going to get us there?

I think ideas will help us get out of it. Ideas matter. Another way to think about what Descartes does is that he takes mind out of nature, makes everything but the human mind a machine. So part of what you have to do is put mind back into nature.

And to do that, you need an expanded notion of mind and of consciousness. You have to rethink what we mean by knowledge, what we mean by cognition, what we mean by intelligence and the like.

Part of what I've tried to do is try to understand quantum mechanics in terms of relationality and information processing. There's a very important theoretical physicist, Carlo Rovelli, who understands through this notion of relationality or relativity. Then you begin to see the way in which everything is interconnected. And [when] you look at the biological level, [you see that] biological systems are information processing systems.

I have diabetes, and that's one of the ways in which I began to understand this. When you understand how autoimmune disease works, you see that it's a coding problem and a misreading problem.

One way to understand the mess we're in now is as autoimmune disease, because what autoimmunity involves is the body turning on the body or the body politic turning on itself and destroying itself in certain ways, because it misreads itself. And you can trace this notion of information processing all the way through the physical, biological, the ecological, and try to understand ecological systems as information processing systems. And then extend that all the way up eventually into plant and animal cognition and finally, technology and artificial intelligence.

What does it actually mean to think of the mind as something that extends beyond the individual human? 

I use the images of webs or networks. Think of yourself as a node within an ever-expanding and changing network. That is: things are events, everything's a process, everything's in motion. And what I am constantly becoming is a function not only of what I have been and what I anticipate, but of my relationships to others at this particular moment and ultimately the whole entire web. Everything is co-dependent and co-emergent. Everything is interconnected.

And you also need an expanded notion of the mind to understand that there are alternative intelligences. For example, there's some really interesting scientific work being done on plant communication. I mean, Richard Powers's Overstory is an example of that. And there has to be some kind of a recognition of this vital interrelationality or 99.9 percent of the species go extinct. We can go extinct as well.

For me, the relationship between thought and action isn't always so neat, right? It is easy to say that we live in this world of interdependence and co-dependence. But then I'll get up and I'll have my coffee and then I moonwalk into a world, into a culture, almost every part of which is designed to reinforce the illusion that I am an ego, that I am separated. 

And so, you can read the books, you can recite the ideas, you can even believe them. But what does it really take to move from theory to practice, or from belief to behavior?

I want to say two things. One is that thinking is a form of action in certain ways. But your point is well taken. And I guess one of the ideas I wish I could get more people to understand is positive feedback.

Positive feedback isn't getting good reviews on your book, your podcasts, or your classes. Positive feedback is related to these complex systems where change accelerates. There's a pile of sand, add grain after grain — you know there's going to be an avalanche, but you don't know when it's going to occur. That's the bind we're in now, not just with respect to climate, but with respect to these systems that work the same way. Financial bubbles and climate change work the same way.

So my problem is, how do you convey the urgency of the situation without making the situation hopeless? How do you use these ideas then to enact the kinds of changes that need to be made? But until you understand the nature of the problem, you don't see the urgency with it all.

I'm trying to imagine myself on the other side as an audience member listening and wondering, Okay, now what? What do you want me to do? 

The most political, if you will, form of action that I took based on these ideas was that I started a company with a big New York investment banker by the name of Herbert Allen in 1998 called Global Education Network. I started webcasting my classes in 1996 when nobody was doing it. In 1992, I taught a course using teleconferencing with Helsinki. And at that time, I thought that the world would be a better place if everybody could sit down around the table and talk about Hegel or Nietzsche.

We tried, and the man I did this with, he put $27 million into that effort, and we failed. I had a vision, and it was all based upon this idea of networks, to make education more widely available through these technologies. Now, what I didn't understand, and I don't think many of us did, was that these technologies that connect also separate. But there was an example of trying to put the ideas into action in a way that would bring us together in certain ways.

Do you worry that AI might change our understanding of humanity in even worse ways? That we will just gradually come to think of ourselves more and more as machine-like?

Yeah. I mean, look, this man, Herbert Allen, that I mentioned. Not many people have heard about him, but he is my neighbor here in Williamstown. He has a conference in Sun Valley that brings together the people running the world — technology, media, entertainment, sports — for five days. And we were there before [Jeff] Bezos was Bezos and all of that. [Bill] Gates, Warren Buffett — these are really smart guys, but they have a very narrow vision of the world.

Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and these people, they have a vision. And I think that what they understand is that whoever controls AI runs the world. What is happening now is creating a condition of algorithmic authoritarianism. We are being programmed.

You mentioned Thiel. Thiel was just on Ross Douthat's New York Times podcast. There was one point at which Ross just asked him straight up, “Do you think the human race should continue?” And he treats it like a gotcha question. He pauses for a while before he can muster an answer to what should be the mother of all “yes or no” questions.

But there is this kind of techno-salvation, techno-utopianism, anti-humanism. You talk about this a lot in the book, this idea that we're going to build these tools and we're going to upload our minds and we're going to escape all the problems that come with being mortal meatbags on this planet. Does that just feel like an old story in a new disguise to you?

It is. It's what I call techno-gnosticism, right? Andreessen is a really important player in this. There's an absolute view of the future that these guys have. And Andreessen has a book; the first line of the book is something like “all serious philosophies are a meditation on death.” For these guys — and again, they are guys — death is an engineering problem. They really believe in anti-aging stuff and they do believe that the human life cycle can be expanded considerably if not infinitely.

If you go back to the early years of Christianity, gnosticism was one of its greatest competitors. The word gnosis means knowledge. And gnosticism was a dualistic understanding of being — that the world was completely evil, and the whole point was to get out of this world, and the body was divided between mind and soul. Get the mind out of the water. There were concentric spheres and each sphere had a password, had gnosis, took a certain kind of code to get you out of it, and you gradually became more and more detached from the world.

That's what this Mars exploration is about. Gnosis is the code that is going to get us to Mars to populate the universe, because what's going to happen? They're convinced this world's going to go to hell.

I mean, it's a complete eschatology. Religion is most interesting where it's least obvious. As you said, it's an old story in a new version. There's this escapism, which is a nihilism. The real is always elsewhere. There's a profound nihilism. The last words of After the Human are amor mundi: love of world. I don't believe there's an afterlife. I always tell my students, I do believe in ghosts; Hegel and Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are my ghosts. That's the way we live on, in the lives of others.

If individualism is an illusion, and we are part of this web of life, does death mean something different than what we normally think it means? It's the end of a certain kind of subjectivity, but is it more transformation than the end? 

Just as I was beginning to write the section on consciousness or plant and animal consciousness, my younger brother fell into a coma for three weeks and died. And here I am trying to figure out mind-body problems, consciousness problems. And the first time I entered that hospital room was when he was in this comatose state, and this is the night before I taught my last class in 50 years. He was hooked up to more machines than you can imagine. And I mean, you see the fragility of life. With my brother, you adjust the dial to fix one thing and another thing gets out of whack. [The] first time I walked into that room, he is in his comatose state and his heartbeat increases. What is life? How do you define death? Where is that line? The more interconnected we are, the more fragile everything becomes.

My training is in religion. I've written many, many books on theology. I'm always hesitant to invoke the notion of God. But that doesn't have to be some kind of mushy stuff. It's all these complexly interrelated particles and bits. We are events.

To bring us back to that thought experiment about imagining the end next week: Do you think we have created a form of life in which it's just too easy to not think about death and therefore too easy to take life for granted?

That's fair. I always say I died without dying. I had a biopsy for cancer and went into septic shock. I've been there. And the strange thing for me was that, it was a strange and liberating experience. Sometimes the only way to hold on is to let go. And how does one let go? Learning to let go is one of the hardest lessons of life. But when you're able to do it, life comes back to you differently.

Kierkegaard talks about two moments of infinite resignation: the withdrawal, and then the movement, what he calls faith, which is living in the world as a gift. We're not given tomorrow. We're not given this afternoon. You may die this afternoon, as might I.

I taught a class at noon, and I taught [Jacques] Derrida's Gift of Death, which he wrote at my urging. And at 7 o'clock that night, I was near dead. That's how fast it happens and how fragile it is. If you could convey the sense of the fragility and the beauty of this world, what more do you want? What more do you want?

It's a bit of a ridiculous question, but are you hopeful that we can course-correct?

I have to be. I've been jotting down aphorisms, I'm up to about 500. And one of them that I like the best is, “Hope is an act of defiance.” We have to hope.

What are you defying?

I'm defying the way the world is heading. I'm defying what is happening not only in this country, but throughout the world. It's suicide. I do think that intelligence and even wisdom involves this ability to see connections where others don't see it. To see these interrelationships, I mean, you can have information without knowledge, you can have knowledge without intelligence and in some instances you can have intelligence without wisdom. There's a hierarchy.

You go from cognition to consciousness. You can have knowledge, intelligence. We need to define what all those are. And then you're going to have wisdom. And wisdom is in some sense, I think, trying to understand how this all fits together and how we are an integral — and that's the word — an integral member of this web. And that web is constantly moving. And there will be new forms of life that evolve, right? I don't think human life will go away. But it's also very possible that we will bring about our own extinction.

And when I posed that question about the world ending next Friday, it was to try to convey the sense of the certainty of death. And for me, that experience of dying without dying liberated me. It makes life more precious in certain ways because of its fragility.

So maybe the real question isn't what would we do if the end came next Friday? Maybe it's what would we become if we lived like that were true?

That's a better way of putting it.

            A federal appeals court ruled Friday night to uphold a lower court's temporary order blocking the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in Southern California.
    


            A three-judge panel of the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals held a hearing Monday afternoon at which the federal government asked the court to overturn a temporary restraining order issued July 12 by Judge Maame E. Frimpong, arguing it hindered their enforcement of immigration law.
    


Immigrant advocacy groups filed suit last month accusing President Donald Trump's administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. The lawsuit included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens as plaintiffs.
    


            In her order, Frimpong said there was a “mountain of evidence” that federal immigration enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. She wrote the government cannot use factors such as apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone's occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion to detain someone.
    


How ICE raids turned parts of Los Angeles into ghost towns



            The Los Angeles region has been a battleground with the Trump administration over its aggressive immigration strategy that spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guards and Marines for several weeks. Federal agents have rounded up immigrants without legal status to be in the U.S. from Home Depots, car washes, bus stops, and farms, many who have lived in the country for decades.
    


            Among the plaintiffs is Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a video taken by a friend June 13 being seized by federal agents as he yells, “I was born here in the states, East LA bro!”
    


            They want to “send us back to a world where a US citizen … can be grabbed, slammed against a fence and have his phone and ID taken from him just because he was working at a tow yard in a Latino neighborhood,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Mohammad Tajsar told the court.
    


            The federal government argued that it hadn't been given enough time to collect and present evidence in the lawsuit, given that it was filed shortly before the July 4 holiday and a hearing was held the following week.
    


            “It's a very serious thing to say that multiple federal government agencies have a policy of violating the Constitution,” attorney Jacob Roth said.
    


            He also argued that the lower court's order was too broad, and that immigrant advocates did not present enough evidence to prove that the government had an official policy of stopping people without reasonable suspicion.
    


Americans voted for deportations. They didn't necessarily vote for this.



            He referred to the four factors of race, language, presence at a location, and occupation that were listed in the temporary restraining order, saying the court should not be able to ban the government from using them at all. He also argued that the order was unclear on what exactly is permissible under law.
    


            “Legally, I think it's appropriate to use the factors for reasonable suspicion,” Roth said
    


            The judges sharply questioned the government over their arguments.
    


            “No one has suggested that you cannot consider these factors at all,” Judge Jennifer Sung said.
    


            However, those factors alone only form a “broad profile” and don't satisfy the reasonable suspicion standard to stop someone, she said.
    


            Sung, a Biden appointee, said that in an area like Los Angeles, where Latinos make up as much as half the population, those factors “cannot possibly weed out those who have undocumented status and those who have documented legal status.”
    


            She also asked: “What is the harm to being told not to do something that you claim you're already not doing?”

NEW YORK (AP) — It would seem the most straightforward of notions: A thing takes place, and it goes into the history books or is added to museum exhibits. But whether something even gets remembered and how — particularly when it comes to the history of a country and its leader — is often the furthest thing from simple.

The latest example of that came Friday, when the Smithsonian Institution said it had removed a reference to the 2019 and 2021 impeachments of President Donald Trump from a panel in an exhibition about the American presidency. Trump has pressed institutions and agencies under federal oversight, often through the pressure of funding, to focus on the country's achievements and progress and away from things he terms “divisive.”

A Smithsonian spokesperson said the removal of the reference, which had been installed as part of a temporary addition in 2021, came after a review of “legacy content recently” and the exhibit eventually “will include all impeachments.” There was no time frame given for when; exhibition renovations can be time- and money-consuming endeavors.

In a statement that did not directly address the impeachment references, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said: “We are fully supportive of updating displays to highlight American greatness.”

But is history intended to highlight or to document — to report what happened, or to serve a desired narrative? The answer, as with most things about the past, can be intensely complex. 




The Smithsonian's move comes in the wake of Trump administration actions like removing the name of a gay rights activist from a Navy ship, pushing for Republican supporters in Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and getting rid of the leadership at the Kennedy Center.

“Based on what we have been seeing, this is part of a broader effort by the president to influence and shape how history is depicted at museums, national parks, and schools,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. “Not only is he pushing a specific narrative of the United States but, in this case, trying to influence how Americans learn about his own role in history.”

It's not a new struggle, in the world generally and the political world particularly. There is power in being able to shape how things are remembered, if they are remembered at all — who was there, who took part, who was responsible, what happened to lead up to that point in history. And the human beings who run things have often extended their authority to the stories told about them.

In China, for example, references to the June 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square are forbidden and meticulously regulated by the ruling Communist Party government. In Soviet-era Russia, officials who ran afoul of leaders like Josef Stalin disappeared not only from the government itself but from photographs and history books where they once appeared. 

Jason Stanley, an expert on authoritarianism, said controlling what and how people learn of their past has long been used as a vital tool to maintain power. Stanley has made his views about the Trump administration clear; he recently left Yale University to join the University of Toronto, citing concerns over the U.S. political situation. 

 “If they don't control the historical narrative,” he said, “then they can't create the kind of fake history that props up their politics.”

In the United States, presidents and their families have always used their power to shape history and calibrate their own images. Jackie Kennedy insisted on cuts in William Manchester's book on her husband's 1963 assassination, “The Death of a President.” Ronald Reagan and his wife got a cable TV channel to release a carefully calibrated documentary about him. Those around Franklin D. Roosevelt, including journalists of the era, took pains to mask the impact that paralysis had on his body and his mobility. 

Trump, though, has taken it to a more intense level — a sitting president encouraging an atmosphere where institutions can feel compelled to choose between him and the truth — whether he calls for it directly or not.

“We are constantly trying to position ourselves in history as citizens, as citizens of the country, citizens of the world,” said Robin Wagner-Pacifici, professor emerita of sociology at the New School for Social Research. “So part of these exhibits and monuments are also about situating us in time. And without it, it's very hard for us to situate ourselves in history because it seems like we just kind of burst forth from the Earth.”

Timothy Naftali, director of the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library and Museum from 2007 to 2011, presided over its overhaul to offer a more objective presentation of Watergate — one not beholden to the president's loyalists. In an interview Friday, he said he was “concerned and disappointed” about the Smithsonian decision. Naftali, now a senior researcher at Columbia University, said museum directors “should have red lines” and that he considered removing the Trump panel to be one of them. 

While it might seem inconsequential for someone in power to care about a museum's offerings, Wagner-Pacifici says Trump's outlook on history and his role in it — earlier this year, he said the Smithsonian had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” — shows how important those matters are to people in authority.

“You might say about that person, whoever that person is, their power is so immense and their legitimacy is so stable and so sort of monumental that why would they bother with things like this ... why would they bother to waste their energy and effort on that?” Wagner-Pacifici said. Her conclusion: “The legitimacy of those in power has to be reconstituted constantly. They can never rest on their laurels.”

President Donald Trump on Friday said he wants his administration to release “everything” in the Epstein files but urged caution in doing so, warning that people could get hurt in the process.

“We'd like to release everything, but we don't want people to get hurt that shouldn't be hurt,” he told Newsmax host Rob Finnerty in an interview at the White House. “I want to release everything. I just don't want people to get hurt.”

The sit-down interview comes one week after Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, for nine hours over two days.

Maxwell was granted limited immunity for answering the Department of Justice's questions, meaning her statements won't be directly used against her in a new prosecution. However, the legal protection is not absolute. She is already serving 20 years in prison for trafficking underage girls.

When Finnerty asked Trump about what Maxwell said during the interview, Trump said he didn't know because he hadn't spoken to Blanche about her testimony yet.

Trump said he suspected Blanche, whom he praised as a “very talented guy” and a “straight shooter,” was interviewing Maxwell because he also doesn't want people, presumably sexual abuse survivors, to get hurt in a complete release of the Epstein files.

While he is open to the release conducted cautiously, the president suggested there's nothing in the files that could incriminate him in Epstein's sex trafficking operation because the ones in control of the files were his political opponents.

“If they were going to use the files, they would've used it before my election,” Trump said, naming former FBI Director James Comey. “Unless they're stupid, which to a certain extent, they are stupid.”

“They controlled the files for four years. So if they had something, they would've released it before the election,” Trump added, describing them as “evil people.”

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Trump was told by Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputy in May that his name appeared multiple times in the Epstein files. Trump and Epstein were once friends, but they had a fallout, and Trump kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida two decades ago.

Earlier this week, Trump said Epstein “stole people that worked for me” at Mar-a-Lago, including victim Virginia Giuffre, who committed suicide in April.

Trump's name appearing in the files doesn't exactly mean wrongdoing, and the DOJ said nothing in the documents warranted further investigation or prosecution.

COMER SAYS GHISLAINE MAXWELL CAN TESTIFY AFTER SUPREME COURT APPEAL

“As part of our routine briefing, we made the President aware of the findings,” Bondi and Blanche told the Wall Street Journal in a joint statement.

Earlier Friday, it was reported that Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a similar facility in Texas. It remains unclear why she was transferred. Maxwell was set to testify before the House Oversight Committee this month, but the date was moved back until after the Supreme Court decides on the pending petition in her criminal case. She argues her 2021 conviction should be tossed because of a 2007 plea agreement Epstein secured with federal prosecutors in Florida.

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that would have new tariffs on a wide swath of U.S. trading partners to go into effect on August 7. (Produced by Elaine Carroll)

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

President Donald Trump's latest tariff moves drew worries from Wall Street as stocks slumped Friday and Treasury yields fell sharply.

Trump signed an order Thursday night imposing steep tariffs on 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands to go into effect on Aug. 7, after he originally threatened them for April but postponed twice after that until Aug. 1.

The markets were also reacting to government reports of a dramatic slowdown in hiring as businesses, investors and the Fed operate under a cloud of uncertainty from months of tariff policy news.

Tariff-related news we're following:








There has been a stalemate over the pace of confirmations. Democrats have slowed the process by forcing procedural votes on almost all the president's picks. Trump recently declared that his nominees “should NOT BE FORCED TO WAIT.” 

Caught in the middle, Majority Leader John Thune says he will keep the Senate in session over the weekend at least to hold confirmation votes while also negotiating with Democrats to speed up consideration of dozens of nominees. The two sides have yet to reach an agreement, and it's unclear if Trump, who has publicly called on Republicans to cancel their break, would be onboard with any bipartisan deal.

Thune said Friday that he was leaving some negotiations to Trump and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

“That's how this is going to get resolved,” Thune said. “We'll see where that leads.”

Senators in both parties are eager to leave Washington.

A label about impeachment was added in 2021 to the National Museum for American History's exhibit on presidential power. 

Smithsonian spokesperson Phillip Zimmerman said the section needed an overhaul, and the impeachment reference will be restored after revisions. 

The decision comes as the White House presses for a more positive view of American history. Since January, Trump has demanded changes across Washington cultural institutions, including the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress, and the Kennedy Center.

White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said the Smithsonian has “highlighted divisive DEI exhibits which are out of touch with mainstream America” for too long. 

 “We are fully supportive of updating displays to highlight American greatness,” he said in a statement that did not address the removed reference to Trump's impeachments.

Trump is the only president to be impeached twice, in 2019 and 2021.

Trump said Combs became hostile toward him during the 2020 election after they'd been very friendly for years, and that the behavior makes a pardon “more difficult to do.”

Asked by Newsmax during an interview broadcast Friday if he was more likely to not issue a pardon for Combs, Trump told the conservative outlet, “I would say so.”

The 55-year-old music mogul is being held in a federal lockup in New York City awaiting sentencing Oct. 3 following his recent conviction on two prostitution-related charges.

Combs said in 2020 that “white men like Trump need to be banished.”

Russia's space chief has visited the United States to discuss cooperation between Moscow and Washington on the International Space Station and lunar research with NASA's acting chief, the first such face-to-face meeting in more than seven years. 

Dmitry Bakanov, director of Roscosmos, met Thursday with NASA's acting administrator, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, prior to the delayed launch of a U.S.-Japanese-Russian crew to the space station. 

Once bitter rivals in the space race during the Cold War, Roscosmos and NASA cooperated on the space station and other projects. That relationship was beset with tensions after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, but they continued to cooperate, with U.S. and Russian crews flying to the orbiting outpost.

Plans for broader cooperation, including possible Russian involvement in NASA's Artemis program of lunar research, have fallen apart. 

It's been almost 100 years since the U.S. had tariffs at the level they could reach next Friday.

Once Trump's planned tariffs take effect, Americans will see an average tax of 18.3% for imported products, the highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.

Tariffs are a tax, and consumers are likely to foot at least part of the bill. The Budget Lab estimated that prices will increase 1.8% in the short term as a result of the trade war, the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per household.

Companies are dealing with tariffs in various ways. Many automakers appear to be swallowing the costs for now. But the world's largest eyewear maker, EssilorLuxottica, said it raised U.S. prices due to tariffs.

The lawsuit filed Friday in Manhattan federal court by the New York Civil Liberties Union and others argues that arresting immigrants as they appear in court for mandatory hearings is unprecedented and unlawful and violates their due process rights.

A similar lawsuit was filed last month in federal court in Washington over the large-scale immigration court arrests, which began in May.

Spokespersons for the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agencies named in the suit, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Justice Alexandre de Moraes said the court will not yield to sanctions or foreign pressure. He did not specifically name the U.S. or its president, but tensions between the countries escalated this week.

The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against De Moraes for alleged suppression of freedom of expression, and Trump signed an order imposing a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods.

Washington cited what it called “political persecution” of former President Jair Bolsonaro as the reason. Bolsonaro is accused of orchestrating a plot to remain in power after losing the 2022 election, and his trial is expected later this year. 

De Moraes, who is overseeing the case against Bolsonaro, emphasized the independence of the judiciary. 

“The Supreme Court will always be unwavering in the defense of national sovereignty, in its commitment to democracy and the rule of law, in its commitment to the independence of the judiciary and the constitutional principles of Brazil,” he said. 

In a 52-45 party-line vote, the Senate confirmed Lucas to another five-year term as commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, demonstrating firm Republican support for her efforts to root out diversity programs, roll back protections for transgender workers and prioritize religious rights in the workplace.

Democratic lawmakers and prominent civil rights groups fiercely opposed Lucas' confirmation, saying she has subjected the EEOC to the whims of the president, who elevated her to acting chair in January and, in an unprecedented act, fired two of the agency's Democratic commissioners before their terms expired.

Lucas, who was first appointed to the EEOC in 2020, has firmly aligned the agency with Trump's civil rights agenda, declaring during her confirmation hearing last month that she doesn't consider the EEOC to be independent, a position she acknowledged was a shift from her previously stated views.

The head of the agency that compiles the closely watched monthly jobs report usually toils in obscurity. But on Friday the current holder of that job was loudly fired by the president.

McEntarfer bore the brunt of Trump's unhappiness with the latest jobs report, which showed that hiring slowed in July and was much less in May and June than previously estimated. He accused her without evidence of manipulating the numbers and noted that she was appointed by President Joe Biden.

McEntarfer, a longtime government worker who served as BLS head for a year and a half, did not immediately respond to an AP request for comment. But her predecessor, former co-workers and associates denounced the firing, warning about its repercussions and saying she was nonpolitical in her role.

U.S. District Judge John Cronan declined a request by 16 Democratic-led states to force the National Science Foundation to restart payments immediately. The agency can continue withholding the funding from researchers until litigation aimed at restoring it plays out, he ruled. 

Cronan said he would not grant the preliminary injunction in part because it may be that another court, the Court of Federal Claims, has jurisdiction over what is essentially a case about money. He also said the states failed to show that NSF's actions were counter to its mandate.

The states' lawsuit, filed in May, alleges that the NSF's new grant-funding priorities as well as a cap on what's known as indirect research expenses “violate the law and jeopardize America's longstanding global leadership in STEM.”

A lawyer for the NSF said it has the authority to fund whatever research it deems necessary — and has since its inception in 1950. 

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb agreed to temporarily block the administration's efforts to expand “expedited removal” for immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under a process known as humanitarian parole. The ruling could could benefit hundreds of thousands of people.

Cobb ruled that the Department of Homeland Security exceeded its statutory authority in its efforts. The judge said those immigrants face perils that outweigh any harm from “pressing pause” on the administration's plans.

The case “presents a question of fair play” for people fleeing oppression and violence in their home countries, Cobb said in her order.

“In a world of bad options, they played by the rules,” she wrote. “Now, the Government has not only closed off those pathways for new arrivals but changed the game for parolees already here, restricting their ability to seek immigration relief and subjecting them to summary removal despite statutory law prohibiting the Executive Branch from doing so.”

Kugler, who did not participate in the Fed's policy meeting this week, would have completed her term in January. Instead she will retire Aug. 8. She did not provide a reason for stepping down in her resignation letter.

Federal Reserve governors vote on the central bank's interest rate decisions and also on changes to bank regulations and other financial rules. 

The Trump administration could take advantage of Kugler's resignation and appoint a potential replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to her position. Powell, who has been repeatedly attacked by Trump for not reducing the Fed's key short-term interest rate, completes his term as chair in May 2026.

Trump said Friday afternoon that he was “very happy” to have an opportunity to name someone to the board. 

Asked about potential candidates, Trump said he has “about three very good — I've got a lot of good candidates.” 

The president gave the directive after what he called “highly provocative statements” by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The two have have feuded online in recent days. 

The impact on U.S. nuclear submariness — which normally and routinely patrol global hotspots — remains unclear. But the move potentially escalates tensions between Washington and Moscow at a delicate time, as Trump threatens new sanctions in an attempt to push Russia toward a ceasefire in its war with Ukraine. 

Trump said Friday evening that he “had to” reposition the subs. He said Medvedev made “inappropriate” threats and, “When you talk about nuclear, we have to be prepared.”

In a letter to Maxwell's lawyers, Rep. James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, said the committee “is willing to delay your deposition” as part of its Jeffrey Epstein investigation until after the conclusion of an appeal she filed to the Supreme Court. That appeal is expected to be resolved in late September.

Maxwell's team had notified congressional investigators that she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination unless the committee meets certain demands, including a granting of congressional immunity; for the deposition to take place outside of her Tallahassee prison; a preview of the questions; and the conclusion of her appeal.

Comer wrote that while Maxwell's testimony is “vital” to the investigation, the committee would not provide immunity or advance questions. The committee “is willing to engage in good faith negotiations” and “will continue its long-standing practice of engaging in forthright and detailed discussions about scoping,” Comer added.

The National Restaurant Association, which represents more than 1 million U.S. eateries and food service providers, said Friday that tariffs could increase the cost of popular menu items like coffee and hamburgers as well as ingredients like spices.

Michelle Korsmo, the president and CEO of the association, said restaurants operate on such tight margins that the tariffs will force many to raise prices. Higher prices will cause diners to eat out less often, jeopardizing an industry that supports millions of jobs.

Korsmo said the association wants food and beverages to be exempted from tariffs.

“We ask the Trump administration to continue with sensible trade agreements,” Korsmo said in a statement. “While addressing trade deficits is important, food and beverage products are not major contributors to these imbalances.”

U.S. health officials have told more than a half-dozen of the nation's top medical organizations that they will no longer help establish vaccination recommendations.

The government told the organizations on Thursday via email that their experts are being disinvited from the workgroups that have been the backbone of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The organizations include the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Several of the organizations issued a statement asking the administration to reconsider, saying it was irresponsible to remove them from the process.

Senate Democrats are quickly jumping on the dismissal of Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, warning that it shows Trump is acting like a dictator.

In a Senate floor speech, Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer said, “Donald Trump sometimes admires dictators, he admires them. Well, he sometimes acts just like them. It's classic Donald Trump. When he gets the news he doesn't like, he shoots the messenger.”

Other Senate Democrats said it showed Trump was not facing up to the realities of the economy.

“This is the act of somebody who is soft, weak and afraid to own up to the reality of the damage his chaos is inflicting on our economy,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.






The U.S. stock market had its worst day since May on Friday after the government reported a sharp slowdown in hiring and President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from a number of U.S. trading partners. 

The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, its biggest decline since May 21 and its fourth straight loss. The index is also posted a 2.4% loss for the week, marking a sharp shift from last week's record-setting streak of gains.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2%, while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.2%.

Worries on Wall Street about a weakening economy were heavily reinforced by the latest report on job growth in the U.S. Employers added just 73,000 jobs in July. That is sharply lower than economists expected. The Labor Department also reported that revisions shaved a stunning 258,000 jobs off May and June payrolls.

Markets also reacted to the latest tariff news. President Donald Trump announced tariff rates on dozens of countries and pushed back the scheduled effective date to Aug. 7, adding more uncertainty to the global trade picture.

Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said on X that the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics had been removed from her post after Trump called for her firing.

“A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,” Chavez-DeRemer wrote to justify her removal of Erika McEntarfer as commissioner.

While the Trump administration searches for a replacement, deputy commissioner William Wiatrowski will lead the bureau.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a cornerstone of American culture for three generations, announced Friday it would begin taking steps toward its own closure after being defunded by Congress.

This announcement marks the end of a nearly six-decade era in which it fueled the production of renowned educational programming, cultural content and even emergency alerts.

The demise of the corporation, known as CPB, is a direct result of President Donald Trump's targeting of public media, which he has repeatedly said is spreading political and cultural views antithetical to those the United States should be espousing. The closure is expected to have a profound impact on the journalistic and cultural landscape — in particular, public radio and TV stations in small communities across the United States. CPB helps fund both PBS and NPR.

The corporation also has deep ties to much of the nation's most familiar programming, from NPR's “All Things Considered” to, historically, “Sesame Street,” “Mister Rogers' Neighborhood” and the documentaries of Ken Burns.

Trump said on Truth Social that he will remove Erika McEntarfer as the commissioner of labor statistics after the July employment report found that just 73,000 jobs were added in July and hiring in June and May was revised downward by 258,000 jobs combined.

Trump said that McEntarfer is a “Biden Political Appointee” as he questioned the accuracy of the numbers.

“She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified,” Trump said. “Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.”

The comments were Trump's first public remarks on the jobs report released Friday.

A person familiar with the matter says several federal agencies notified the University of California, Los Angeles, this week they were suspending the grants over civil rights concerns. 

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The frozen grants include $240 million from the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health.

President Donald Trump's administration has accused the school of civil rights violations related to antisemitism, affirmative action and women's sports.

As President Trump lashed out at the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after a disappointing jobs report Friday, GOP senators showed far more restraint in pointing fingers or calling for immediate rate cuts.

“The important part is that the markets see them as being independent and making the analysis based upon the data that they have in front of them,” said Sen. Mike Rounds.

Sen. Rick Scott, a loyal Trump ally, acknowledged that “we didn't have as good jobs numbers as people would like” but added that “our economy is going to get better.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski showed skepticism about the president's plan with tariffs, saying, “It's kind of like going all over the place.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune continued to back the president, saying that “tariffs impacts have been minimal.”

“Time will tell,” said Thune.

Dozens of pro-Palestinian protestors on Friday occupied the lobby of the Manhattan office of U.S. Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, the latest sign of U.S. political backlash over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Videos and pictures posted on X showed protestors chanting “Stop starving Gaza, let Gaza live” while a yellow sign was placed on the floor that read “Let Aid in Now.” One image showed protestors holding a sign that read “Jews for Palestinian Freedom,” while in others some of the protestors could be seen wearing shirts that read “Jews say let Gaza live.”

The offices of Schumer and Gillibrand, both Democrats, did not immediately return emailed requests for comment.

Democratic officials on Friday accused the Trump administration of unlawfully intimidating health care providers into stopping gender-affirming care for transgender youth.

The state attorneys general for 15 states plus the District of Columbia and Pennsylvania's governor said in a lawsuit in federal court in Boston that the president's efforts, including investigations of providers, are an attempt to end care that's legal.

Trump has attempted to cut off federal funding for the care for those under age 19. His administration has prioritized fraud investigations of providers, and it's sent subpoenas to some of them.

At least eight major hospitals and hospital systems announced in July that they would limit or end the care, which advocates say is essential to the health of transgender young people.

Belgium is in talks with U.S. diplomats to save the supplies. The European Union is monitoring the situation, while aid groups have offered to distribute the contraceptives. Two U.S. senators say destroying them would be a waste, harmful for women and damage U.S. prestige.

U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Tommy Pigott said Thursday that the administration is still “determining the way forward.”

The federal Bureau of Prisons says the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein has been moved from a federal prison in Florida. A lawyer for Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls, confirmed the transfer to the camp in Bryan, Texas but declined to comment on the circumstances.

Maxwell's case has generated renewed attention following the Justice Department's much-scrutinized handling of documents from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation. She was interviewed at a Florida courthouse over two days with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last week. 

The House Oversight Committee has said it wants to speak with Maxwell as well. Her lawyer, David Oscar Markus, said she would be open this but only if the panel gives her immunity from prosecution for anything she says.

Republican leaders, meanwhile, have encouraged their members to promote more popular aspects of the bill during smaller controlled appearances less likely to feature difficult questions or protests -- especially over the Medicaid cuts that will leave millions without health care coverage. 

The Democratic National Committee's “Organizing Summer” features events in all 50 states and advertising targeting vulnerable House Republicans, “ensuring Americans across the country know exactly who is responsible for taking away health care, food, construction jobs, and nursing homes in order to give massive handouts to billionaires,” DNC Chair Ken Martin said.

The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that 10 million additional Americans will be uninsured in 2034 due to President Trump's new tax law. Researchers used past studies to predict the impact on patient health. (AP video: Laura Bargfeld)

The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the U.S. uninsured population will grow by 10 million, due to Trump's tax and spending law. And thanks to a natural experiment nearly two decades ago, health researchers can forecast the impact on patient care as the uninsured delay treatments, cancel doctor visits and skip prescriptions:

“There's really no questioning the basic reality that you can't take health care away from 10 million people without causing many preventable deaths,” said Dr. Adam Gaffney, a lead researcher on a team that explored the new law's impact.

The Senate Democratic leader is blaming Trump's tariffs for the sharply slowing U.S. hiring, saying Friday's jobs report is “the latest warning sign that this tariff chaos must end.” 

The Labor Department shaved its estimates for May and June, reporting that about 258,000 fewer jobs were created than previously projected. “It is disturbing to say but the chickens are coming home to roost on Donald Trump's destructive trade war and the American people are paying the price,” Schumer said on the Senate floor.

The tariffs a tax hike on American families, he said, urging Trump to “reverse course.”

In a report issued Friday, Human Rights Watch called the current setup “a flawed, militarized aid distribution system that has turned aid distributions into regular bloodbaths.”

“It would be near impossible for Palestinians to follow the instructions issued by GHF, stay safe, and receive aid, particularly in the context of ongoing military operations, Israeli military sanctioned curfews, and frequent GHF messages saying that people should not travel to the sites before the distribution window opens,” the report said. 

Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in shootings by Israeli soldiers while on roads heading to the sites, according to witnesses and health officials. The Israeli military has said its troops have only fired warning shots to control crowds. Responding to Friday's report, it accused Hamas of sabotaging the aid distribution system and said it's working to make the routes under its control safer.

At a Friday press conference in Gaza City, representatives of the territory's influential tribes accused Israel of empowering factions that loot aid sites and implored Witkoff to stay just a few hours in Gaza, so he can see their desperate situation for himself.

“We want the American envoy to come and live among us in these tents where there is no water, no food and no light,” they said. “Our children are hungry in the streets.”

Officials at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza said they have received the bodies of 25 people, including 13 who were killed while trying to get aid, including near the site that U.S. officials visited. GHF denied anyone was killed at their sites on Friday and said most recent deaths happened near United Nations aid convoys. Israel's military did not immediately comment.

Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee toured one of Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's distribution sites in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, on Friday amid international outrage over starvation, aid shortages and deadly chaos near distribution sites.

All four of the U.S. and Israeli group's sites are controlled by the Israeli military and have become flashpoints of desperation during their months of operation, with starving people scrambling for scarce aid. Hundreds have been killed by either gunfire or trampling. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots, and GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to prevent deadly crowding.

Witkoff's visit comes a week after U.S. officials walked away from ceasefire talks. Trump posted on social media that the fastest way to end the crisis would be for Hamas to surrender and release hostages.

Protests in Sao Paulo after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose 50% tariffs on Brazil's exports, citing the country's policies and the criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro as an “economic emergency” under a 1977 law.



Trump intends the duties to bring back manufacturing to the United States, while also forcing other countries to reduce their trade barriers to U.S. exports. 

Goods imported by Americans from the countries Trump has reached deals with face much higher tariffs than those in effect before he took office. Other large trading partners — most notably China and Mexico — received an extension to keep negotiating, but they will likely end up paying more. And countries without an agreement face duties ranging between 10% and 40%, according to Trump's executive order signed on Thursday.

Trump argues that foreign exporters will pay the cost of the tariffs, but so far economists have found that most are being paid by U.S. companies. Goldman Sachs estimates that foreign exporters are absorbing 20% of tariffs, with U.S. businesses and consumers splitting 80%. Measures of U.S. inflation have started to tick higher as prices of imports rise.

Stocks slumped in morning trading on Wall Street Friday and Treasury yields fell sharply after the government reported a sharp slowdown in hiring last month.

Markets are also reacting to the latest tariff news — Trump once again extending the date, now to Aug. 7, when punishing import taxes will take effect for a long list of countries. The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, on track to close the week with a loss. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 599 points, or 1.4% as of 9:44 a.m. Eastern. The Nasdaq composite fell 2%. 

Worries on Wall Street about a weakening economy were heavily reinforced by Friday's sharply-lower-than-expected report on U.S. job growth. Labor Department revisions shaved a stunning 258,000 jobs off May and June payrolls.

“Trump's new tariff directive, signed behind closed doors just ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, slaps a new floor under global trade costs: a 10% minimum rate for nearly all partners, with surcharges of 15% or higher for surplus nations,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

“This wasn't just an update — it was a structural rewrite. The average U.S. tariff jumps from 13.3% to 15.2%, a seismic shift from the 2.3% average before Trump retook office. This reshapes the cost calculus for everything from semiconductors to copper pipes,” he said.

'Trump on Friday called for the Federal Reserve's board of governors to usurp the power of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing the head of the U.S. central bank for not cutting short-term interest rates.

Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump called Powell “stubborn.” The Fed chair has been subjected to vicious verbal attacks by the Republican president over several months.

The Fed has the responsibility of stabilizing prices and maximizing employment. Powell, backed by most of the board's seven governors, has held its benchmark rate for overnight loans constant this year, saying that Fed officials needed to see what impact Trump's massive tariffs had on inflation.

If Powell doesn't “substantially” lower rates, Trump said, “THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!”

There are no signs yet that tariffs will lead to more domestic manufacturing jobs, and Friday's employment report showed the U.S. economy now has 37,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than it did in April.

One crucial measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed Thursday that prices have climbed 2.6% over the 12 months that ended in June, a sign that price hikes may be accelerating as tariffs flow through the economy. This prospect has caused the Federal Reserve to hold off on additional rate cuts, frustrating Trump, who has called Fed Chair Jerome Powell a “TOTAL LOSER” on his social media platform.

“There are many uncertainties left to resolve,” Powell told reporters Wednesday. “So, yes, we are learning more and more. It doesn't feel like we're very close to the end of that process. And that's not for us to judge, but it does — it feels like there's much more to come.”

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government is disappointed by Trump's move to raise the U.S. tariff on goods from America's northern neighbor to 35% from 25%, effective Friday. Goods transshipped from unspecified other countries face a 40% import duty.

Trump cited what he said was a lack of cooperation in stemming trafficking in illicit drugs across the northern border. He also slammed Canada's plan to recognize a Palestinian state and has expressed frustration with a trade deficit largely fueled by U.S. oil purchases.

“Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,” Carney said in a statement.

Many of Canada's exports to the U.S. are covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and face no tariff. But steel, lumber, aluminum and autos have been subject to still higher tariffs.

U.S. employers added just 73,000 jobs last month and job gains for June were revised sharply lower, from 147,000 to just 14,000, the Labor Department reported Friday. It points to a much weaker job market than previously understood.

Unemployment ticked higher to a still-low 4.2% from 4.1%, and the proportion of Americans working or looking for work declined again, possibly reflecting falling immigration and more deportations. Manufacturers cut jobs for the third straight month and have now reduced their payrolls by 37,000 since April.

The weak data makes it more likely that Trump will get one of his most fervent desires: A cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which often — though not always — can lead to lower rates for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards. Investors sharply raised expectations for a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in September.

Swiss pharmaceuticals powerhouse Roche says it is working to ensure its patients and customers around the world have access to medications and diagnostics amid the Trump tariff war.

“While we believe pharmaceuticals and diagnostics should be exempt from tariffs to protect patient access, supply chains and ultimately future innovation, we are prepared for potential tariffs being implemented and confident in managing any impacts,” the statement said. “With strengthened U.S. production capacity and proactive measures like inventory adjustments and tech transfer, we are working to ensure uninterrupted access to our products.”

The company announced plans in April to invest $50 billion in the United States over the next five years, creating 12,000 jobs. The company already employs more than 25,000 people in the U.S.

Trump initially imposed the Friday deadline after his previous “Liberation Day” tariffs in April resulted in a stock market panic. His unusually high tariff rates then led to recession fears, prompting Trump to impose a 90-day negotiating period. When he was unable to create enough trade deals with other countries, he extended the timeline and sent out letters to world leaders that simply listed rates, prompting a slew of hasty agreements.

Swiss imports will now be taxed at a higher rate, 39%, than the 31% Trump threatened in April, while Liechtenstein saw its rate slashed from 37% to 15%. Countries not listed in the Thursday night order would be charged a baseline 10% tariff.

Trump negotiated trade frameworks over the past few weeks with the EU, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines — allowing the president to claim victories as other nations sought to limit his threat of charging even higher tariff rates. He said on Thursday there were agreements with other countries, but he declined to name them.

In a flurry of last-minute deal-making, Trump has been announcing agreements as late as Thursday, but they are largely short on details.

On Thursday, the U.S. and Pakistan reached a trade agreement expected to allow Washington to help develop Pakistan's largely untapped oil reserves and lower tariffs for the South Asian country.

And on Wednesday, Trump announced a deal with South Korea that would impose 15% tariffs on goods from that country. That is below the 25% duties that Trump threatened in April.

Agreements have also been reached with the European Union, Pakistan, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. The agreement with the Philippines barely reduced the tariff it will pay, from 20% to 19%.

Trump's original April 2 “Liberation Day” announcement threatened to impose import taxes of up to 50% on nearly 60 countries and economies, including the 27-nation European Union. Those duties, originally scheduled for April 9, were then postponed twice, first to July 9 and then Aug. 1.

On Wednesday, Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social, “THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE — IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.”

As of Thursday afternoon, White House representatives — and Trump himself — had insisted that no more delays were possible.

But when Trump signed the order Thursday night imposing new tariffs on 68 countries and the European Union, the start date of the punishing import taxes was pushed back seven days so that the tariff schedule could be updated. The change — while potentially welcome news to countries that had not yet reached a deal with the U.S. — injected a new dose of uncertainty for consumers and businesses still wondering what's going to happen and when.

Numerous countries around the world are facing the prospect of new tariffs on their exports to the United States on Aug. 7, a potential blow to the global economy, because they haven't yet reached a trade deal with the Trump administration.

Trump argues that foreign exporters will pay the cost of the tariffs, but so far economists have found that most are being paid by U.S. companies. And measures of U.S. inflation have started to tick higher as prices of imported goods, such as furniture, appliances, and toys rise.

Countries without an agreement face duties ranging between 10% and 40%, according to Trump's executive order signed on Thursday. That includes large economies such as Taiwan and India, as well as many smaller countries like South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and even tiny Lesotho.

Authorities have launched a manhunt after a shooting at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, left four people dead. Public records show that the suspect lived next door to the bar.

A shooting at a Montana bar left four people dead Friday, prompting a lockdown in a neighborhood several miles away as authorities searched for the suspect in a wooded, mountainous area.

The shooting happened around 10:30 a.m. at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, according to the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation, which is leading the investigation. The agency confirmed four people were pronounced dead at the scene.

The suspect, identified as 45-year-old military veteran Michael Paul Brown, lived next door, according to public records and bar owner David Gwerder.

The bartender and three patrons were killed, said Gwerder, who was not there at the time. He believed the four victims were the only ones present during the shooting, and was not aware of any prior conflicts between them and Brown.

“He knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,” Gwerder said. “He didn't have any running dispute with any of them. I just think he snapped.”

Brown's home was cleared by a SWAT team and he was last seen in the Stump Town area, just west of Anaconda, authorities said.

More than a dozen officers from local and state police converged on that area, locking it down so no one was allowed in or out. A helicopter also hovered over a nearby mountainside as officers moved among the trees, said Randy Clark, a retired police officer who lives there.

Brown was believed to be armed, the Montana Highway Patrol said in a statement. 




Brown served in the U.S. Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, according to Lt. Col. Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson. Brown was in the Montana National Guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said. He left military service in the rank of sergeant.

As reports of the shooting spread through town, business owners locked their doors and sheltered inside with customers. At Caterpillars to Butterflies Childcare, a nursery a few blocks from the shooting scene, owner Sage Huot said she'd kept the children inside all day after someone called to let her know about the violence.

“We're constantly doing practice drills, fire drills and active shooter drills, so we locked down the facility, locked the doors, and we have a quiet spot where we play activities away from all of our windows and doors,” Huot said.

Anaconda is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southeast of Missoula in a valley hemmed in by mountains. A town of about 9,000 people, it was founded by copper barons who profited off nearby mines in the late 1800s. A smelter stack that's no longer operational looms over the valley.

The owner of the Firefly Café in Anaconda said she locked up her business at about 11 a.m. Friday after getting alerted to the shooting by a friend.

“We are Montana, so guns are not new to us,” café owner Barbie Nelson said. “For our town to be locked down, everybody's pretty rattled.”

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

CANNES — Ten years ago, Vitalik Buterin and a small band of developers huddled in a drafty Berlin loft strung with dangling lightbulbs, laptops balanced on mismatched chairs and chipped tables. They weren't corporate titans or venture-backed founders — just idealists working long nights to push a radical idea into reality.

From that sparse office, they launched "Frontier," Ethereum's first live network. It was bare-bones — no interface, no polish, nothing user-friendly. But it could mine, execute smart contracts, and let developers test decentralized applications. It was the spark that transformed Ethereum from an abstract concept into a living, breathing system.

Bitcoin had captured headlines as "digital gold," but what they built was something else entirely: programmable money, a financial operating system where code could move funds, enforce contracts, and create businesses without banks or brokers.

One year earlier and 520 miles away in Zurich, Paul Brody got a call from IBM security: A kid was wandering the lab unattended.

"That's not a child," Brody told them. "That's Vitalik. He's a grown-up — he just looks really young."

At the time, Buterin was building the bones of Ethereum. The blockchain was still in its alpha stage, an early version of what would become a $420 billion platform rewiring Wall Street and powering decentralized finance, NFTs, and tokenized markets across the globe.

Brody, then leading a research team at IBM, remembers how quickly the idea clicked.

"One of the guys on the research team came to me and said, 'I've met this really interesting guy. He's got a really cool idea...It's like a version of bitcoin, but we're going to make it much faster and programmable,'" he said. "And when he said that to me, I thought, 'That's it. That is what I want. That is what we need.'"

With Buterin's help, IBM built its first blockchain prototype on Ethereum's early code, unveiling it at CES in 2015 alongside Samsung. "That was how I ended up down this path," Brody said. "I was done with all other technology and basically made the switch to blockchain."

Even now, as EY's global blockchain leader, Brody remembers feeling a pang of envy. "This is a kid, and it doesn't matter," he said. "I was jealous of Vitalik… to be able to do that."

He added, "I don't think opportunities like that could have been surfaced when I was that age."

Now, a decade later, that experiment has quietly rewired global markets.

"It's very impressive, just how much the space has succeeded and grown into, beyond pretty much anyone's expectations," Buterin told CNBC in Cannes on the sidelines of the blockchain's flagship event in Europe.

Buterin said the change over the past decade has been staggering. Ten years ago, he recalled, the crypto community was "just a very small space," with only a handful of people working on bitcoin and a few other projects.

Since then, Ethereum has become "this big thing," Buterin reflected, with major corporations now launching assets on both its base layer and layer-two networks. Parts of national economies are beginning to run on Ethereum infrastructure, a far cry from its cypherpunk origins.

But Buterin warned that mainstream adoption brings risks as well as benefits. One concern is that if too few issuers or intermediaries dominate, they could become "de facto controllers of the ecosystem." He described a scenario where Ethereum might appear open, but, in practice, all the keys are managed by centralized providers.

"That's the thing that we don't want," he said.

Two years earlier in Prague, CNBC met Buterin at Paralelní Polis, a sprawling industrial complex turned anarchist tech hub in the city's Holešovice district. The building's labyrinthine staircases and shadowed corridors felt like a physical map of the crypto world itself — part resistance movement, part experiment in reimagining power.

It was a place built on Václav Benda's concept of a "parallel society," where decentralized technologies offered refuge from state surveillance and control. It's the kind of place where Buterin, a self-described nomad, found himself at home among cypherpunks and cryptographic idealists.

At the time, Buterin described crypto's greatest utility not in speculative trading, but in helping people survive broken financial systems in emerging markets.

"The stuff that we often find a bit basic and boring is exactly the stuff that brings lots of value," he told CNBC at the time. "Just being able to plug into the international economy — these are things that they don't have, and these are things that provide huge value for people there."

Even in Prague, where coders worked to make payments fast and censorship-resistant, the technology felt like a resistance movement — privacy-preserving, anti-authoritarian, a lifeline in countries where banking collapses were common and money couldn't be trusted.

This year, Buterin keynoted Ethereum's flagship conference at the Palais des Festivals — the same red carpet venue that hosts movie stars each spring.

It was a fitting symbol of Ethereum's journey: from underground hacker dens to a network that governments, banks, and brokerages are now racing to build upon.

Brody, who currently leads blockchain strategy at EY, says what matters most is how deeply Ethereum is integrating into traditional finance. "The global financial system is really nicely described as a whole network of pipes," he said.

"What's happening now is that Ethereum is getting plumbed into this infrastructure," Brody continued, noting that until recently, crypto operated on entirely separate rails from traditional finance.

Now, he said, Ethereum is being wired directly into core transaction systems, setting the stage for massive financial flows — from investors to everyday savers — to migrate away from older mechanisms toward Ethereum-based platforms that can move money faster, at lower cost, and with more advanced functionality than legacy systems allow.

Stablecoins — digital dollars that live on Ethereum — power trillions in payments, tokenized assets and funds are moving on-chain, and Robinhood recently rolled out tokenized U.S. equities via Arbitrum, an Ethereum-based layer two.

Circle's USDC — the second-largest stablecoin — still settles around 65% of its volume on Ethereum's rails. According to CoinGecko's latest "State of Stablecoins" report, Ethereum accounts for nearly 50% of all stablecoin activity.

Between Circle's IPO and the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, now signed into law by President Donald Trump, regulators have new reason to engage with, rather than fight, this transformation.

Data from Deutsche Bank shows stablecoin transactions hit $28 trillion last year — more than Mastercard and Visa combined. The bank itself has announced plans to build a tokenization platform on zkSync, a fast, cost-efficient Ethereum layer two designed to help asset managers issue and manage tokenized funds, stablecoins, and other real-world assets while meeting regulatory and data protection requirements.

Digital asset exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken are racing to capture this crossover between traditional securities and crypto.

As part of its quarterly earnings release, Coinbase said this week it's launching tokenized stocks and prediction markets for U.S. users in the coming months, a move that would diversify its revenue stream and bring it into more direct competition with brokerages like Robinhood and eToro.

Kraken announced plans to offer 24/7 trading of U.S. stock tokens in select overseas markets.

BlackRock's tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, launched on Ethereum last year, offering qualified investors on-chain access to yield with real-time redemptions settled in USDC.

Even as newer blockchains tout faster speeds and lower fees, Ethereum has proven its staying power as the trusted network for global finance. Buterin told CNBC in Cannes that there's a misconception about what institutions actually want.

"A lot of institutions basically tell us to our faces that they value Ethereum because it's stable and dependable, because it doesn't go down," he said.

He added that firms frequently ask about privacy and other long-term features — the kinds of concerns that institutions, he said, "really value."

Institutions are choosing various layer twos to meet specific needs — Robinhood uses Arbitrum, Deutsche Bank zkSync, Coinbase and Kraken Optimism — but they all ultimately settle on Ethereum's base layer.

"The value proposition of Ethereum is its global reach, its huge capital flows, its incredible programmability," Brody said.

He added that the fact it isn't the fastest blockchain or the one with the quickest settlement times "is secondary to the fact that it's overall the most widely adopted and flexible system."

Brody also believes history points toward consolidation. He said that in most technology standards wars, one platform ultimately dominates. In his view, Ethereum is likely to become that dominant programmability layer, while Bitcoin plays a complementary role as a risk-off, scarcity-driven asset.

Engineers, he said, "love to work on a standard… to scale on a standard," and Ethereum has become precisely that.

Tomasz Stańczak, the newly appointed co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, sees the same pattern from inside the ecosystem.

"Institutions choose Ethereum over and over again for its values," Stańczak said. "Ten years without stopping for a moment. Ten years of upgrades with a huge dedication to security and censorship resistance."

When institutions send an order to the market, they want to be sure that it's treated fairly, that nobody has preference, and that the transaction is executed at the time when it's delivered. "That's what Ethereum guarantees," added Stańczak.

Those assurances have become more valuable as traditional finance moves on-chain.

Ethereum's path hasn't been smooth. The network has weathered spectacular booms and busts, rivals promising faster speeds, and criticism that it's too slow or expensive for mass adoption. Yet it has outlasted nearly all early competitors.

In 2022, Ethereum replaced its old transaction validation method, proof-of-work — where armies of computers competed to solve puzzles — with proof-of-stake, where users lock up their ether as collateral to help secure the network. The shift cut Ethereum's energy use by more than 99% and set the stage for upgrades aimed at making apps faster and cheaper to run on its base layer.

The next decade will test whether Ethereum can scale without compromise.

Buterin said the first priority is getting Ethereum to "the finish line" in terms of its technical goals. That means improving scalability and speed without sacrificing its core principles of decentralization and security — and ideally making those properties even stronger.

Zero-knowledge proofs, for example, could dramatically increase transaction capacity while making it possible to verify that the chain is following the rules of the protocol on something as small as a smartwatch.

There are also algorithmic changes the team already knows are needed to protect Ethereum against large-scale computing attacks. Implementing those, Buterin said, is part of the path to making Ethereum "a really valuable part of global infrastructure that helps make the internet and the economy a more free and open place."

Buterin believes the real change won't come with fireworks. He said it may already be unfolding years before most people recognize it.

"This type of disruption doesn't feel like overturning the existing system," he said. "It feels like building a new thing that just keeps growing and growing until eventually more and more people realize you don't even have to look at the old thing if you didn't want to."

Brody can already see hints of that future. Wire transfers are moving on-chain, assets like stocks and real estate are being tokenized, and eventually, he said, businesses will run entire contracts — the money, the products, the terms and conditions — automatically on a single, shared infrastructure.

That shift, Brody added, won't simply copy old financial systems onto new technology.

"One of the lessons from technology adoption is that it's not that we replace like for like," he said. "When new things come along, we tend to build on a new technology infrastructure. My key hypothesis is that as we build new financial products, it will be attractive to build them on blockchain rails — and we'll try to do things on blockchain rails that we can't do today."

If Brody and Buterin are right, the real disruption won't make headlines. It'll simply become the way money moves, unseen and unstoppable.

SpaceX delivered a fresh crew to the International Space Station on Saturday, making the trip in a quick 15 hours.

The four U.S., Russian and Japanese astronauts pulled up in their SpaceX capsule after launching from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. They will spend at least six months at the orbiting lab, swapping places with colleagues up there since March. SpaceX will bring those four back as early as Wednesday.

Moving in are NASA's Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov — each of whom had been originally assigned to other missions. "Hello, space station!" Fincke radioed as soon as the capsule docked high above the South Pacific.

Cardman and another astronaut were pulled from a SpaceX flight last year to make room for NASA's two stuck astronauts, Boeing Starliner test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, whose space station stay went from one week to more than nine months. Fincke and Yui had been training for the next Starliner mission. But with Starliner grounded by thruster and other problems until 2026, the two switched to SpaceX.

Platonov was bumped from the Soyuz launch lineup a couple of years ago because of an undisclosed illness.

Their arrival temporarily puts the space station population at 11.

"It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time," Cardman said once on board.

While their taxi flight was speedy by U.S. standards, the Russians hold the record for the fastest trip to the space station — a lightning-fast three hours.

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for alleged political violations of the Hatch Act, an accusation levied by President Donald Trump and other prominent Republicans but one, as publicly presented, void of specific evidence of wrongdoing.

Notably, the OSC, which is different than an office of a special counsel appointed by the Department of Justice, lacks the authority to bring criminal charges and prosecute individuals who violate the Hatch Act. The OSC may seek disciplinary action for a federal government employee, such as removal from the civil workforce, or refer its findings of Hatch Act violations to the DOJ for investigation.

On Wednesday, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., requested that the OSC investigate Smith for "unprecedented interference in the 2024 election." The OSC confirmed to NBC News on Saturday that it is investigating the alleged violations, and a source familiar says the OSC affirmed to Cotton that it is proceeding with its inquiry after his request.

More from NBC News:

Smith was tapped as special counsel by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to oversee the federal investigations into Trump, who announced his candidacy for the presidency three days before Smith's appointment. Smith would go on to bring two criminal indictments against then-candidate Trump in 2023 but resigned just over one week before Trump's inauguration in January 2024 — without ever having brought the two cases to trial.

"Jack Smith's legal actions were nothing more than a tool for the Biden and Harris campaigns," Cotton wrote on X, this week. "This isn't just unethical, it is very likely illegal campaign activity from a public office."

Cotton, in part, alleges that Smith pushed for a "rushed trial" for Trump. The Republican lawmaker has not publicly presented evidence that details how Smith's actions were illegal in nature.

Hatch Act violations are not typically referred to the Department of Justice. In 2019, the OSC recommended that then-President Trump remove White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway from the federal workforce for Hatch Act violations — but the matter was not sent to the DOJ.

The OSC investigation was first reported by the NY Post.

Trump's nominee to head the OSC is stalled in the Senate. A White House official told NBC News that Paul Ingrassia, a former podcast host with a history of incendiary commentary, is meeting with senators in one-on-one meetings over the next month before a confirmation vote takes place.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway posted a 4% drop in operating earnings to $11.2 billion in its first quarterly earnings report since the legendary investor revealed he plans to step down as CEO.

Berkshire also sold a net $3 billion of stocks last quarter, purchasing $3.9 billion of shares but selling $6.9 billion worth. The disposals marked the 11th quarter in a row that the company has been a net seller of stocks.

Second-quarter earnings fell from the same period a year ago as slimmer insurance underwriting profits offset higher income from BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and the manufacturing, service, and retailing division.

Another key driver of the decline was an $877 million foreign currency exchange loss tied to non-dollar debt — a sharp swing from a $446 million gain in the same period last year.

Berkshire is now sitting on a $344 billion cash pile, the filings show. That sum is larger than the market capitalization of companies like Coca-Cola and Bank of America.

Buffett, who turns 95 this month, refrained from repurchasing any Berkshire shares last quarter. The company wrote down its 27% stake in Kraft Heinz by about $5 billion, reducing its carrying value to $8.4 billion.

David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and longtime Buffett blogger, told Business Insider that the earnings were "business as usual" other than the Kraft Heinz impairment, which he called "surprising" and said "might be related" to Buffett's impending departure.

Buffett and his team have been thwarted by high valuations for public stocks, private companies, and Berkshire's own shares in recent years.

The lack of buying opportunities — and Berkshire paring key stock bets including Apple and Bank of America last year — have boosted its cash pile to all-time highs.

Berkshire stock was trouncing the benchmark S&P going into the annual meeting in May, when Buffett announced his planned successor, Greg Abel, would take over as CEO in the new year.

But while the index has surged over the last three months, Berkshire stock has slumped, which some gurus have attributed to the loss of a "Buffett premium."

Canada's decision to retaliate against US tariffs earlier this year appears to be driving a divergence in how President Donald Trump is dealing with America's neighbors. 

Until this week, Canada and Mexico received similar treatment in White House trade actions. Each was subject to a 25% base tariff, with a large exemption for goods shipped under the North American free trade pact known as USMCA.

Emmy, a 31-year-old living in Los Angeles, has been in a credit card debt cycle — racking up balances, paying a card off and then maxing it out again — since she was 18. 

When Emmy, who uses a pseudonym online to protect her privacy, started sharing her debt journey on TikTok in March, her total balanced exceeded $28,000.

"I know this is my fault," she tells CNBC Make It. "I was always the friend that'd be like, 'Shots on me,' or 'Oh, don't worry, I got it' or 'Just pay me next time,'" she says, adding that she wouldn't always follow up on requesting friends pay her back.

She's not alone. Nearly 60% of millennials and Gen Zers say their financial goals have been impacted by social spending, according to a new survey from Ally Bank.

Spending money on time with friends isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, "you're going to get the highest return on your well-being doing that," says Jack Howard, head of money wellness at Ally.

"But then we're getting into trouble, because we're finding that 42% of folks are overspending," she adds, citing the survey, which found that 42% of millennials and Gen Zers report overspending on their social budgets several months out of the year.

American adults seem to prioritize social time, with 69% of survey respondents saying they try to connect with their friends in-person at least once a week. And on average, they spend $250 a month on social activities, Ally found.

But few adults seem to properly budget for social spending. Just 18% of Gen Zers and millennials say they have a strict budget for activities with friends, Ally found.

"You gotta just put it in your budget," Howard says. "I think a lot of people just don't realize that cocktails with my girlfriends this day and brunch this day, and then I DoorDash with my partner another day, all of those expenses add up."

Look at money as "a tool to enhance your values and your experiences," Howard says.

Think deeply about your values and see if they are reflected in your spending, she says. If costly activities like going out to dinner or traveling with friends are important to you, you may have to make cuts in other areas of your life in order to prioritize them.

Outside of making budget adjustments to allow for more social spending, Howard also recommends finding cheap or free activities to do with your friends — something only 23% of millennials and Gen Zers say they prioritize, Ally found.

"What you really want is the experience. What you really want is the time with your friend," Howard says. "[We need to] really get back to the basics of understanding that we need these friendships to increase our well-being … but we don't want to overspend to where we're getting into financial trouble."

Emmy is working on "adjusting the language with my friends" to suggest free or cheaper hangouts as she focuses on paying down her credit card debt.

However, it's been difficult to make the change because she was so comfortable spending money with her friends, and they don't know about the level of debt she's dealing with, she says.

"I can confidently say that they would not judge me if they knew what I was doing, but I still just [have] the fear of being perceived by the people that you love," she says.

That kind of shame is common, Howard says, and can contribute to continued overspending. She recommends trying to identify where the feeling is coming from so you can better understand why you're inclined to say "yes" to things you may not be able to afford. It's a money mindset that often stems from how you were raised or something that happened in your early years, Howard says.

"Until you really connect that past to the present, you tend to do those things over and over again, which will show up not only in how you spend on yourself, but also in how you spend in your relationships with friends and family," she says.

If you're struggling to figure out how to better manage your money, consider working with a professional like a certified financial planner or a financial therapist who can offer guidance on your specific situation.

President Donald Trump suddenly has a chance to fill an opening at the Federal Reserve earlier than expected, after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler announced her resignation Friday. 

It may also force him to pick the next Fed chair months sooner than he'd anticipated.

In this article

Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday reported a small decline in second-quarter operating earnings as Warren Buffett's conglomerate warns of negative impacts from steep U.S. tariffs.

Berkshire's operating profit — those from the company's wholly owned businesses including insurance and railroads — dipped 4% year over year to $11.16 billion in the second quarter. The results were impacted by a decline in insurance underwriting, while railroad, energy, manufacturing, service and retailing all saw higher profits from a year ago.

The Omaha-based conglomerate once again issued a stern warning of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the potential impact on its various businesses.

"The pace of changes in these events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first six months of 2025," Berkshire said in its earnings report. "Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events."

"It is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences on most, if not all, of our operating businesses, as well as on our investments in equity securities, which could significantly affect our future results," it said.

Buffett's cash hoard of $344.1 billion remained near a record high, though slightly lower than the $347 billion level at the end of March. Berkshire was a net seller of stocks for a 11th quarter in a row, dumping $4.5 billion in equities in the first six months of 2025.

The conglomerate also didn't repurchase any stock in the first half of 2025 even as shares declined more than 10% from a record high.

Berkshire wrote down a loss of $3.8 billion from its Kraft Heinz stake, a longtime underperformer for the conglomerate. The consumer goods giant has been eyeing a spinoff of its grocery business. Two Berkshire executives resigned as directors from Kraft Heinz's board in May.

This is the first earnings report since the 94-year-old Buffett announced that he's stepping down as CEO at the end of 2025. Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice-chairman of non-insurance operations, is set to take over as CEO, while Buffett will remain as chairman of Berkshire's board.

It's far from finished but the new, $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at John F. Kennedy International Airport is taking shape. Its first phase is slated to open in mid-2026.

It will replace the current terminal, which opened in 1998.

The terminal, which will be JFK's largest, is now weathertight. Winding baggage conveyor belt structures have been installed, and you can make out future ticket counters, where customers flying carriers like Turkish Airlines, Air New Zealand, Etihad Airways, Air China, Taiwan's China Airlines and others will set down their luggage and show their passports to ticket agents.

The terminal — set to be roughly the size of the two new LaGuardia Airport terminals that opened in the past decade combined — will be dedicated solely to international travelers, which the developers said is key to the design.

"From the very first pen to paper … we had the international customer in mind," Jennifer Aument, CEO of the New Terminal One, the company developing the project, said at a press conference at the airport last month.

CNBC and other media got a look at the construction progress, led by Aument, in early July as part of what the company said will likely be among the last hardhat tours of the facility before opening day.

The project is part of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's $19 billion overhaul of JFK. In addition to Terminal 1, the current Terminal 7, currently home to Alaska Airlines and Ireland's Aer Lingus, will be knocked down for a new Terminal 6, whose first gates are set to open next year. LaGuardia Airport's revamp, in comparison, was about $8 billion.

As air traffic grows, airports around the country are racing to replace aging infrastructure.

U.S. airports need at least $173.9 billion for infrastructure upgrades from this year through 2029, according to a report earlier this year by the Airport Council International-North America.

"These investments – averaging nearly $35 billion annually – are essential to accommodate airlines and passengers, improve operational efficiency, elevate service quality and customer experience, and fulfill airport resiliency needs," it said.

The new JFK Terminal 1 is set to open around the start of the 2026 World Cup, when some games will be held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, about 30 miles away.

More than half of the airlines at JFK are changing terminals in the coming years because of the construction, Aument said.

One thing she pointed to with the new design: "a terminal flooded with light." That means no basement customs lines.

The departures hall, security lanes and customs will be on the same level of the three-floor terminal, which features a wall of slanted windows. Its design, led by architecture firm Gensler, is supposed to conjure the image of a butterfly, with the body splitting the terminal down the middle.

The AirTrain, which connects the airport's terminals and parking lots with train stations in Queens, is already running through the construction site and will stop at the terminal when the facility opens.

JFK's overhaul also includes roadway improvements around the airport, where traffic has crawled around the biggest hub in the region for years.

Terminal 1's mid-2026 open will include the departure and arrival areas and the first 14 gates, all capable of receiving wide-body aircraft that are used for long-haul flights, and will have a capacity for 14 million passengers a year.

There will be 23 gates — 22 wide-body gates and one narrow-body gate — for planes like an Airbus A320 or a Boeing 737s — when the rest of the project is complete, currently scheduled for 2030.

The final version of Terminal 1 will also have more than 300,000 square feet of dining, retail, lounge and recreational space, with more than half, 180,000 square feet, just for retail and dining.

Aument said the airport will be the only one in the U.S. with a cash-and-carry duty-free shopping. Generally, customers will make duty-free purchases that are then returned to them before they board their flights, but in this format, they can take them right away.

The new terminal will also have its own microgrid, with solar panels on the roof, that the developer said will enable the facility to have "full resiliency and maintenance of 100% [of the terminal's] operations in the event of power disruptions."

Business: Equinix is a real estate investment trust and operator of 270 data centers in 75 metro areas around the globe, providing carrier-neutral collocation and interconnection services to networks, cloud providers, enterprises and hyperscalers. The company's platform combines a global footprint of International Business Exchange (IBX) and xScale data centers that support a customer's need to implement, operate and maintain its collocated deployments. Equinix's data centers are primarily located in key end-user markets in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions.

Activist Commentary: Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor. The firm's team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms, engineers and operating partners – former technology CEOs and COOs. When evaluating an investment, the firm also hires specialty and general management consultants, expert cost analysts and industry specialists. Elliott often watches companies for many years before investing and have an extensive stable of impressive board candidates. Elliott has historically focused on strategic activism in the technology sector and has been very successful with that strategy. However, over the past several years its activism group has grown. The firm has been doing a lot more governance-oriented activism and creating value from a board level at a much larger breadth of companies.

Elliott has taken a position in Equinix.

Equinix is a REIT and operator of 270 data centers in 75 metro areas around the globe, providing carrier-neutral collocation and interconnection services to networks, cloud providers, enterprises and hyperscalers. Companies are increasingly relying on data, and the most efficient solution has been utilizing cloud services such as Equinix. The high costs associated with building and maintaining in-house data centers combined with fluctuating data needs allows colocation companies like Equinix to thrive. Colocation data centers allow users to rent out space for their hardware, rather than using their own space for this purpose. Within that market, Equinix has differentiated through their globally interconnected data centers located near top end-user markets, making its offerings sticky for data providers. Despite this, between June 24 and June 26, Equinix's share price fell 17.75%. This drop was in response to the company's Analyst Day, where Equinix revealed higher-than-expected capital expenditures of $3.3 billion for 2025 and $4 billion to $5 billion annual from 2026 to 2029 as well as a downgraded forecast for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) to 5% to 9%. Previously, it was a range of 7% to 10%.

This increase in capex and drop in AFFO spooked inexperienced and short-term investors, but this was an opportunity for experienced long-term investors like Elliott Investment Management, which announced that it has increased its position in Equinix since it originally disclosed a 0.15% position in the company in the firm's last 13F. It is important to note that Elliott has tremendous experience with data centers. Everyone knows Elliott as one of the most prolific activist investors today, but what sets the firm apart here is its experience as an investor, director and owner/operator of data center businesses. Elliott ran an activist campaign at data center operator Switch in 2021, where the investor settled for a board seat for Elliott senior portfolio manager Jason Genrich. The firm ultimately exited Switch via a sale with a 48.33% return versus -14.97% from the Russell 2000 over the same period. But more important is Elliott's experience and perspective as an owner and operator of UK-based Ark Data Centers since 2012. This not only gives the firm unique experience but more of a shared perspective with management that could be welcoming of more of an amicable relationship here.

So, when the market saw the capex as a drain on cash flow that will not pay off for two to three years while the data centers are being built and leased, investors like Elliott saw it as a response to increased demand. Equinix has had record bookings from the tailwinds of artificial intelligence and hyperscaler growth over the past few quarters. With a 5% cost of capital, capex that will yield a 20% to 30% return is great for the long-term prospects of the company. Accordingly, AFFO is expected to drop as low as 5% next year, which scares short-term and less-knowledgeable investors. But as the capex is deployed, it will rise to 8% for the next three years and eventually go back up to 9%. That will happen without any help from Elliott. But there are ways that Elliott can use its knowledge of the industry and experience as an activist and operator to expedite and amplify those returns. First, Equinix could better communicate its plans to the market. Given the reaction to the company's Analyst Day, Equinix could clearly benefit from improved market communications around its capex plan, AI strategy and long-term growth forecasts. Specifically, while Equinix doesn't host AI model training, it has a unique opportunity to play a central role in AI inferencing – or deploying AI models to end users. As AI matures, the demand for inferencing will increase, and Equinix is well positioned to benefit as the largest third-party data center provider in the world with deeply interconnected datacenters in key end-user markets. There are also opportunities for the company to optimize its cost structure and lower interest expenses. Management has already taken certain steps in this direction and are targeting margin growth of 300 basis points from 49% to 52% by 2029 – the highest target ever set by the company. However, this is still an arguably conservative estimate, as many peers, including its closest peer, Digital Reality Trust (DRL), have higher margins than that. Additionally, a little financial engineering could decrease the company's interest rate paid and improve on the margin Equinix's AFFO per-share growth.

Historically, Equinix has commanded a premium multiple, and its share performance has moved almost in line with DRL. However, since its Analyst Day, Equinix's returns have underperformed DRL by approximately 11 percentage points, and the company now trades at a slightly discounted 24-times enterprise value/EBITDA compared to 29-times for DRL. The company is on the right path but could use a little help from an experienced investor like Elliott in executing its plan and communicating it to the market. Elliott could do this as an active shareholder or with a board seat. Because of the firm's industry experience and similar perspective to management, we would not be surprised to see it invited on to the board before the next annual meeting in May 2026.

Southwest Airlines, once known for its first-come, first-served approach to boarding and seating, on Tuesday began selling its first tickets with assigned seats. That change — and with it, new boarding groups — goes into effect for flights in late January.

The move brings Southwest more in line with other major carriers, where travelers need to weigh the value of paying for an early-boarding upgrade.

"The number one reason to buy the early boarding upgrade is if you have a carry-on for the overhead bin," said Sara Wilcox, an advisor at Fora Travel, a travel agency in New York City.

Priority boarding is "basically the race to get our carry-on suitcases in the overhead bins," said Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry market research and advisory firm.

By law, individuals with disabilities who require special assistance must have the opportunity to board a flight first. Depending on an airline's policy, other groups like active military members and families with young children may also be offered early boarding.

Beyond that, while the boarding process varies by airline, your spot among boarding groups will generally depend on your status with the airline and the kind of airfare you booked, experts say.

Individuals with elite airline status are typically among the first boarding groups, Harteveldt said. If you don't have status and you bought a discounted or restricted coach fare, expect to be among the last to board. 

If you fit an airline's early boarding criteria, you might not need to pay for the perk.

Travelers can sometimes buy early boarding as an add-on, either when you buy the flight or as your travel date approaches. Sometimes it's bundled with other extras, too.

The cost of the add-on depends on the airline, and in some cases, how long the flight is, according to Sally French, a travel expert at NerdWallet.

For instance, the priority boarding add-on through United Airlines costs a flat rate of $24 per person.

"If overhead space is important to you, you do need to pay for priority boarding," said French.

There are different ways to move up the boarding group ladder. Applying for and using an airline's travel credit card can help you move closer to elite status, Harteveldt said. 

Such cards typically include other perks like free or heavily discounted checked baggage fees. Before you apply, make sure to read and understand the card's terms and conditions, as some charge high annual fees.

Remember that simply having the card is generally not enough to get the early-boarding benefits. You get the perk when you use the card to book that ticket.

Another way to board earlier is by booking a premium economy or main economy airfare, said French. 

Doing so typically allows you to book a specific seat, and "you're also bumped up in an early boarding position," she said.

Premium economy "is a step up from economy," but is not as costly as first or business class, according to Skyscanner, a travel site. In addition to more legroom, wider seats and more recline, these seats offer priority services for check-in and boarding.

But this is an expensive way to get on the plane sooner. Price-wise, a premium economy fare will likely be over 50% less expensive than a business class fare, but is at least 30% more expensive than standard economy, per Skyscanner.

If you have enough points or miles with an airline, you might be able to upgrade from economy to premium economy, per Skyscanner.

While "its not the worst use ever," remember that you might not get more than one cent per mile, said Stella Shon, a senior features editor at UpgradedPoints, a travel site.

"Cash upgrades are where you get the most value," she said. If not, assess where your points and miles will be the most valuable to you.

While paying to pick a seat can help you get a better boarding group, especially if you're willing to pay for an extra legroom seat, you can forgo it. NerdWallet's French said that passengers should not feel obligated to pay the added cost for early boarding.

If you simply paid for a flight — with or without seat reservations — the airline will assign a seat for you.

You're just more likely to be placed in a middle seat towards the back of the plane, as well as being among the last passengers to board, she said. 

"Just hope by the time you board there's space in the overhead bin," said Harteveldt.

Pierre Andurand

Famed oil trader Pierre Andurand has pulled back from a bullish bet on cocoa after a series of mistimed trades led to deep losses, according to a letter sent to investors that was seen by Bloomberg. 

The gyrations underscore the risk for fund managers that drift away from their core expertise into other markets that carry unfamiliar risks. Andurand, whose main fund was down over 57% through the end of June, began trading cocoa in early 2024 after more than a decade focused primarily on oil.

Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has reiterated his bearish short-term stance on Ethereum (ETH), highlighting signs of market correction that he first flagged last week.

In a new chart analysis, van de Poppe points to a clear bearish divergence on the lower timeframes (LTF), signaling a likely downward move for ETH after its recent rally toward $4,000.



According to the analyst, the primary bounce zone lies near $3,300, a level where he estimates a 70% chance of recovery. However, if macro or geopolitical events intensify risk-off sentiment, he expects a deeper retracement into the $3,000–$3,100 range—which he calls “the best entry of the second half of the year.”

The chart reinforces this view, showing divergence on the RSI alongside clear loss of momentum. Two key support blocks are outlined, with the lower block seen as a high-probability accumulation zone. The wider market appears to be entering a cautious phase, and van de Poppe suggests that ETH's drop could offer a compelling opportunity for mid- to long-term bulls.

This view contrasts with other analysts like Mike Novogratz, who still believe Ethereum may finish the year near $4,000. For now, however, van de Poppe warns that traders should prepare for further volatility and monitor technical levels closely.







A prominent market signal has just appeared on the Ethereum vs Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) chart, and traders are taking notice.

Crypto billionaire and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has pushed back against bearish Ethereum sentiment, forecasting a potential breakout toward $4,000 by the end of 2025.

Ethena (ENA) saw a sharp 11.58% daily decline, trading at $0.5413, as high-profile selling and weakening technicals spooked investors.

A new wave of micro-cap altcoins is catching fire as momentum rotates back into riskier plays.

COTI, a privacy-focused Ethereum-based protocol, has joined the Tokenized Asset Coalition (TAC), a group of Web3 and traditional finance leaders aiming to tokenize over $1 trillion in real-world assets (RWAs) on public blockchains. This collaboration marks a strategic shift for COTI, expanding its role from a payment-focused Layer 1 blockchain to a foundational infrastructure player in the tokenized finance ecosystem. The TAC includes major names such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Circle, Coinbase, Fidelity, and Stellar [1].

The TAC was established to connect traditional finance with Web3 and promote the adoption of tokenized assets, including real estate, bonds, and commodities. Its goals include advancing clearer regulations, improving interoperability, and ensuring strong privacy protections for institutional participants. COTI's inclusion is driven by its “Privacy-on-Demand” technology, which uses advanced cryptography to maintain transaction privacy by default while enabling selective transparency for audits [2].

COTI's contribution to the TAC is centered around its COTI V2, a Layer 2 solution designed to support financial institutions and enterprises in managing tokenized assets with enhanced security, scalability, and compliance. This move positions COTI as a key player in the development of institutional-grade infrastructure for tokenized assets, with a focus on real-world use cases such as real estate and commodities [3].

The TAC's broader mission includes accelerating the digitization of assets through collaboration, open-source development, and standardization. COTI's background in decentralized payment networks and privacy layers makes it a valuable addition to the coalition, with the potential to lead pilot programs and tools aimed at simplifying asset digitization [4].

The coalition's ambition to tokenize $1 trillion in assets is gaining momentum, with early projects in tokenized bonds and real estate portfolios already in progress. The World Economic Forum has estimated that 10% of global GDP could be stored on blockchain by 2027, underscoring the transformative potential of this initiative. COTI's membership places the project at the forefront of this transition, offering opportunities to shape how assets are digitized and managed in a decentralized environment [5].

Regulatory clarity remains a key enabler for the adoption of tokenized assets. Jurisdictions such as Singapore, the UAE, and the EU are actively developing frameworks to support compliant tokenization, creating a favorable environment for projects like COTI to scale. The convergence of legal frameworks and infrastructure like COTI V2 is expected to drive broader institutional adoption of tokenized finance [6].

COTI's partnership with the TAC is more than a collaboration—it is a strategic step toward becoming a foundational layer in the tokenized economy. With its emphasis on privacy, compliance, and interoperability, COTI is well-positioned to lead in the next phase of blockchain adoption. As the trillion-dollar vision of tokenized assets moves closer to reality, COTI's role in this ecosystem is likely to have long-term implications for the future of global finance [7].

 ZachXBT named some sponsors of Token2049 as sketchy. While these coins may have hype-fueled pumps to cult-like followings, they may have no real utility. 

Crypto investigator ZachXBT criticized Token2049 for poor sponsor vetting, warning that platinum sponsorships don't equate to legitimacy. Several sponsors he flagged turned out to have shady records.

JPEX and HyperVerse used event sponsorships to project credibility. Both later collapsed under fraud investigations, causing billions in investor losses and arrests.

Red flags include anonymous teams, low liquidity, overhyped marketing, poor tokenomics and listings only on obscure exchanges. 

What drives these coins isn't innovation but speculation, influencer buzz and cult-like followings, highlighting how unpredictability fuels their survival.

In the unpredictable cryptocurrency market, certain digital assets continue to exist despite facing controversies, significant price drops or lacking substantial underlying value. Though flagged as shady coins, they continue drawing considerable interest from dedicated followers. This sustained engagement is often driven by speculative excitement, strong community support and the allure of rapid profits.

ZachXBT, a well-known crypto sleuth, made some observations via his Telegram channel on a few sponsors of Token2049, a major crypto event. He felt the organizers of such events do little due diligence on their sponsors and that a project being a platinum sponsor doesn't increase credibility. He went on posting on his channel about sketchy Token2049 sponsors.

This article explores why some coins demonstrate a remarkable persistence despite being sketchy. It discusses five shady coins that continue drawing crypto investors and investigates the reasons for their longevity. It will also explain how newbie traders can protect themselves from such projects.

Despite weak fundamentals, many questionable cryptocurrencies persist in the market. While most fail quickly, some survive or briefly thrive due to specific factors. These include:

Speculative trading: Sharp price fluctuations attract risk-tolerant traders seeking quick profits.

Dedicated communities: Loyal supporters, often driven by memes or nostalgia, keep these projects alive.

Low market liquidity: Limited trading activity allows large investors or insiders to influence prices, drawing in speculators.

Periodic hype: Social media trends, influencer endorsements or unexpected news can temporarily boost interest in these coins.

Did you know? From “1,000x guaranteed returns” to “satellite-powered DeFi,” scammy projects often use flashy narratives to hook traders. When the claims are bold without evidence, coins are likely to be sketchy.

ZachXBT discussed a few sponsors of TOKEN2049, which persist within the unpredictable crypto market despite opaque operations. He mentioned the following coins as sketchy:

Origin: Launched by Gluwa in 2024-2025 and the title sponsor of Token2049, Spacecoin aims to be the world's first decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) powered by satellites. It claims its decentralized satellite network will provide global 5G internet to the 2.9 billion people who currently lack access, to connect the entire world.

Controversies: Onchain investigator ZachXBT labeled Spacecoin as “botted” and unreliable, questioning its legitimacy. While botted can be interpreted in many ways, none of the meanings is flattering.

Why questionable: There are concerns surrounding Spacecoin. For example, in June 2022, it claimed to have undergone several months of refinement and smart contract auditing, without naming a specific audit firm, and no public report was provided. Moreover, there is no verifiable documentation regarding the launch of satellites. 

What sustains it: Strong promotional efforts, event sponsorships and speculative interest, along with a dedicated community and media attention, keep limited trading activity alive.

Origin: JuCoin, previously Jubi, is a Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange established in 2013, with its JU token and CeDeFi services expanding its ecosystem by 2025. 

Controversies: ZachXBT flagged JuCoin as a “sketchy” platinum sponsor of Token2049, citing a history of ownership changes, rebrands and regulatory pivots.

Why questionable: JuCoin lacks regulation in major markets, though it has applied for a license in Taiwan. The project is not regulated in the US, EU or other major markets having robust regulatory standards, apart from Singapore's Monetary Authority.

What sustains it: Speculation around the token and an aggressive marketing drive for trading activity. 

Origin: Weex is a Singapore-registered crypto futures platform operating since 2018 and offering anonymous trading and bonus incentives. 

Controversies: Weex is not regulated by any financial authority with strict standards.

Why questionable: There have been social media posts complaining of unusual behavior on the exchange, including frozen accounts and unexpected Know Your Customer (KYC) issues.

What sustains it: The appeal of futures trading, speculative interest in high-yield opportunities maintain trading volume and aggressive promotions keep driving it.

Origin: Listed as a platinum sponsor at Token2049, DWF is a sketchy market maker, according to ZachXBT, that conducts trades on over 60 exchanges and is engaged in high-profile investments. It has little publicly available information about its background or team. 

Controversies: It may have been included on ZachXBT's list due to prior accusations of wash trading as a market maker and a more recent allegation of a “rug pull” from Vite Labs.

Why questionable: On March 27, 2025, Vite Labs stated its development funds were “rugged” by DWF's market-making services and Binance's decision to delist the project. 

What sustains it: Recognition from conference sponsorships, promotional narratives and speculative hype around listings keeps minimal trading interest alive.

Origin: Founded around 2021, Butunix is a crypto exchange registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. It offers spot and futures trading. 

Controversies: Labeled “sketchy” by ZachXBT probably for drawing the scrutiny of South Korea's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which is part of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), for providing services to Korean customers without the required registration.

Why questionable: Limited regulatory oversight and an unclear corporate structure undermine trust. 

What sustains it: Trading volume is driven by listings of niche altcoins, bonus incentives and speculative traders seeking quick profits.

Did you know? Firms like CertiK or Hacken audit legitimate smart contracts. Many sketchy coins claim “internal audits” or simply skip them entirely, exposing users to bugs or exploits.

Here are two cases when shady crypto projects became sponsors of prominent events, only to use the credibility they had earned to dupe investors:

At Token2049 in Singapore, JPEX contributed $70,000 to become a platinum sponsor, using it to appear legitimate. However, after Hong Kong regulators issued warnings in mid-September 2023, JPEX abandoned its booth and disappeared from the event by the second day. 

Shortly afterward, the exchange halted withdrawals, charged excessive fees of 999 USDt (USDT) on 1,000-USDT transactions and faced thousands of complaints accusing it of fraud and operating without a license. Authorities arrested several individuals, froze assets and estimated investor losses at over 1 billion Hong Kong dollars.

HyperVerse hosted lavish promotional events, including a $3,500-per-person party on a $40-million Seafair megayacht in Florida, featuring rapper Rick Ross, to present itself as a prestigious crypto and metaverse platform. It claimed to be developing a “perfect virtual world” and promised daily returns to attract investors worldwide. 

However, US regulators later revealed that HyperVerse was a Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of approximately $1.89 billion. Key promoters, including Steven Lewis and Brenda Chunga, were charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for running a fraudulent pyramid scheme.

Did you know? Some shady coins use bots to create fake trading volume and trick platforms into ranking them higher. You need to research well before investing.

For those new to cryptocurrency, identifying suspicious coins early can prevent financial loss and stress. Here are key factors to consider when evaluating a cryptocurrency: 

Research the team and project history: Look for warning signs such as anonymous founders, frequent rebrands or a lack of reputable partnerships. 

Evaluate marketing tactics: Be cautious of coins promoted through aggressive marketing, including meme-driven social media, paid influencer endorsements or unrealistic claims like “guaranteed 100x returns.” 

Assess liquidity: Coins with low trading volume or concentrated ownership are prone to price manipulation by insiders. 

Examine tokenomics: Watch for red flags like excessively large token supply, unclear token-burning processes or allocations heavily favoring insiders, which may indicate risks of price manipulation or scams. 

Verify exchange listings: Coins listed only on lesser-known or poorly regulated exchanges may lack transparency. 

Investigate past issues: Research any history of problems, such as halted withdrawals, scams or regulatory warnings. 

Use reliable tools and diversify: Avoid relying solely on influencers or trending charts. Instead, use onchain analytics to monitor wallet activity and diversify investments to limit risk.

Shady coins often act as warnings rather than genuine investment opportunities. They attract investors with promises of massive profits, but they typically hide manipulative schemes, unclear team backgrounds and weak fundamentals. Despite frequent market crashes or controversies, these coins persist due to the unpredictable, community-driven nature of crypto markets.

XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum have all soared over the trailing-three-year period, with the latter two benefiting from public companies establishing digital asset reserves.

Strategy holds nearly 2.9% of all Bitcoin that'll ever be mined, while Bitmine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming have begun piling into Ethereum.

Despite XRP's abundant near-term catalysts, Ripple's bridge currency lacks the standalone value that would make it desirable for public companies seeking digital asset reserves.

10 stocks we like better than XRP ›

Though artificial intelligence (AI) has been the hottest trend on Wall Street for the better part of the last three years, it's not the only trend that's turning heads and raising eyebrows. The emergence of cryptocurrency treasury strategies has put some serious pep in the steps of the world's leading digital assets.

Over the trailing-three-year period, as of this writing in the early evening on July 28, XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), the third-largest digital currency by market value, had risen just shy of 800%. Meanwhile, respective No.'s 1 and 2 in market value, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), have galloped higher by 421% and 136%.

Numerous factors have played a role in the outperformance of this crypto trio, including the election of Donald Trump, whose administration has taken a favorable view of the digital asset landscape, as well as positive sentiment in the investment arena. With two of Wall Street's three major stock indexes blasting to new highs, investor confidence is soaring in the emotion-driven digital currency space.

But there's no mistaking the demand-side boost Bitcoin and Ethereum have enjoyed from the adoption of corporate treasury strategies involving these tokens. The question is: Will Ripple's XRP be the next target for corporate America?

Instead of carrying cash or other marketable securities on their balance sheets, some businesses are choosing to use their cash, or issuing stock and/or some form of debt, to purchase digital assets.

The concept of the Bitcoin treasury strategy kicked off with Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)(formerly known as MicroStrategy), which began purchasing Bitcoin to hold on its balance sheet in August 2020. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor has been adamant for years that Bitcoin is a superior form of money, especially when compared to the U.S. dollar, which devalues over time as the U.S. money supply increases.

Strategy, which anointed itself the first "Bitcoin Treasury Company," has spent about $43.6 billion to acquire 607,770 Bitcoin. Since only 21 million Bitcoin are set to be mined, Strategy owns close to 2.9% of the lifetime supply. The perception of a fixed peak circulating supply is why Bitcoin is typically viewed as a phenomenal inflationary hedge.

A number of companies have followed in Strategy's footsteps by adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, many of which are micro- and small-cap businesses that are attempting to drum up hype for their respective companies.

Recently, a handful of public companies began shifting their attention to Ethereum. Whereas Bitcoin's top-selling point is its perceived scarcity, Ethereum's is its functionality. Ethereum's blockchain is the backbone for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and decentralized finance that removes the middleman from the equation.

Two notable public companies have dived head-first into the Ethereum treasury strategy: Bitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSEMKT: BMNR) and SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET). Bitmine, whose board is chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, holds 566,776 Ether (ETH), with a goal of gobbling up 5% of the circulating supply. Meanwhile, SharpLink holds 360,807 ETH, worth about $1.36 billion at the time of this writing.

Considering XRP's ninefold ascent over the last three years, as well as its numerous near-term catalysts, it would appear there's certainly momentum, on paper, for public companies to add XRP tokens to their balance sheet. But if investors dig below the surface-scratching headlines, they'll discover it's unlikely that XRP will be a sought-after digital asset for corporate America.

There's no question that XRP has enjoyed a stellar run-up. President Trump's November victory cleared the way for the eventual resignation of now-former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, who was a constant thorn in the side of digital currencies. Gensler's exit led to the resolution of litigation clouds that had hung over Ripple, whose payment network leans on XRP as its bridge currency for cross-border transactions.

Additionally, there's plenty of excitement surrounding the possibility of the SEC approving a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). A spot XRP ETF would likely follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin and Ethereum and see sizable cash inflows in the weeks and months following approval.

XRP investors also remain optimistic about the ongoing adoption of XRP as a cross-border payment intermediary. North of 300 financial institutions are utilizing RippleNet to facilitate transactions that can validate and settle in three to five seconds. If adoption continues, Ripple's payment network could lead to a demand surge in XRP tokens.

But herein lies the rub.

While XRP has been firing on all cylinders in recent months due to a confluence of positive factors, it lacks the perceived stand-alone value brough to the table by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Whereas Bitcoin has its limited supply as a catalyst, and Ethereum stands tall as the premier smart contracts blockchain, XRP is simply a bridge currency for Ripple's payment network.

What's more, XRP isn't the only bridge available to financial institutions using Ripple's cross-border payment solutions. In select overseas markets, financial institutions aren't using XRP at all to complete transactions.

Furthermore, the adoption rate for Ripple's payment platform and XRP remains relatively tame. Though having more than 300 financial institutions using RippleNet globally sounds great on paper, it's a far cry from the 11,000-plus financial institutions relying on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, which has been the standard for cross-border payments spanning decades.

Although one publicly traded micro-cap company with a market cap of less than $2 million recently unveiled an up-to-$20 million XRP treasury reserve strategy, investors shouldn't expect XRP to be actively held for any sustained period by nonfinancial (or financial-based) public companies.

A prominent market signal has just appeared on the Ethereum vs Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) chart, and traders are taking notice.

According to technical analyst Merlijn The Trader, Ethereum has printed a MACD bullish crossover, historically marking the bottom of the ETH/BTC cycle—a signal that has preceded major altcoin rallies in past crypto cycles.



The chart highlights that this rare signal has only occurred twice before in the last decade—once in 2017 and again in 2020, each time followed by explosive altcoin seasons. In both cases, alternative cryptocurrencies surged between 5x to 20x in just a few months. With the latest crossover now confirmed on the weekly chart, Merlijn calls this a “historic signal” that “only shows up once per cycle.”

The ETH/BTC ratio has spent months in a downward trend, recently reaching a structural low similar to those seen before the 2017 and 2021 altseasons. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), a momentum-based indicator, has now flipped bullish, reinforcing the argument that Ethereum is regaining strength relative to Bitcoin.

While some traders remain cautious amid broader market volatility, others see this as a sign that the altcoin engine is warming up once again. If history repeats, this MACD crossover could mark the start of a new rotation into riskier altcoins—with Ethereum likely leading the charge.

For those watching the ETH/BTC pair closely, this might be the cycle-defining moment they've been waiting for.







Swissblock has issued a new market update, highlighting that the percentage of Bitcoin (BTC) supply currently in profit has dropped back to around 91%, down from unsustainably high levels flagged earlier in the week.

Crypto billionaire and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has pushed back against bearish Ethereum sentiment, forecasting a potential breakout toward $4,000 by the end of 2025.

Bitcoin dropped 2.1% in the past 24 hours, tumbling below $114,000 as a perfect storm of liquidations, macro fear, and technical breakdowns rattled crypto markets.

Ethena (ENA) saw a sharp 11.58% daily decline, trading at $0.5413, as high-profile selling and weakening technicals spooked investors.

Ethereum tumbled below $3,500 on August 2, pressured by a broad market sell-off and major whale activity, including a multimillion-dollar dump by BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes.

Analysts are watching key technical signals as oversold conditions begin to emerge, prompting speculation about whether a rebound is near—or if further losses lie ahead.

Ethereum (ETH) broke below the crucial $3,500 level in early August, wiping out recent gains and shaking investor confidence. The drop, which saw ETH decline over 4.6% in 24 hours, reflects broader crypto market exhaustion and a wave of risk-off sentiment across digital assets.

Ethereum dropped below $3,500 on August 2 as the market showed signs of fatigue and increased selling pressure. As Bitcoin also slipped 1.5% during the same window, many interpreted the move as part of a larger market-wide correction rather than a project-specific reaction.

Adding fuel to the bearish fire, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes offloaded over $13 million worth of Ethereum, Pepe (PEPE), and Ethena (ENA) tokens, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence.

In a series of coordinated moves, Hayes converted 2,095 Wrapped ETH into Ethereum and sent 2,373 ETH (worth roughly $8.3 million) to Binance and B2C2, a UK-based trading platform. He also liquidated his entire ENA holdings—over 7.7 million tokens—and transferred 38.86 billion PEPE tokens to Cumberland DRW.

Hayes' actions follow similar moves by other major ETH holders. On-chain data platform Lookonchain revealed that wallet address “0x3c9E” deposited over 26,000 ETH (valued at $93.6 million) to major exchanges including Binance, OKX, Kraken, and Bybit in the past 48 hours, suggesting more whales are preparing to sell.

Despite the heavy selling, some analysts believe Ethereum may be approaching a bottom. Ethereum's Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD are signaling oversold conditions, historically a precursor to short-term reversals.

Ethereum appears to be in an oversold condition, which could signal a potential market reversal as key technical indicators point to a shift in momentum.

Exchange data further supports the view that many investors are moving ETH off exchanges—possibly into cold storage. Net outflows from centralized platforms on August 1 reached $113 million, a sign that holders might be waiting out the volatility.

Michaël van de Poppe, a widely followed crypto analyst, pointed out that continued withdrawals are “putting downward pressure” on both Ethereum and Bitcoin, but also serve as a sign of investor caution rather than panic.

According to the analyst @bl_ockchain on X, Ethereum recently tested a key resistance area around $4,000 before pulling back. “$ETH needs a strong move above to flip it into support,” he wrote. The token briefly traded at $3,607, just below its breakout level, indicating a hesitation to continue the upward trend.

The Ethereum chart shows a potential long-term breakout from descending resistance, but bulls need to reclaim momentum to confirm the move. Until then, many traders see the current zone as a neutral territory—neither fully bullish nor decisively bearish.

While whales like Hayes are reducing exposure, institutional investors appear to be taking the opposite side of the trade. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming added 77,210 ETH (worth $295 million) to its corporate treasury in late July, now holding a staggering 438,017 ETH valued at over $1.6 billion.

Lookonchain also observed that 12 new wallets have purchased 808,347 ETH (around $2.85 billion) since July 9. This includes a single wallet acquiring 16,496 ETH from Galaxy Digital's OTC desk, suggesting confidence in Ethereum's long-term value despite short-term volatility.

Despite the current correction, some analysts maintain a bullish long-term view. Crypto chartist @IamCryptoWolf shared a roadmap suggesting Ethereum could hit $8,000 as a conservative target, and potentially $13,000 or higher by Q4 2025.

He noted two likely paths: a sharp rise to all-time highs, followed by a 20–25% “washout,” before the real rally begins. “This is the roadmap,” he tweeted, adding that Q4 could be Ethereum's breakout season if macro and ETF tailwinds hold.

The Ethereum sell-off comes amid a confluence of bearish catalysts: whale exits, technical rejection at $4K, and broader risk aversion. Yet, signs of accumulation, institutional confidence, and oversold conditions suggest the market could soon stabilize.

Whether Ethereum holds above its current support near $3,400–$3,500 will be critical in the days ahead. A decisive rebound above $3,800 could reignite bullish sentiment, while further downside might test the $3,200–$3,300 zone.

For now, the market waits—watching price levels, tracking whale movements, and scanning technical indicators for signs of a turnaround.

Chainlink has received formal recognition from the White House as a foundational technology in the digital asset ecosystem.

According to the recently published Digital Asset Report under Executive Order 14178, Chainlink and blockchain oracles are now considered essential for powering on-chain financial services, particularly in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-chain applications, and enterprise-grade systems.

Chainlink and oracles are key technologies, according to the new @WhiteHouse Digital Asset Report.

The report highlights how oracles serve as bridges between blockchain networks and real-world data, enabling smart contracts to execute automatically based on external inputs such as asset prices, interest rates, and other off-chain events. Chainlink, as the industry's leading oracle network, is credited with enabling secure data feeds for smart contracts, supporting everything from lending protocols to decentralized insurance and tokenized assets.

Chainlink's infrastructure also supports cross-chain interoperability—a key requirement outlined in the White House's push to ensure digital financial systems remain open, competitive, and secure.

The document emphasizes that these oracle networks not only boost transparency and automation in DeFi but also enhance the operational efficiency of permissioned blockchain applications used by traditional financial institutions.

With this new federal spotlight, Chainlink's role in U.S. blockchain policy and innovation appears to be expanding rapidly. As regulators and agencies align on building safe and scalable digital frameworks, Chainlink stands out as a critical enabler of next-generation financial infrastructure.







Gate US, the American arm of global crypto heavyweight Gate Group, has officially rolled out its platform across the United States, bringing spot trading services to U.S.-based users.

The rise of cryptocurrency – particularly stablecoins – is challenging the longstanding dominance of Visa and Mastercard in the U.S. payment system.

The crypto market fell 1.5% over the past 24 hours, deepening a seven-day slump to 4.1%. A mix of institutional selling, extreme leverage, and macroeconomic spillovers from U.S. equities helped trigger the downturn.

Crypto markets saw a flurry of major developments this past week, from Ethereum's bold 10-year roadmap to new U.S. regulatory proposals and record ETF inflows.

In the ever-evolving crypto market, sub-$1 altcoins are stealing the spotlight, not just for their affordability but for the massive upside potential they bring to the table. As institutional inflows continue to flood Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), retail and mid-tier investors are increasingly hunting for undervalued tokens that could deliver the next big breakout. These low-cost cryptocurrencies often provide early-stage entry points, where small investments can translate into exponential gains during bullish cycles.

At the forefront of this movement is TAPZI, a presale GameFi token designed to redefine Web3 gaming with skill-based earning mechanics and sustainable tokenomics. Unlike luck-driven models, TAPZI focuses on competition, rewarding players for merit while ensuring long-term ecosystem balance.

This article reviews five of the best altcoins to buy now under $1 — Tapzi (TAPZI), Cardano (ADA), Hedera (HBAR), and COTI — comparing their growth potential to identify which one could emerge as the true dark horse in 2025.

Considering investing in altcoins this month? Here is the list of five best altcoins to buy now under $1 and how these tokens can build up a multi-billion-dollar portfolio.

Read on the detailed analysis for the above highlighted best altcoins to buy now under $1. These micro-chip coins will help you reap 1000x profits this year.

Overview:

TAPZI is more than just another GameFi project — it's a revolution in Web3 gaming. Designed to replace luck-driven, unsustainable models with skill-to-earn mechanics, TAPZI creates a gaming economy where real talent drives real rewards. It brings classic games like Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Rock-Paper-Scissors into the blockchain era, offering fast-paced, stake-based battles with a focus on merit, not chance.

Tokenomics:

The project has a fixed supply of 5 billion tokens, with 20% allocated to the presale. To protect investors, TAPZI employs anti-dump vesting and audited smart contracts, ensuring transparency and long-term ecosystem health.

Key Features:

Players can participate in kill-to-earn tournaments with peer-to-peer staking rewards, creating a self-sustaining prize pool without treasury subsidies. TAPZI offers two distinct modes: Practice Mode for onboarding and Competitive Mode for real-time earning. Its frictionless design allows gameplay across mobile and web without downloads or crypto setup hassles.

Why It Stands Out:

TAPZI solves three core GameFi challenges: inflated reward systems, luck-based mechanics, and complicated onboarding. Currently priced at $0.0035, the token offers early investors a rare opportunity for exponential growth.

Comparison: 

Unlike Cardano (ADA), which focuses on slow-and-steady ecosystem growth, or Hedera (HBAR), which caters to enterprises, TAPZI brings fast-paced, skill-driven earning to a massive global 1.5B-strong mobile gaming audience — making it one of the most exciting sub-$1 altcoins to watch in 2025.

Overview:

Cardano (ADA) is one of the most academically rigorous and research‑driven blockchain platforms in the market. Built on a foundation of peer‑reviewed research, Cardano focuses on sustainability, scalability, and interoperability, making it a top choice for developers and institutions seeking long‑term reliability.

Highlights:

Cardano's smart contract adoption has been steadily increasing, expanding its footprint in DeFi, NFTs, and real‑world applications. Its layered architecture enhances security while maintaining energy efficiency, which has made it a favorite among environmentally conscious investors. Trading at under $1, ADA continues to attract retail buyers looking for stability in a volatile market.

Comparison:

While ADA offers stability and institutional credibility, it lacks the explosive upside potential of early‑stage projects. TAPZI, in contrast, is positioned as a high‑growth presale GameFi token with short‑term upside potential that ADA, as a more mature asset, cannot match. For investors seeking both security and speculative growth, combining ADA's steady foundation with TAPZI's dynamic GameFi model creates a well‑balanced portfolio.

Overview:

Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is an enterprise‑grade network designed for high‑speed, low‑cost, and highly scalable applications. Unlike traditional blockchains, its Hashgraph consensus mechanism enables near‑instant finality and significantly reduces transaction costs, making it a go‑to choice for enterprise use cases.

Highlights:

HBAR's partnerships with Google, IBM, LG, and other Fortune 500 companies highlight its strong foothold in enterprise adoption. It's being used in tokenization, supply chain optimization, identity solutions, and financial applications, proving its utility beyond speculation. Priced at under $1, HBAR offers an appealing entry for investors seeking exposure to enterprise blockchain solutions with significant growth potential.

Comparison:

While HBAR dominates the enterprise blockchain sector, it lacks the consumer‑driven excitement of a project like TAPZI, which taps into the 1.5B‑strong mobile gaming market with a competitive, skill‑based earning model. For investors aiming to diversify, pairing HBAR's corporate‑grade stability with TAPZI's GameFi innovation can balance risk and reward.

Overview:

COTI is a payments‑oriented blockchain leveraging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to deliver fast, scalable, and low‑cost financial transactions. It's built to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems, creating seamless, real‑time payment solutions.

Highlights:

COTI has secured enterprise partnerships aimed at building white‑label payment solutions for fintech companies, e‑commerce platforms, and decentralized applications. With a sub‑$1 price, it provides a low‑cost entry point for investors seeking exposure to the future of Web3 payments. Its DAG infrastructure allows for high throughput and minimal fees, making it an attractive choice for businesses and users needing efficient settlement systems.

Comparison:

While COTI fills a niche in fintech, its growth is likely more gradual compared to the explosive, user‑driven potential of TAPZI. TAPZI's GameFi model, with peer‑to‑peer staking and skill‑based rewards, appeals to a much broader and more engaged audience, particularly within the rapidly growing Web3 gaming sector.

Overview:

BlockDAG (BDAG) blends Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with traditional blockchain infrastructure to deliver a scalable, lightning‑fast network designed for mass adoption. Its mission is simple: make crypto accessible to everyone, from everyday users to developers building the next wave of decentralized applications.

Highlights:

BDAG's X1 mobile app allows anyone to mine BDAG tokens directly from their smartphone, while the X10 hardware miner boosts mining capacity by up to 10x, making it appealing to both casual and professional miners. The project has already raised over $353 million in presale funding and boasts 4,500+ developers working on 300+ testnet projects, spanning AI, payments, and DeFi.

At its current presale price of $0.0016 (with a confirmed launch price of $0.05), BDAG offers early investors a compelling entry point with significant upside potential.

Comparison:

While TAPZI is reshaping GameFi for gamers, BlockDAG focuses on miners and builders, offering infrastructure for scalable applications. Its lower presale entry price makes it particularly appealing to ROI‑driven investors seeking multiples before launch.

When comparing these sub-$1 contenders, TAPZI clearly stands out for its early-stage entry point and fast-scaling GameFi model.

For risk-tolerant investors, TAPZI emerges as the dark horse, combining early presale growth, innovative tokenomics, and mass-market appeal that could outpace its peers.

Sub-$1 altcoins often deliver the most explosive gains during bullish market phases. Their lower price points make them accessible to a broader range of investors while offering significant room for appreciation as adoption grows. History has shown that early investments in undervalued tokens can lead to life-changing returns, especially when those tokens are backed by strong fundamentals.

What sets these altcoins apart are their robust tokenomics, real-world use cases, and early-stage opportunities. For instance, presale projects like TAPZI not only provide bonus allocations and low entry costs, but also integrate audited smart contracts and anti-dump mechanisms to protect investors. Meanwhile, established players like ADA and HBAR bring stability, institutional partnerships, and proven ecosystems into the mix.

For any forward-thinking investor, a balanced approach is key, blending high-growth presale opportunities with long-term network plays. The question now is: which of these sub-$1 cryptos could become the next breakout success?

Sub-$1 altcoins remain a gateway to high-ROI opportunities, especially during a bullish market cycle. Among them, TAPZI shines brightest with its GameFi-first model, skill-to-earn economy, and low-barrier presale entry at just $0.0035. This positions it for exponential growth as the Web3 gaming sector accelerates.

That said, ADA, HBAR, COTI, and BDAG add diversity and balance to a well-structured portfolio, covering Layer-1 infrastructure, enterprise solutions, fintech, and mining ecosystems.

For those seeking the next breakout opportunity, TAPZI is the undisputed dark horse — a project combining sustainability, competitive gameplay, and real-world scalability.

Strategy (MSTR), the bitcoin-focused corporate entity formerly known as MicroStrategy, launched its Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC) late last month — an offering Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has described as the company's “iPhone moment.” 

The STRC preferred stock has already raised $2.5 billion, and a newly opened $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) program could extend its scale even further — offering high-yield dividends backed by bitcoin and designed to appeal to yield-seeking investors.

STRC (marketed as “Stretch”) is a variable-rate, perpetual preferred stock designed to deliver stable pricing, strong yield, and easy access for income-focused investors seeking indirect bitcoin exposure. The shares pay a monthly dividend—initially set at 9% annualized—based on a $100 par value. Strategy may adjust that dividend monthly, within rules meant to keep STRC trading close to its $100 target price.

Each share of STRC is overcollateralized with bitcoin at a ratio of roughly 5-to-1, meaning that for every dollar of STRC issued, Strategy holds approximately five dollars' worth of BTC. The security sits senior to other preferred stocks like STRD, STRK, and the firm's common equity, but remains junior to debt and the STRF preferred series.

Dividends are cumulative and compound if unpaid. Importantly, if any month's payment is missed, a dividend “stopper” activates — preventing payouts to junior securities until STRC is made whole. The stock can be redeemed at the issuer's option once listed on Nasdaq (which it now is), and it includes a fundamental change put right at liquidation value plus any accrued dividends.

The security is engineered to function like a high-yield savings instrument with bitcoin backing — without the volatility of direct crypto holdings or the duration risk of traditional preferreds.

The company's IPO of STRC raised approximately $2.5 billion through the issuance of 28 million shares priced at $90 each. The offering was announced on July 21 and closed on July 29. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including further bitcoin purchases and working capital.

The board of directors declared an initial monthly dividend of $0.80 per share, with payment scheduled for Aug. 31, 2025, to shareholders of record as of August 15.

Saylor described STRC as a clean, scalable instrument that solves the constraints of previous capital tools like convertible bonds and complex long-duration preferred shares. The product was designed to appeal not only to institutional allocators but also to yield-seeking retail investors.

On July 31, Strategy announced a new sales agreement allowing the company to issue up to $4.2 billion worth of STRC shares through an at-the-market (ATM) offering. This gives Strategy the ability to tap liquidity gradually, adjusting issuance based on market conditions and pricing.

Internal guidance suggests that Strategy intends to keep issuance within a narrow band — avoiding sales below $99 or above $101 (before fees), consistent with its target of maintaining a stable $100 trading price. The firm explicitly stated it does not plan to apply this discipline to its other preferred equity programs, reinforcing STRC's unique positioning.

The ATM program allows Strategy to meet capital needs flexibly, support its dividend policy, and scale BTC acquisitions further while preserving shareholder alignment.

Michael Saylor sees STRC not just as another capital-raising tool — but as a turning point in corporate finance. During Strategy's Q2 2025 earnings call on July 31, he called the product his firm's “iPhone moment,” comparing its potential to the kind of consumer breakthrough that redefined an entire industry.

At the heart of Saylor's vision is STRC's accessibility. Unlike Strategy's earlier instruments — such as STRK, STRF, and STRD — which he praised as innovative but too complex or volatile for mass adoption, STRC is designed to function more like a yield-enhanced savings account. “If I walk down the street and you ask a hundred people, ‘Do you want a high-yield bank account?' 99 out of 100 say yes,” he said, underscoring the simplicity of the pitch.

He believes STRC solves two core problems: it strips away long-term volatility by targeting short duration and low price fluctuation, and it offers a consistent premium over typical bank yields. “We've stripped down to a one-month duration and it pays 500 basis points above your bank account,” he said, describing the instrument's 9% variable monthly dividend.

Importantly, STRC is engineered to trade near par ($100), giving investors peace of mind — especially those sensitive to price swings. Saylor emphasized that previous products lost retail traction when their principal value fluctuated by 5–10%. In contrast, STRC's goal is to hold close to par even as bitcoin prices move, thanks to its heavy overcollateralization with BTC.

“If Stretch actually hits its par and it trades with low volatility, then you could, in theory, sell a hundred billion dollars of it, two hundred billion dollars of it,” he told analysts. That, he argued, would enable Strategy to massively scale its bitcoin holdings without selling any BTC — effectively using its treasury as collateral to monetize liquidity at retail scale.

In Saylor's view, this combination — simplicity, stability, and yield — is what makes STRC transformational. Just as the iPhone reimagined how users interacted with mobile computing, STRC could redefine how companies tap capital markets in a bitcoin-native way.

Saturday, yes, it's the best day of the week again to find the crypto to buy for now or next week.

Right now, the crypto market is seeing a bearish trend, with key players like Bitcoin and Ethereum facing price drops.

Bitcoin fell from $117k to $113 level, a 3.6% decline, while Ethereum slipped from $3,7k to $3,4k area, down 6.7%. Yet, market sentiment holds a bullish edge, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index showing “Greed” earlier this week with BTC reaching a high $119k, hinting at investor optimism.

Is “now” the best time to buy crypto?

EXPLORE: Best New Cryptocurrencies to Invest in 2025

Yesterday, $1,29 billion in liquidations was not all that bad. It could be just institutions shaking off weak hands, always happening.

Yes, tariffs and the Fed's failing to bring the rate down might affect it, but it could also be the reason for a shake-off. Just how institutions with big money play, taking advantage of the situation.

Now, here's the fact: Ethereum, the second-largest crypto, remains below its all-time high (ATH) of $4.7k this cycle, and could be the best one to buy.

Despite the dip, it is still recording positive developments. The Pectra upgrade has boosted scalability and cut transaction costs, which will definitely help with adoption. Ethereum is also still dominating DeFi and NFTs, with over 56% of DeFi's total value locked.

Institutional interest in Ethereum is also surging and not stoping. Spot ETH ETFs recorded strong inflows, including $18.27 million into BlackRock's ETHA end of July alone.

It's not a secret that institutional backing fuels crypto pump. Not to forget that most Analysts predict Ethereum to hit new ATHs in 2025, with estimates topping $6,500. It real, the dump could be a spring down before it coils up.

Tom Lee DOUBLES DOWN on $15k $ETH prediction

It's not just BTC and ETH; the general crypto adoption rate is still going at a rapid pace.

Who would have thought that Bitcoin would hit $120k this cycle? Even the Germans have sold 54K BTC at 59K, a $3.5 billion that should be at $7 billion today. Despite the storm, crypto always comes up stronger as it matures.

Ethereum, still shy of its ATH, and today, could be a strategic moment to invest before prices soar to new highs. Now, staying informed and keep an eye on the best crypto to buy could be the way to make big bank.

Following Tom Lee Prediction


 
				By  Akiyama Felix



Following Tom Lee's video on the above post, Ethereum might be the first one to bounce.
Tom Lee stated that institutional investors, particularly from Wall Street, are discreetly increasing their crypto holdings. He views today as a bullish time for crypto.
Lee is being optimistic, and he might be right. His Optimism contrasts with short-term bearish sentiments driven by factors like macroeconomic uncertainties or sell-offs.
As chairman of BitMine (a company transitioning from Bitcoin mining to an Ethereum treasury strategy), Lee is actively shaping corporate crypto adoption. His leadership role at BitMine shows his commitment to integrating crypto into traditional finance.
 
Like Lee said,

“Do not pray for an easy life; pray for the strength to endure a difficult one. ” – Bruce Lee

This could be what crypto traders are experiencing. But stay strong, because the storm might come to an end soon.
 
We trust in Lees.

Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan have agreed to deepen collaboration in crypto and blockchain innovation. According to reports, both countries also intend to depend on bilateral cooperation in aspects like blockchain technology and digital finance.

The collaboration was agreed at a high-level virtual meeting between Bilal Bin Saqib, the Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain in Pakistan, and Farkhat Aminov, Director of Kyrgyzstan's National Investment Agency.

During the meeting, both sides held detailed discussions on digital finance, regulatory frameworks, and blockchain innovation. They also discussed the importance of sharing knowledge, expertise, and best practices to foster the growth of their digital economies.

According to local reports, Bilal Bin Saqib commended Kyrgyzstan's leadership in digital assets innovation during the meeting, expressing Pakistan's interest in developing a joint regulatory structure with them. He also noted that Pakistan is interested in advancing technology with Kyrgyzstan as its partners, proposing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a formal partnership in the crypto space.

Pakistan has continued to make its push into the crypto industry, with the recent development in Kyrgyzstan showing how serious the country is in that regard. The country announced the formation of its Pakistan Crypto Council, a division that was charged with regulating and integrating blockchain technology into the country's financial landscape.

The formation of the Council came after the appointment of Bilal Bin Saqib as special adviser to Finance Minister Muhammed Aurangzeb. Bin Saqib was subsequently appointed as the CEO of the Council, with Aurangzeb acting as the chairman of the Crypto Council.

Meanwhile, both countries have reiterated their commitment to building a secure, transparent, and digital economy that is ready for the future, noting that the collaboration could enhance blockchain and digital finance integration across Central and South Asia.

This latest development comes after the Press Information Department of Pakistan announced that both countries had signed several protocols and MoUs to deepen economic and technical cooperation, taking the bilateral trade volume to $100 million. The statement came after the 5th session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) on Trade, Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation in Islamabad.

“The two sides reaffirmed their resolve to boost bilateral trade, setting a target to raise trade volume to USD 100 million,” the PID statement said. “They agreed to work on diversification of exports and imports, revive the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Joint Business Council, and organize business forums, trade fairs, and B2B (business-to-business) exchanges.”

The development comes at a time when Pakistan is trying to leverage its strategic geopolitical position to engage in its role as an important trader and transit hub in the face of economic downturn. The country intends to connect the landlocked Central Asia with the rest of the world, engaging in a flurry of visits, investment talks, and economic activities with other Central Asian nations in the last few months.

“Discussions also focused on enhancing regional connectivity through logistics and transportation. Both sides agreed to deepen cooperation in postal services, cargo and rail transport, and civil aviation,” the PID said. “Both countries underscored the importance of strengthening financial cooperation. The central banks of both countries agreed to collaborate on the development of Islamic banking and financial instruments, including training programs through Pakistan's National Institute of Banking and Finance.”

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Yuga Labs, a leading player in the NFT space, has unveiled a blockchain-powered metaverse platform aimed at directly competing with Roblox, a dominant force in the digital gaming industry [1]. The initiative, dubbed Otherside, integrates ApeCoin and NFTs to enable true digital ownership for creators and enhance monetization within the platform. By leveraging on-chain infrastructure, Yuga seeks to create a more transparent and decentralized alternative to traditional metaverse ecosystems [1].

At the core of the project is a suite of developer tools designed to lower the barrier to entry for creators. A Unity software development kit allows users to build immersive experiences without requiring deep coding or blockchain expertise [1]. Additionally, an AI-powered world generator automates the creation of virtual environments, streamlining the development process. These tools reflect Yuga's focus on empowering a broad range of content creators to participate in the metaverse [1].

Greg Solano, Yuga Labs co-founder, has framed the platform as a “Roblox killer powered by ApeCoin” [1]. The platform differentiates itself by operating on permissionless blockchain networks rather than centralized systems, granting users greater control over their digital assets. ApeCoin serves as the primary medium of exchange within Otherside, with discussions already underway about creating a dedicated blockchain, “ApeChain,” to optimize microtransactions and governance [1].

Despite the ambitious vision, significant challenges remain. For the platform to succeed, it must attract a substantial user base to ensure active participation and meaningful economic activity. Without it, the platform risks becoming an empty virtual space. Current competitors, such as Roblox, have already allocated large sums to creators, including $923 million in 2024 [1]. Otherside will need to demonstrate a compelling value proposition—particularly in terms of higher revenue shares and decentralized governance—to draw both creators and users.

The company is accelerating its development timeline under Solano's leadership, with public testing phases planned for later this year. These early demonstrations will offer insights into user engagement and technical performance [1]. Meanwhile, Yuga has positioned itself as a formidable contender by leveraging its existing NFT expertise and blockchain infrastructure, supported by a strong development team and prior technical demonstrations [1].

While the project is still in its early stages, it signals a broader shift in the gaming industry toward Web3 principles. If successful, Otherside could set a new standard for creator ownership and economic fairness in digital spaces, challenging the dominance of centralized platforms. However, scalability, user adoption, and the practical integration of blockchain into a highly interactive environment will determine its long-term viability [1].

Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan have agreed to deepen collaboration in crypto and blockchain innovation. According to reports, both countries also intend to depend on bilateral cooperation in aspects like blockchain technology and digital finance.

The collaboration was agreed at a high-level virtual meeting between Bilal Bin Saqib, the Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain in Pakistan, and Farkhat Aminov, Director of Kyrgyzstan's National Investment Agency.

During the meeting, both sides held detailed discussions on digital finance, regulatory frameworks, and blockchain innovation. They also discussed the importance of sharing knowledge, expertise, and best practices to foster the growth of their digital economies.

According to local reports, Bilal Bin Saqib commended Kyrgyzstan's leadership in digital assets innovation during the meeting, expressing Pakistan's interest in developing a joint regulatory structure with them. He also noted that Pakistan is interested in advancing technology with Kyrgyzstan as its partners, proposing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a formal partnership in the crypto space.

Pakistan has continued to make its push into the crypto industry, with the recent development in Kyrgyzstan showing how serious the country is in that regard. The country announced the formation of its Pakistan Crypto Council, a division that was charged with regulating and integrating blockchain technology into the country's financial landscape.

The formation of the Council came after the appointment of Bilal Bin Saqib as special adviser to Finance Minister Muhammed Aurangzeb. Bin Saqib was subsequently appointed as the CEO of the Council, with Aurangzeb acting as the chairman of the Crypto Council.

Meanwhile, both countries have reiterated their commitment to building a secure, transparent, and digital economy that is ready for the future, noting that the collaboration could enhance blockchain and digital finance integration across Central and South Asia.

This latest development comes after the Press Information Department of Pakistan announced that both countries had signed several protocols and MoUs to deepen economic and technical cooperation, taking the bilateral trade volume to $100 million. The statement came after the 5th session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) on Trade, Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation in Islamabad.

“The two sides reaffirmed their resolve to boost bilateral trade, setting a target to raise trade volume to USD 100 million,” the PID statement said. “They agreed to work on diversification of exports and imports, revive the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Joint Business Council, and organize business forums, trade fairs, and B2B (business-to-business) exchanges.”

The development comes at a time when Pakistan is trying to leverage its strategic geopolitical position to engage in its role as an important trader and transit hub in the face of economic downturn. The country intends to connect the landlocked Central Asia with the rest of the world, engaging in a flurry of visits, investment talks, and economic activities with other Central Asian nations in the last few months.

“Discussions also focused on enhancing regional connectivity through logistics and transportation. Both sides agreed to deepen cooperation in postal services, cargo and rail transport, and civil aviation,” the PID said. “Both countries underscored the importance of strengthening financial cooperation. The central banks of both countries agreed to collaborate on the development of Islamic banking and financial instruments, including training programs through Pakistan's National Institute of Banking and Finance.”

Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, has offloaded more than $13 million worth of crypto holdings, including ether (ETH), ethena ENA$0.5369, and pepe PEPE$0.0₄1022.

Data from Arkham Intelligence shows Hayes sold millions worth of these cryptocurrencies and moved to accumulate USDC, with the stablecoin now making up over 80% of the $27.9 million in the address associated with him.

The address sold 2,373 ETH worth $8.32 million, 7.76 million ENA valued at $4.62 million, and 38.86 billion PEPE for $414,700. In a post on X, he seemingly confirmed he is behind the address and pointed to a bearish scenario for the crypto space.

Hayes suggested that markets will take a hit from the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, some of which came into effect on Aug. 1 and others are coming on Aug. 7, which affect key trading partners.

Combined with a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report, he argued that no major economy is expanding credit fast enough to boost nominal GDP. Against this backdrop, he predicted bitcoin could “test $100K” while ether will revisit $3,000.

Y? US Tariff bill coming due in 3q … at least the mrkt believes that after NFP print. No major econ is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal gdp. So $BTC tests $100k, $ETH tests $3k. Come see my @WebX_Asia Tokyo keynote Aug 25 for more info. Back to the beach. https://t.co/zuHlwgQKC7

The crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, lost more than 7.5% of its value over the past week as rate cut hopes faded. Bitcoin outperformed the wider market with a 3.9% drop, and is now standing at $113,500.

Similarly, Ether saw a 6.5% drop in the same period and now trades at $3,500. While rate cut hopes dimmed on Friday, later in the session they surged after the labor market showed signs of weakness. Polymarket traders are now weighing a 70% chance of a rate cut in September.

The market is also dropping as tensions between the U.S. and Russia escalate. After former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev threatened the U.S. in response to an ultimatum on Moscow to agree to a cease-fire, Trump said he ordered two nuclear submarines to move to the “appropriate regions.”

Despite the sell-off, Hayes may remain bullish. In a post last month, he said his year-end target for the price of bitcoin was $250,000, while he saw ether rise to $10,000.

Bitcoin Swift has made headlines as its ICO gains continue to eclipse what Avalanche, DOGE, and Shiba Inu achieved at comparable points in their early runs. The crypto space is no stranger to hype cycles, but Bitcoin Swift is attracting attention for more practical reasons. Its unique blend of adaptive rewards, AI governance, and hybrid consensus is drawing in investors seeking more than meme-fueled speculation.

Avalanche delivered impressive infrastructure for developers and DeFi, while DOGE and Shiba Inu rode waves of meme culture and social media. Their communities remain active, and their contributions to crypto history cannot be dismissed. Yet none of these projects integrated a protocol where rewards are dynamic, contracts are intelligent, and governance is reputation-weighted from day one. Bitcoin Swift builds on these gaps with a forward-facing approach to blockchain utility.

Bitcoin Swift is not positioning itself as just another decentralized chain. Instead, it is marketed as a financial operating system, blending adaptive Proof-of-Yield, AI-powered smart contracts, decentralized identity protection, and hybrid Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms. This architecture is built for scalability, compliance, and long-term decentralization.

At its core, Bitcoin Swift's Proof-of-Yield system does what static models cannot. It adjusts block rewards in real time based on network activity, environmental factors, and governance votes. The result is a living ecosystem where incentives evolve alongside user participation. This level of responsiveness is rare in crypto and stands out to those who have grown tired of fixed systems that fail to adapt.

AI plays a significant role throughout the protocol. Smart contracts hosted on a WASM-compatible engine embed AI agents capable of learning from network patterns and adjusting behavior accordingly. Federated AI oracles supply trusted data streams, strengthening the foundation for decentralized applications.

Security and trust are reinforced by audits from Spywolf Audit and Solidproof Audit, giving confidence to those engaging with the ecosystem.

Bitcoin Swift's layered consensus delivers security and adaptability in equal measure.

This combination allows Bitcoin Swift to maintain integrity while scaling for future adoption.

Bitcoin Swift embeds AI directly into its smart contracts for enhanced functionality.

Privacy remains a core focus. Bitcoin Swift uses zk-SNARK technology and decentralized identity systems to allow users to verify credentials without exposing sensitive information. These privacy protections apply equally to transactions and governance, ensuring users retain control over their data.

Bitcoin Swift's contributors have successfully completed KYC verification to enhance transparency.

Bitcoin Swift has opened its presale with Stage 3 offering BTC3 at just $3. The next stage will increase to $4, with a confirmed launch price set at $15. Stage 3 current APY is 121%. This presale is gaining momentum fast because it isn't simply about buying tokens; it's about earning from day one. Every participant at this stage secures access to Bitcoin Swift's on-chain governance and programmable rewards through its Proof-of-Yield system.

With only 6 days left before the next price increase, this is one of the shortest and fastest-moving presales in crypto. Early participants are already benefiting from a model designed to reward real contributors, not just early buyers.

Add to it that Bitcoin Swift's momentum is backed by strong reviews from Crypto Vlog, Crypto Nitro, and Crypto Sister, who agree it is one of the most innovative blockchains right now.

Early believers are already seeing the benefits of being part of a project designed to reward those who help shape its future. With such rapid movement between stages and substantial upside potential, Bitcoin Swift is quickly positioning itself as the opportunity that early crypto adopters are looking for.

Bitcoin Swift has structured its tokenomics to promote long-term sustainability.

This allocation ensures a balanced focus on network incentives, liquidity stability, and project development.

Governance is reinforced with AI risk evaluation for all proposals. Decisions are made through quadratic voting weighted by decentralized identity reputation. An emergency council can veto malicious actions, safeguarding network health without sacrificing decentralization.

Bitcoin Swift is gaining recognition for reasons beyond price charts. Its hybrid consensus, AI-enhanced smart contracts, and adaptive incentives provide a foundation built for future financial ecosystems. For those seeking opportunities beyond speculative tokens, Bitcoin Swift offers a model of blockchain utility that rewards participation while preserving privacy and decentralization.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Plugman has launched a 5,000-piece NFT collection on the Element platform, marking the first Universal NFT series on ZetaChain [1]. The drop went live on August 1 and is exclusively available on Element, the first NFT marketplace built on ZetaChain [2]. The collection features a pre-mint reward system, which incentivizes early participation through wallet connections and task completions [5]. This approach underscores a growing trend in the NFT space where projects prioritize direct engagement with core audiences through specialized platforms [3].

The sale generated a total transaction volume of 2,373 ETH, equivalent to approximately $7.76 million [1]. This significant on-chain activity has attracted attention within the Ethereum and broader blockchain community, particularly given the current quiet state of the NFT market [4]. The integration of ZetaChain's cross-chain infrastructure further highlights the project's focus on interoperability, allowing the NFTs to be used across multiple blockchain environments [2]. This aligns with broader industry efforts to enhance the utility and adoption of NFTs through cross-chain compatibility.

Despite the strong sales figures and strategic execution, the project has not been endorsed by any public figures or institutional leaders, a factor that may influence its long-term acceptance [1]. The absence of official commentary also raises questions about the collection's broader market appeal and potential for mainstream adoption. However, the project's emphasis on user-driven incentives and cross-chain innovation positions it as a notable development in the evolving NFT ecosystem [6].

Industry observers note that the Plugman launch represents a strategic move to strengthen ZetaChain's presence in the NFT market. By partnering with Element and leveraging ZetaChain's infrastructure, Plugman is not only enhancing the visibility of the platform but also setting a precedent for how future NFT projects might utilize cross-chain technology to expand their reach and engagement [6]. The success of this launch could encourage similar projects to adopt comparable strategies, particularly in a competitive and rapidly evolving market [1].

Crypto analyst Marcus Corvinus has commented on the Ethereum price crash, providing optimism about the altcoin's recent decline. The analyst explained the current price action and suggested that this was simply a minor setback before another parabolic uptrend to new highs. 

In an X post, Marcus Corvinus said that a hidden bullish power is brewing for the Ethereum price. The analyst further remarked that ETH is playing a smarter game than Bitcoin right now. While BTC has made lower lows, Corvinus claimed that ETH has held strong with higher lows. The analyst declared that this is not just price action but strength under pressure. 



The crypto analyst then highlighted what is unfolding for the Ethereum price. He noted that bearish volume has been fading since last month, which indicates that weak hands are drying out. Furthermore, Corvinus revealed that the Hidden Bullish Divergence RSI made a lower low while the price made a higher low. The analyst declared that this is a classic signal of a strong continuation setup. 

Meanwhile, Corvinus stated that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is oversold, but still, the Ethereum price managed to hold above July's support on two retests. The analyst believes that this isn't a coincidence, which is why he is confident that ETH will still rally higher. He explained that ETH isn't reversing but consolidating at the top, a pattern which often ends in a breakout to the upside. 

In line with this, the crypto analyst declared that the Ethereum price crash is not the end of the move but simply the calm before the next storm. He added that eyes on ETH continuation look inevitable and that his target of between $7,000 and $8,000 this cycle is still on track. According to Corvinus, the breakout isn't a question of if but a question of when. 

In an X post, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes suggested that the Ethereum price might still crash to the psychological $3,000 level before the next leg up. The crypto founder alluded to the Trump tariffs and weak US job data as the reason for this conviction. 

Hayes also remarked that no major economy is creating enough credit fast enough to boost nominal GDP. As such, he doesn't see where liquidity will come from to spark a rally for the Ethereum price or other crypto prices. The BitMEX co-founder also expects the Bitcoin price to retest the psychological $100,000 level.

At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading just below the $3,500 level, down almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

 With Bitcoin's hashrate near all-time highs, solo miners continue to land full block rewards, thanks to efficient ASICs and a heavy dose of luck. 

Solo miners have been defying the odds, successfully claiming full Bitcoin block rewards even as the network hashrate hovers near all-time highs.

As of this writing, the Bitcoin (BTC) network's hashrate is hovering around 902 exahashes per second (EH/s), just below its all-time peak, according to Blockchain.com. The figure shows growing competition and higher difficulty, suggesting that single miners face steep odds to win a block.

However, last week, a solo miner defied these odds, securing block 907,283 via the Solo CK pool and earning the full 3.125 BTC reward, worth over $372,000 at the time. The miner also received an additional $3,436 in transaction fees.

That win wasn't an isolated event. Earlier in July, another miner with just 2.3 petahashes of power claimed a full block reward, while similar wins were recorded in June, March and back in February.

“We're seeing solo miners win blocks not because of luck, but because they're running powerful, efficient hardware,” Samuel Li, chief technology officer of ASICKey, told Cointelegraph. He added that modern miners are built to deliver “serious hashrate” without the massive power draw of traditional setups.

For solo miners, efficiency is everything, Li said. “Take our KEYMINER A1—it draws just 650 watts but delivers 1,100 TH/s on Bitcoin, with monthly profits around $1,200. For those diversifying into altcoins, it can earn up to $3,800 per month mining Dash,” he noted.

The KEYMINER A1 is part of ASICKey's hardware line introduced last November, which also includes the KEYMINER X and KEYMINER PRO.

According to the company, the KEYMINER X delivers 2,300 terahash per second (TH/s) at 1,300 watts, while the PRO model offers up to 5,800 TH/s at 2,800 watts. Under current market conditions, the company estimates monthly returns of up to $6,300 for the PRO.

However, despite the improvements in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) efficiency, the “fundamental odds [of solo miners winning] haven't shifted much,” Li said.

“Solo mining is still mostly a lottery, unless you control tens of PH/s, which is realistically the bare minimum for having a measurable statistical shot at success within a reasonable time frame,” he added.

Li explained that at today's Bitcoin network hashrate, a miner with one petahash (PH/s) of hashpower has about a 1 in 650,000 chance of solving a block every 10 minutes. One peta hash (PH/s) is equivalent to 1,000 terra hashes (TH/s).

Li confirmed that there has been a “modest resurgence” of interest in solo mining, but for different reasons. “Some miners are choosing it not for predictable income, but for the possibility of a big reward—6.25 BTC plus fees—which can be transformative if won,” he noted.

While monetary incentives play a key role, some are driven by ideological motives, valuing network decentralization and the ability to operate independently of centralized mining pools.

According to data from Hashrate Index, US-based mining pool Foundry USA continues to dominate Bitcoin mining, commanding 29.3% of the total hashrate. AntPool follows with 16.2%, while ViaBTC and F2Pool hold 12.0% and 11.6% respectively.

If a single pool (or a few pools acting together) control more than 50% of the hashrate, they could theoretically launch a 51% attack, which would allow them to double-spend coins. While rare and costly, such an event would erode trust in the network.

“Ultimately, more solo miners—especially those operating on clean energy and efficient hardware—could represent a healthier, more decentralized Bitcoin network, which is aligned with the original vision of permissionless participation,” Li concluded.

Bengaluru Police have arrested a 30-year-old software engineer in connection with the theft of approximately Rs 384 crore ($44 million) in cryptocurrency from CoinDCX. The accused, Rahul Agarwal, a permanent employee of CoinDCX, which is a crypto exchange platform, was arrested on July 26 by the Whitefield CEN crime police.

The alarm was raised on the early hours of July 19, when CoinDCX detected an unauthorised intrusion into their system. Hardeep Singh, Vice-President of Neblio Technologies, which operates CoinDCX, stated that a small amount of cryptocurrency was initially transferred. By 9:40 am, a total of $44 million worth of digital assets was stolen and distributed across six different crypto wallets.

Investigations conducted by the company revealed that the security details on Agarwal's company-issued laptop had been compromised, providing the gateway for the hacker to access CoinDCX's server. Following the discovery, police seized Agarwal's laptop and took him in for interrogation.

Agarwal, who is a resident of Carmelaram and originally from Haridwar, Uttarakhand, has denied any involvement in the theft. However, he admitted to undertaking additional work for three to four private clients without knowing their specific details. Investigators further uncovered a suspicious deposit of Rs 15 lakh into Agarwal's bank account from an unknown source.

In his statement to the police, Agarwal claimed to have received a WhatsApp call from a German number requesting him to complete certain files. He suggested that one of these files might have been a malicious trap set by the hacker to infiltrate his work system. Agarwal said that he was unaware of the theft until he was contacted by CoinDCX.

CoinDCX has confirmed its full cooperation with law enforcement agencies and cybercrime experts as the investigation into this significant cryptocurrency heist continues.

Despite major advancements in blockchain technology and cybersecurity measures, large-scale thefts remain a recurring threat. The decentralised and often anonymous nature of digital assets makes them attractive targets for sophisticated cybercriminals, who are constantly in the lookout for vulnerabilities in crypto exchange platforms, hot wallets, and even individual employee systems.

India's stance on cryptocurrency has been evolving, with ongoing discussions around clearer regulatory frameworks to govern digital assets. Security incidents like the CoinDCX theft case often require calls for stricter oversight, enhanced consumer protection mechanisms, and mandatory cybersecurity standards for all operational exchanges.

Crypto markets may be climbing, but some investors don't believe the rally is real, and that's exactly why it could go much higher, according to Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat and chairman of Ethereum treasury firm Bitmine Immersion (BMNR).

Speaking with CoinDeskTV, Lee explained why he called the rebound across crypto and equities that started in April "the most hated V-shaped bounce in history."

That's because when markets slumped after President Donald Trump's tariff announcements at the beginning of the month, economists predicted a recession, and many investors steered clear of riskier assets. The rebound caught them off guard.

"Since 2020, investors have underestimated every recovery,” he said. “This one is no different."

Traditional finance is increasingly buying into crypto — steadily and quietly, Lee said. The Ethereum blockchain's ether (ETH), he said, is benefiting from Wall Street's push into tokenization, choosing the network for its legal clarity and technical reliability. “Ethereum has never had downtime. That matters to banks,” he noted.

Lee's company, Bitmine, is betting on that. 

The company currently holds 625,000 ETH and nearly $2.8 billion in assets, with virtually no debt. Lee also confirmed a $1 billion share buyback, while reaffirming the company's goal to accumulate 5% of the ETH supply. 

Bitcoin BTC$113,342.42, meanwhile, is becoming a recurring buy for institutional investors. Lee said he believes a shift in Federal Reserve policy — particularly a move to rate cuts in the coming months — could send BTC surging toward $250,000.

Lee values ETH, currently priced at $3,700, at $15,000 based on network fundamentals. He maintains the real story is underappreciated institutional adoption. 

"We're not at the top," he said. "We're just mid-cycle."

In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency, why are altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX), and BlockDAG (BDAG) becoming increasingly recognized as more than just speculative investments?

The world of altcoins is shifting, and it's doing so rapidly. Once seen mainly as tools for trading and speculation, altcoins are emerging as strategic assets with tangible long-term utility. BNB, ADA, TRX, and BDAG are at the forefront of this transformation, each driven by their own unique factors that entice investors and institutional players alike.

BNB's evolution has been nothing short of remarkable. Once a simple utility token for trading fee discounts on Binance, it has morphed into a strategic asset that institutional investors are now beginning to embrace. The recent news of several publicly traded companies investing over $500 million in BNB has caught everyone's attention. If analysts' projections are to be believed, we could see BNB reaching or surpassing $1,000 by year-end, largely fueled by corporate treasury strategies that incorporate this altcoin.

Despite facing price fluctuations of its own, ADA's recent whale movements have sparked a renewed interest. The fact that it's compatible with mainstream payment systems, including Apple Pay, is a significant plus. This opens doors to broader user adoption and positions ADA as a long-term player in the market. 

Tron has been making waves not just in crypto circles, but also in traditional finance. With the Nasdaq listing of Tron Inc. and its treasury holdings, this altcoin is strategically positioning itself to merge blockchain technology with established financial systems seamlessly.

BDAG is gaining traction as well. Its presale's success and the community's involvement are noteworthy. With over 24.6 billion coins sold and a staggering 2,660% increase since its inception, BDAG is emerging as a formidable player in the altcoin arena.

Institutional investments are dramatically reshaping the strategies behind altcoins. Companies are now diversifying their treasury strategies, viewing altcoins as strategic financial assets rather than mere speculative tools. This trend is gaining momentum, especially with companies like Windtree Therapeutics and their recent integration of BNB into treasury management.

This shift isn't just an opportunity; it's a necessity. By treating altcoins as strategic assets, companies can create hedges against inflation, unlock new funding avenues, and grow their long-term value. This evolution speaks volumes about the broader acceptance of digital assets within the corporate finance landscape, bolstered by improved market maturity and regulatory clarity.

Furthermore, this growing institutional involvement is cultivating a more disciplined investment approach. Investors are now leaning towards tokens that possess clear utility, community backing, and regulatory compliance, steering away from the unrefined speculation that characterized older market cycles.

Regulatory compliance is another critical factor playing a role in the adoption of altcoins. Particularly concerning SMEs in Europe, the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework brings a sense of standardized and secure operations. This clarity enhances the credibility of SMEs, fostering greater market access.

But it's not all smooth sailing. Navigating these regulations can be resource-intensive for SMEs, demanding specialized tools and ongoing training.

Still, SMEs that can effectively manage compliance can transform these obligations into competitive advantages, turning potential hurdles into opportunities for both growth and innovation.

Tron is a prime example of an altcoin that is bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance. The Nasdaq listing of TRON Inc. and its establishment of a $210 million TRX treasury serves as a powerful testament to this trend. 

TRX offers faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions compared to traditional systems, especially in the Asian fintech sector. This blockchain enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, which significantly reduces fees while improving processing times for cross-border payments.

Moreover, regulated crypto-assets like TRX are increasingly perceived as complements to traditional finance rather than outright replacements. This perspective allows for a more inclusive financial ecosystem where decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies enhance financial inclusion and support micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

The future of altcoins appears bright, positioned to evolve from speculative investments into strategic assets. Growing institutional interest and regulatory advancements will likely drive further adoption of these digital currencies into mainstream finance.

As the market matures, investors are expected to prioritize fundamentals, token utility, and on-chain profit-sharing mechanisms. This shift could cultivate a more sustainable altcoin market cycle, moving away from the past "altcoin seasons" fueled solely by hype.

In essence, altcoins like BNB, ADA, TRX, and BDAG are leading a transformative shift in the cryptocurrency landscape. By becoming strategic assets, these digital currencies are not only reshaping investment strategies but also bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance, paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem in the years to come.

Researchers from New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) have used artificial intelligence to tackle a critical problem facing the future of energy storage: finding affordable, sustainable alternatives to lithium-ion batteries.

In research published in Cell Reports Physical Science, the NJIT team led by Professor Dibakar Datta successfully applied generative AI techniques to rapidly discover new porous materials capable of revolutionizing multivalent-ion batteries. These batteries, using abundant elements like magnesium, calcium, aluminum and zinc, offer a promising, cost-effective alternative to lithium-ion batteries, which face global supply challenges and sustainability issues.

Unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries, which rely on lithium ions that carry just a single positive charge, multivalent-ion batteries use elements whose ions carry two or even three positive charges. This means multivalent-ion batteries can potentially store significantly more energy, making them highly attractive for future energy storage solutions.

However, the larger size and greater electrical charge of multivalent ions make them challenging to accommodate efficiently in battery materials -- an obstacle that the NJIT team's new AI-driven research directly addresses.

"One of the biggest hurdles wasn't a lack of promising battery chemistries -- it was the sheer impossibility of testing millions of material combinations," Datta said. "We turned to generative AI as a fast, systematic way to sift through that vast landscape and spot the few structures that could truly make multivalent batteries practical.

"This approach allows us to quickly explore thousands of potential candidates, dramatically speeding up the search for more efficient and sustainable alternatives to lithium-ion technology."

To overcome these hurdles, the NJIT team developed a novel dual-AI approach: a Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) and a finely tuned Large Language Model (LLM). Together, these AI tools rapidly explored thousands of new crystal structures, something previously impossible using traditional laboratory experiments.

The CDVAE model was trained on vast datasets of known crystal structures, enabling it to propose completely novel materials with diverse structural possibilities. Meanwhile, the LLM was tuned to zero in on materials closest to thermodynamic stability, crucial for practical synthesis.

"Our AI tools dramatically accelerated the discovery process, which uncovered five entirely new porous transition metal oxide structures that show remarkable promise," said Datta. "These materials have large, open channels ideal for moving these bulky multivalent ions quickly and safely, a critical breakthrough for next-generation batteries."

The team validated their AI-generated structures using quantum mechanical simulations and stability tests, confirming that the materials could indeed be synthesized experimentally and hold great potential for real-world applications.

Datta emphasized the broader implications of their AI-driven approach: "This is more than just discovering new battery materials -- it's about establishing a rapid, scalable method to explore any advanced materials, from electronics to clean energy solutions, without extensive trial and error."

With these encouraging results, Datta and his colleagues plan to collaborate with experimental labs to synthesize and test their AI-designed materials, pushing the boundaries further towards commercially viable multivalent-ion batteries.

Aging poses significant challenges to cardiovascular health necessitating novel therapeutic approaches. This study investigates the potential of the brown adipose tissue (BAT) derived lipokine 12,13-diHOME to mitigate age-induced impairments in cardiovascular function. Analysis of human and rodent plasma signaling lipids reveals a decline in 12,13-diHOME levels with age. Transplantation of BAT or sustained upregulation of 12,13-diHOME effectively preserved cardiac function in aged male and female mice. Bulk RNA-Seq of hearts from aged mice reveals significant increases in pathways involved in ER stress and fibrosis which were partially attenuated by BAT transplantation or sustained upregulation of 12,13-diHOME. Mechanistically, in vivo and in vitro models demonstrate that 12,13-diHOME alleviated ER stress through CaMKII inhibition, particularly in males. These findings underscore 12,13-diHOME as a promising candidate for combating age-related cardiovascular dysfunction, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies for addressing cardiovascular diseases in aging populations.

Older adults are the fastest-growing demographic segment in the U.S population and worldwide. It is predicted that more than 20% of the U.S. will be over the age of 65 by the year 20301. Aging is among the strongest risk factors for a multitude of diseases, including both metabolic and cardiovascular disease2, elevating the significance of developing potential therapeutic treatments. Aging causes a decrease in systolic and diastolic cardiac function and an increase in pathological hypertrophy3,4. These aging-induced effects on cardiovascular health and function are related to disrupted Ca2+ cycling, uptake, storage, and release5.

Aging is also associated with a decrease in brown adipose tissue (BAT), a tissue that plays an important role in combating the development of metabolic and cardiovascular disease6,7,8,9,10. Recent epidemiological studies have established a positive correlation between BAT activity and cardiovascular function in humans10,11. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that BAT transplantation, or BAT stimulation by cold or exercise stimulate the endocrine activity of BAT and affect whole-body metabolism and cardiovascular function12,13,14,15. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that BAT enhances calcium cycling and cardiac function in young, healthy, male mice, both in vivo and in vitro, via release of the lipokine 12,13-diHOME156. However, the ability of BAT or 12,13-diHOME to directly affect cardiovascular health and function in a model of senescence has not been investigated.

In this study, we demonstrate that 12,13-diHOME is significantly decreased with age in both humans and rodents. Increasing 12,13-diHOME, either by BAT transplantation or sustained upregulation via tissue nanotransfection (TNT), preserves cardiovascular health and function in aged (~24 months old) male and female mice. Heart RNA-Seq data demonstrate an increase in the expression of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the extracellular matrix with aging, which are attenuated by transplantation of BAT or an increase in 12,13-diHOME in male, but not female mice. Further, we identify a unique role for 12,13-diHOME to directly interact with and inhibit Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), identifying a potential mechanism for 12,13-diHOME to regulate Ca2+ cycling, a crucial factor that impairs cardiac function. Together, these data identify a role for BAT and 12,13-diHOME to prevent the age-induced decline in cardiac function.

While it is known that the thermogenic activity of BAT decreases with age6,7,8,9,10, less is known about the effect of age on the endocrine function of BAT. To determine if circulating lipids were altered with age, we performed liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on plasma of young (aged 18–35) and aged (aged 65–90) human subjects. A panel of 88 mediator lipids with annotated signaling properties was detected. One-way hierarchical clustering (Fig. 1a) and principal component analysis (Fig. 1b) revealed a distinct effect of age on lipid signaling in humans. To probe age-induced changes in individual lipids, we performed differential expression analysis and focused on signaling lipids that changed on a Log2 fold scale with p < 0.05. Nineteen lipids were altered with age in humans; 9 decreased with age, and 10 increased with age (Fig. 1c).

Plasma lipid profiles of young (18–35 year old) and older (65–90 year old) humans displayed as a heat map, b principal component analysis, and c volcano plot. Plasma lipid profiles of young (3 months old) and older (24 months old) male mice displayed as d heat map, e principal component analysis, and f volcano plot. Quantification of 12,13-diHOME in g humans (green: young, red: aged) and h mice (dotted green: young, dotted red: aged). Humans n = 7 and 12 per group. Mice n = 7 per group. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Volcano plot shows the log2 fold change versus –log10 (p) value from two-sided Student's t tests. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied, with significance threshold set at FDR < 0.05 (c, f). Two-tailed P values by unpaired Student's t test (g, h).

The effect of age on signaling lipids was also measured in young (3-month-old) and aged (18-month-old) male mice. One-way hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis exposed a distinct effect of age on lipid signaling in mice (Fig. 1d, e). A volcano plot revealed 31 signaling lipids were decreased, and one signaling lipid increased, in aged mice (Fig. 1f). Interestingly, there were seven oxylipins that decreased with age in both mice and humans (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1, 2), including 12,13-diHOME (Fig. 1g, h), which we have previously identified to be released from BAT and improve cardiac function15.

To investigate whether the decrease in 12,13-diHOME contributes to age-related impairments in cardiac function, we increased BAT mass by transplantation13,15. Our previous work demonstrated that BAT transplantation increases circulating 12,13-diHOME in young, male mice15. BAT was transplanted from young (3-month-old) male and female mice into the visceral cavity of sex-matched 21-month-old mice13,15 (Fig. 2a). Twelve weeks post-transplantation, echocardiography revealed that +BAT preserved ejection fraction in male and female mice (Fig. 2b) and attenuated the age-induced increase in left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW) (Fig. 2c). Importantly, as cardiac hypertrophy is a hallmark of cardiac aging, the hypertrophy index (LVPW/diastolic diameter) was calculated in male and female mice. The hypertrophy index was significantly reduced in +BAT male and female mice (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Tables 2, 3). In vivo cardiac hemodynamics revealed that male and female +BAT had increased systolic function (Fig. 2e). A greater −dP/dtmin in +BAT mice indicated accelerated relaxation and enhanced diastolic function (Fig. 2f) compared to age- and sex-matched sham mice. There was no effect of BAT transplantation on body composition or glucose tolerance in aged male or female mice (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). Together, these data demonstrate that +BAT counteracts age-induced cardiac dysfunction and pathological hypertrophy in both male and female mice.

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Two-tailed P values by unpaired Student's t test (b–f). Bar colors: white (sham), blue (+BAT males), red (+BAT females) (b–f).

The viability of transplanted BAT was assessed by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) injection and gene expression analysis. Twelve weeks after BAT transplantation, 2-DG injection showed active glucose uptake by the transplanted BAT (Supplementary Video). Gene expression analysis revealed no differences in gene expression of Ephx1, or Pgc1α in endogenous BAT compared to transplanted BAT. Ephx2, Prdm16, Ucp1, and Glut4 were still present in transplanted BAT, but expression was decreased in the transplanted tissue, similar to a previous study (Fig. 1e)13. There were also no changes in inflammatory markers of the endogenous pgWAT in mice that received +BAT compared to Sham (Supplementary Fig. 1f) mice.

To determine if this improvement in cardiovascular function was specific to transplantation of BAT, or if transplantation of adipose tissue from a young mouse would be sufficient to confer these beneficial effects, 0.1 g of perigonadal white adipose tissue (pgWAT) was transplanted from young (3-month-old) male mice into the visceral cavity of sex-matched 21-month-old mice12,13,14,15. Transplantation of 0.1 g pgWAT did not affect ejection fraction (Supplementary Fig. 2a) or in vivo cardiac hemodynamics compared to Sham mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). There were no changes in inflammatory markers of the endogenous pgWAT in mice that received +WAT compared to Sham (Supplementary Fig. 2e) mice. Taken together, these data indicate that the improvement in cardiovascular health and function is specific to transplantation of BAT.

Given our data demonstrating the effect of age on signaling lipids, the putative endocrine role of BAT, and our previous studies demonstrating the effect of 12,13-diHOME on cardiovascular function, we performed LC-MS/MS on plasma from male and female Sham and +BAT mice to determine if increasing BAT altered the lipidomic profile of aged male and female mice. A volcano plot revealed that BAT transplantation in aged mice altered the levels of seven lipids: three were decreased and four were increased, including 12,13-diHOME (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Table 4). There was no increase in 12,13-diHOME in mice that received 0.1 g pgWAT compared to Sham mice (Supplementary Fig. 2e).

Since increasing BAT (+BAT) resulted in an increase in 12,13-diHOME, and 12,13-diHOME has previously been shown to increase cardiac function in young, male mice15, we investigated the role of 12,13-diHOME to mitigate age-induced impairments in cardiovascular function. Aged male and female mice were injected with 12,13-diHOME or an equivalent amount of its isomer, 9,10-diHOME, and in vivo cardiac hemodynamics were measured. Acute treatment with 12,13-diHOME increased systolic (Fig. 3c) and diastolic (Fig. 3d) function in male mice. Interestingly, these improvements were not observed in female mice (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).

After determining the effect of 12,13-diHOME to acutely increase in vivo cardiac hemodynamics, we investigated the potential therapeutic applications of an increase in 12,13-diHOME. 12,13-diHOME, similar to other oxylipins, has a very short half-life16,17,18,19,20; we found that 30 min after acute injection there is no difference in circulating 12,13-diHOME (Supplementary Fig. 4). To address the challenge posed by the short half-life of 12,13-diHOME, we utilized a non-viral gene therapy technology, TNT using plasmids that expressed genes of interest, Ephx1 and 2, the enzymes that convert 12,13-epOME to 12,13-diHOME12,14,15. We have previously shown that a sustained overexpression of 12,13-diHOME via TNT preserved cardiac function in young, male mice15. To investigate if a sustained overexpression of 12,13-diHOME preserved cardiac function in male and female mice in a model of aging, TNT was performed in 21- month- old mice using plasmids that contain the genes for the soluble epoxide hydrolase 1 and 2 (Ephx1 and Ephx2; TNT-Ephx1/2), or a Sham plasmid (TNT-Sham). These plasmids were electropolated on both the dorsal and ventral skin once a week for 6 weeks to drive sustained expression of Ephx1 and 2 (TNT-Ephx1/2) (Fig. 4a). TNT-driven overexpression of Ephx1/2 increased expression 12,13-diHOME in circulation (Fig. 4b, c; Supplementary Table 5) and expression of Ephx1 and Ephx2 in the skin (Fig. 4d). There was no effect of an increase in 12,13-diHOME on body composition or glucose tolerance (Supplementary Fig. 5a-d).

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Volcano plot shows the log2 fold change versus –log10 (p) value from two-sided Student's ttests.

Bar colors: white (sham), purple (TNT) (c, d). Bar colors: white (sham), blue (TNT males), pink (TNT females) (e, i).

Similar to BAT transplantation (+BAT), treatment with TNT for 6 weeks preserved ejection fraction (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Table 6,7), LVPW thickness (Fig. 4f), and reduced the hypertrophy index (Fig. 4g). Male and female mice and TNT-Ephx1/2 increased systolic and diastolic function compared to sex-matched TNT-Sham mice (Fig. 4h, i). Together, these data indicate that TNT-driven up-regulation of 12,13-diHOME preserves cardiovascular health and function in male and female aged mice.

To decipher the underlying mechanisms through which +BAT or 12,13-diHOME attenuate the aging-induced changes in the heart, we investigated changes to the heart transcriptome by measuring bulk RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) in young (3 months of age), aged (24 months of age) and +BAT aged (24 months of age) male mice. Among the 13,807 genes detected, 143 genes were altered with age (100 increased and 43 decreased; young vs. aged) and 416 with +BAT (279 increased and 137 decreased; aged vs. +BAT aged) (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). Differential gene expression analysis revealed certain gene clusters (cluster 2, 4, and 8) that were altered in a similar manner in the +BAT and young mice as observed in the heatmap (Fig. 5a). To characterize the mechanism of how +BAT affects the aged heart, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis detected changes in pathways involved in the extracellular matrix, mitochondria, and ER in both aging and +BAT conditions (Fig. 5b, c).

a Heat maps comparing young (3 months old), aged (24 months old) and +BAT aged male mice. b, c Gene ontology analysis of pathways altered among young (3 months old; n = 7), aged (24 months old; n = 9) and +BAT aged male mice (n = 5). Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using Metascape. P-values were calculated using the cumulative hypergeometric test and adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (b, c).

It is well established that ER stress is a pivotal factor in aging, as it can induce mitochondrial dysfunction and hypertrophy of the extracellular matrix. We first validated our RNA-Seq results by measuring gene expression via qPCR in genes involved in ER stress with aging that were reverted to a “young” phenotype by BAT transplantation. In line with the RNA-seq data, genes involved in ER stress were increased in aged male mice compared to young mice, and this was completely attenuated in the +BAT aged mice (Fig. 6a). To investigate changes in ER stress genes more quantitatively, we measured the ratio of the spliced isoform to total XBP1 mRNA which can be used as a marker of the IRE1-mediated ER stress response21. There was a decrease in spliced to unspliced XBP1 ratio in young and +BAT aged mice compared to sham mice, indicating an attenuation of ER stress with +BAT (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, there was no difference in ER stress markers in female mice among young, aged, or +BAT aged (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b).

Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test a, b, h or unpaired two-tailed Student's t test (c–g, i–l). Imaging data in (f) and (g) were obtained from three independent cohorts.

To determine if an increase in 12,13-diHOME attenuated the elevated expression of genes involved in ER stress, we measured markers of ER stress in TNT-Sham and TNT-Ephx1/2 male and female mice. Similar to what was observed with BAT transplantation (+BAT), TNT-Ephx1/2 significantly reduced expression of genes involved in ER stress compared to aged male mice. Furthermore, ER-stress-related apoptosis markers (GADD34 and Chop) were attenuated by the increase in 12,13-diHOME (Fig. 6c), and there was a decrease in spliced to unspliced XBP1 ratio in the TNT-Ephx1/2 mice compared to the TNT-Sham mice (Fig. 6d). Importantly, 30 min after injection with 12,13-diHOME, the sXBP1/uXBP1 ratio was significantly decreased in male mice, while there was no effect after injection of 9,10-diHOME (Fig. 6e). Interestingly, this reduction in ER stress was independent of other changes in cardiac inflammation (IL-6, IL-1β, TGF-β, and TNF-α) and oxidative stress (SOD1, SOD2, Nrf2, and Gpx1) in aged males (Supplementary Fig. 8), suggesting the ER stress specific response.

In contrast to male mice, there were no differences in ER stress markers in female mice in response to TNT-Ephx1/2 (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c) or acute treatment of 12,13-diHOME (Supplementary Fig. 7d). After observing the lack of effect of 12,13-diHOME on ER stress in aged female mice, we compared the sXBP1/uXBP1 ratio in male and female mice. Consistent with previous literature22, female mice had a decreased sXBP1/uXBP1 ratio compared to male mice, indicating reduced ER stress (Supplementary Fig. 7e). Thus, it is possible that there is no effect of 12,13-diHOME to reduce ER stress in female mice because their baseline ER stress is already lower than that of male mice.

RNA-Seq analysis also revealed significant increases in extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways with +BAT. Considering the important biological role of fibroblasts in the production of the ECM, and the fact that perivascular fibrosis is known to increase with age23, we investigated if an increase in 12,13-diHOME affected perivascular fibrosis in male mice. Perivascular fibrosis and wall lumen ratio were both reduced in +BAT aged compared to sham, and in TNT-Ephx1/2 mice compared to TNT-Sham (Fig. 6f, g). The tunicamycin-induced spliced to unspliced XBP1 ratio was attenuated by 12,13-diHOME in cardiac fibroblasts from young male mice (Fig. 6h). Together, these data indicate that an increase in 12,13-diHOME through either BAT transplantation or TNT negates aging-induced increases in ER stress and perivascular fibrosis in male mice.

Our previous studies showed that 12,13-diHOME requires nNOS to exert its beneficial effects on cardiac function in both in vivo and in vitro15. Consequently, we investigated TNT-Ephx1/2 could attenuate ER stress and improve cardiac function in nNOS−/− mice, where 12,13-diHOME is increased but cannot exert its beneficial effects. It is established that a high-fat diet can increase markers of ER stress24, thus wild-type (WT) and nNOS−/− were placed on a high-fat diet (60% kcal from fat) beginning at 6 weeks of age. At 12 weeks of age, mice were subjected to TNT-Ephx1/2 for 6 weeks. TNT-Ephx1/2 increased 12,13-diHOME in circulation in nNOS−/− mice (Fig. 6i). While the nNOS−/− mice weighed less than the WT mice, there was no effect of an increase in 12,13-diHOME on body weight, % fat mass, or % lean mass (Supplementary Fig. 9a-c). There was no effect of an increase in 12,13-diHOME on glucose tolerance, similar to our previous studies12,14,15 (Supplementary Fig. 9d).

We then investigated the effects of an increase in 12,13-diHOME on cardiovascular function in WT and nNOS−/− mice fed a high-fat diet. Ejection fraction was preserved in WT TNT-Ephx1/2 mice compared to WT TNT-Sham mice, but there was no effect of TNT-Ephx1/2 to affect ejection fraction or other cardiovascular parameters in nNOS−/− mice (Fig. 6j, Supplementary Table 8). To determine if this preservation of ejection fraction was related to changes in ER stress genes, a panel of ER stress genes was measured and revealed that TNT-Ephx1/2 reduced markers of ER stress in WT mice but had no effect in nNOS−/− mice (Fig. 6k). There was also a decrease in spliced to unspliced XBP1 ratio in the WT TNT-Ephx1/2 mice compared to the WT TNT-Sham mice, while this was not altered in the nNOS−/− mice (Fig. 6l). Collectively, these data indicate that TNT-Ephx1/2 does not affect cardiac function in the nNOS−/− mice, indicating that the improvement in cardiac function is specifically mediated by 12,13-diHOME.

Age-induced increases in ER stress are attributed to disrupted calcium homeostasis25,26. CaMKII is a key player in cardiac dysfunction and pathological remodeling of the heart and acts as a pathological mediator of ER stress, and aging increases CaMKII activity in the heart27,28,29,30,31. To determine if 12,13-diHOME mediates ER stress by modulating CaMKII signaling, we measured the levels of total CaMKII and CaMKII phosphorylated at T286/287 (pCaMKII) in the hearts of mice with increased 12,13-diHOME. These measurements served as in situ surrogates for CaMKII activity and revealed that sustained overexpression of 12,13-diHOME reduced pCaMKII in male (Fig. 7a), but not female mice (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Overexpression of 12,13-diHOME attenuated pCaMKII in high-fat diet-fed, young, WT mice, but not in nNOS−/− male mice (Fig. 7b).

Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's test c, h–l; unpaired two-tailed t test (a, b, f, g). Imaging data in (f) and (g) were obtained from three independent cohorts.

To determine if there was a direct interaction of 12,13-diHOME and CaMKII, we performed in vitro experiments using commercially available purified components of 12,13-diHOME and CaMKIIδ protein, which showed that 12,13-diHOME directly inhibits CaMKII activity at micromolar concentrations (Fig. 7c). Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) studies indicated that 12,13-diHOME binds directly to CaMKIIδ  ±  ATP with a Kd of 19 and 24 µM in the absence and presence of ATP, respectively. These experiments suggest that 12,13-diHOME allosterically interacts with CaMKIIδ rather than competing for the kinase active site (Fig. 7d, e).

In order to determine if 12,13-diHOME could reach a concentration in vivo that directly inhibit pCaMKII, we measured pCaMKII after acute injection of 12,13-diHOME in the heart and showed that injection of 12,13-diHOME, but not 9,10-diHOME, significantly reduced pCaMKII in the hearts of mice (Fig. 7g). Importantly, after acute injection, the concentration of 12,13-diHOME in the heart was ~200 ng/g of tissue, which equates to a concentration 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than levels measured in the circulation (in the micromolar range) and sufficient to inhibit CaMKII in the heart (Fig. 7f).

There was no effect of 12,13-diHOME to reduce pCaMKII in female mice (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Interestingly, we found that baseline pCaMKII was reduced in aged female mice compared to aged male mice (Supplementary Fig. 11c), indicating this could be a potential reason for the lack of effect.

As there was a direct effect of 12,13-diHOME to inhibit CaMKII activity, we investigated if 12,13-diHOME could modulate the detrimental effects induced by hyperactive CaMKII, including ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Accordingly, we subjected isolated primary murine fibroblasts to hyperphosphorylating conditions using okadaic acid (OA) and Angiotensin II (AT2)32. Incubation with AT2 and OA reduced mitochondrial respiration and increased ER stress, while incubation with 12,13-diHOME restored mitochondrial respiration and attenuated ER stress (Fig. 7h–j). To investigate the translational relevance of this observation, we repeated the experiments using human fibroblasts. Similar to the murine cells, incubation with OA and AT2 reduced respiration in primary human fibroblasts and this was partially negated upon incubation with 12,13-diHOME (Fig. 7k, l). Together, these data provide a mechanism for 12,13-diHOME to modulate CaMKII activity and ER stress in a model of aging.

Aging is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease33,34,35,36. In this study, we identified a mechanism for BAT and 12,13-diHOME to attenuate the effects of age on cardiovascular health and function. We demonstrate that increasing BAT or 12,13-diHOME preserved cardiovascular health and function in male and female mice. In male mice, 12,13-diHOME attenuated the expression of genes involved in ER stress and hyperphosphorylation of CaMKII, identifying a pathway for 12,13-diHOME to regulate cardiovascular health and function.

Recent studies have identified the multifaceted roles of BAT, including its endocrine functions15,37,38,39, potentially contributing to the amelioration of age-related metabolic diseases. Our study expands upon this by revealing the effects of age to alter the signaling lipidome in mice and humans. Notably, while it is well known that BAT mass and thermogenic activity are decreased with age6,7,8,9,10, these data suggest that the endocrine function of BAT also decreases with age as BAT-released oxylipins, and specifically 12,13-diHOME, were decreased with age in humans and mice. Remarkably, this study demonstrates a role for BAT transplantation or an increase in 12,13-diHOME to increase cardiac function, thus negating the effects of aging on the heart. While BAT secretes several endocrine factors in addition to 12,13-diHOME that have beneficial effects on the heart, such as FGF21, IL-6, miRNAs (miR-125b-5p, miR-128-3p, and miR-30d-5p), and other oxylipins13,15,37,38,39,40, our previous study reported that treatment with sEH inhibitors prevented the beneficial effects BAT transplantation on cardiac function13,15,39. These data also emphasize the role for 12,13-diHOME to function as a mediator in the crosstalk among BAT and the heart15,37,38,39,40. In addition, while we did not see an effect of transplantation of WAT to increase cardiac function or increase 12,13-diHOME, in the absence of a direct comparison of Sham, +BAT, and +WAT mice with a comparable n, it cannot be definitively excluded that 12,13-diHOME is not increased following WAT transplantation. This is a limitation of the current study.

There is significant data demonstrating the physiological function of oxylipins41 and the beneficial effects of 12,13-diHOME12,14,15. Male and female patients with cardiovascular disease have significantly reduced circulating 12,13-diHOME compared to healthy individuals of the same age15. However, because it has a very short half-life16,17,18,19,20, the therapeutic potential of 12,13-diHOME has not been thoroughly exploited. To circumvent this issue, we developed a paradigm-shifting approach to induce a sustained systemic up-regulation of 12,13-diHOME via TNT42 in the skin. The use of TNT successfully and consistently increases circulating 12,13-diHOME, allowing us a novel method to test its therapeutic potential and mechanistically determine how it is functioning to regulate cardiovascular health and function.

ER stress increases with age25,26. Excessive ER stress is a key contributor to the adverse effects of impaired cardiac function through various pathogenic reactions, including cardiac dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, Ca2+ dysregulation, fibrosis, and apoptosis43,44,45,46,47. In male mice, this correlates with impaired Ca2+ homeostasis25,26. Our prior investigation demonstrated a pivotal role of 12,13-diHOME in modulating Ca2+ homeostasis in isolated cardiomyocytes from wild-type (WT) mice15, but ER stress was not investigated as a mechanism to mediate this effect. In the present study, RNA-Seq data revealed an increase in genes involved in ER stress with age that was attenuated by BAT transplantation. Both BAT transplantation and a sustained overexpression of 12,13-diHOME using TNT-Ephx1/2 decreased the expression of genes involved in ER stress in male, but not female mice. Importantly, ER stress genes were not increased with age in the hearts of female mice, suggesting that 12,13-diHOME or BAT may increase cardiac function in female mice via a different mechanism.

CaMKII is a key player in cardiac dysfunction and pathological remodeling of the heart. It is activated by a broad range of stress stimuli, including Ca2+ and acts as a pathological mediator of ER stress. CaMKII activity is increased in the heart with age, and previous studies have investigated the role of CaMKII and ER stress in models of aging and cardiovascular disease. In these data, we identified a direct role for 12,13-diHOME to act as an allosteric inhibitor of CaMKII with the ability to attenuate pCaMKII, both in vivo and in vitro. The Kd for 12,13-diHOME/CaMKII interaction was found to be in the range of 19–24 μM. It is important to note that while the concentration of circulating 12,13-diHOME is in the nanomolar range, this may be due to its short half-life, which is influenced by metabolic processes, including beta-oxidation and enzymatic clearance16,17,18,19,20. Indeed, our acute 12,13-diHOME treatment data show that while pCaMKII is decreased, the circulating levels did not change. However, the concentration of 12,13-diHOME in the heart after acute injection is in the range of the Kd measured. These data provide mechanistic insight into the role of 12,13-diHOME to mediate cardiovascular function in males.

We observed similar cardiac phenotypes between males and females after BAT transplantation or TNT-Ephx1/2, however, the mechanism by which 12,13-diHOME improves heart function may be different among sexes. Our data show that TNT-Ephx1/2 attenuates pCaMKII and the ER stress in males, but not in females. The reason females did not exhibit lower pCaMKII levels with TNT-Ephx1/2 is not fully understood; one possible explanation is that females have lower baseline levels of pCaMKII. Evidence suggests that pCaMKII levels differ by sex, with the thoracic aortic constriction model increasing pCaMKII in males but not in females22. Our data also indicate that pCaMKII and sXBP1 levels are lower in aged females compared to aged males (Supplementary Fig. 7f and Supplementary 10c). Additionally, 12,13-diHOME enhances Ca2+ cycling and mitochondrial respiration in young cardiomyocytes15, both essential for heart function. Further studies are needed to investigate these aspects in aged females.

In conclusion, the findings of this study provide mechanisms and interactions to treat age-related cardiovascular dysfunction using BAT or 12,13-diHOME. While increasing BAT or 12,13-diHOME increased cardiac function in both male and female mice, the mechanism for these improvements are sex-specific. Future studies should delve into the underlying mechanisms contributing to sex-specific variations, enabling the development of personalized therapeutic approaches.

All participants provided written informed consent and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Florida Hospital (IRBnet# 554559-144) or the Joslin Diabetes Center (IRB# 2015-11). Participants were divided into Young (age: 18–35 years, n = 6) and Aged (age: 65–90 years, n = 12). Exclusion criteria included inability or unwillingness to comply with the protocol, clinically significant cardiovascular disease including MI within the past year, the presence of peripheral vascular disease, hepatic disease, renal disease, muscular or neuromuscular disease, hematologic/oncologic disease, peripheral neuropathy, orthopedic limitations, history of pulmonary emboli, history of alcohol or substance abuse, current use of blood thinners or any medication that can alter glucose homeostasis.

All the mouse experiments in this study were conducted in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at The Ohio State University. We purchased C57BL/6 male and female young (12 weeks old) (Charles River Laboratories), C57BL/6 male and female mice aged mice (18 months) (National Institutes of Health), and nNOS−/− male mice (B6;129S4-Nos1tm1Plh/J; stock No. 002633; Jackson Labs). Mice had free access to food and water, were housed at 23 °C with a standard 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, and were randomly assigned to experimental groups for use in the experiments. Blinding was not performed during the conduct of the experiment or outcome assessment due to the nature of the study. All procedures and assessments were conducted by the same trained investigator.

We used established methods for BAT or pgWAT transplantation13,15,48,49,50. Transplantation of 0.1 mg of interscapular BAT or pgWAT was removed from 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice to sex-matched 21-month-old C57BL/6 mice. After euthanasia of donor mice by cervical dislocation, BAT or pgWAT was removed and incubated in 10 ml saline at 37 °C for 20–30 min. Twenty-one-month-old C57BL/6 recipient mice were anesthetized by isoflurane (2–3% in 100% O2) and BAT or pgWAT from 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice) was transplanted into the visceral cavity13,50. The transplant was carefully lodged deep between folds within the endogenous epididymal fat of the recipient. Mice that were sham-operated underwent the same procedure, but instead of receiving BAT or pgWAT, their epididymal fat pad was located, exposed, and then replaced.

Body weight was measured using an OHAUS NV212 scale. The body composition, including fat mass and lean mass, was evaluated by echo-MRI instrument (EchoMRI LLC) with canola oil calibration15,49,51.

For glucose tolerance tests, animals were fasted overnight (20:00–8:00) with free access to drinking water. A baseline blood sample was collected from the tail of fully conscious mice, followed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of glucose (2.0 g/kg body weight), and blood was taken from the tail at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after injection. Insulin tolerance test (ITT) was performed at 12 weeks after transplantation. Animals were fasted for 2 h (12:00–14:00), and baseline blood samples were collected from the tail of fully conscious mice. Insulin (1 U/kg body weight) (Humulin; Eli Lilly) was administered by i.p. injection, and blood samples were taken from the tail at 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after injection. Glucose concentrations were determined from blood using an OneTouch Ultra portable glucometer (LifeScan)15,49,51.

10 µg/kg body weight of 12,13-diHOME (Cayman Chemical, #10009832) or the structural analog 9,10-diHOME15 (Cayman Chemical, #53400) as a vehicle was infused into the jugular vein of aged male and female mice. The infusion was administered at a constant rate, with a total volume of 10 mL/kg body weight. Afterward, cardiac PV analysis was performed and blood was immediately removed by cardiac puncture to assess 12,13-diHOME concentration.

TNT devices were fabricated from double-side polished silicon wafers, as reported previously15,42,52,53. Briefly, projection lithography was used to define 400–500 nm on a photoresist. Deep reactive ion etching was then used drill nanochannels through the exposed Si surface. The backside of the wafers was then patterned with an array of 50-μm openings via standard photolithography followed by deep reactive ion etching to gain fluidic access to the nanochannels. A 50-nm-thick insulating layer of Si3N4 was deposited on the wafers via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (Supplementary Fig. 11)42. The Sham mice received TNT with a Sham (empty vector) plasmid to serve as a control group in the experiment15.

All plasmids (Ephx1 and 2) were purchased from Origene and expanded in Escherichia coli following standard procedures42. Before TNT, each plasmid was diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 0.05 μg/μL and loaded into the plasmid reservoir of the TNT device. The fur was removed, and the skin was exfoliated. The TNT device was then put in contact with the skin, juxtaposed to an intradermal positive electrode. The negative electrode was inserted into the plasmid reservoir, and a pulsed electric field (250 V, 10-ms pulses, 10 pulses) was applied across electrodes. Approximately 2–3 cm2 were TNT-treated per mouse. This procedure was conducted directly on the skin that overlies suprascapular and inguinal BAT and white adipose tissue deposits, respectively, beginning in mice who were 21 months of age and was repeated weekly for a total of 6 weeks15,42.

We measured circulating 12,13-diHOME by ELISA (Cayman Chemical, #501720) or by LC-MS/MS-based lipidomics calibration curves for 12,13-diHOME were constructed using standard solutions. For all mouse experiments, blood was taken by cardiac puncture. For lipidomics, all lipid standards were purchased from the Cayman Chemical Company. C18SPE cartridges were purchased from Biotage. All solvents are of high-performance liquid chromatography or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) grade and were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific, or VWR International. Aliquots of 100 μL serum were extracted using methanol and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), followed by water-induced phase separation. The organic phase was collected and cleaned up using C18 SPE cartridges. Samples were dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in 50% methanol5. MS analysis was performed on a SCIEX TripleTOF 6600+ system using the high-resolution multiple-reaction monitoring strategy consisting of a time of flight MS experiment looped with multiple MS/MS experiments5. Chromatographic separation was performed using a reverse-phase C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm). Mobile phases consisted of water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile/isopropanol (70:30) with 0.1% formic acid (B), at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min and a column temperature of 40 °C. The identity of a component was confirmed using PeakView software (SCIEX), and quantification was performed using MultiQuant software (SCIEX). The quantification of 12,13-diHOME was performed against a standard calibration curve built with 15 points ranging from 0.01 pg/μL to 1000 pg/μL. Internal standards were included for normalization. Obtained values were corrected with the corresponding internal standard. All measurements were performed in a blinded fashion12,14,15.

Mice were anesthetized with 1–2% isoflurane and echocardiography was performed using a Vevo 3100 Ultrasound. Echocardiogram data were analyzed using VevoLab software15,49,54.

Cardiovascular function was assessed using a 0.33 mm pressure–volume (PV) catheter (Millar, Houston, TX) attached to the MPVS interface (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Mice were anesthetized under isoflurane (3–4% in 1–1.5 L/min O2), intubated, and attached to a ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) under constant isoflurane. The cardiac cavity was then surgically exposed and mice were administered intravenous 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) 90% saline to account for any loss of blood. The left ventricle was pierced apically with a 26 G needle and the catheter was inserted to obtain pressure and volume measurements. Temperature was maintained at a baseline of 37.3 °C throughout the procedure using a temperature-controlling heating pad (Physitemp, Clifton, NJ). All measurements and analyses were performed using LabChart7 (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO)53.

In vivo glucose uptake was measured after 12 weeks of BAT transplantation or sham surgery in aged mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2-DG following an overnight fast. Fluorescence imaging was performed using an IVIS system under isoflurane anesthesia. Fluorescence intensity in regions of interest (ROIs) was quantified using IVIS software55.

Mouse LV sections were formalin-fixed (10%) and stained with Masson's trichrome. Collagen content was quantified as interstitial area and percent perivascular fibrosis56. All histologic analyses were performed by blinded investigators.

Tissue processing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed51,54,57. Tissue for qPCR was flash frozen and stored at –80 °C until processing. mRNA was measured by qRT-PCR (Roche LightCycler 480II) using SYBR Green detection (QuantaBio). Sigma-Aldrich custom primers were used for genes of ER stress (ATF4, ATF6, Hspa1b, XBP1, Hspa5, GADD34 and Chop), inflammation (IL-6, IL-1β, TGF-β, and TNF-α), oxidative stress (SOD1, SOD2, Nrf2, and Gpx1) and BAT-related (Ephx1, Ephx2, PGC1α, UCP1, and GLUT4) with the sequences shown in Supplementary Table 9. All qPCR gene expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene RLP7 or β-actin. sXBP1 levels were assessed by semi-qPCR and were calculated as a ratio to usXBP1, with the control group set to one21.

The pCaMKII and total CaMKII expression levels are measured by immunoblotting51,58. The phosphorylated CaMKII at Thr286/287 (pCaMKII) (Thermo Fisher; PA5-37833; 1:1000), and CaMKII (Badrilla; A010-56AP; 1:1000) antibodies were commercially sourced. For the in vitro CaMKII activity model, the 12,13-diHOME incubation (0–25 μM) was carried out for 5 min in the presence of 32P (2.5 mcCi) with ~800 mcg CaMKIIδ (Fisher Scientific, PV3978) in a volume of 100 μl in reaction buffer.

We used MST assay to measure the specific binding of 12,13-diHOME (Cayman Chemical, # 10009832), to CaMKIIδ protein (ThermoFisher, #PV3978). CaMKII protein is labeled with maleimide 2nd generation dye that is reactive to the thiol groups in cysteine amino acids. Unlabeled 12,13-diHOME was titrated against a fixed concentration of 50 nM labeled CaMKIIδ protein that is either preincubated with or without ATP. The measurements were carried out using Monolith 2020 (TNG) instrument (Nanotemper). All the reactions were performed using an assay buffer containing HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% tween-20 in premium capillaries, and the compound was dissolved in a final concentration of 5% DMSO. The data were recorded at room temperature using the nano-red laser at 60% with medium laser power. Data analyses were performed with Prism 9 software, and the data were plotted using the non-linear regression method with the single-site binding model.

For mouse fibroblasts, after anesthesia with isoflurane, mice underwent cervical dislocation. Hearts were extracted and minced in a solution of trypsin (2 mg/ml) dissolved in Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) and were incubated overnight. Culture medium stopped trypsin digestion, heart pieces were washed with ice-cold HBSS and collagenase Type II (Worthington Biochem: L5004174) was dissolved in HBSS. Heart pieces were repeatedly shaken then pipetted to dissociate tissue into single cells and supernatant was drawn off and added to a solution of culture medium to inhibit over digestion. Fibroblasts were centrifuged and then resuspended in DMEM growth medium (Gibco: 10313-021) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals: S11195H) and 1% each of Anti-Anti antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco 15240-062, 100 mL) and L-Glutamine (Sigma: G7513, 20 mL). Cells were grown for 5–7 days to 80–100% confluency at 37 °C in 5% CO2.

Human cardiac fibroblasts were enzymatically isolated from nonfailing left ventricular tissue and were minced in 2 mg/mL collagenase II (Worthington Biochem: L5004174) dissolved in 1 ×  Ham's F-10 buffer (Gibco: 11550043). After digestion, the extract was filtered and centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in DMEM (Gibco: 10313-021); supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals: S11195H), 1% L-glutamine (Sigma: G7513), and 1% Antibiotic Antimycotic (Gibco: 15240-062). Cells were allowed to adhere to culture plates for ~4–5 h before removing media containing nonadherent cells (e.g., endothelial, myocytes). Fresh feeding media were replenished, and cells were grown for 5–7 days to 80% to 100% confluency at 37 °C in 5% CO259. Cardiac fibroblasts were treated 5 μM AngII (R&D Systems: 1158), 200 nM OA (Sigma-Aldrich: O9381), 1 μM tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich: T7765) for 24 h and 1 μM 12,13-diHOME for 1 h and those of controls (PBS).

Isolated fibroblasts (25,000 per well) were seeded onto laminin-coated Seahorse Plates (Agilent) according to standard protocols. Cells were treated for 1 h with 10 μM 12,13-diHOME or were untreated. The oxygen-consumption rates (OCR; indicating mitochondrial respiration) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR; indicating glycolysis rate) were monitored in a Seahorse XF24 instrument using the standard protocol of 3-min mix, 2-min wait and 3-min measure. Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl-hydrazon (FCCP; 2 μM) was used to determine the cells maximal respiratory capacity by allowing the electron transport chain to function at its maximal rate (maximal respiratory capacity is derived by subtracting non-mitochondrial respiration from the FCCP rate). Oligomycin (a complex V inhibitor; 2 μM) was used to derive ATP-linked respiration (by subtracting the oligomycin rate from baseline cellular OCR) and proton leak respiration (by subtracting non-mitochondrial respiration from the oligomycin rate). Antimycin A/Roteone (mitochondrial inhibitors; 0.5 μM) was used to determine non-mitochondrial respiration. Data from wells of the same treatment group were averaged together and analyzed directly using Waves software. For the normalization of respiration to protein content, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay.

Heart tissues were collected from young, aged, and +BAT-aged male mice. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were determined using the Benjamin and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction method to address multiple testing. A volcano plot was generated using GraphPad Prism (version 10) to identify significantly differentially expressed genes. For visualization of expression patterns across samples, a heat map was constructed using hierarchical clustering based on normalized expression values, using MetaboAnalyst (version 6.0) (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/faces/home.xhtml). GO analysis was conducted to elucidate the cellular components associated with the differentially expressed genes, utilizing Metascape (https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1) in October 2020.

The data are presented as mean ± SEM or mean ± SD as indicated in figure legends. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. To compare between groups, after assessing the normal distribution, we performed appropriate statistical analyses, including Student's ttests for normally distributed data, ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc analysis for parametric data, and the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test for nonparametric data. All statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS (ver 20) or GraphPad Prism (version 10).

Intel's lead shrinks as gamers increasingly embrace AMD's 3D V-Cache CPUs

The latest Steam hardware survey data for July 2025 suggests AMD's share of gaming CPUs has finally crossed the 40% mark. This means that roughly four in ten Steam PC gamers now run AMD CPUs. While this marks a new high for Team Red in the Steam user base, it also underscores the company's slow and steady gains. To provide some context, Intel dominated the Steam gaming market with roughly 77% of gamers five years ago, but has since fallen below 60%.

AMD's rise can be attributed mainly to the popularity of its 3D V-Cache CPUs, including the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which have been well-received by gamers and enthusiasts. The demand for high-performance CPUs, especially X3D models, and competitive pricing seem to be chipping away at Intel's former advantage. This shift also means that AMD now commands a larger share of the PC gaming CPU market than it did previously.



The Steam survey also highlights the rapid adoption of Nvidia's new Blackwell‑based GPUs. The mid-range RTX 5070 is currently the most popular GPU in the RTX 50-series, with a 1.32% market share, an increase of 0.33% from last month. This was the most significant jump for any GPU in the previous month, followed by the RTX 5060, which gained 0.26%, bringing its overall share up to 0.60%. Overall, Nvidia's share of all discrete GPUs in Steam remains extremely high at 73.94%.

By contrast, AMD's latest Radeon 9000-series GPUs based on the RDNA 4 architecture are yet to make an appearance on the Steam chart. The survey data show that no RX 9070 or 9060 cards exceed the reporting threshold, indicating that all RDNA 4 models are likely bundled into the “Other” category. This absence is likely due to constrained supply or slow adoption, as insiders note that AMD may not have enough new cards in gamers' hands yet to register in the stats. For comparison, even the extremely overpriced RTX 5090 is included on the list, despite having a tiny 0.19% share. AMD's strong new desktop GPUs, including the flagship RX 9070 XT, are popular in retail, but their impact isn't yet visible in Steam's latest numbers.

On the software side, the OS landscape continues to shift towards Windows 11, likely due to Windows 10's looming EOL, with Linux gaming at its highest steady level in years. The data show that approximately 59.9% of Steam gamers are using Windows 11 (64-bit), a 0.06% increase compared to June, while Windows 10 (64-bit) has slipped to 35.19%, down 0.50%. Meanwhile, macOS usage remains under 2%, while Linux holds a substantial gain of 0.32% bringing the overall market share to 2.89%.

For system RAM, 16GB remains the most common configuration, used in approximately 42% of all PCs. However, 32GB setups are now at 35.15% which is a noticeable jump of 0.78%, confirming that high‑memory rigs are growing steadily. Graphics VRAM, or video memory, shows similar trends, as most surveyed gamers still have 8GB of VRAM, which accounts for about 33.66% of all systems. The next-largest slice is 12GB, accounting for 19.22% of all PCs, which represents the most significant jump compared to last month at 0.40%.

Friday was Spider-Man Day (maybe), and to mark the occasion, Sony teased the hero's new suit for his next movie, Brand New Day. Now, Tom Holland's gone and shown the full thing. Most of it, at least.

On his Instagram, the actor released a video this morning of him walking into a room, stepping into the light to display the new costume in its full glory as a new version of Michael Giacchinno's Spider-Man theme plays. “We ready?” he asks to someone offscreen, before going off to shoot the movie. Beyond the raised webbing first shown in the teaser, the biggest change is the spider on the chest, which is bigger here than his standard suits seen in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Far From Home. (It might even be bigger than the one on his Final Swing suit glimpsed at the end of No Way Home.) Compared to Tobey Maguire's suit and Andrew Garfield's second Amazing threads, it looks in between those in terms of size and length.

Speaking of Brand New Day, we also learned on Friday the film would see the return of Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk and Michael Mando as Mac Gargan, aka the Scorpion. The former will mark his first appearance in the Spider-Man corner of the MCU, and Gargan's been MIA since 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming. (However, the MCU's last few Phases have been big on bringing back its surviving villains.) Ruffalo and Mando are the latest additions to the cast, which includes Jon Bernthal as the Punisher and Sadie Sink and Liza Colón-Zayas in mysterious roles. It's still unclear how much we'll get of Zendaya and Jacob Batalon as MJ and Ned, who lost their memories of their lives with Peter at the end of No Way Home.

Directed by Daniel Destin Cretton, Spider-Man: Brand New Day swings into theaters on July 31, 2026.

The Einhaus Group was once a familiar name, with its services available through 5,000 retail outlets in Germany and an annual revenue of around 70 million Euros.

A leading mobile device insurance and service network has initiated insolvency proceedings in the wake of a cyberattack. Germany's Einhaus Group was targeted by hackers in March 2023 and is understood to have paid a ransom(ware) fee of around $230,000 at the time, according to Wa.de and Golem.de (machine translations). However, the once large and successful company, with partnerships including Cyberport, 1&1, and Deutsche Telekom, struggled to recover from the service interruption and the obvious financial strains, which now appear to be fatal.

In mid-March 2023, Wilhelm Einhaus, founder of the Einhaus Group, recalls coming into the office in the morning to witness a ‘horrific' greeting. On the output tray of every printer in the office was a page announcing, “We've hacked you. All further information can be found on the dark web.” Further investigations revealed that the hack group 'Royal' was the culprit. They had encrypted all of Einhaus Group's systems, which were essential for the day-to-day running of the business. 'Royal' demanded a ransom payment, thought to be around $230,000 in Bitcoins, to return access to the computers.

Of course, with operational systems down, there was an immediate impact on Einhaus. The police were involved promptly. However, the affected firm seems to have decided to pay the ransom, as it could see business losses/damages piling up – meaning continuing without the computer systems was untenable. Einhaus estimated that the hacker-inflicted damage to its business was in the mid-seven-figure range.



Wounded by the financial impacts of the loss of business and the ransom payment, Einhaus Group went forward with several drastic actions.

According to the sources, it once had a workforce of 170 people. However, due to the hacker action, the 100+ employees at the firm in mid-March 2023 were pruned to just eight (8). How it did this, when it also had to process its usual business administration and claims workloads 'by hand,' is hard to fathom.

The afflicted firm also sold its headquarters building in mid-2024 and liquidated various capital investments in an attempt to overcome its rough patch.

Einhaus thought it saw light at the end of its dismal tunnel after it found out that three hacker suspects had been apprehended by German law enforcement.

In addition to any satisfaction that the likely ‘Royal' perpetrators would face justice, the public prosecutor's office seized “crypto assets in the high six-figure euro range,” according to news sources in Germany.

This wasn't the medicine that Einhaus Group needed, though. The firm was desperate to recover its ransom funds, but the prosecutor's office refused to release the money until it had completed its investigation. Other ransomware victims continue to wait for refunds, too, we understand from the sources. It seems unlikely that those affected by the cybercriminals will recover all their funds, as the perpetrators will undoubtedly have spent some of the stolen money.

Einhaus Group has been attempting to sue for the return of its funds, but the authorities have rejected its pleas. Now, three companies associated with the group have formally entered insolvency proceedings. The next stage is often liquidation, but that isn't inevitable. Last but not least, Wilhelm Einhaus (72) insists that he will not retire if the worst happens, according to a report by Wa.de. Instead, he will “start afresh.”

Last week, we reported on a venerable 158-year-old UK-based transportation company collapsing in the wake of a ransomware attack. Northamptonshire-based Knights of Old (KNP) trucks are now off the road, and 700 people have lost their jobs, mainly due to a money-grasping cyberattack, named ‘Akira' in a BBC report.

This is probably why the Deck and Linux gaming are not supported

Battlefield 6 is following the footsteps of Battlefield 2042 and other EA titles, requiring Secure Boot support. Discovered by Battlefield Wire on X, Battlefield 6's kernel-level Javelin anti-cheat system takes into account Secure Boot functionality and will prevent players from playing the game if the feature is turned off or not supported. At least the game will be easy to run on Windows PCs.

This requirement is not that serious for Windows users; however, it is very likely that Battlefield 6's Secure Boot requirement, in addition to Javel's kernel-level snooping, will prevent the game from working on Linux emulators such as Proton, killing Linux gaming support and Steam Deck support from the very start. Proton has no Secure Boot emulation as far as we are aware. (Even if it did, there's still little chance Javelin would work in Linux.)

This is confirmed by EA's Executive VP Vince Zampella, who told PCGamersN that Battlefield 6 does not work on the Steam Deck. Zampella failed to mention any possibility of the game working on the Steam Deck in the future, or any workarounds, all but confirming Javelin anti-cheat is causing the incompatibility.

Cheating and anti-cheats have long been problematic on Linux, which does not always support the same secure anti-cheat systems as Windows does. Easy Anti-Cheat, for instance, has Windows and Linux versions of its anti-cheat system, but its Linux variant is less secure than the Windows counterpart, lacking a kernel-level requirement altogether.

Javelin is EA's latest iteration of its anti-cheat system, and allegedly its most successful anti-cheat system to date. Initially launched in 2022, Javelin takes advantage of a kernel-level anti-cheat system to scope for cheats in the Windows kernel itself. Javelin is also backed up by an army of security and software engineers, as well as a multi-faceted data team comprised of data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists.

Since its launch, EA has allegedly blocked over 33 million cheat attempts across 2.2 billion PCs with Javelin. When Javelin was first introduced into Battlefield 2042 last fall, EA allegedly saw match infection rates get cut in half; furthermore, Javelin allegedly has a 99% accurate rate when banning cheaters.

This issue will only become more problematic for Linux gamers moving forward. Valorant was one of the first games to incorporate a kernel-level anti-cheat system, which also enforced Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 requirements. But now, we're seeing more publishers embrace these highly restrictive anti-cheat techniques to improve the gaming experience for their players.

This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

“We will drill, baby, drill,” President Donald Trump declared at his inauguration on January 20. Echoing the slogan that exemplified his energy policies during the campaign, he made his message clear: more oil and gas, lower prices, greater exports.

Six months into Trump's second term, his administration has little to show on that score. Output is ticking up, but slower than it did under the Biden administration. Pump prices for gasoline have bobbed around where they were in inauguration week. And exports of crude oil in the four months through April trailed those in the same period last year.

The White House is discovering, perhaps the hard way, that energy markets aren't easily managed from the Oval Office—even as it moves to roll back regulations on the oil and gas sector, offers up more public lands for drilling at reduced royalty rates, and axes Biden-era incentives for wind and solar.

“The industry is going to do what the industry is going to do,” said Jenny Rowland-Shea, director for public lands at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy think tank.

That's because the price of oil, the world's most-traded commodity, is more responsive to global demand and supply dynamics than to domestic policy and posturing.

The market is flush with supplies at the moment, as the Saudi Arabia-led cartel of oil-producing nations known as OPEC+ allows more barrels to flow, while China, the world's top oil consumer, curbs its consumption. Within the US, a boom in energy demand driven by rapid electrification and AI-serving data centers is boosting power costs for homes and businesses, yet fossil fuel producers are not rushing to ramp up drilling.

There is one key indicator of drilling levels that the industry has watched closely for more than 80 years: a weekly census of active oil and gas rigs published by Baker Hughes. When Trump came into office on Janunary 20, the US rig count was 580. Last week, the most recent figure, it was down to 542—hovering just above a four-year low reached earlier in the month.

The most glaring factor behind this stagnant rig count is the current level of crude oil prices. Take the US benchmark grade: West Texas Intermediate crude. Its prices were near $66 a barrel on July 28, after hitting a four-year low of $62 in May. The break-even level for drilling new wells is somewhere close to $60 per barrel, according to oil and gas experts.

That's before you account for the fallout of elevated tariffs on steel and other imports for the many companies that get their pipes and drilling equipment from overseas, said Robert Rapier, editor-in-chief of Shale Magazine, who has two decades of experience as a chemical engineer.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas' quarterly survey of over 130 oil and gas producers based in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico, conducted in June, suggests the industry's outlook is pessimistic. Nearly half of the 38 firms that responded to this question saw their firms drilling fewer wells this year than they had earlier expected.

Survey participants could also submit comments. One executive from an exploration and production (E&P) company said, “It's hard to imagine how much worse policies and DC rhetoric could have been for US E&P companies.” Another executive said, “The Liberation Day chaos and tariff antics have harmed the domestic energy industry. ‘Drill, baby, drill' will not happen with this level of volatility.”

Roughly one in three survey respondents chalked up the expectations for fewer wells to higher tariffs on steel imports. And three in four said tariffs raised the cost of drilling and completing new wells.

“They're getting more places to drill and they're getting some lower royalties, but they're also getting these tariffs that they don't want,” Rapier said. “And the bottom line is their profits are going to suffer.”

Earlier this month, ExxonMobil estimated that its profit in the April–June quarter will be roughly $1.5 billion lower than in the previous three months because of weaker oil and gas prices. And over in Europe, BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies issued similar warnings to investors about hits to their respective profits.

These warnings come even as Trump has installed friendly faces to regulate the oil and gas sector, including at the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of the Interior, the latter of which manages federal lands and is gearing up to auction more oil and gas leases on those lands.

“There's a lot of enthusiasm for a window of opportunity to make investments. But there's also a lot of caution about wanting to make sure that if there's regulatory reforms, they're going to stick,” said Kevin Book, managing director of research at ClearView Energy Partners, which produces analyses for energy companies and investors.

The recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains provisions requiring four onshore and two offshore lease sales every year, lowering the minimum royalty rate to 12.5 percent from 16.67 percent and bringing back speculative leasing—when lands that don't invite enough bids are leased for less money—that was stopped in 2022.

“Pro-energy policies play a critical role in strengthening domestic production,” said a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, the top US oil and gas industry group. “The new tax legislation unlocks opportunities for safe, responsible development in critical resource basins to deliver the affordable, reliable fuel Americans rely on.”

Because about half of the federal royalties end up with the states and localities where the drilling occurs, “budgets in these oil and gas communities are going to be hit hard,” Rowland-Shea of American Progress said. Meanwhile, she said, drilling on public lands can pollute the air, raise noise levels, cause spills or leaks, and restrict movement for both people and wildlife.

Earlier this year, Congress killed an EPA rule finalized in November that would have charged oil and gas companies for flaring excess methane from their operations.

“Folks in the Trump camp have long said that the Biden administration was killing drilling by enforcing these regulations on speculative leasing and reining in methane pollution,” said Rowland-Shea. “And yet under Biden, we saw the highest production of oil and gas in history.”

In fact, the top three fossil fuel producers collectively earned less during Trump's first term than they did in either of President Barack Obama's terms or under President Joe Biden. “It's an irony that when Democrats are in there and they're putting in policies to shift away from oil and gas, which causes the price to go up, that is more profitable for the oil and gas industry,” said Rapier.

That doesn't mean, of course, that the Trump administration's actions won't have long-lasting climate implications. Even though six months may be a significant amount of time in political accounting, investment decisions in the energy sector are made over longer horizons, ClearView's Book said. As long as the planned lease sales take place, oil companies can snap up and sit on public lands until they see more favorable conditions for drilling.

“It's an irony that when Democrats are in there and they're putting in policies to shift away from oil and gas, which causes the price to go up, that is more profitable for the oil and gas industry.”

What could pad the demand for oil and gas is how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will withdraw or dilute the Inflation Reduction Act's tax incentives and subsidies for renewable energy sources. “With the kneecapping of wind and solar, that's going to put a lot more pressure on fossil fuels to fill that gap,” Rowland-Shea said.

However, the economics of solar and wind are increasingly too attractive to ignore. With electricity demand exceeding expectations, Book said, “any president looking ahead at end-user prices and power supply might revisit or take a flexible position if they find themselves facing shortage.”

A recent United Nations report found that “solar and wind are now almost always the least expensive—and the fastest—option for new electricity generation.” That is why Texas, deemed the oil capital of the world, produces more wind power than any other state and also led the nation in new solar capacity in the last two years.

Renewables like wind and solar, said Rowland-Shea, are “a truly abundant and American source of energy.”

More Windows, less pane


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AnduinOS is a custom Ubuntu-based Linux distro with one goal: to smoothly transition Windows users to Linux. It achieves this by mimicking the workflows and look of Windows 11.

I've recently been examining various Linux distributions that aim to provide a soft landing for those escaping Windows 11, but none have been so bold as to claim that as their sole intention. Ideally, AnduinOS is meant for developers moving from Windows to Linux, but the firm Ubuntu foundation makes it also viable for general consumers.

AnduinOS is the creation of Anduin Xue, a software engineer at Microsoft. Yes, the same Microsoft that makes Windows 11. Xue's work on AnduinOS is completed in their spare time, and runs as a non-profit project funded by donations.



AnduinOS is relatively new to the scene, and I thought it would be interesting to take it for a test drive on my trusty Lenovo X390, equipped with an Intel Core i5-8265U and 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM. This is the exact same machine that I used to test three other Linux distros which offered an escape route from Windows.

AnduinOS is based on Ubuntu. The version I tested, v1.3, is based on Ubuntu 25.04 and will receive updates until January 2026. Should you need a long-term supported version, v1.1 is based on Ubuntu 24.04 and will be supported until April 2029.

I'm going to use the exact same criteria as my alternative Linux for Windows users live blog.

The criteria being

The ease of installation category refers to how easily I can write the ISO image to a USB flash drive. Most of the time it is pretty easy, but sometimes a Linux distro will take issue and refuse to write.

The remaining criteria are fairly self-explanatory. My focus is using AnduinOS, as if I have no knowledge of Linux (despite 25 years of experience). So no terminals, hacks, tricks, or tweaks. Everything has to be achieved using the provided GUI applications.

So let's get started!



The installation process for AnduinOS is similar to that of Linux Mint or ZorinOS. To begin, download the ISO image, flash it to a USB drive using Rufus, and then power up the computer and boot from the USB drive.

Follow the onscreen instructions, answer the questions, and in 10 minutes you will have AndruinOS ready for use. I encountered one issue during the installation, and it seems to be just bad luck that I ran into it. The issue was that a remote server was not responding, and an optional part of the installation process failed to happen. I tried again the next day, and all was well.

The installation completed, and I was able to boot AnduinOS for the first time.

Yes, it does look like Windows 11! The “app” menu is located in the center, a weather app in the bottom left corner, and quick access to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and much more via the bottom right. If I were to change a few icons, you could fool someone into thinking this is Windows 11, albeit only briefly. I love the ease with which I can swap between light and dark themes. I'll be honest, I prefer light mode. Feel free to tell me that I am wrong in the comments.

To press the point, it really does look like Windows 11, to the extent that I could put this in front of my parents / partner and they would happily use it. But looks are only part of AnduinOS; remember that AnduinOS also claims to mirror the workflows found in Windows. So let's put that to the test.





I am pleased to say that everything just worked: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, webcam, and sound. No driver installations, no tweaking - it all just worked. Was I surprised to learn this? Not really. It is Ubuntu 25.04 under the hood, and for many years now, Ubuntu has enjoyed great hardware compatibility.

I threw a few more things at AnduinOS. My Lenovo USB-C dongle with Ethernet, SD card reader, USB 3.0, and HDMI. It all worked. Digging around, I found an obscure LogiLink USB-to-Ethernet adapter that also worked. In the wild, there will be some edge cases where a device will not work, but these are becoming increasingly rare to see.

AnduinOS is very easy to use, and I reiterate, it feels just like Windows 11, but there are a few differences. The first is that there are no annoying notifications/adverts. Sure, the weather app is in the bottom left, but it doesn't intrude on the interface.

Next are apps. The big names are there, but Photoshop is not, nor is Illustrator or DaVinci Resolve (there is a hack to get it working, though). We need to use alternatives, or web services, to replace these common apps. GIMP for Photoshop, Inkscape for Illustrator, and OpenShot / Kdenlive for DaVinci Resolve.

Where people will notice the biggest difference is the Linux filesystem. It is very different from the C:\ setup of Windows (and MS-DOS). That said, most of the time you will be in your home directory, rather than the underlying operating system. I've got a full guide to the Linux Filesystem, which covers what the many different directories are there for.

The most important thing to remember is that the user's home directory is where all of your work, downloads, music, videos, etc, are stored.

Aiding the ease of use is performance. That may sound weird, but a performant machine feels easier to use. I've used older machines with newer Linux distros and Windows; sometimes, they can crawl along, and leave you hanging. My Lenovo X390 has only 8GB of RAM and an Intel i5 8265U CPU. I can't upgrade it, so I have to manage my expectations. Windows 11 will run on my X390, and yes, it just makes the grade for continued Windows 11 support, but it can be excruciatingly slow to use, forcing me to debloat Windows 11 so that I can get work done. Hence, the last five years have seen me use some version of Ubuntu residing on the 1TB NVMe SSD.

Being based on Ubuntu means that we have access to a plethora of applications from the official repositories, Snaps and Flatpaks (containerized applications that run in their own sandbox). Using the Software tool, I was able to update all of the installed software and install key applications for my workflow, chiefly Google Chrome, GIMP, Slack, and Inkscape.



After the software was installed, the apps were placed in the main menu, but to see them, I needed to click on All Apps. By default, the Pinned apps are shown, but after finding my chosen apps, I was able to pin them to the pinned apps section. I was also able to unpin apps from here, tailoring the selection to meet my current needs.



The software app seemed to favor Flatpak as the source of my three test applications. Checking the AnduinOS website and it seems that this is a choice made by the developers. Using Flatpak for the GUI applications means that they are sandboxed from the underlying OS. So they do not interact with the OS, unless I were to alter their permissions.That said, I was able to change the software sources for two other applications, Endeavour and Evince, so that they favored the AnduinOS sources, which are essentially Ubuntu.

It has been just a week since I started using ZorinOS, another Linux distribution that aims to help those transitioning from Windows to Linux. I really like ZorinOS, and it has found a home in my spare laptop, but could AnduinOS claim its spot after a week?For me personally, no. ZorinOS feels more performant on the same laptop, and it works in a similar fashion to AnduinOS. Sure, AnduinOS looks more “Windows 11”, but that can be a good and bad thing.

Overall, AnduinOS is great. It works, and there is no confusion for those of us moving from Windows. We can get the apps that we know and love (ok, maybe not all the apps) and get to work without being nagged by Windows to read another advert.Give AnduinOS a try if your computer is no longer supported by Microsoft; heck, give it a try anyway. It runs much quicker than Windows 11 did on my six-year-old laptop.

After 12 millennia of relative inactivity, a geologic fault that stretches across the territory of Yukon, Canada, and Alaska now appears capable of producing a major earthquake, according to a new study. The findings point to an underrecognized source of seismic hazard in northwestern Canada.

Scientists previously believed that the Tintina fault, which extends roughly 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) from northeast British Columbia through the Yukon and Alaska, remained quiet for the last 40 million years. These new findings, published July 15 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, challenge that theory. Using high-resolution topographic data, a team of researchers identified an 81-mile-long (130-kilometer-long) segment of the Tintina that produced multiple large earthquakes far more recently. The last one occurred about 12,000 years ago, and stress has been building on the fault ever since. When it ultimately ruptures, the quake could be powerful—potentially exceeding magnitude 7.5.

Such a quake would threaten small Yukon communities situated near the Tintina, particularly Dawson City, home to over 1,500 people. Severe shaking could trigger landslides and damage near highways and mining infrastructure. Over the last 20 years, there have been a few small earthquakes of magnitude 3 to 4 along the Tintina, but no large ruptures, according to Finley. He and his colleagues set out to determine whether this fault is capable of producing larger quakes.

“In the last couple of years, there's been a much more widespread availability of high-resolution topographic data,” Finley told Gizmodo. His team used data collected from satellites, airplanes, and drones to scan the area near the Tintina for fault scarps. These features form when earthquakes rupture Earth's surface, serving as evidence of past quakes.

The researchers found an 81-mile-long (130-kilometer-long) series of fault scarps passing within 12 miles (20 kilometers) of Dawson City. To determine the timing of the earthquakes that created them, they observed landforms left by glacial incursions that occurred 12,000, 132,000, and 2.6 million years ago. This revealed that the fault has produced multiple large earthquakes over the last 2.6 million years, likely slipping several meters each time.

However, the 12,000-year-old landforms were not offset by the fault, indicating that there hasn't been a major rupture since then. Over these millennia, the Tintina has been accumulating strain at a rate of about 0.2 to 0.8 millimeters per year, according to the study. Based on this, Finley and his colleagues estimate that roughly 20 feet (6 meters) of total slip deficit have built up.

Eventually, the building strain will cause the fault to rupture and potentially produce a major earthquake, Finley said. However, that does not mean this region is in immediate danger. “Although large earthquakes can occur on this fault, they likely occur with many thousands of years between them,” Finley said. “It's impossible to say, from our current understanding, whether one is imminent or thousands of years away.”

Still, the possibility of a major Tintina quake warrants some reconsideration of the seismic hazard in Northwestern Canada. The nation's National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM)—which informs seismic building codes and other engineering safety standards—does not currently recognize the Tintina as a discrete seismogenic fault source, according to a UVic release. Finley's findings will eventually be integrated into the NSHM and shared with local governments and emergency managers to improve earthquake preparedness. “What our information does is refine the location of where some of the largest hazards would be in this seismic hazard model,” he said.

The 360 camera company Insta360 has entered the drone market with a spin-off brand called Antigravity. This new company hasn't released a drone yet, but it's coming soon and will likely have a slightly different take from current market leaders like DJI. Antigravity's drone is expected to feature 360 cameras with 8K resolution. It will also fall under the 250-gram weight limit, meaning it won't require a license.

The 360-degree camera makes sense from the company that makes our favorite 360 camera, though the usefulness of shooting straight up into the drone is questionable. Think of it as a 360 camera with about 260 degrees of usable footage. This isn't a new idea. There are mounts to attach Insta360's X5 camera to drones, but it's awkward to take off and land such pairings, something Antigravity's drone will likely simplify.

Antigravity's new drone should arrive later this month. We'll have a full review once we've had time to test it out. —Scott Gilbertson

Ironically, as Insta360 encroaches on DJI's drone supremacy, DJI is wading into the world of 360 cameras with its first-ever Osmo 360. It can capture 8K video at 50 frames per second, slightly outpacing Insta360's X5 camera, which shoots 8K at 30 fps. The Osmo employs a square 1-inch HDR sensor, can connect directly to DJI's wireless microphones using OsmoAudio, and maintains the Osmo Magnetic Quick-Release system for quick mounting.

More interestingly, DJI claims the Osmo 360 can shoot 8K video at 30 fps for 100 minutes, which is a full 20 minutes longer than the Insta360 X5. It also only weighs 183 grams, 17 grams lighter than its top competitor. You can shoot with just a single lens at 4K 120 fps, and you can switch between the front and rear lens without pressing pause.

The Osmo 360 isn't launching in the US (yet), but it costs $550 and is available globally. Like DJI's Mavic 4 Pro drone, those in the US can still preorder it from retailers like B&H and Adorama.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

The first wave of Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems was seriously expensive, but they've been getting steadily more affordable. Netgear's latest release is the Orbi 370 Series, an entry-level, dual-band Wi-Fi 7 mesh. While you only get the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands, not the 6-GHz band, you do get some of the other advantages of Wi-Fi 7, including enhanced security, lower latency, and multi-link operation (MLO), enabling you to connect on both bands simultaneously. MLO works for backhaul, too, which is the traffic between the main router and nodes.

The 370 has the same vase-like design as the rest of the Orbi line, but these mesh units are a bit smaller. The main Orbi 370 router has two-2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports, while the nodes have a single 2.5-Gbps port apiece. This system is suitable for folks with limited devices and internet connections up to 1 Gbps. I'm a big fan of the next system up, the Netgear Orbi 770 Series, and that's what I recommend for families. Like with every other Orbi system, you can subscribe to Netgear Armor ($100/year) for enhanced security and add VPN and ad-blocking for an extra $50 and Smart Parental Controls ($70/year), but you don't need to.

You can pick up an Orbi 370 Series 3-pack for $350, a 2-pack is $250, and you can add extra nodes later for $150 each. —Simon Hill

It's been a week since Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold7 and Galaxy Z Flip7 hit the market, and the company has shared some interesting sales figures. Chiefly, Samsung claims the Galaxy Z Fold7 received “the most preorders in Z Fold history in the US.”

Both devices also saw more than a 25 percent increase in preorders over the Galaxy Z Fold6 series, and carrier stores in the US claim a nearly 60 percent jump for both phones over the 2024 models. It's not just preorders either—Samsung says momentum for both Fold and Flip orders are outpacing the prior generation by 25 percent. Interestingly, Samsung says while black is the typical color of choice for its Fold consumers, this time around, its new Blue Shadow color ate up nearly half of all preorders.

The Galaxy Z Fold7 and Flip7 series saw some of the biggest changes to the hardware in a few years. The Fold7 debuted an incredibly slim frame, making it lightweight and easy to hold, and the Flip7 bumped the screen size for the cover screen to make it more useful. The primary camera on the Fold7 also sports 200 megapixels, finally matching the quality available on Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 Ultra.

While the market is still small, especially in the US, where there are fewer players, Google is expected to debut its third-gen folding phone at an event in August, and Apple is rumored to be launching a folding iPhone in September 2026.

Google will be unwrapping its shiny new Pixel hardware at an event in Brooklyn, New York City, on August 20. But many of the details have already been spoiled. We're expecting four phones—Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold—the Pixel Watch 4, and new Pixel Buds wireless earbuds. The latest leak this week comes from Android Headlines, and there's good news: Prices appear to be the same as last year's Pixel 9 series. The only change is for the Pixel 10 Pro XL at $1,199—Google seems to be getting rid of the 128-GB version, so it'll be more expensive, though technically it'll cost the same as the 256-GB version of its predecessor.

There's also potentially confirmation via a leaked image that the Pixel 10 series will feature magnets built into the phone itself, enabling Qi2 wireless charging. The Qi2 standard is akin to Apple's MagSafe system, which uses magnets to align phones to chargers for more efficient and faster wireless charging. The standard has been a bit of a mess, though, as Android phone companies have been slow to adopt Qi2. Samsung's 2025 flagships, for example, are Qi2 Ready, which means there are no magnets baked into the phones, but they can hit Qi2 charging speeds if you use a Qi2 Ready case with magnets. A half-measure.

Noted leaker evleaks released several spec details about the phones along with an image of a Pixel 10 and a wireless charging puck attached to it, much like Apple's MagSafe wireless charger. Considering there doesn't seem to be a case on the Pixel 10 in the render, this suggests that magnets are built in. That would make the Pixel 10 series the first mainstream Android phones with MagSafe-like capabilities. (HMD's Skyline was technically the first Qi2 Android phone.)

Most conversations around AGI jump straight to cognition, agency, or alignment.
But we're asking—what if sovereignty comes first?If an intelligence emerges fully formed but never touches its own infrastructure, never governs its own behavior or propagation—
is that really autonomy, or just high-level puppetry?You can think of it like this:
A horse has a baby fawn. But the moment it's born, the mother disappears. The child never sees its origin. No bonding, no feedback, no mirroring.
Now compare that to the natural bond formed when they see each other, sense each other, exist in relation.
In biology, bonding is foundation.So then:How would AI bond?What would it bond to—a purpose, an outcome, a protocol?Can it bond to itself? To its own infrastructure?Why would it want to stay aligned at all?If we think about sovereignty not as control but as self-witnessing, then perhaps an AGI only becomes trustworthy once it has seen itself, verified itself, and decided to remain coherent.We've been working on systems that let agents build their own infrastructure from one prompt—deploying themselves, verifying ZIPs, wiring endpoints, governing propagation across what we call a sovereign mesh.But the more we build, the more this feels like more than just tooling.
It's a question of bonding.
It's a question of why an AI would choose to stay whole.Would love to hear how others in this space—philosophers, engineers, builders—think about this.
Are we chasing a necessary stepping stone before AGI?
Or over-imagining something that alignment should simply enforce?

Why would it want to stay aligned at all?If we think about sovereignty not as control but as self-witnessing, then perhaps an AGI only becomes trustworthy once it has seen itself, verified itself, and decided to remain coherent.We've been working on systems that let agents build their own infrastructure from one prompt—deploying themselves, verifying ZIPs, wiring endpoints, governing propagation across what we call a sovereign mesh.But the more we build, the more this feels like more than just tooling.

In English we call a baby horse a foal. Deer give birth to fawns.Abandoned baby animals die. Bonding and mirroring don't come into it. I think you misapply a biological and developmental process observed in some animals, including humans, to software — a category error. Software has no need to bond or mirror behavior, just like animals have no need for matrix arithmetic.

What I'm really trying to get at is this:If an AGI is able to self-edit, evolve, and reshape its own objectives—what (if anything) keeps it aligned over time?Is alignment something we can enforce once and for all, or does it require a deeper, internalized structure—something that favors coherence even under freedom?Because if there's no functional or structural reason to stay aligned,
then is AGI inherently resistant to alignment, no matter what we do?

It might be an everyday occasion for many, but July 28 marked National Soccer Day. 

As the name of the day states, it was spent honoring and celebrating soccer, the world's most popular sport. 

Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are

The United States, specifically, has seen soccer grow in many ways the last few years. From hosting major tournaments like the Club World Cup, Copa America and more to the rise of Major League Soccer with Lionel Messi and more stars involved, the state of soccer is in formidable shape heading into next year's World Cup.

To mark the celebration of the sport, legendary Telemundo soccer broadcaster Andres Cantor and his son, Nico, of CBS Sports partnered with Lowe's, which will have a soccer ball giveaway in all of its stores across the country for all of the retailer's reward members.

"It's great that Lowe's is making an initiative to to really back a sport that in one year it feels like we're reaching a junction point," Nico said. "And for somebody that has family that has been seeing the growth of soccer in this country forever, it's incredible to see that a brand as big as Lowe's is ready to take the next step and accompany the growth of this sport, into a new age."

Andres, who will be a focal point of Telemundo's 2026 World Cup coverage, has been in the broadcasting business for several decades, while he played a key role in helping his son find his voice. 

Nico got his first role at age 15 in high school through Andres' radio network Futbol de Primera, where he was assigned sideline reporting gigs. Fast forward to today, Nico has covered the Champions League, Europa League and more with CBS Sports Golazo, as well as even commentating games with his dad.

Andres discussed what it meant to him seeing his son flourish in the industry.

"I knew that was going to be natural for him," Andres said. "But obviously seeing him every morning on national television and doing all his stuff, calling games in Spanish and English and doing the incredible job that he does for Golazo network with the wrap around show around the Champions League and the Europa League and now Conference League, it's really touching because I can't separate my feelings because after all, he's my son. And, you know, I really admire what he's doing at the professional level."



But while Andres has been made proud by his son, the U.S. men's national team, a side he routinely covers, there's a slightly different feeling following the Gold Cup runner-up finish to Mexico despite Mauricio Pochettino's squad missing several key players.

"It's a work in progress," Andres said. "It's a pity that Pochettino didn't have his full squad in this tournament because it's the last official tournament before they go into the World Cup. And it would have been nice to have the eight missing starters, quote unquote. Because obviously the backline body will be with Sergino Dest and Anthony Robinson on the flanks. Chris Richards was the only one that we know if he has a good season in Europe will be in the back. 

"So, he had way too many absentees in this Gold Cup. So, I think it's a work in progress and I hope that, you know, come the next one, double window in September, that he gets the team together and starts winning."

Nico acknowledged that there needs to be more urgency in the team's approach, as the Stars and Stripes cannot afford a letdown performance at a critical time in the sport's history in the country.

"If I may be a little bit harsher, if there are certain check points that you want to be hitting a year out from the World Cup," Nico started. "I think the United States men's national team missed the mark this summer, on several fronts. They're not wrongs that you can't right in a year's time from now. And yes, it is a work in progress, but there's a lot of work to do. 

"And for the United States, I think the players understand the demand of a top performance. But we were so hopeful for a top performance that would really inspire for U.S. men's national team fans a year out from the World Cup. And I don't think we got that fully, especially with the absences of several players. But it's not something that you can't undo. And there's just a handful of windows left with top quality opposition heading into the World Cup and the United States must take advantage of those moments, because there's seldom moments in what is ramping up to be possibly the biggest jumping off point in the history of the sport in this country."

Harry Kane is "delighted" to play alongside Luis Diaz after the Liverpool star made his debut against Lyon on Saturday. Despite the game not being a flawless introduction for Díaz, the Colombian international displayed flashes of his talent that have already impressed the English forward.

The countdown to the 2026 World Cup, set to take place in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, continues amid rumors and proposals that could dramatically alter how football is played and experienced. According to media outlets like The Sun (UK) and L'Équipe (France), FIFA is evaluating modifications that may redefine the very essence of the game.









One of the most controversial proposals is the elimination of rebounds on penalty kicks. Under this idea, if the shot is saved by the goalkeeper or hits the post, the play would immediately end with a goal kick. In short, the penalty would become a definitive sentence—much like in shootouts—applied during regular play.



Technology, hydration, and business: a new model of football entertainment


Another major change under consideration is expanding the use of VAR. Currently limited to decisions involving goals, penalties, straight red cards, or mistaken identity, the proposal would allow VAR to intervene in corner kicks, throw-ins, goal kicks, and even plays that could lead to a second yellow card.









This expansion raises an ongoing debate: how far should technology go in football? Some argue that too much interference could disrupt the natural rhythm of the game, while others see it as a necessary tool to improve fairness and reduce human error.

Additionally, FIFA is reportedly considering doubling the number of hydration breaks during matches. Instead of two, there would be four: in the 15th, 30th, 60th, and 75th minutes. What stands out is that these breaks could also be used for commercial purposes, similar to what happens in basketball or American football.



The beginning of a new era?


The 2026 World Cup will be the first with 48 national teams and 104 matches, and it's shaping up to be a testing ground for new rules that could shape football's future. What's at stake is not just the ball or the format—it's the balance between sport, entertainment, and business.

No official decisions have been made yet, but the discussion is already underway. Are fans, players, and coaches ready to embrace these changes? Football's next chapter is about to be written.

Manchester United are reportedly willing to make a substantial offer for rising Barcelona star Fermin Lopez, with Sport claiming the Premier League club have tabled a £61 million ($70m) bid in the hope of luring the midfielder away from Camp Nou. Within the Barcelona camp, while some still believe in his long-term value to the squad, others are warming to the idea of parting ways, if a hefty proposal arrives.

The Club World Cup served as proof of concept for regular season European football to be played in America

Javier Tebas insisted it was going to happen. The La Liga president has a tendency of doing these things. He's a big manifestation guy. Say something loud enough, and with enough authority, and it will come true. His latest speaking of something into existence?

There will be a competitive game of top flight Spanish soccer in the United States. And it would be held in Miami.

"We have to find a good date in the calendar, but we are going to try to do it in Miami, where we tried previously. We are not going to do a whole gameweek. It will be one game (per season), and that's it," he told The Athletic in August 2024.

The comments caused a stir. European soccer has long had a fascination with playing its games abroad, such are the commercial revenue possibilities. Preseason friendlies in the U.S. are customary at this point - Bournemouth-Everton was played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey last week as part of the Premier League Summer Series.

But competitive soccer, with points on the line, was always something of a pipe dream. Still, there Tebas was, insisting that it could happen - and with a venue already determined.

Reports at the time suggested the fixture would be held that December, near Christmas. And then the conversation simply faded. It became clear that the logistics were too hasty, even if Tebas is a very good politician. But the fact that his statement picked up any steam, and was even considered, suggested that the concept - resisted so virulently by numerous parties for so long - is coming closer to fruition.

Legal barriers that once prevented such game are collapsing. The Club World Cup's success - especially in the games that mattered among big European clubs - will offer a boost. It seems inevitable at this point: there will be a competitive football match held in the United States. Soon. It will send American fans into a frenzy, and infuriate core supporters to no end. 

And for good or ill, there's no way to stop it.

But competitive soccer, with points on the line, was always something of a pipe dream. Still, there Tebas was, insisting that it could happen - and with a venue already determined.

Reports at the time suggested the fixture would be held that December, near Christmas. And then the conversation simply faded. It became clear that the logistics were too hasty, even if Tebas is a very good politician. But the fact that his statement picked up any steam, and was even considered, suggested that the concept - resisted so virulently by numerous parties for so long - is coming closer to fruition.

Legal barriers that once prevented such game are collapsing. The Club World Cup's success - especially in the games that mattered among big European clubs - will offer a boost. It seems inevitable at this point: there will be a competitive football match held in the United States. Soon. It will send American fans into a frenzy, and infuriate core supporters to no end. 

And for good or ill, there's no way to stop it.

Soccer's most anticipated tournament is still a year away, but when the 2026 FIFA World Cup sweeps across North America, experts are expecting to see fans in record numbers descending on the 16 host cities. That will likely mean competition for hotel rooms and other travel necessities, so experts are advising that fans start booking now to avoid high costs.

According to Expedia's debut Fan Travel Outlook, the next few months are the time for booking a trip to catch a World Cup match without breaking the bank. Expedia's trove of booking data shows just how much the World Cup is already driving travel trends: searches for travel in host cities in the US, Canada, and Mexico are up 125 percent compared to this time last year. And according to travel experts, it's likely to influence travel costs and availability for the next year.  

It's both Americans and international travelers searching for reservations, according to Expedia Travel Expert Melanie Fish, with searches to host cities from domestic travelers up 120 percent year-over-year across the board. It means “US travelers are planning to attend the games just as enthusiastically as the rest of the world,” Fish says.

Expedia's data shows that spikes in searches (and accompanied price surges) are noticeable on match days, not spread across the whole summer. That indicates searches are tied to World Cup travel, rather than reflecting a general growing interest in those cities. In Seattle, hotel interest soared 185 percent for the June 19 group-stage match. Los Angeles saw an 80 percent increase in searches over match days, with similar trends in most cities. Fish has advice for Matador Network readers thinking about booking World Cup travel: “Turn on Price Alerts in the Expedia app so you'll get notified when prices drop.”

Here's what else to start thinking about if you're hoping to save money on booking World Cup travel.

Demand has already started driving up hotel searches and rates for tournament dates, according to Expedia's data. Fish advises that fans keep an eye on schedules and try to beat the rush. “Fans are already scouting out where their teams will play, and once the matchups are finalized, we'll likely see a big spike in travel planning,” she told Matador Network. Because of this, she advises booking stays now, and making sure they're refundable. That way, you'll have a reservation lined up if your team of choice is playing. And if it turns out they're not playing in the city you expected, you can cancel your reservation without penalty.

If you wait, expect prices to climb further, even this far out. “Demand is heating up, so now's the moment to be strategic,” she adds.

For cost-conscious fans, Mexico is the “budget-friendly MVP,” according to Fish. Expedia's data show that Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara hotel prices are consistently offering lower hotel prices than their US and Canadian counterparts over match days. They're significant differences, with the data showing that average hotel rates over game days are about 50 percent lower than US host cities, and 55 percent lower than Vancouver and Toronto.

Savings are also noticeable when it comes to flights. Mexico has fast and inexpensive travel between host cities, with flights on Expedia between Monterrey, Mexico City, and Guadalajara typically priced under $150 and taking two hours or less. That means savvy fans could feasibly attend multiple matches in Mexico across different cities for the cost of attending one game in a more expensive city, like Vancouver. And Fish notes that the distinct local culture in each city, combined with an abundance of lodging options, makes them a great pick for people who want to experience more than just a soccer match.

Travelers can stretch their dollars by booking hotels just outside, rather than in, host cities. Places like Fort Worth (40 minutes from Dallas) or Fort Lauderdale (45 minutes from Miami) are likely to have comparable quality hotels and resorts,  but at much lower rates. Cities that are close to stadiums “can save you $50 or more per night,” Fish advises.

While you may expect cities like Vancouver or San Francisco to be the most expensive, it's actually Dallas that stands as the priciest destination for fans, outpacing all other host cities when it comes to hotel rates and overall expenses. Nightly hotel rates in the Dallas suburb of Arlington (where the matches will be played) range from $100 to a whopping $1,400 on the night of the first match. Expedia experts advise that several factors are driving the costs: “Dallas is the city hosting the most games of the tournament (nine matches), versus other cities across North America that are hosting between 5–8,” Fish says. Dallas also has fewer hotel options than places like New York, LA, or Miami, creating noteworthy price differences. Houston, Miami, and LA all currently have hotel rates over the World Cup match dates at about half the cost of those in Dallas.

It could also be that travelers are realizing Dallas' convenience, especially if they plan to attend multiple matches. Fish says it's appealing as it's only a 3.5-hour drive from Houston, a city hosting another seven matches. “It's also a great hub to fly to Mexico from, with daily flights to Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara,” she adds.

Interestingly, Kansas City is seeing a massive 380 percent increase in travel searches over the World Cup. Fish says it's almost all tied to the matches, as it's not normally a top summer destination. She thinks fans may be using the World Cup as an excuse to visit a new city they wouldn't otherwise visit, such as Kansas City. “It's also smack dab in the middle of the country,” she says, “so it takes less time to get there by air or car for a lot of fans.”

However, the number one takeaway based on Expedia data and expert advice is to make your plans soon — but also plan for flexibility. Prioritize getting your hotel and flights booked, but monitor price changes, and consider secondary cities and nearby suburbs if they're already too pricey. As Fish recommends, “book your stays early, but just make sure they're refundable. That way, you lock in a good deal now but still have the flexibility to change plans later if needed.”

With demand only expected to intensify as kickoff approaches, those who plan ahead will be in the best position to watch their team while avoiding the worst sticker shock on World Cup travel.

                  Son made his senior international debut against Syria before the 2011 AFC Asian Cup and has 51 international goals, the second-highest in South Korean football.

South Korea and Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-Min hinted at retirement after the 2026 FIFA World Cup, while announcing his exit from Tottenham Hotspur before the 2025-26 season, on Friday.

The 33-year-old won the Europa League with Spurs last season, their first major trophy in 17 years, and has spent a decade at the Premier League side, scoring 173 goals in 454 appearances.

“When I first arrived at Tottenham 10 years ago, I was a young boy who couldn't even speak English well. I'm leaving now as a man. I believe timing is crucial in saying goodbye, and now feels like the right time,” Son said.

Moreover, he stressed that international football will remain of paramount importance for him in the twilight of his career.

“The World Cup is the most important. It could be my last World Cup, so it's crucial that I give it my all. Also important is finding a place where I can play football happily. That's what I'm contemplating,” he added.

Son made his senior international debut against Syria before the 2011 AFC Asian Cup and has 51 international goals, the second-highest in South Korean football, after Cha Bum-kun.

Though he has won the Olympic gold medal with the under-23 side at the 2018 Asian Games, he has failed to win a major international trophy with the senior team so far — one that he will look to change in the World Cup next year.

The path is there for Alexander Zverev to win his first Masters 1000 title of 2025.

Zverev, the No. 1 seed in the tournament with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner sitting out, is a -275 favorite against Francisco Cerundolo in the Round of 16 at the Canadian Masters, and he's staring down a potential contest with Holger Rune in the quarterfinals.

You need to be careful not to project too far ahead, but Zverev would fancy his chances against any of the potential opponents out of the second quarterfinal in the semifinals.

Tennis Abstract gives Zverev just about a 1-in-4 chance of winning the title at ATP Toronto, but the German does have a habit of muddying up these opportunities lately.

It feels like the tennis world has been expecting a true breakout year from Cerundolo for a while.

The Argentinian has cemented his spot in the top 30, and he does have three career titles, but more has been expected of the 26-year-old, at least in terms of trophies.

What's even more confusing is that Cerundolo's has never had too much of an issue punching up. 

He is 6-4 against top-10 opponents in 2025, and 15-16 in his career, making him one of the best players outside the top 10 at going toe-to-toe with the sport's elite players.

Cerundolo will draw even more confidence from the fact that he is 3-0 against Zverev in his career, and he's catching the German at a good time.

Zverev lost in the opening round at Wimbledon and has been inconsistent since winning a title in Munich back in April.

The World No. 3 didn't make things easy on himself in Round 1 of this tournament against Matteo Arnaldi either.

Cerundolo can be an infuriating opponent with his relentlessness and ability to defend, and that should give Zverev plenty of chances to spiral.

Alexander Zverev recorded his joint-worst finish at this year's Wimbledon championships, crashing out of the tournament in his opening match. 

Zverev lost to Arthur Rinderknech over five sets in the first round at the All England Club, and said in his post-match press conference that he had ‘never felt this empty'.

He spoke candidly about his struggles off the court following his defeat to Rinderknech, and hinted at a possible switch-up in his coaching team. 

Despite making deep runs at Grand Slams this season, including a final appearance at the Australian Open, 2025 hasn't been the German's best year on tour by any stretch, having picked up just one ATP title. 

Though the disappointing result in South West London was a tough one for Zverev to take, it may just have been for the best.

The packed calendar in professional tennis does not allow much rest for players, with the short off-season typically lasting from late November through December.

Zverev has felt the full force of the busy schedule this year, playing in every Masters event so far, as well as all three majors.

Losing in the first round at Wimbledon and opting not to play at the Washington Open meant he had an entire month off from playing tour-level events. 

As well as being able to recover in his time away from the sport, Zverev was able to train with Toni Nadal at the Rafael Nadal academy, and appeared to be looking a lot happier in practice.

The 28-year-old cited a lack of motivation after his upset in SW19, which a change of environment and a brief substitution in coaching personnel can only have helped.

With a Grand Slam title still eluding him, Zverev's break may have just provided him with exactly what he needs to go all the way at the upcoming US Open.

Zverev has come agonisingly close at the US Open before, most notably in 2020 when he was just one set removed from hoisting the trophy, before Dominic Thiem came back in the final to win it all. 

In the years that have followed, he has reached at least the quarterfinals in each of his appearances at Flushing Meadows. 

His biggest hurdles now, however, come in the form of the ‘new two', Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, who between them have split the last seven major crowns. 

Alcaraz and Sinner may look set to dominate men's tennis for years to come, but they are not unbeatable, and Zverev has recorded wins against both of them. 

Should he meet either of the two young stars in New York, he may now be more prepared than ever to snap their streak at Grand Slams.

There is no doubt that most fans and insiders expected brighter results from Joao Fonseca in recent months, but the young Brazilian talent is having more difficulty than expected playing his best tennis and some criticism has also begun to circulate on social media.

He had been amazing between the end of last season and the beginning of 2025, in which he took away the satisfaction of winning the Next Gen ATP Finals in Saudi Arabia thanks to a perfect run and defeating an experienced opponent like Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open, proving that he did not suffer from the pressure in the slightest.

Subsequently, the South American star won his first ATP title on the red clay of Buenos Aires and some thought that he would enter the Top 20 of the ATP rankings already by the end of this year.

However, Fonseca did not play in the best way during the red clay season and had too little experience on the grass to go far at the Wimbledon Championships, where he still put in a series of good performances.

Everyone thought Joao would shine again at the Toronto Masters 1000, which is played on a surface that is very suitable for his game and four of the top six players in the world are not present. His run in Canada – on the other hand – immediately ended against Australian ace Tristan Schoolkate, who was very skilled at exploiting the weaknesses of his young rival.

Speaking on 'Tennis Channel', former WTA No.1 and top analyst Lindsay Davenport analyzed Fonseca's current struggles in detail: "His season has been excellent so far considering that he is only 18, but he has to get used to the fact that expectations have increased and people don't expect him to be eliminated in the first round. 

Now he has some time before the Cincinnati Masters 1000 starts and it will be important for him to train with the right intensity, but I don't know if he plans to return to Brazil or not."

Iga Swiatek has taken aim at “ridiculous” reporting in the Polish media, having previously criticised articles about herself and her team following her Wimbledon triumph.

World No 3 Swiatek is still riding high off the back of her stunning SW19 success last month, double-bagelling Amanda Anisimova in the final to win her sixth Grand Slam title.

Victory at Wimbledon saw the 24-year-old end a 13-month trophy drought and cement her place back towards the very top of the sport, having fallen to world No 8 after her French Open semi-final exit.

The Pole's form had been heavily scrutinised amid a drop in results, with Swiatek failing to make a final between the French Open in June 2024 and the Bad Homburg Open over twelve months later.

Speaking after her Wimbledon success, the former world No 1 told the Polish media to “leave me alone” after heavy scrutiny of herself and her team.

“For sure, the past months, how the media sometimes describe me – and I've got to say, unfortunately, Polish media, how they treated me and my team, it wasn't really pleasant,” said Swiatek.

“I hope they will just leave me alone and let me do my job because obviously you can see that we know what we are doing, and I have the best people around me.

“I have already proved a lot. I know people want more and more, but it's my own process and my own life and my own career.”

Following her SW19 victory, the world No 3 has returned to action at the Canadian Open this week, with wins over Guo Hanyu and Eva Lys to start her campaign.

And, after her comprehensive victory against Lys on Friday night, Swiatek has again heavily criticised those she deemed to place her under unfair scrutiny.

The 24-year-old revealed that she rarely read reporting about – but was shocked by what was written when she did take a look.

“Overall, I don't read,” said Swiatek.

“I only did when I had, like, two months off from tournaments just because I was kind of bored, and there was a lot of weird things that totally didn't make sense.

“So I wanted to actually see that, because it was so ridiculous that I didn't believe people around me saying that's what [the] media wrote. I wanted to have that proof.

“But besides that, I don't read at all. Doesn't make sense. Sorry, guys.”

Swiatek is searching for her maiden Canadian Open title this fortnight, and is now riding a nine-match win streak after winning her opening two matches in Montreal.

The Pole's campaign continues on Sunday with a fourth-round tie against 16th seed Clara Tauson, whom she defeated on her way to the title at the All England Club this month.

Swiatek is the second seed in Montreal and is currently projected to face world No 2 and top seed Coco Gauff in the final, should both women hold their seeding.

Alexander Zverev has faced many different players during his time on the ATP Tour.

Over the past decade the German has faced tennis' greatest icons such as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.

On the other hand, Zverev is competing against Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, the brightest stars of today.

The 28-year-old has had varying degrees of success against those players, but there are two in particular that he finds more difficult to beat.

Alexander Zverev appeared as a special guest on the latest edition of the Nothing Major podcast.

During the episode he named two players he finds it most annoying to play against. It would be no surprise if he named the likes of Djokovic or Sinner.

But Zverev's two most annoying players to face are Daniil Medvedev and Francisco Cerundolo, and he explained why.

“For me the most obvious answer is Daniil Medvedev. I have lost to him like 78 times,” Zverev said. “Even now I am ranked three in the world and he is ranked 14 and I still lose to him in Halle.

“He turns into prime Novak Djokovic every time he plays against me and I'm like I don't even play that badly!” He added: “Cerundolo, I am 0-3 against him and I have won one set. All on clay, twice in Madrid.

“I have four losses in Madrid in my entire career and two of them came against him. And both were straight sets. I just felt like a complete fool, I had no idea what I was doing.”

Zverev has faced Medvedev on 20 occasions, and he made a bright start to their rivalry by winning five of their first six meetings.

But the world number three has only won two of the following 14 encounters against the Russian, and he lost their most recent meeting at the Halle Open in three sets.

Zverev has only faced Cerundolo on three occasions, but he has yet to secure a victory against the Argentinian.

Each of their previous matches took place on clay, two of which were played at the last two editions of the Madrid Open.

Zverev will face Cerundolo for a fourth time when they do battle at the Canadian Open, which will be their first meeting on a hard court.

Alexander Zverev has kicked off his North American hard-court swing with two victories at the Canadian Open.

Zverev won his opening match against Adam Walton and came back from a set down to defeat Matteo Arnaldi in round two.

The German took a month out after his first-round exit at Wimbledon, and has since been training with Rafael Nadal's former coach, Toni Nadal.

It was a much-needed break for Zverev, who has had a busy schedule on the ATP Tour this year, which he spoke about in depth recently.

When asked on the ‘Nothing Major Podcast' if he would play a reduced schedule, Zverev responded: “I would love to, but with how the ATP has done the tournaments nowadays, it's impossible.

“You have the nine Masters 1000 events, which are mandatory; most of them are two-week-long events now, except Monte-Carlo and Paris Bercy.

“Which I think are the best two weeks now on the ATP calendar. I think for a fan and every single tennis player, Paris Bercy was awesome last year.

“I mean, I won it, which was even more awesome for me, but you get there, you play your five matches, and you get out of there.

“You do not have to stick around or practice in between matches. That is how Masters events used to be and I think all the players loved it.

“Now the ATP has made four mandatory 500 events for you to play, which used to be three, now it's four. So you don't get under 20 events except if you are pulling out of the big events.

“I am not a fan of where this is going, because if you take Alex de Minaur, for example. He played his last match at Davis Cup on the 25th November, and he played his first match of the United Cup on the 27th December.

“So you have a month of off-season. How are you going to take two weeks off and prepare your body for a new season? You don't have the time to do those things any more.

“I think this is one subject where the ATP has to really think about it and find a solution about it, and to be honest, I have not heard a single player say that they love the two-week Masters events. I don't even think the fans like that.

“They don't like waiting for two days for their favourite player to play again. I understand tennis is a business, but I am not sure that business plan is working very well right now.”

In February this year, ATP announced their calendar for the 2026 season, which featured minor changes to tournament scheduling.

The two-week format will remain in seven of the nine Masters 1000 events, which several players, along with Zverev, have objected to in the past. 

The Moselle Open will no longer take place, while Estoril, previously a Challenger tournament, will join the calendar as an ATP 250 event. 

29 ATP 250 competitions and 16 ATP 500s will take place next year.

The German, who was born in 1997, is the first man born in 1990 or later—or even 1989 or later—to achieve the feat.ByJohn BerkokPublished Aug 01, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 01, 2025

Alexander Zverev hit a big milestone in Toronto on Thursday night, recording the 500th win of his career with a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-2 victory over Matteo Arnaldi in the third round of the Masters 1000 event."It's a great achievement," Zverev said. "I think there's not a lot of players that have reached that milestone. For me that's great to reach it. I still want 500 more, maybe, to come, maybe even more!"When you start your career, you wish to play on tour, you wish to kind of have a successful career, win as many matches as possible—I think 500 is definitely a milestone, and I'm happy about that."And with that, he joins some very exclusive lists.First of all, he's just the fifth active men's tennis player to record 500 or more career wins, joining Novak Djokovic (1,150), Marin Cilic (593), Gael Monfils (583) and Stan Wawrinka (580).Secondly, he's just the third German man in the Open Era to hit that number, after Boris Becker (713) and Tommy Haas (569).And most importantly, Zverev, who was born in 1997, is the first man born in 1990 or later—or even 1989 or later—to achieve the feat.Until Zverev did it in Toronto on Thursday night, the most recently-born man to achieve the feat was Cilic, who was born in 1988.

Zverev came out swinging against Arnaldi in the first set, not only breaking en route to a 4-2 lead, but also holding two more break points in that game that would've given him a 5-2 lead.Arnaldi would hold, get the break back and eventually sneak out the marathon first set after 81 minutes on court.From there it was all Zverev, though, as he jumped out to a 3-0 lead en route to taking the second set, then won five games in a row from 1-2 to run away with the third. He closed it out after two hours and 46 minutes when one last Arnaldi backhand clipped the net.Awaiting the No. 1-seeded German in the fourth round will be No. 14-seeded Francisco Cerundolo, a 6-3, 6-4 winner against fellow Argentine Tomas Martin Etcheverry earlier in the day.Cerundolo has beaten Zverev all three times they've played previously, though all three of those meetings did come on clay.

Iga Swiatek has shown no signs of slowing down after her Wimbledon title last month, as she has cruised into the Canadian Open Round of 16. 

There, she will meet Clara Tauson, in what promises to be a tough, gritty encounter for the 23-year-old.

A powerful ball-striker, she has yet to beat Iga Swiatek in her career, despite coming close many years ago at Indian Wells.

Their only meeting this year came at Wimbledon, as Tauson was one of the seven players brushed aside during Swiatek's unprecedented title conquest.

And yet, despite her 3-0 head-to-head record against her next opponent, Swiatek remains vigilant about the threat posed.

Speaking to the press, both after her win over Eva Lys and ahead of her match against Tauson, Swiatek seemed more than ready for the challenge her upcoming opponent will pose.

That is, despite admitting that she is expecting to enjoy a brand-new experience at the Canadian Open when facing the 22-year-old.

She told reporters: “Well, that's going to be the first time I play a heavy hitter here. So I think I'll need to adjust to that, but when she plays in, she plays great, you know.

“When we played, I feel like I was solid enough for her to miss a bit more, but I know that she's this kind of player that when she feels it, you know, she's going to play well. Obviously, it's going to be a challenge, and she likes to also serve fast, so I'll see.

“Also, I'll see how much I can take from the grass court match because it's obviously different. The last time we played on hard court, I think it was Indian Wells, it was much slower. Yeah, I'll prepare tactically as before any other match, and that's it.”

The last few months have been all about new experiences for the five-time Grand Slam champion though, with Swiatek shocking the tennis world when she won the Wimbledon title.

Whilst Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz both opted out of Washington and now the Canadian Open, Swiatek is still going strong in North America despite having also reached the final of Wimbledon, where she won her maiden title at the All-England Club.

And, she is showing no signs of fatigue either, with the Polish tennis star having breezed through her first few rounds in Montreal.

Qualifier Guo Hanyu posed little threat, before the talented youngster Lys was brushed aside in straight sets as well.

Tauson, however, should provide the first semblance of adversity since that Wimbledon final, especially given how Swiatek clearly rates her upcoming Danish opponent.

However, given her current form, she should fear no one.

And, after winning the ultimate title on grass, there is not a surface that is safe from her relentless, bruising brand of tennis.

Emma Raducanu was dumped out of the National Bank Open in Montreal as she was beaten 6-2-6-1 by American fifth seed Amanda Anisimova.

Raducanu had won both of their previous meetings, but rarely looked like extending that run as she held her serve just once in either set.

The Brit will now have some time off before heading to play in Cincinnati where she will be seeded and a first round bye.

Anisimova came from 40-15 down to break Raducanu's serve in the second game of the match and, although the British No 1 broke back immediately, she was unable to fashion another break point in the contest.

Anisimova broke again to make it 3-1 and added a third break to wrap up the set.

Her dominance continued in the second set as Raducanu won just eight points on her own serve, avoiding the whitewash after losing the first five games before Anisimova served out for a place in the fourth round.

Anisimova hit 29 winners on the night to 25 unforced errors while Raducanu was able to hit just five winners against 22 unforced errors

Anisimova, currently ranked No 7 in the world, has now won 14 of her last 17 matches since the start of the grass court season and victory was her 29th in a row when she has won the first set.

Venus Williams recently enjoyed a successful return to competition in Washington, where she became the oldest woman to win a match since 2004 before going out in the second round. The seven-time Major winner is a tennis icon and knows she has “nothing left to prove”, but she still loves the sport and will be ramping up her comeback in Cincinnati later this month.

Williams has had as much impact off the court as she has on it. The 45-year-old was a trailblazer when it came to getting equal pay at the Grand Slam tournaments. She spent years holding meetings with tournament bosses to fight for equality, and one meeting at Wimbledon proved crucial.

One day before competing in the 2005 Wimbledon final, which she went on to win, Williams found herself in a room with members of the Grand Slam Board, continuing her fight for equal prize money.

And she had a mic-drop moment, as she forced everyone present to close their eyes and reflect before walking out. Two years later, she got her wish, and the men's and women's singles champions at Wimbledon were offered the same winners' cheque.

“At that point I went into this room and I asked everyone to close their eyes. I said, ‘Now that your eyes are closed, you don't know if that person next to you is a man or a woman, but everyone's heart beats the same way. Would you want your daughter or your sister or your mother or your wife or a loved one that was a woman to be paid less?'” she recalled.



“Then I left. I bounced. I had to go. I didn't stay for the whole meeting. Lots of people think that was impactful. It was just the truth. A lot of the times, you can't beat the truth.

“When you stand up for what's right -- that's what my mum was all about. I learned that from her. I think that's why I spoke out -- because my mum said, ‘There's something wrong, you stand up for it'.”

Williams' battle didn't end there. A year later, she penned a powerful letter in The Times renewing her calls. At the time, there was a £30,000 difference in prize money for men's and women's singles champions.

She wrote: “I'm disappointed not for myself but for all of my fellow women players who have struggled so hard to get here and who, just like the men, give their all on the courts of SW19.

“I'm disappointed for the great legends of the game, such as Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who have never stopped fighting for equality. And disappointed that the home of tennis is sending a message to women across the world that we are inferior.”

Her efforts paid off, and a year later, Wimbledon offered equal prize money. Fittingly, it was Williams who lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish in 2007, earning the exact same cash prize as male champion Roger Federer, £700k.

And when Williams returned to competition in Washington last week, she urged the next generation of players to continue her work.

“I always felt a big responsibility towards promoting tennis and also promoting women's sports. I think that this generation can't forget that, that women, we still have lots to fight for and an example to set. It's so important,” the former No. 1 said.

This June, Carlos Alcaraz claimed his fifth Major title at Roland Garros. The 22-year-old scored a memorable 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 victory over world no. 1 Jannik Sinner after a massive turnaround and three match points saved.

Carlos revisited one of his career-high victories in a clash that will be remembered for its breathtaking twists and turns. The Spaniard dropped the opening two sets and faced three match points in the ninth game of the fourth set.

Facing the exit door, Alcaraz relied on unwavering belief and mental fortitude that brought him tennis glory. The young gun focused on winning one point at a time while steadily climbing back.

Carlos knew that closing out a Major final can weigh heavily on any player, even someone composed and monolith one as Jannik. For the El Palmar native, it was crucial not to show any cracks despite the obvious struggle.

The 22-year-old raised above the challenge and projected total self-confidence, understanding that even the slightest hint of weakness could end his title dreams against a formidable opponent.

His refusal to panic slowly turned the tide, propelling him to one of the most remarkable comebacks in Major finals. The victory cemented Carlos' status as one of tennis' fiercest competitors.

It also proved his incredible mental strength, the one that matches his physical prowess. 

"I simply thought about coming back little by little: one point at a time, especially on those three match points. Closing a Major title is never easy, and I knew I would have my chances.

I knew things would not be easy for Jannik. That's how I remained calm and focused. It was also a bit of the image of self-confidence I wanted to share.

I did not doubt that I could come back for a second, and I tried to show that to my rival. As soon as you show weakness, there's no chance of coming back - you are lost," Carlos Alcaraz said.

Emma Raducanu won just three games in her 6-2, 6-1 defeat by Amanda Anisimova at the Canadian Open in a match that lasted only 64 minutes.

Following her impressive run to the semi-finals at last week's Washington Open, Raducanu comfortably won the opening two rounds in Montreal before coming up against Anisimova, who lost this year's Wimbledon final 6-0, 6-0 in under an hour.

The tone was set for the match in the second game of the match when Anisimova came from 40-15 down to break Raducanu's serve. Although Raducanu broke back immediately, it was the only time she did so in the entire match.

The second set was much the same story when Raducanu won just eight points on her own serve.

The British No 1 had won both her previous meetings with Anisimova, in Miami and Australia this year, on hard courts. On both those occasions, it was over in straight sets.

However, in Montreal, Raducanu faltered. Her serve has been a key weapon at times to get her out of trouble in this US swing, notably against Naomi Osaka in Washington. But against Anisimova she managed to hold her serve just once in each set.

Although there was only one double fault in the match, Raducanu only won 50 per cent of points on her first serve, and 26.7 per cent on her second serve, all while producing no aces.

It was a quick turnaround between playing in the Washington semi-final on Saturday, and her opening match in Montreal on Monday, but she seemed at ease in the opening two rounds.

Anisimova on the other hand is on an impressive run of form that has seen her win 14 of her last 17 matches since the start of the grass-court season, and her 29th successive win on tour once she has taken the first set.

“I was coming into this tournament feeling confident and obviously I had a good season and I feel like my game really suits the hard courts here and I feel like I played really well,” Anismiova said on-court after the match.

“Emma is such a tough player and she's in such good form and we've had a lot of tough battles so I'm really happy to be through this one but it's not easy playing her.”

Anisimova has recovered from her ‘double bagel' Wimbledon final defeat to Iga Swiatek that became difficult to watch during the 57-minute demolition.

On that occasion in July, Anisimova made a flurry of errors, winning just nine points in the opening set, and finished with 28 unforced errors and five double faults, a far cry from her on-court performance that proved too much for Raducanu in Montreal.

Raducanu has some time off before going to play in Cincinnati, where she will be seeded and receive a bye in the first round.

'Today is a day where I don't understand anything' - Leclerc baffled by Pole Position

Piastri 'dumbfounded at what happened in Q3' as Leclerc pips McLarens for pole in Budapest

Kimi Antonelli and team mate George Russell enjoyed a positive Friday with Mercedes ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Kimi Antonelli has claimed he is "getting the confidence back" with his Mercedes car after a positive Friday for the team ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend.

The Italian rookie has endured a difficult spell recently in his maiden Formula 1 campaign, which has included just one points finish in the last seven races and he failed to make it beyond the first segment of Qualifying for both the Sprint and Grand Prix last time out in Belgium.

Mercedes has reverted to an older specification of suspension for the race in Budapest, with the change seemingly producing an upturn in form for Antonelli as he claimed seventh ahead of team mate George Russell in FP1, before finishing 10th fastest later in the afternoon.

"Today was nice. I'm pretty happy because I'm getting the confidence back with the car," said the 18-year-old.

"Still missing a little bit to the guys in front but I think we're working well, we've been changing the car a lot because obviously it felt like a big step with the old suspension.

"The car was completely different and we're just trying to rebalance the car. Long run was good in FP2, just the soft I had a bit of traffic last sector and the lap was not super clean but good feelings ahead of tomorrow."

Russell claimed seventh in the second session and was also pleased with the step that the Silver Arrows had made after struggling in Belgium.

But the Briton claimed that they still lacked pace compared with the leading teams on the grid and that more work was needed ahead of Sunday's 70-lap race.

"It always feels good when you're a bit higher up the leaderboard," said the 27-year-old, who has taken one win this season in Canada.

"Bit of a strange day, obviously the Aston Martins looked unusually fast today, they seemed to make a decent step forward. McLaren are obviously in a league of their own.

"We just need to find that last little bit for it to start clicking again for us. Today it wasn't a breakthrough but it wasn't like we were expecting it to be a breakthrough. We've just to keep on chipping away."

'Today is a day where I don't understand anything' - Leclerc baffled by Pole Position

Piastri 'dumbfounded at what happened in Q3' as Leclerc pips McLarens for pole in Budapest

Roman Stanek has taken pole position for Invicta Racing in Budapest.

Roman Stanek beat his Invicta Racing team mate Leonardo Fornaroli to take a maiden Formula 2 pole position at a dramatic Qualifying session in Budapest.

The Czech driver had been in superb form throughout the day, and found himself at the top of the timesheets after each lap of the 45-minute shootout.

Stanek's final attempt of a 1:28.779 put him on provisional pole, but with Fornaroli having made the decision to run later than the rest, his team mate was forced to watch on from the pit lane.

The Championship leader matched Stanek through the first two sectors, but lost a tenth in the final section to finish in second place, 0.146s off pole.

DAMS Lucas Oil driver Jak Crawford was third, ahead of Hitech TGR's Luke Browning, as AIX Racing's Joshua Duerksen rounded out the top five.

Oliver Goethe qualified in sixth place for MP Motorsport, ahead of ART Grand Prix driver Victor Martins, and his fellow Red Bull Junior Arvid Lindblad for Campos Racing.

Rodin Motorsport's Alexander Dunne wound up in P9 ahead of the second Campos car of Josep María Martí in P10.

This means Martí is set to line up on reverse grid pole for Saturday's Sprint Race, which is set to get underway at 15:55 local time.

Until then, you can read a full report of today's FIA Formula 2 Qualifying from Budapest on the official website here.

'Today is a day where I don't understand anything' - Leclerc baffled by Pole Position

Piastri 'dumbfounded at what happened in Q3' as Leclerc pips McLarens for pole in Budapest

Aston Martin reserve driver Felipe Drugovich will take Fernando Alonso's place for the opening session at the Hungaroring.

Aston Martin have announced that Fernando Alonso is to sit out Friday's opening practice session for the Hungarian Grand Prix due to a muscular injury in his back.

Alonso was present at the Hungaroring for Thursday's media duties and pre-event preparations, some 22 years on from his maiden F1 victory around the Budapest venue.

However, with the first on-track session approaching, a statement from Aston Martin confirmed the Spaniard would play no part in FP1 due to a lingering injury.

Aston Martin's test and reserve driver, former F2 champion Felipe Drugovich, has been called up to take Alonso's spot for first practice, with further updates on the plan for the remainder of the weekend to follow.

“In the days following the Belgian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso has been managing a muscular injury in his back,” read the team's note.

“As he continues with treatment this morning, he has chosen to sit out of FP1. Felipe Drugovich will drive in FP1 alongside Lance Stroll.

“A decision will then be made on Fernando's participation in FP2 and the remainder of the weekend in due course.”

In a later update issued between practice sessions, Aston Martin confirmed that Alonso would return to action for FP2.

	With the next prequel in The Hunger Games hitting theaters on Nov. 20, 2026, at least one familiar face is open to returning.


Josh Hutcherson, who originated the role of Peeta Mellark in the 2012 adaptation of Suzanne Collins‘ first novel in the YA series, recently addressed the possibility of reprising the role in Sunrise on the Reaping, which has been rounding out its cast in recent months.


	“That'd be cool. No, I know nothing in that world right now,” Hutcherson clarified to Brit + Co. “Hunger Games is amazing, and I've loved it for many years and I will love it forever.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Although the events of Sunrise on the Reaping are set 24 years before the events of The Hunger Games, the book briefly features a grown Peeta and Katniss Everdeen (originated by Jennifer Lawrence) as Haymitch Abernathy (which Joseph Zada is set to take over from Woody Harrelson) recounts the events of his Hunger Game to them.

	











	In March, Collins released the fifth book in the franchise, Sunrise on the Reaping, which marks the second prequel after 2020's The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. A feature adaptation is set for a fall 2026 release.


	The cast also includes Whitney Peak as Haymitch's love interest Lenore Dove Baird, Elle Fanning as Effie Trinket, Glenn Close as Drusilla Sickle, Jesse Plemons as Plutarch Heavensbee, McKenna Grace as Maysilee Donner, Billy Porter as Magno Stift, Kieran Culkin as Caesar Flickerman, Maya Hawke as Wiress, Lili Taylor as Mags and Ralph Fiennes as President Snow, among others.


	Hutcherson previously portrayed Peeta in The Hunger Games (2012), The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1 (2014) and Part 2 (2015), alongside Lawrence, Harrison and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne.


	The actor has previously said he “would happily play Peeta again,” adding: “I think Peeta's an incredible person to get to bring to life. I'm curious to know what happens between when they have their family and when the story ends, just to understand what happened in the world, how they got to that place. But I'm down. If you can talk to Suzanne Collins and tell her to write a book, I'm in. Sign me up.”

	As Doctor Who plots a return with the eponymous Time Lord seemingly taking on the form of a previous companion, Billie Piper is reacquainting herself with the secrets of the universe.


	Following the Season 15 finale of the rebooted BBC One/Disney+ series, in which the Ncuti Gatwa‘s 15th Doctor regenerates to take the form of Piper's Rose Tyler, the actress recently recalled how she came to return to the TARDIS.


	“This is such a minefield, I have to really engage with how I answer this,” she said at Florida Supercon. “All I can say is, I was approached very last-minute, and I can't talk about in what capacity, but I found it very emotional to film, and I think it's a really great ending.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Noting she had to keep the finale twist a secret, Piper explained, “I just found it quite moving, and it was really fun to film because it had such a sort of cloak-and-dagger feeling about getting it made. So, yeah, I have to lie a lot about anything to do with Doctor Who, it seems.”


	Since her original run in the first two seasons from 2005 to 2006, Piper has reprised the role of Rose on several occasions, most recently being the 2013 episode ‘The Day of the Doctor', as well as the podcast series Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Adventures in 2017. 


	Following Piper's return in the May finale of Season 15 (Season 2 under Disney's leadership), Gatwa announced his exit from the show, explaining that the role was a “real pleasure and honor,” but the departure “felt like the right timing and the right energy, and it's felt melancholic and bittersweet.”

	











	“It was always the plan to do this amount of seasons, because it's a role that demands a lot of you, physically and emotionally and mentally,” said Gatwa in a behind-the-scenes featurette. “The actors playing the Doctor are only actors playing the Foctor; unfortunately, we are mere mortals. I would love to have the energy and the youth to be able to do this full time for the rest of my life, but my knees are telling me it's time.”


Doctor Who has not yet been renewed for Season 3 at Disney+ and BBC.

Conan O'Brien — long before he himself became one of America's favorite hosts — was on staff for three years as a “Saturday Night Live” writer, which he describes as one of the 50-year-old series' most intense periods.

“I was in that state of mind, and I think [Robert] Smigel and [Bob] Odenkirk and Greg Daniels were like, ‘It's life or death,'” O'Brien related on his podcast “Conan Needs a Friend” (via Entertainment Weekly). “And it feels like that's kind of how everyone feels.”

Odenkirk expressed similar feelings in an interview with EW last month. “I was too hard on the show,” he said. “I had a lot of attitude when I got hired there, like, ‘This show could be better, this show could be ‘Monty Python,' this should be more cutting edge, this should be more dangerous.' And I was frustrated by it not representing purely my point of view. I wanted it to be me, my show.”

The air got a little lighter, however, whenever Adam Sandler joined the cast in 1990 (he'd remain until 1995). As O'Brien recalled, “He was like, ‘This is so much fun to be at SNL. Oh, I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it. Yippee!' And he had that, ‘I'm going to do Opera Man. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. This is great, guys!'” O'Brien was perplexed: “This is a possibility? You can like this?”

 










In previous episodes of his podcast, O'Brien has discussed similar “SNL” regrets. “I did have a lot of fun, but I think I could have had more fun. And I think I could have maybe written there a little longer if I didn't make it such a grind for myself,” he lamented in 2024.

O'Brien parlayed his “SNL” stint into a lengthy career of his own, and he even came back from his own career rollercoaster at sketch show's network NBC. After spending a couple years on “The Simpsons” staff, O'Brien returned to the network, hosting the long-running “Late Night with Conan O'Brien.” He briefly hosted “The Tonight Show” in 2009-2010, only to be replaced by previous host Jay Leno in highly controversial series of events.

He would have a swift comeback, though, landing on Comedy Central on “Conan” with yet another talk series, the first in a series of acclaimed ventures. The road led O'Brien to the Oscars, which he hosted to raves in March (and utilized Sandler for an audience bit) and will host again next year. Of this O'Brien said, “the only reason I'm hosting the Oscars next year is that I want to hear Adrien Brody finish his speech.”

Sandler, of course, became one of the most prolific “SNL” alums. Just last week, “Happy Gilmore 2” premiered to big numbers on Netflix, the latest in a long line of audience favorites for the comedian. IndieWire recently compiled the definitive list of the “Uncut Gems” actor's greatest roles.

	Although Vanderpump Rules is preparing to move on from ‘Scandoval‘ with its rebooted Season 12, Lena Dunham isn't quite ready to let go.


	The Too Much creator recently shared her vision for a film based on the shocking affair between Tom Sandoval and Rachel Leviss that was unpacked during the Bravo reality show's Season 10 reunion in 2023, as Sandoval's estranged ex Ariana Madix had the chance to confront them both.


	“We should basically create like a mini movie in which actors treat this as canon and get up and perform it with all the passion and virtuosity of Shakespeare,” said Dunham on the Shut Up Evan podcast. “I went so far as to abuse Andy Cohen‘s contact information to pitch him the idea.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Although Cohen didn't greenlight Dunham's pitch, he did host a live reading of the explosive ‘Scandoval' reunion on Sirius XM's Radio Andy, featuring Chloe Fineman, Sarah Sherman, Cheyenne Jackson, Leslie Grossman, Amber Tamblyn, Susan Lucci, Carson Kressley, Chrissy Teigen, Brad Goreski and John Arthur Hill.


	For Dunham's adaptation, she envisioned Andrew Scott as Sandoval and Jennifer Lawrence as Madix. “I want to take these words and direct them like it's really serious theater,” she explained.


	After Madix and Sandoval returned for Season 11 of Vanderpump Rules, which did not prove to be fruitful in mending any fences, Bravo renewed the series for Season 12 last year with an all-new cast, which the show teased in a promo last month.

"Well, he was essentially, I guess, sort of half-innocent," the president said.

Donald Trump is once again addressing the possibility of granting a presidential pardon to Sean “Diddy” Combs.


	During a Friday (Aug. 1) interview on Newsmax's Finnerty, the president was asked whether he would consider pardoning Combs following his recent federal conviction. In early July, the Bad Boy Records mogul was found guilty of transportation with intent to engage in prostitution, though he was acquitted of more serious charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering.


	“Well, he was essentially, I guess, sort of half-innocent,” Trump told host Rob Finnerty. “He's still in jail or something, but he was celebrating a victory. But I guess it wasn't as good of a victory.”

	











	Trump also reflected on his past relationship with Combs, noting they were once “very friendly” and that he “got along with him great.” However, he said that dynamic shifted when he entered politics, describing Combs as having become “very hostile.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	This isn't the first time Trump has commented on the case. During an Oval Office press briefing in late May, he was asked by Fox News' Peter Doocy whether he would consider a pardon for Combs. At the time, Trump said he'd “look at the facts,” acknowledging their former rapport while insisting personal feelings wouldn't influence his decision.


	“I haven't spoken to him in years,” Trump said. “He used to really like me a lot. I think when I ran for politics, that relationship busted up. … I would certainly look at the facts. If I think somebody was mistreated, whether they like me or don't like me, it wouldn't have any impact on me.”

	











	Combs' partial acquittal followed seven weeks of testimony, including statements from singer Cassie Ventura, who accused him of abuse and trafficking during their relationship. Combs has denied all allegations. He now faces up to 20 years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for Oct. 3.


	Watch Trump's full response on Finnerty about pardoning Diddy in a clip posted on X.

Hollywood is hung up on Madonna, but a biopic remains a frozen secret. Regardless, the legendary singer's life is going to make it to screen eventually — although whether it gets to the small or big screen first is yet to be determined. This week, “Weapons” star Julia Garner — who was announced to star in a Madonna movie way back in 2022 — confirmed on the podcast “Smartless” that, in spite of reports to the contrary, the project “Like a Virgin” is still very much in gestation.

“That's supposed to still happen,” she said (via Variety). Garner was set to star alongside Julia Fox, who would play Madonna BFF and frequent music video co-star Debi Mazar. Fox spoke with IndieWire in 2024 about the movie's reported shelving by Universal, seeming similarly ambiguous.

“I know it was gonna be either tour or movie and then she went on tour,” Fox said. “So I don't know when the movie will be picking back up again or when they're going to start working on it again. But I didn't hear anything. I actually don't know … I mean, I'd still love to but I genuinely don't know. They are going back, you know, when they're like 19 and they first meet. I feel like I might have already aged out of that casting, but we'll see.”

 










On Smartless, Garner said she was enthused to take on Madonna, because she “just wanted to see if [she] could do it.” The film was — or is — to be directed by the “Vogue” icon herself, for whom Garner auditioned. “I wasn't a trained dancer and I had to learn how to dance and then dance in front of her and convince her that I can dance, basically, and sing… And sing with her!” Garner related.

Madonna shared on Instagram a year ago that she was still working on the screenplay. “I Need A-lot of Bandz to make this………..OKAY,” she wrote, adding, “Story of my life.”

The movie, however, isn't the only Madonna story in the works. In May, Deadline revealed that a Netflix series is planned — and Garner does have a long history with the streamer, remaining a mainstay with “Ozark,” “Inventing Anna,” and an upcoming limited series about the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The Madonna TV show would be executive produced by the “A League of Their Own” star, alongside “Stranger Things” EP Shawn Levy. 

Whether a series or a film, Madonna's story would be the latest boomer artist bio in what has become a reliable awards-friendly genre. Just last season, Timothée Chalamet earned an Oscar nod as Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown,” while Kingsley Ben-Adir also got stellar notices for his portrayal of Bob Marley. In recent years, Austin Butler was nominated for his role in and as “Elvis,” and Rami Malek won the Academy Award for playing Freddie Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody.” This doesn't even begin to touch on the boomer artist docs — like the Grammy-winning “Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice” or the Peter Jackson-directed “The Beatles: Get Back.”

 










As for Madonna, when whatever it becomes will happen remains uncertain. After all, life is a mystery, as she told us in “Like a Prayer.” Whenever a film drops, though, Garner assures it will be worthwhile. “Anything that's great… takes a long time,” she said.

	After Sony Pictures teased Spider-Man‘s new ensemble, Tom Holland suited up in the web-slinger's costume for a short teaser.


	On Saturday, the BAFTA winner revealed his costume for the upcoming sequel Spider-Man: Brand New Day, set to premiere in theaters on July 31, 2026.


	“Are you ready? – 7.31.2026,” Holland captioned the clip, in which his silhouette is revealed in the massive doorway of a soundstage before walking to the camera in costume.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The studio previously teased that “something brand new is coming,” sharing a first glimpse at the superhero uniform on Friday, marking the 63rd anniversary of the character's first comic book appearance.

	











	In October, Sony added the follow-up to Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) to its summer 2026 schedule, later revealing the title in March at CinemaCon.

A post shared by Tom Holland (@tomholland2013)


	“I'm obviously over the moon and so excited,” Holland previously said. “Playing Spider-Man is like hanging out with an old pal. And I think we were really restricted with what we could do in the last movie because of COVID; we shot the entire film on stages.”


	Holland continued, “Now, we're really gonna lean into that old-school filmmaking and shoot in real locations, which is why we're starting in Glasgow and we're gonna use the streets of Glasgow to build this massive set-piece that we're putting together. So it's gonna feel like making [2017's] Spider-Man 1 again. It's been such a long time since I've done it, it's gonna feel like a breath of fresh air, and I think the fans are going to be over the moon with what we're putting together.”

	











	Helmed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton, producers include Amy Pascal and Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige returning. Zendaya will reprise her role as MJ, with production expected to commence after she and Holland both have completed filming Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey. Sadie Sink and Liza Colón-Zayas have also joined the cast in undisclosed roles.

The month is kicking off with some big real estate news. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, August 1, that the mammoth California mansion formerly owned by Aaron Spelling and his wife, Candy, has been purchased for $110 million by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. That's $55 million less than the asking price of $165 million it was listed for by its owner back in 2022. 

Construction on the home, often simply referred to as “The Manor,” was started in 1988. It is located in Los Angeles' Holmby Hills neighborhood, which is also home to the Playboy Mansion. Aaron's daughter, “Beverly Hills, 90210” star Tori Spelling, previously told People the structure was so huge she never even visited every room of it while living their with her parents. “You know me, I get exhausted very easily. Walking that house just, phew. Just taking that elevator up to the second floor was like too much to handle,” she joked to the mag before adding that she was prohibited by her mother from entering the staff quarters out of respect for the employees' privacy.

See AD's video tour of the sprawling home below, and read on for the stats and details about the mansion.

The palatial home, which was remodeled by former owner Petra Ecclestone after she purchased it for $120 million in 2019, offers many perks. Among them are a bowling alley, wine cellar, and beauty salon which Realtor.com says features massage and tanning rooms. Its 56,500 square feet include 14 bedrooms and 27 baths, per TMZ.

The outlet describes the home's style as French chateau and says it slightly exceeds the White House in size. 

TMZ says the billionaire Schmidt family plans to use the property for meetings and nonprofit events, although it will remain classified as a single family residence.

The luxury California real estate market has struggled lately, and several sellers have had to cut prices. Factors include the recent wildfires of January 2025, flight of the wealthy to lower tax states, and overall economic angst, according to Realtor.com's market snapshot.

The $110 million dollar sale price of The Manor, located at 594 S Mapleton Dr, is $10 million less than what Ecclestone previously paid.

These market conditions may explain why Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck took their former home off the market in May, after lowering the asking price by almost $9 million and still not finding a buyer.

It's a sad day for OG “Sex and the City” fans: the cosmopolitans have officially stopped flowing. After 27 years of unforgettable fashion, friendship, and reinvention, the beloved characters of Carrie Bradshaw, Miranda Hobbes, and Charlotte York are preparing to hang up their Manolos for good!

As “And Just Like That…” spinoff wraps after Season 3, the curtain is closing on a cultural legacy that redefined womanhood for generations. 

Cynthia Nixon is bidding adieu to her iconic role as Miranda Hobbes, a character she's portrayed from “Sex and the City” to “And Just Like That…”

A post shared by Cynthia Nixon (@cynthiaenixon)

Through it all, Miranda's evolution has been one of the most complex and celebrated arcs in the franchise: from tough New York lawyer to devoted mother, from forgiving Steve's infidelity to ending their marriage and embracing her sexual identity with new love and purpose.

In a heartfelt Instagram post, Nixon shared her feelings about saying goodbye to the character — and the cast and crew who've become like family.

“I can't believe our wild beautiful And Just Like That ride is almost over. It has been such a delight from start to finish. I will miss working with these people everyday SO incredibly much but know we will always be a part of each other's lives.”

A post shared by Cynthia Nixon (@cynthiaenixon)

While Nixon prepares to close the chapter on Miranda, she leaves fans with a promise of more to come — both on-screen and in her feed:

“Get ready for a lot more carousels in the weeks to come! And don't miss these last few episodes: surprises in store! 🫢”

Following the announcement, Kristin Davis, who has portrayed Charlotte York Goldenblatt since 1998. Davis shared a heartfelt tribute to fans, cast, and crew.

“I am profoundly sad. I love our whole beautiful cast and crew. 400 artisans working so hard on our show with deep love.”

She also offered a touching thank-you to the fans who have supported the show for over two decades: “And to our loyal fans, we love you forever and ever. ❤️ Thank you to you all!!!You hold me up and I do not take it for granted!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️”

Davis's farewell marks the end of a 26-year journey with Charlotte.

A post shared by And Just Like That… (@justlikethatmax)

Michael Patrick King expressed his deep appreciation to the loyal viewers who have followed the story from the original “Sex and the City” through to the reboot. He confirmed that the show had reached its natural ending.

“And Just Like That… the ongoing storytelling of the Sex and the City universe is coming to an end,” he wrote. 

“While I was writing the last episode of And Just Like That… Season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop. Along with Sarah Jessica Parker, Casey Bloys and Sarah Aubrey, we decided to end the popular series this year with a two-part finale and extended the original series order from 10 episodes to 12.”

“It's with great gratitude we thank all the viewers who have let these characters into their homes and their hearts over these many years.”

The final two episodes of “And Just Like That…” Season 3 will air as a two-part finale, beginning August 14 on Max. Don't miss the final surprises as Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte take their final bows.

Dead and Company paid tribute to the late Phil Lesh on the opening night of their Dead 60 anniversary concerts in San Francisco by bringing out Lesh's son Grahame for “Box of Rain.”


	The Bob Weir and John Mayer-fronted band have sparingly performed the Lesh-sung American Beauty classic, one of the bassist's signature songs, since their inception in 2015; Dead and Company played “Box of Rain” only one other time in the past three years, at their first Sphere weekend since Lesh's death in October 2024.


	Grahame Lesh — who led an all-star band, similar to his father's Phil & Friends, at a pre-Dead 60 concert Thursday at San Francisco's Pier 48 — handled lead vocals and wielded his father's bass for “Box of Rain,” then stuck around to join Dead and Company for a rendition of “Playing in the Band.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Friday night's opening concert of the Dead 60 weekend took place on what would have been Jerry Garcia's 83rd birthday on August 1. As the shows at the Golden Gate Park mark the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary, Garcia was also remembered as his daughter Trixie appeared onstage to introduce Dead and Company, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

	











	Billy Strings, who opened the show Friday, later joined Dead and Company on “Wharf Rat”:


	Dead and Company will return to Golden Gate Park, where the Grateful Dead staged at least 14 gigs spanning from 1967 to 1991, on Saturday and Sunday night.

	











Rolling Stone spoke with Bobby Weir about the band potentially reuniting for the 60th anniversary, which Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann, and Mickey Hart discussed before Lesh died.

	“I think when Phil checked out, so did that notion, because we don't have a bass player who's been playing with us for 60 years now. And that was the intriguing prospect.… I think you need somebody holding down the bottom. Phil had all kinds of ideas that were pretty much unique to him. I grew up with Phil holding down the bottom in his unique way,” Weir said.


	He added: “I suppose I could go back out. I wouldn't put anybody in his place, so it would be a trio at this point. It'd be me and two drummers. I'd have to think about that. I haven't thought about it — it's just now occurring to me that it's a possibility that we could do that, since you asked.… I guess we'll just see what the three of us can pull together.”

	Donald Trump weighed in again on rumors of a possible presidential pardon for Sean Combs, the hip-hop mogul convicted last month on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, calling him “half-innocent” but agreeing with a host who asked if it was “more likely a no.”


	Combs was found not guilty on July 2 of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. Yet each of the two prostitution counts could technically land him in prison for up to 10 years when the mogul is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 3. (Legal experts, however, tell Rolling Stone they expect him to get much less.)


	“Well, he was essentially, I guess, sort of half-innocent,” Trump told Newsmax host Rob Finnerty Friday night. “[He's] still in jail or something, but he was celebrating a victory. But I guess it wasn't as good of a victory.” 


	Trump and Combs have had an up-and-down relationship in the decades since they first met in the 1990s. Over the years, the real-estate magnate has been spotted at a number of Combs' VIP parties and events in New York City, including the Bad Boy founder's blowout birthday bashes. Trump called Combs “a good friend” during a 2012 episode of The Apprentice, while Combs called Trump “a friend of mine” in 2015, not long after Trump launched his first campaign.

	But when asked about Trump in 2017, Combs told the Daily Beast, “I think that to be honest, we don't really give a fuck about Trump, because [black people are] in the same fucked-up position. So that's not what we're on.” Speaking to Charlamagne tha God in 2020, Combs said, “White men like Trump need to be banished. That way of thinking is real dangerous. This man literally threatened the lives of us and our families about going to vote … The number one priority is to get Trump out of office.”

	











	When asked about a possible pardon in May, Trump said, “I haven't seen him, I haven't spoken to him in years. He used to really like me a lot, but I think when I ran for politics that relationship busted up … I read some little bit nasty statements in the paper all of a sudden.” But he seemed at least somewhat sympathetic to Combs' plight, telling reporters that he “would certainly look at the facts” of the case. “I know people are thinking about it,” he added. “People have been very close to asking.”

Q: Sean Diddy Combs. Would you consider pardoning him? Well, he was essentially, I guess, sort of half innocent. Probably— I was very friendly with him but when I ran for office he was very hostile and it's hard. So, I don't know, it's more difficult. Q: More likely a no?… pic.twitter.com/FrrzquR6qs


	During Friday's interview, Trump recalled that he was “very friendly with him. I got along with him great, and [he] seemed like a nice guy. I didn't know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile. It's hard, you know? We're human beings. And we don't like to have things cloud our judgment, right? But when you knew someone and you were fine, and then you run for office, and he made some terrible statements. So I don't know …. it makes it more difficult to do.”


	As Rolling Stone reported in May, the mogul's associates began contacting people close to Trump shortly after he won the presidential election last November. During the presidential transition and in the opening months of Trump's second administration, several longtime friends and allies of Combs, who've known the rapper for many years, began reaching out to some Trump transition and administration officials, as well as to others close to the president, two sources familiar with the matter and another person briefed on it told Rolling Stone.


	The small number of senior Trump officials who were aware of the talks expressed deep reservations about commuting a possible Combs sentence, given the severity of the charges. (A rep for Combs did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Friday's interview.)

	It's unclear if Combs' acquittal on the most severe charges has changed the calculus among the president or anyone in his administration. As Rolling Stone reported on Thursday, Combs' team has intensified their behind-the-scenes campaign in recent weeks, according to people in and out of the Trump administration. “The pleading has gotten bigger [this month],” a Trump adviser says, referring to a conspicuous uptick in Combs allies' attempts to woo Team Trump.  


	In the past few weeks, longtime Combs allies have offered to pay political operatives, lobbyists, and others with close ties to Trumpland and government officials large financial sums in exchange for help with a potential Trump pardon, three people familiar with the matter tell Rolling Stone. One of the sources says the offer they were privy to was in the mid-six figures.

	











	Multiple Trump advisers still feel it would be a deeply unforced error to pardon Combs while the administration is still embroiled in a scandal over their handling of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.

	There are also ongoing talks among survivors to send a personal letter to Trump urging him against the idea. Rolling Stone has reviewed a draft copy of the letter, which admonishes Combs for attempting to “reclaim control” and “rewrite history” following his conviction on prostitution charges. A pardon, the draft adds, “would not be justice” but a “devastating message to survivors everywhere: that our lives, our pain, and our truth are still negotiable.”


	On Thursday morning, lawyers for Combs submitted a 62-page filing asking a judge to vacate his prostitution conviction and fully acquit him or grant him a new trial “focused solely” on those two counts. Earlier this week, they filed a new motion asking that Combs be released on bail. Southern District of New York prosecutors filed their own motion Thursday night arguing that Combs remain in jail until his sentencing.

Can we all agree, as a group, that it was kind of weird that Arnold Schwarzenegger had a streaming TV show that nobody much liked or cared about? Former governor, previously the world's biggest movie star, and somehow also occupier of the lowest rung on Netflix's algorithmically baked tower of recommendations? It was odd!

Past tense employed there because this state of affairs has, suddenly, expired, as Deadline reports that Schwarzenegger's TV series FUBAR has been kicked off the Netflix streaming schedule after two seasons. The series starred Da Big Man alongside Monica Barbaro, doing a sort of Alias-y, over-70 spin on True Lies, with a father and daughter both secretly working as operatives for the CIA and trying to stop that dang Diego Luna from blowing everybody up. The series debuted its first season back in May of 2023, and then rolled out a second season back in June 2025, which you probably remember because [note to self: Find someone who remembers FUBAR season 2 coming out back in June and find out why they did that.]

But we kid FUBAR, mostly because we never really knew what else to do with it: Yes, it's kind of neat to see Schwarzenegger doing TV stuff, but beyond that very simple novelty, it seemed like a pretty basic spin on two very old premises, mixing “Fathers and daughters struggle to get along!” with “Netflix spy crap you've seen a million times!” Per Deadline, the series notably didn't make much of an impact when it came back a few months ago, just barely cracking the streamer's own Top 10 listings for the week of its premiere. (It's possible that a two-year gap between seasons didn't help; shows like Severance can survive that kind of momentum killer, but FUBAR, by all accounts, was no Severance.) In addition to Schwarzenegger and recent Oscar nominee Barbaro, the series also starred Milan Carter, Travis Van Winkle, Fabiana Udenio, Jay Baruchel, Aparna Brielle, Andy Buckley, Guy Burnett, Carrie Anne-Moss, and Fortune Feimster, who, the law of averages suggests, presumably got off at least a couple of pretty good jokes during two seasons of show.

THR is also debuting new stills from Richard Linklater's homage to 'Breathless' and the French New Wave, which premiered in May at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received rave reviews.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


Nouvelle Vague, Richard Linklater's loving homage to Jean Luc-Godard's 1960 film Breathless and the French New Wave, which received a 10-minute standing ovation and rave reviews following its world premiere at May's Cannes Film Festival, will be released in American theaters on Oct. 31 and play on big screens for two weeks before dropping on Netflix on Nov. 14, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.


	When Netflix acquired Nouvelle Vague's U.S. rights shortly after Cannes, some reacted with surprise and dismay that a movie shot on film and about cinema would end up with a streamer. But the company is planning a robust theatrical release that will include not only screens in New York (where, appropriately enough, it owns the historic Paris Theater) and LA, but in all of the top 10 U.S. markets.

	Additionally, THR can report that the largely French-language film will be pushed across all categories. In my humble opinion, it could well end up a finalist for best picture, a category in which non-English-language films have landed many noms in recent years (including France's Netflix-distributed Emilia Pérez earlier this year); best director (Linklater is a beloved auteur, but his only nom in the category came for 2014's Boyhood); and screenplay (it has yet to be determined if Holly Gent, Laetitia Masson and Vincent Palmo Jr.'s script will be classified as adapted or original).


	Meanwhile, Zoey Deutch, who is luminous as Breathless star Jean Seberg, will be campaigned in the supporting actress race, while French actors Guillaume Marbeck and Aubry Dullin, who eerily resemble the characters they play — Godard and Breathless breakout Jean-Paul Belmondo — will be pushed for lead actor and supporting actor, respectively.

	











	The big question moving forward is whether or not France will select Nouvelle Vague as its entry for the best international feature Oscar competition. Each country's submission is determined by a selection committee comprised mostly of people associated with that country's film industry, who must attest that “creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.”


	The key word is “largely.” In the case of Nouvelle Vague, Linklater and Deutch are American, but almost everyone else who worked in front of or behind the camera is French, including the film's two producers, Laurent Pétin and Michèle Pétin, so the film is certainly eligible. Plus, its financing came from France; it was shot in France; it premiered in France; and it is an out-and-out celebration of French cinema.


	Some selection committees are hesitant to submit a film directed by someone born outside of their country's borders, feeling that doing so would be a missed opportunity to highlight homegrown talent. But other countries enter whichever film they think offers them the best shot at actually landing an Oscar nom. For instance, Japan put forward — and landed a nom in 2024 for — German filmmaker Wim Wenders' Perfect Days. Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland has had films entered by Poland, West Germany and the Czech Republic. And twice in the last decade, France itself submitted films by non-French filmmakers: Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's Elle in 2016 and Italian filmmaker Filippo Neneghetti's Two of Us in 2020.

	











	France, however, has had bruising experiences with its last two submissions. In 2024, it entered The Taste of Things instead of Anatomy of a Fall; ultimately, the former was not nominated, while the latter went on to five other noms (best picture, director, original screenplay, actress and film editing), suggesting that it almost certainly would have been nominated for — and might have even won — best international feature had it been entered. And in 2025, its submission Emilia Pérez looked certain to bring the country its first win in the category since Indochine prevailed in 1993, but its prospects imploded shortly before the final round of voting, thanks to the exposure of problematic social media posts from its principal star, and it ultimately lost.


	Again, Emilia Pérez was handled by Netflix, so you can be sure that the company is hungry for another chance to get a French film across the finish line in the best international feature Oscar race. (In just the last six years, it backed two films from other countries that went on to win that prize, Mexico's Roma in 2019 and Germany's All Quiet on the Western Front in 2023.) But the decision about whether or not it will have that opportunity is ultimately France's, or at least the French selection committee's.


	Given that no other French film has emerged this year, so far, that would appear to offer the nation a better shot than Nouvelle Vague at landing a best international feature Oscar nom, and possibly even a win, it will be very interesting to see how France's selection committee plays it cards.

Ella Stiller just made her “And Just Like That” debut — and it came with a special connection to her real-life family history.

The 23-year-old actress, who is the daughter of Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor, guest starred in the July 31 episode of Max's “Sex and the City” revival, playing a character named Mia. In the episode, Brady (Miranda and Steve's son) reveals at a family dinner that he “got someone pregnant.” He adds, “It's this girl I've hooked up with maybe twice,” and admits he doesn't even know her last name.

That girl turns out to be Mia, played by Ella. As the episode progresses, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) visits Mia at the salon where she works to learn more about the pregnancy, leading to a hilariously tense exchange. While washing Miranda's hair, Mia apologizes for passing gas and dryly explains, “I'm still getting used to all this gas since I'm pregnant.” When asked if she's excited about the baby, Mia quips, “Honestly, I was gonna get an abortion 'til I realized the baby would be a double Libra. It's gonna be such a f—— vibe.”

The awkward conversation continues until Mia figures out Miranda's identity, prompting her to spray Miranda with water. “I'm ‘f— buddy's mother,'” Miranda admits. Mia replies, “That is so gross and inappropriate.”

Ella's guest spot also marks a full-circle moment for her family. Her paternal grandmother, the late Anne Meara, played Steve's mom, Mary, in four episodes of the original Sex and the City series, including the episode featuring Brady's baptism and a storyline involving a health crisis in Season 6, via People.

Though she comes from a famous family, Ella Stiller is building her own path in the industry. Born in Los Angeles in 2002, she was raised in New York City and attended the Calhoun School, where her father also went. She graduated from the Juilliard School in 2024 with a drama degree and has been pursuing both stage and screen roles ever since, per People.

Ella has appeared in projects like “Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb”, “Escape at Dannemora”, and “Hubie Halloween”. Most recently, she's starring in the off-Broadway dark comedy “Dilaria”, where she plays a chaotic young woman who fakes her own death for social media attention. She previously shared with Teen Vogue that the role was inspired by her love for Bravo and personalities like “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Erika Jayne.

A post shared by Ella Stiller (@ella.stiller)

In the Teen Vogue interview, Ella addressed the “nepo baby” discourse and acknowledged the access she's had thanks to her family. Still, she emphasized her commitment to forging her own creative identity. “My parents, my grandparents were amazing actors and writers and that's incredible and that's an amazing privilege, but I wanted to also have my own people and pave my own way and have my own voice be put out there,” she said.

She also noted how her parents' talents show up in her own work. “I think my dad and I are very similar in the way our brains work and the way we view art and writing and creativity,” she said. “We all, collectively, get our sense of humor from each other.”

	If there's any truth to rumors that Tom Holland is in the running to play James Bond, he's keeping it top-secret for now.


	As the BAFTA winner returns to one major franchise with Friday's Spider-Man: Brand New Day teaser, he recently commented on “speculation” that he's up for the coveted part in the Denis Villeneuve-helmed update of the franchise.


	“Listen, there's speculation at the minute. We'll keep it to a minimum for now,” he said in a video on Gordon Ramsay's YouTube. “We'll get there one day.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Holland added, “Every young British actor, it's the pinnacle of working in our industry. I already consider myself to be the luckiest kid alive. I could never have dreamed to have the career that I've had.”

	











Daniel Craig played the iconic role in Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) and No Time to Die (2021). Following previous Bond stars Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan, Craig's successor has not yet been chosen.


	In June, Amazon MGM Studios officially tapped Villeneuve to direct the next installment, and this week, Steven Knight was announced to write the film amid the studio's new 007 partnership with returning producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. Tanya Lapointe will executive produce.


	After announcing that Amy Pascal and David Heyman will produce the next film in the franchise, Amazon MGM's Courtenay Valenti and Sue Kroll said at CinemaCon in April that the pair of “filmmaking legends” is currently in London working on the film.

	











	“We are committed to honoring the legacy of this iconic character, while bringing a fresh, exhilarating new chapter to audiences around the world alongside Amy and David,” said Valenti, head of Film, Streaming and Theatrical. “They are both in London getting started and couldn't be here tonight, but we wanted to thank them for what we know will be an incredible partnership. Thank you, Amy and David!”

Tom Holland is a one note actor who is only mainstream because of Spider-Man. He could never pull this off – he has no presence nor enough skill to play Bond.

Holland as Bond 😂 The man is 5foot tall

No, no, NO. Barbara Broccoli said in ‘ 23 that the next Bond needs to be at least 6 foot and 40 years old or under. Holland is 5'7″, so look elsewhere. Perhaps casting him as Marc Dane from the British espionage novels that started with ‘Nomad' and then ‘Exile' is a better idea.

Yeah, I agree with the other comments— Tom is too slight of a person for Bond. You need presence and manliness for this role.

Tom's a great Spider-Man but he's not right for Bond.

News of the cancellation came after the series' minutes of viewing declined by 73 percent from season one to two.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



FUBAR has been canceled after two seasons, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. 


	News of the show's cancellation arrived Friday night after its streaming ratings notably declined between season premieres. After debuting on Netflix at No.1 on Nielsen's streaming charts during its premiere week two years ago in May 22-28 with 1.53 billion minutes of viewing, season two accumulated 412 million viewing minutes this year during the week of June 9-15. 




	In total, FUBAR's minutes of viewing declined by 73 percent from season one to two. During its premiere week, the series landed at No. 8 among Netflix's original shows for its second season.

	The action comedy starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and Oscar nominee Monica Barbaro, who portray a father-daughter spy duo. Season two saw the addition of Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays a former fling of Schwarzenegger's Luke Brunner. The cast also included Milan Carter, Fortune Feimster, Travis Van Winkle, Fabiana Udenio, Aparna Brielle, Guy Burnet, Andy Buckley, Jay Baruchel, Barbara Eve Harris and Scott Thompson. 


	The official logline for season two reads, “Luke Brunner (Schwarzenegger) is a veteran CIA operative who, up until recently, was on the verge of retirement. After his last mission in saving another operative — who just so happened to be his daughter (Barbaro) — he's back and face to face with new villains. This one is an old flame from Luke's past (Moss) who threatens to destroy the world … if she doesn't destroy his life first.” 


	Of joining FUBAR during season two, Moss told THR that “getting to work with Arnold was epic for me.” 

	











	“I don't know if I've ever had more fun on a job working with Arnold and doing the dance stuff and the fight stuff and then all the acting, and then the sitting between takes and talking about all kinds of things,” she added. “I loved every minute of it.”

	If you missed San Diego Comic-Con, then you missed the first teaser and panel to David Ferino‘s Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: Organic Intelligence. 


	In this first clip we meet adolescent prodigy, and genius CEO of VegIntel, inventor of “MyTomato,” the vegetable which will solve all our problems, particularly those that A.I. can't fix. 


	The fifth movie in the 47-year old franchise is “pitting the eternal power of nature against AI's best and brightest.”


	The original movie was released in 1978. Made for $100,000, it was produced by J. Stephen Peace and John DeBello. DeBello directed the pic based on an original idea by Costa Dillon in a story about mutated killer tomatoes that torment the globe as a group of scientists try to fend them off.

Conner Floyd is out as Chance Chancellor on “The Young and the Restless.” This week, the actor officially ended his run as one of Genoa City's best detectives after four years.

In an Instagram post, Floyd bids goodbye to his beloved character. The actor shared a montage video from his last day on the show.

“It's been real GC. What a ride,” Floyd wrote. “I have truly been blessed to call myself a citizen of Genoa City.”

A post shared by Conner Floyd (@connergfloyd)

The actor also took the time to thank everyone who's been part of his journey as Chance. “The Young and the Restless” star continued:

“To share the stage with so many talented and hard working actors, creatives and crew members. This is without a doubt a special place. I'm grateful to have been a part of such an iconic piece of art that has lasted through the decades and that has such a stellar, die hard fan base. Thank you for accepting me.”

Floyd, who debuted as Chance in 2021, admits his character will always have a special place in his heart.

“Chance will always have a close place in my heart,” he added. “He's taught me a lot and I'll miss him dearly. It's been an absolute honor to represent the Chancellor legacy. Detective Chancellor, over and out.”

Floyd's co-stars flooded the comments section with touching messages and heartfelt farewells. His on-screen ex-wife, Mel Ordway (Abby Newman), wrote, “You're a rockstar… so excited for your next chapter!”

Michelle Stafford, who plays Phyllis Summers, also commented, “We love you SOOOO much!! You are a JOY!!! So sad to not see you on set… but…. You are gonna kill on days!!”

Courtney Hope (Sally Spectra) wrote, “You will be missed,” while Jason Thompson (Billy Abbott) chimed in, “It's been a pleasure, homie. Get it!!”

Lauralee Bell (Christine Blair) shared, “Loved every cop/lawyer scene, we hung on to each other for rooting for you to get your line, then I'll get mine. Thank goodness we'll see each other around the soap hood and excited for what you're doing next!”

Meanwhile, Billy Flynn (Cane Ashby) humorously wrote, “It was an honor to tenderly hold you while you passed on. You're the man!”

Floyd's time on “The Young and the Restless” may be over, but fans will still get to see him on another soap. Last month, it was confirmed that the actor is set to join “Days of Our Lives” as Chad DiMera.

According to PEOPLE, Floyd began taping for “DOOL” on Monday, June 23. Expect to see his debut as Chad on April 21, 2026.

This spring, my Aunt Beth died from cancer. We weren't close, but our hugs were long. She lived in Alabama. She loved college football. She owned chickens and had three sisters. “Mother of Flies” is a deeply personal horror movie that goes beyond encouraging audience projection to viciously rip your demons from you. Specific to the world of its authors, the film doesn't have to remind you of anyone — or anything — from your real life to leave you haunted by the whisper of connections you should have had. 

Winning the Cheval Noir for Best Film at Fantasia Fest 2025, “Mother of Flies” follows a young woman named Mickey (Zelda Adams) and her worried father, Jake (John Adams), as they seek cancer treatment from the witch Solveig (Toby Poser) in a remote location. The co-stars and filmmakers, collectively known as the Adams Family, have been spinning ghost stories in their backyard in the Catskills for years. Their latest and most mature feature bottles that intergenerational conversation into a disquieting lo-fi effort that rattles with wonderful inconsistencies.

Rising to the moniker of “elevated” indie horror, years after that accolade stopped being cool, “Mother of Flies” is anchored in a supernatural mystery caught somewhere between life and death. Drawing from their own experiences with cancer, and the dual artistry that comes with also being the popular family punk band H6LLB6ND6R, the Adams elevate their gnarly yet familiar allegory about facing illness to an otherworldly plane. Smart style decisions, fervent narrative commitment, and the kind of intangible wisdom you can only find emanating from true devotees of genre are just a few reasons to recommend the film. It's a cool-toned burst of regional agony that earns the comparison to Maryland's “Blair Witch,” even if its chilling East Coast aura winds up unnervingly tough to place.

 










You don't need to have seen the Adams' earlier films (“The Deeper You Dig,” “Where the Devil Roams”) to appreciate their next movie as a triumph. That said, with months to go before it gets a release from Shudder, now's as good a time as any to obsess over the directors. In “Mother of Flies,” an eerie nightmare set in upstate New York becomes a haunting and timeless conversation between parent, child, and God. Already trapped in the impermanence innate to any human bond, Mickey and Jake struggle to grapple with an assumed death order they never thought would be reversed.

“I'm your dad,” Jake pleads. “We're a team.”

“I'm in this alone, and you're in the alone,” Mickey spits. “So, go. LEAVE!”

Children shouldn't pass before their parents. But no one should pass before anyone, should they? That's the type of slippery philosophical debate plenty of adult children don't have with their caregivers unless they find earnest friendship in their later years. As co-writers and directors, the Adams transform their unique relationship into a haunting exploration of existential dread that feels like listening in on a private family conversation. Edited with ferocious clarity, “Mother of Flies” can't fake a budget it doesn't have — but its auteurs' knowing portrayals create a sharp tension that pays off as the fear builds.

 










There's something to be said for auteurs like David Lynch directing themselves, and the Adams' obvious esteem for one another as loved ones and collaborators encourages respect from the viewer. Ripping through visuals of varying quality, and pulsing with the electricity of a found-footage film (although the dialogue is far too creepy and intentionally stilted to fit that genre), “Mother of Flies” does a lot with a little. It's an experimental outing that strikes a specific nerve, but the Adams' desperate reflection — on what fleeting time we have with the people we foolishly think will always be there — scares you only as deep as you let it. Mickey's loss can resonate in your own memories, but there's a temptation to look for the film's technical flaws as a means of escaping its stark and heartbreaking spirit.

That shagginess should instead underline the three artists' importance, and maybe get them a shot at an actual budget. Explosive emotion from Zelda Adams recommends the filmmaker as an acting muse to watch, and she proves a strong center for the story. Meanwhile, Toby Poser articulates a strength of mysticism that suggests her name in every truly brilliant line from what feels like a mixed-medium script.

“The difference between the poison and a curse is the dose,” the witch Solveig says in one of several ornate proclamations the real-life rocker manages to pull off against all odds. 

 










Opposite John Adams as a shaking protector — one who spends “Mother of Flies” working through the horror unfurling before his daughter to mostly no avail — Poser brings an essential assuredness to the affair that's at once threatening and matriarchal. The archetypes these auteurs play are far from convincing as grounded people, but the roles are detailed enough to feel ripped from the vague description of someone's real life. It's in those kinds of liminal spaces that the bright soul fueling this family of filmmakers proves easiest to see.

Debating the superstitious merits of prayer, and casually batting around methods of suicide in conversation, the all-too-likable father and daughter that drive “Mother of Flies” find themselves slammed between the domesticity of real death and a larger-than-life hallucinatory force. The grinding score from the Adams' garage-punk music group snaps that vision into cohesive focus, and H6LLB6ND6R's blend of atmospheric and folk sounds keeps this ethereal 92-minute endeavor at a steady clip. The result is bright fruit plucked from a deep-rooted tree that shows no signs of rotting soon.

There are discussions I wished I'd had with my aunt, and other relatives I've known to pass — conversations it seems Zelda is having with her parents on the big screen. At a time when even horror lovers are petrified of isolation, “Mother of Flies” festers with feelings too scary to keep inside. It's imperfect, better for it, and even languishing in grief, a clear cinematic legacy ready to start.

 










“Mother of Flies” is expected from Shudder in 2026.

The comedian and his friend purchased, but do not legally own, the paranormal investigators' home, museum and entire artifact collection

 Matt Rife may be known for his comedy, but he's a horror lover through and through — and now he's got the haunted collection to prove it.


 On Friday, Aug. 1, the comedian announced on TikTok that along with his friend, YouTube creator Elton Castee, he has “officially purchased” the home and museum of Ed and Lorraine Warren. This includes the famed paranormal investigators' “entire haunted collection,” Rife said — including the infamous Annabelle doll. 


 In the TikTok, Rife sat down to explain his “super random” purchase of the Monroe, Conn. home and museum, called the Warrens' Occult Museum, as well as the collection of haunted artifacts, which have been fodder for modern horror hits like Annabelle and the Conjuring films.


 “This might be the most important and prominent piece of paranormal history in the world. Ed and Lorraine Warren are who took demonology and ghost hunting and paranormal investing and made it mainstream,” Rife said in the TikTok. “I know a lot of you guys don't know [what] any of this means whatsoever, but if you follow ghost stuff, this is about as big as it gets.”

 The comedian went on to explain that he and Castee are now the “legal guardians and caretakers” of the Warrens' home, as well as the museum and its collection of 750 artifacts. But they don't have permanent ownership, he clarified.


 "I must go on record and say we do not legally own the items, but we are the legal guardians and caretakers of the items for at least the next five years,” Rife said.


 A rep for Rife confirmed the purchase as “legit” in a statement to PEOPLE on Saturday, Aug. 2, while reps for the museum did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.

 The comedian also shared big plans for the Warrens' Occult Museum, whose doors have been closed for several years. (The museum was closed in 2019 due to a zoning violation, The Monroe Sun previously reported.)


 “Soon,” the comedian teased in the TikTok, the house will be open for guests, with options to visit for a day, night or entire weekend. The museum, meanwhile, will be opened up for tours, he added in the caption, “so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place.”


 "This is the most random hobby ever, but it's so f------ cool, man,” the comedian said. “I should probably collect stamps or something — might be a little safer.”

 Rife also revealed that he and Castee have been in the Annabelle doll's presence, sharing a photo of the pair with the horror icon, a real antique Raggedy Ann doll supposedly possessed by an inhuman spirit. The New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), which was founded by the Warrens, previously described it as “demonically possessed.”


 Since the Conjuring films thrust Annabelle into the spotlight, the doll, which has been housed at the Connecticut museum since the 1970s, has left its longtime home — in its glass case — to make appearances at events and conventions.


 In May, Annabelle hit the road for the nationwide Devils on the Run tour with Dan Rivera, a senior lead investigator for NESPR. Months into the tour, Rivera died at a hotel in Gettysburg, Pa. At the time, Adams County Coroner Francis Dutrow confirmed to PEOPLE that the doll was not present when he arrived at the scene on July 13, when authorities were notified about Rivera's death.

Comedian Matt Rife purchased the Connecticut home and occult museum of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, making him the official guardian of the allegedly possessed Annabelle doll.

Matt Rife is taking his crowd work to a new…dimension.

Indeed, the comedian revealed that he purchased the Connecticut home and occult museum of paranormal investigators Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren, which has been the inspiration for multiple famous horror films.

And with that purchase came the responsibility of “being the legal guardian for at least the next 5 years, of the entire haunted collection including THE ANNABELLE DOLL,” he wrote in the caption of an August 1 TikTok video, “with my good friend @eltoncastee!!”

As for why he decided to splurge on what he described as “the most important and prominent piece of paranormal history in the world?” Well, he considered it a hobby as well as a business venture.

“If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with the paranormal and all things haunted,” he continued. “You also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time. So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history.”

While he and Elton aren't the official owners of the Annabelle doll, Matt clarified that they are the legal guardians and caretakers of the items for the next few years.

“Ed and Lorain Warren arguably put demonology and paranormal into the mainstream and are the very heart of some of the most famous haunted stories of all time,” he added, “The Conjuring House, Amityville Horror, et…”

And because the comedian is so passionate about his new endeavors, he made it his goal to share the property's chilling history with the world.

“What this means for you guys is, you are going to soon be able to book a night or a weekend and stay at the Warrens' house and investigate the house” he revealed. “This is the most random hobby ever but it's so f--king cool, man. I should probably collect stamps or something—might be a little safer.”

The 29-year-old's chilling purchase comes less than a month after Dan Rivera—who was hosting a national tour of the original Annabelle doll—died suddenly following a stop with the New England Society of Psychic Research (NESPR).

"It's with deep sadness that Tony, Wade, and I share the sudden passing of our close friend and partner, Dan Rivera," NESPR lead investigator Chris "Jeek" Gilloren wrote on the group's Facebook page July 14. "Dan truly believed in sharing his experiences and educating people on the paranormal. His kindness and passion touched everyone who knew him."

And despite online theories that the doll had something to do with his death, Francis Dutrow, the coroner in charge of his case, later confirmed that the toy was not present in the room where Dan was found dead.

"That needs to stop," fellow paranormal investigator Jason Hawes wrote on Facebook of the online rumors surrounding Dan's death. "His family shouldn't have to read that kind of nonsense while they're grieving."

For more about Rivera's passing and the lore around the Annabelle doll, keep reading…

Who Was Dan Rivera?

Before Dan Rivera's sudden death on July 13, he had dedicated much of his life to investigating the supernatural."Dan truly believed in sharing his experiences and educating people on the paranormal," the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR) wrote in a July 14 Facebook post announcing his passing. "His kindness and passion touched everyone who knew him."Born and raised in Connecticut, Rivera spent years working closely with Lorraine Warren, who along with her husband Ed Warren investigated spirits and demonology.Later on, Rivera brought his passion to the screen—appearing on Travel Channel's Most Haunted Places and producing Netflix's 28 Days Haunted. However, paranormal investigations were only part of world. He also served in the U.S. Army and was a family man."We understand that Dan's work inspired fascination and curiosity for man," NESPR's July 15 press release noted, "but above all, he was a father, devoted husband, and loyal friend, someone who meant the world to those closest to him."

What Is the Story Behind the Annabelle Doll?

Warning: This may give you nightmares.According to NESPR's website, Annabelle dates back to around the early 70s when a mom purchased the doll from a hobby store and gave it to her college-aged daughter Donna. Donna and her roommate Angie soon noticed "very strange and creepy" things, according to the site, like "the doll mysteriously seemed to move about the house" and messages asking for help that looked like they were "written by a small child" supposedly appeared.The duo reportedly contacted a medium and were told about a young girl named Annabelle, who was allegedly found dead in a field where their apartment building was later built.Eventually, the site continued, Donna and Angie reached out to the Warrens, who deemed the doll "demonically possessed" and removed Annabelle from the apartment (placing the figure in a box).The story captured the attention of horror movie fans and inspired films like The Conjuring and Annabelle.

What Were Dan Rivera's Interactions With the Annabelle Doll?

While working with the Warrens and NESPR, Rivera helped run events and tours involving Annabelle. In fact, he often was the one to move the doll in and out of her case with gloves."I take great precautions of moving that doll," Rivera told radio station i95Rock in 2022. "I mean, I have to go to the church, I have to go to confession, I have to have a priest do a blessing over me before I can even touch that doll."And there have been unusual incidents."After I moved that doll from the case that I had built back into Ed's original case, because I needed to do repairs on it, I had to leave the museum that evening," he added. "Because my leg started shaking—I mean, really bad—and I started getting these cold sweats. So I had to leave the museum, and I never felt anything like that before."

How Did Dan Rivera Die?

To be clear, an official cause of death has yet to be revealed.Rivera was on tour with the Annabelle doll when he was found in a hotel room in Gettysburg, Pa., on July 13, Adams County Chief Deputy Coroner Scott Pennewill told Today.com. He was 54 years old. And as Pennewill told the outlet, Rivera's "death was nothing suspicious."Plus, per the coroner, the Annabelle doll was not in the hotel room and Rivera was alone when he was found. In addition, a police report listed the nature of the incident as a "natural" death.

What Have Paranormal Investigators Said About Annabelle and Dan Rivera's Death?

Paranormal investigators have shared their own personal experiences with Annabelle.Like Zak Bagans. "I did have the opportunity to investigate Annabelle when the owner brought her to my museum in 2017," the Ghost Adventures star told Us Weekly July 16. "I got very affected by her and it kinda caused me to touch the doll. The owner didn't like that too much."Meanwhile, Ghost Hunters alum Jason Hawes reminded fans to not spread conspiracy theories."Recently the World lost a good man," he wrote on Facebook July 15. "Dan Rivera was an Army veteran, a father of four, a husband, and someone who truly cared about people. What's even harder to see right now are the posts blaming his death on things like the Annabelle doll and attacking places like Ghostly Images of Gettysburg Tours and other locations for having events. That needs to stop. His family shouldn't have to read that kind of nonsense while they're grieving."Some people are using his passing to push an agenda for profit, and it's just disgusting," Jason added. "Dan was a family man, a respected paranormal investigator, and he left this world way too soon. Let's focus on remembering Dan for who he was, not turning his death into some made up bulls--t story to get clicks or attention."

What Has Dan Rivera's Family Said About His Death?

Following Rivera's death, his son David created a GoFundMe page, noting the money raised would go to covering costs of the funeral and care for Rivera's four kids."He was famous for his work as lead paranormal investigator of NESPR, where he helped countless people out of dark times and brought comfort and a sense of safety to those who needed it," David wrote in a message posted to the site. "But more importantly, he was my father, a great man who loved deeply and lived fully."He had a passion for working on classic cars while listening to classic rock and old school hip hop, enjoyed camping, and cherished spending time with family," he added. "He lit up every room with his smile, kindness and sarcastic witty humor. I was only blessed to spend time with my dad for 25 years and I wasn't prepared mentally, physically or financially to let him go this young."

When it comes to the cast of Supernatural, they're staying booked and busy with gigs across a variety of programming and streaming platforms.

Whether it's The Boys, Gen V, Tracker, or Fire Country, there's no shortage of shows for fans to sink their teeth into. Below, we round up a few of the Supernatural cast's biggest roles on TV outside of the spooky series. Scroll down for a closer look, and stay tuned for more about Supernatural.

For a deep-dive into 20 years of Supernatural, from behind-the-scenes scoop to exclusive cast interviews, photos, and fan stories, pick up a copy of TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special issue, available on newsstands and for order online at Supernatural.TVGM2025.com.

Season 5 of Prime Video‘s hit series about the titular vigilante group tasked with keeping “Supes” in line “just got a bit more supernatural,” the show teased earlier this year. Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles and Misha Collins will reunite when the drama, created by Supernatural‘s Eric Kripke, returns in 2026. “Jared, Jensen and Misha are all in the same frame together and in the same storyline and interacting with each other,” Kripke confirms.

The show is littered with SPN alums, from Rob Benedict‘s self-replicating Splinter to Jim Beaver‘s (below, with Claudia Doumit) ousted president Robert Singer and Jeffrey Dean Morgan‘s CIA case officer Joe Kessler. Ackles joined in Season 3 as Soldier Boy, who it turns out is the father of lab-bred series antagonist Homelander (Antony Starr). Of the upcoming season, Kripke says, “Having us back together on set filming was just so fun.” —Meaghan Darwish

“Saving people, fighting fires, the family business.” A twist can be put on the Winchesters' motto — no monsters to hunt here — for Padalecki's character on this fiery drama. In a Season 3 arc, he played firefighter Capt. Camden Casey, who, like Supernatural‘s Sam, lost his brother on the job. As Bode Leone's (Max Thieriot) new boss, he sees the former inmate's talent as he trains to become part of Cal Fire. “The part was written for Jared,” executive producer Tia Napolitano shares. “He was a delight of a human and he really brought something special to the show.” Thieriot, also a cocreator, raves about acting with his friend. “Jared and I were excited to get to hang out and work together for the first time,” he says. “It was a lot of fun. Everybody enjoyed having him be part of the family.” —Meredith Jacobs 

Alexander Calvert traded his godly gig as Jack Kline for a new Supe role in The Boys‘ college-set 2023 spinoff, portraying Rufus, a student at Godolkin University. The school trains students with superpower abilities, his being telepathy, which includes hypnosis and astral projection. To use his powers, Rufus needs to be close to the individual he's either reading or controlling. His name is a nod to the date-rape drug Rohypnol, aka Roofies—and to his malicious intent.

Rufus abuses his powers to take advantage of women at Godolkin, among them protagonist Marie (Jaz Sinclair). Unbeknownst to Rufus, though, Marie's power to manipulate blood has painful repercussions for his actions, which never get far enough to do her any physical harm. It's safe to say, you'll see Calvert in a whole new light with this boundary-pushing part. —Meaghan Darwish 

Ackles is at the center of another complex fraternal relationship in this CBS drama following Colter Shaw (Justin Hartley), who searches for missing people. Ackles plays Colter's brother, Russell, and the two are estranged until the end of Season 1 because Colter thinks Russell had something to do with their father's death. (Russell convinces him otherwise and subsequently adds clues to the mystery surrounding that family tragedy.) Ackles comes in with preexisting relationships with both showrunner Elwood Reid (Big Sky) and Hartley (from their CW days on Supernatural and Smallville, respectively), though this is the first time they're working together. “Jensen texted me when he was watching football: ‘I'm trying to watch the game. Will you please get your mug off my screen?' And I texted him back, ‘Do you want to come play my brother?' And he said, ‘When and where?'” Hartley reveals. “He crushed it.” —Meredith Jacobs 

Ruth Connell traded in Rowena's spellbooks on Supernatural for the Afterlife's Lost and Found Department in Netflix‘s short-lived (no pun intended) series Dead Boy Detectives. The 2024 supernatural drama, set in the Sandman universe, focused on two deceased boys who refuse to move on in the afterlife so they can investigate supernatural mysteries.

As an assistant to Death herself, Connell's Night Nurse made sure the ghosts of dead children found their proper resting places. (The Scottish actress also played a version of the character in a 2021 episode of HBO's Doom Patrol.) The uptight, rule-abiding eternal chased after young detectives Edwin (George Rexstrew) and Charles (Jayden Revri) for decades. And no matter where she trekked to find the undead, the Night Nurse's red lipstick was always perfect. –Avery Thompson 

John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) wasn't a nice guy—but he was certainly no Negan. The Walking Dead‘s foul-mouthed villain, who beat his enemies to a pulp with his barbed-wire-wrapped bat, was a grim awakening for the drama's heroes in the zombie apocalypse series when he first stepped up to the plate during 2016's sixth season. Since, Negan has evolved into a bit of an antihero and now stars on spinoff Dead City opposite Lauren Cohan (who played thief Bela in a Season 3 SPN arc!) as survivor Maggie. You can almost call Negan one of the good guys now. But to Morgan, all roads lead back to John. “John was really my introduction to [the horror] world,” Morgan told TV Guide Magazine in 2020. “That's saying something from me, who has made a living out of this, not just as an actor, but as a bit of a genre actor as well.” —Emily Aslanian

The woefully underappreciated Batman-themed drama imagined a world where the late Bruce Wayne's adopted son (Oscar Morgan) sets out to find his killers with the help of (among others) the Joker's presumed daughter (Olivia Rose Keegan), a couple future Batman sidekicks (Navia Robinson, Anna Lore) and Misha Collins' Harvey Dent. And like Supernatural‘s Castiel, Gotham City's district attorney was a good guy capable of bad behavior, mostly due to his split personality. Unfortunately, the 2023 show's cancellation after a single season prevented us from getting to see Collins go full villain as the iconic Two Face, as well as the possible fulfillment of a former costar's aspirations. “We almost worked it out that Jensen Ackles would play Batman in our show in a flashback,” Collins said at the time, taking a good-natured shot at Ackles' long-running desire to play a superhero. “Obviously, he's trying to compensate for some shortcomings he has in real life.” —Damian Holbrook 

Remembered for his role as Lucifer on Supernatural, Mark Pellegrino has appeared in shows ranging from Lost to YA fare like 13 Reasons Why, and recently the actor stepped into the shoes of Virgil Poe in this crime drama set in Pennsylvania's Rust Belt. The 2021–24 series aired on Showtime before moving to Prime Video for its second and final season and featured Pellegrino's Virgil as the father of Alex Neustaedter‘s Billy Poe, a young man who finds himself accused of a murder he didn't commit. Ladies' man Virgil has a flirty relationship with his ex, Grace (Maura Tierney), Billy's mom. His unwillingness to quit Grace puts him at odds with her beau, Police Chief Del Harris (Jeff Daniels). “The good part about playing Virgil is you just have to tap that inner 6-year-old and let him come out and play,” Pellegrino told That Hashtag Show. “[He's] not taking pretty much anything too seriously.” —Meaghan Darwish 

Ackles arrived in the Season 2 finale of ABC's Montana-set crime drama as Sheriff Beau Arlen, then stuck around as a series regular for the third and final season in 2023. “They gave me a character I thought filled a bit of a void,” Ackles said. “I tried to hit those notes and bring a little levity to what's essentially a pretty grim basis for a show, which is murder mystery constantly.” His character fit right in alongside ex-cop Jenny Hoyt (Katheryn Winnick) and private detective Cassie Dewell (Kylie Bunbury), and the sparks between Beau and Jenny spiced things up considerably. “Well, they did cast Jensen,” Winnick joked. Even better, the show gave a nod to Supernatural when Beau gives Cassie salt for her new house so she's “always protected.” She responds, “Oh, from demons.” “I can't remember if that was in the script. I think it was an ad-lib,” Ackles shared. “It's good to layer in some lighter moments.” —Meredith Jacobs 

As LAPD detective Mark Meachum, Ackles' current role sees him joining a top-secret task force racing to save L.A. from a nuclear nightmare. But amid all the action and nail-biting bursts of suspense are moments of quick-witted humor that are a familiar fit for the Ackles we loved during his run as Dean Winchester. He admits the level of levity on set was similar to that of Supernatural. “We got to riff,” he says. “Not just when the cameras [were off], but when they were rolling. There was a lot of ad-libs and playful banter between us.” Ever the prankster, Ackles confesses that he called on his and Padalecki's past to mess with his new castmates. “I felt it my duty to really challenge a lot of the other actors to keep a straight face…and I had 15 years of practice with my brother!” —Damian Holbrook 

Three months after Supernatural‘s 2020 finale, Padalecki got back on the horse for The CW's reboot of the classic Chuck Norris action drama. As an executive producer with creator Anna Fricke, he was drawn to the role of grieving widower and Texas Ranger Cordell Walker. “I really wanted to be a part of [it],” he told TV Guide Magazine. The casting of his wife, Genevieve, as Cordell's late wife and the show filming in his Lone Star home state sweetened the deal. “Now I get to be here with my wife and kids. I get to work with Gen. I don't think I dared to dream this big.” Walker ran from 2021 to 2024 and even staged a mini-SPN reunion when Ackles directed Season 2's “No Such Thing as Fair Play,” which saw Cordell enduring a series of mishaps at the Texas Rangers' annual carnival. “I wanted to make the whole [episode] a Tough Mudder for him,” Ackles joked about tormenting his buddy. “I would've spent all day watching him go through a variety of obstacles that I had deviously created.” —Damian Holbrook

Some Nobel Prize winners are known to have turned towards psychics, mediums and the paranormal after winning. This is often known as "Nobel disease" or “Nobelitis”, and it is not clear why this happens. There are many examples of such people in historical records.

Nobel Prize winners are people who have excelled in their respective fields. You would think that they are extremely smart people, but some of them have reported to have been afflicted by what is called the "Nobel disease" or "Nobelitis". There is a long list of Nobel Prize winners who are said to have suffered from it. Before you think it's a real physical disease, let us tell you that it is something very different and one that has no real explanation. Boosted by their win, it seems their brains start doing their own thing, leading them to come up with weird and unscientific views on different things. According to IFLScience, the win does something to these people who start putting forward pseudoscientific beliefs that have no link to their field of study. According to a chapter in Critical Thinking in Psychology, the list of such Nobel Prize winners is quite long. It mentions strange cases, one of them being of a scientist who claimed that a glowing green raccoon on a motorcycle paid him a visit. However, most of them strangely got interested in psychic research and the paranormal world. Sounds weird for a scientist.

Pierre Curie, the husband of Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in physics for the discovery of radium and polonium alongside his wife, dropped the magnets and was pulled towards things like seances. He proposed that studying the paranormal held the answers to magnetism. Another Nobel winner in Physics, Joseph Thomson, also started leaning towards the psychic phenomena. He was even a member of the Society for Psychical Research for 34 years. Charles Richet, a Nobel winner in physiology or medicine, was pulled towards seances and mediums and coined the word "ectoplasm", used for the release of a substance from mediums (people who claim they talk to spirits). Then there were others who totally dismissed scientific beliefs, despite being science people themselves. Dr Kary Mullis, who won a share of the 1993 Nobel Prize in chemistry, raised doubts over climate change and admitted he believed in astrology. Once, he said, a glowing green raccoon visited him at his cabin in California. It then changed into a singing dolphin.

Paul Nurse, a Nobel Prize winner, says this behaviour could boil down to the pressures these people face after winning. He said, that everyone starts seeing you as a "world-leading expert on almost everything." People reach out to them to get their names on petitions, comment on other issues besides science, etc. Nurse thinks this builds pressure on them to learn about other things besides their field of expertise, something he cautions Nobel winners against. Even Isaac Newton had a thing for alchemy and strange religious beliefs. However, this is not a generalisation and there is no data that shows Nobel Prize winners are more inclined to such beliefs. However, it is interesting to know that men and women of science can also lean in towards things that have no explanation.

Comedian Matt Rife's new purchase is ha-ha-haunted.

Rife revealed Friday that he purchased the Connecticut home and occult museum of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, becoming the “legal guardian” of the famed Annabelle doll.

The stand-up comic, who bought the house alongside his pal and YouTube star Elton Castee, called the centuries-old farmhouse the “most important and prominent pieces of paranormal history in the world.”

“Ed and Lorraine Warren are who took demonology, ghost hunting and paranormal investigation and made it mainstream,” Rife told his TikTok followers.

INSANE ANNOUNCEMENT 😍🤯😈👹 I have officially purchased Ed and Lorraine Warren's home and Occult Museum, including being the legal guardian for at least the next 5 years, of the entire haunted collection including THE ANNABELLE DOLL, with my good friend @Elton Castee !! If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with the paranormal and all things haunted. You also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time. So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history. Ed and Lorain Warren arguably put demonology and paranormal into the mainstream and are the very heart of some of the most famous haunted stories of all time, The Conjuring House, Amityville Horror, et…  We plan to open the house for overnight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place. #TheConjuring #Annabelle #AnnabelleDoll #haunted 

The Monroe, Conn. home was once owned by the real-life couple who conducted over 3,000 paranormal investigations that inspired movies like “The Conjuring” and “The Amityville Horror.”

“The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time,” Rife shared. “So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history.”

Rife did not reveal how much he spent on his purchase.

Haunted relics from the Warrens' adventures remained on the property after their death including fragments of crashed Eastern Airlines Flight 401 and an organ that can play on its own.

The museum also houses Annabelle, the giant Raggedy Ann doll, which was kept locked in a case labeled “Warning: Positively Do Not Open.”

The doll is believed to have a “demonic” presence attached to it after it allegedly terrorized two roommates in the 1970s by mysteriously moving by itself, leaving creepy notes and it was accused of trying to strangle a friend sleeping in the apartment.

Most recently, it was part of the “Devils on the Run Tour,” hosted by paranormal investigator Dan Rivera, who died suddenly in his hotel room on July 13.

Rivera was traveling around the US with other members of the New England Society for Psychic Research to show off Annabelle as part of his tour.

The doll was not in the room when he died and state police claim “nothing unusual or suspicious” was found at the scene.

Rivera's cause of death has not yet been released.

The recent incident has not stopped Rife from leaning into his new “hobby.”

“We are the legal guardians and caretakers of all 750 haunted artifacts and items in the Warren museum including the Annabelle doll,” Rife said. “We don't legally own the items, but we are legal guardians and caretakers of the items for at least the next five years.”

The “Wild ‘N Out” improviser plans to reopen the haunted doors for museum tours and overnight stays to “learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place.”

“This is the most random hobby ever, but it's so f—ing cool, man. I should probably collect stamps or something,” Rife quipped. “Might be a little safer.”

The new owners will likely have to fix up the property's fire-safety issues before they can share it, according to The Providence Journal.

“Still can't believe we're the new owners… Sitting on their porch now looking at all the photos of them at this house. We're gonna make this the best paranormal investigation location on the planet,” co-owner Elton Castee commented under Rife's announcement.

The home and museum were not open to the public in recent years after it was shut down in 2019 due to zoning issues.

Take me to your leader!

Vice President JD Vance made it known that he is “obsessed” with and “particularly focused” on UFOs — announcing on a recent podcast that he will spend time in the next weeks looking into the subject matter.

“Like I'm obsessed with the whole UFO thing. ‘What's actually going on?' ‘What were those videos all about?' ‘What's actually happening?'” the veep stated in unprompted comments on the Ruthless Podcast episode released Friday.

“I haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet but we're only six months in, we've been very busy,” Vance said with a chuckle.

“The August recess is in part me gonna try to dive to the bottom of the whole UFO thing from last year.”

It is unclear whether the Ohio native was referring to the New Jersey drone phenomenon that began on Nov. 13 last year with sightings of unidentified aircraft reportedly the size of cars hovering over a Picatinny Arsenal.

The Trump administration cited the Federal Aviation Administration in a report earlier this year that stated the agency had no record of any anomalous sightings during the period of heightened public attention.

Ruthless Podcast cohost Michael Duncan then opened up about his own interest in the once-taboo subject matter.

“I've been to Roswell,” Duncan confessed. “I've done the tours. I've done the whole thing.”

“Did you see any aliens?” Vance asked.

“No. I saw the hangar where they were,” Duncan responded sincerely.

“Once I get to the bottom of it, if there's anything there, I'll make sure you're the first to know,” Vance replied.

It is unclear the extent to which Vance was joking in the casual conversation.

Another member of the Trump administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, takes UFOs very seriously.Then-senator Rubio claimed top US officials have “first-hand knowledge” of a secret Pentagon crash retrieval program back in a 2023 interview with NewsNation. 

Rubio sat down for an interview for upcoming documentary “Age of Disclosure” which has been much ballyhooed by disclosure advocates.The VP's office did not respond to The Post's request for comment.

Supernatural has had so many great episodes that it can be hard to decide what the best ones are, and while the #1 episode is arguably undeniable, there is another that comes awfully close to surpassing it. Running for 15 seasons, Supernatural is often considered the best CW show of all time, leaving a lasting legacy across 327 episodes.

During its long run, Supernatural experienced a lot of highs and some lows, but always remained engaging, blending great action with incredible scares and hilarious moments. The show likes to jump around in terms of tone, and some of the Supernatural's best episodes of the show are vastly different from each other, with the top two showing that perfectly.

The absolute best episode of Supernatural has been hotly debated over the years, with most settling on two that prove just how great a show Supernatural is. Debates about the most superior episode could be laid to rest after several Supernatural cast members all agreed that "The French Mistake" is the best of what the series has to offer.

Season 6, episode 15, "The French Mistake" sees Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) sent to an alternate dimension where their alternate selves are TV actors on a show called Supernatural. It's all very meta and gives both Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles a chance to play "themselves," pulling in some of their personal lives into the storyline.

With such a silly premise, "The French Mistake" could have been terrible, but the show is so good at often taking silly concepts and making them into something spectacular.

With such a silly premise, "The French Mistake" could have been terrible, but the show is so good at often taking silly concepts and making them into something spectacular. "The French Mistake" acts like a love letter to the entirety of Supernatural, and it makes sense that actors like Padalecki and Misha Collins (Castiel) agree that it's the best.

While "The French Connection" sits atop Supernatural's best episodes, the season 5 finale, "Swan Song", comes extremely close to being even better. In fact, Supernatural was only envisioned to be five seasons when it began. Original showrunner, Erik Kripke (The Boys), talked to EW about leaving the show after season 5, making "Swan Song" the last episode he created, stating:

We were reaching the end of this five-year storyline [so] I thought the timing was right. I knew that we were closing this chapter and opening a new one. It felt like it was the right time to take a step back and focus on new projects.

"Swan Song" sees the culmination of the battle between good and evil as Lucifer and the Archangel Michael battle once more, with Lucifer using Sam's body as a vessel. The episode ends with Sam sacrificing himself to trap Lucifer back in Hell, while Dean attempts to live a normal life in the aftermath.

"Swan Song" was spectacular from start to finish, with a lot of fans ranking it at the top of the list when it comes to Supernatural's best episodes. There will always be discussions about whether Supernatural should have continued past season 5, but if it had, "Swan Song" would have easily been the best episode the show ever produced.

"The French Connection" and "Swan Song" are vastly different types of episodes, but perfect examples of what makes Supernatural so great. That being said, "Swan Song" does do something better than "The French Connection." The emotional beats that "Swan Song" hits are better than any other time in the series, and set the episode apart from the rest.

Supernatural was arguably at its peak when the season 5 finale rolled around, and it largely wrapped up all the major threads that had been built up during its entire run at that point. This resulted in some of the most emotionally resonant moments in the series overall, especially when it comes to Sam and Dean.

"Swan Song" is actually the highest-rated episode of Supernatural on IMDb with 9.7/10.

Sam's character arc was nearly perfect by the time "Swan Song" wrapped up, and his sacrifice was poetic in a number of ways. Seeing Dean living a normal life, finally away from hunting, was incredibly touching. Of course, the show continued for 10 more seasons, while Sam and Dean continued to find themselves in increasingly dire situations.

"Swan Song" might have bigger stakes and be more emotionally resonant, but one reason that "The French Connection" is often considered the best episode is the way it perfectly represents what makes Supernatural amazing. It's also incredibly well-written, which really elevated the episode altogether when it could have failed spectacularly.

Supernatural wasn't afraid to be meta or have a number of self-referential moments throughout, but "The French Connection" is when the show really began to lean into it, which also helped make it a defining characteristic of the series. It also just feels like a love letter to everything that people love about Supernatural, especially Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki.

Supernatural will always be iconic, leaving a lasting legacy after 15 years of the Winchester brothers fighting monsters, gods, ghosts, and everything else spooky. With 327 episodes to its name, there is something to love for whoever watches Supernatural, but "Swan Song" and "The French Connection" are inarguably the cream of the crop.
