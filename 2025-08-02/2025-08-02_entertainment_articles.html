                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the next prequel in The Hunger Games hitting theaters on Nov. 20, 2026, at least one familiar face is open to returning. No, I know nothing in that world right now,” Hutcherson clarified to Brit + Co. “Hunger Games is amazing, and I've loved it for many years and I will love it forever.” Although the events of Sunrise on the Reaping are set 24 years before the events of The Hunger Games, the book briefly features a grown Peeta and Katniss Everdeen (originated by Jennifer Lawrence) as Haymitch Abernathy (which Joseph Zada is set to take over from Woody Harrelson) recounts the events of his Hunger Game to them. Hutcherson previously portrayed Peeta in The Hunger Games (2012), The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1 (2014) and Part 2 (2015), alongside Lawrence, Harrison and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne. I'm curious to know what happens between when they have their family and when the story ends, just to understand what happened in the world, how they got to that place.

Noting she had to keep the finale twist a secret, Piper explained, “I just found it quite moving, and it was really fun to film because it had such a sort of cloak-and-dagger feeling about getting it made. “It was always the plan to do this amount of seasons, because it's a role that demands a lot of you, physically and emotionally and mentally,” said Gatwa in a behind-the-scenes featurette. I would love to have the energy and the youth to be able to do this full time for the rest of my life, but my knees are telling me it's time.” Doctor Who has not yet been renewed for Season 3 at Disney+ and BBC.

Conan O'Brien — long before he himself became one of America's favorite hosts — was on staff for three years as a “Saturday Night Live” writer, which he describes as one of the 50-year-old series' most intense periods. “I was in that state of mind, and I think [Robert] Smigel and [Bob] Odenkirk and Greg Daniels were like, ‘It's life or death,'” O'Brien related on his podcast “Conan Needs a Friend” (via Entertainment Weekly). Odenkirk expressed similar feelings in an interview with EW last month. “I was too hard on the show,” he said. And I was frustrated by it not representing purely my point of view. I wanted it to be me, my show.” Related Stories ‘The Holiday' Is the Latest Iconic 2000s IP to Get a Revival — This Time for Apple TV+ ‘And Just Like That' Ending After Season 3 As O'Brien recalled, “He was like, ‘This is so much fun to be at SNL. And he had that, ‘I'm going to do Opera Man. '” O'Brien was perplexed: “This is a possibility? In previous episodes of his podcast, O'Brien has discussed similar “SNL” regrets. O'Brien parlayed his “SNL” stint into a lengthy career of his own, and he even came back from his own career rollercoaster at sketch show's network NBC. After spending a couple years on “The Simpsons” staff, O'Brien returned to the network, hosting the long-running “Late Night with Conan O'Brien.” He briefly hosted “The Tonight Show” in 2009-2010, only to be replaced by previous host Jay Leno in highly controversial series of events. He would have a swift comeback, though, landing on Comedy Central on “Conan” with yet another talk series, the first in a series of acclaimed ventures. The road led O'Brien to the Oscars, which he hosted to raves in March (and utilized Sandler for an audience bit) and will host again next year. Of this O'Brien said, “the only reason I'm hosting the Oscars next year is that I want to hear Adrien Brody finish his speech.” Just last week, “Happy Gilmore 2” premiered to big numbers on Netflix, the latest in a long line of audience favorites for the comedian.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Well, he was essentially, I guess, sort of half-innocent," the president said. Donald Trump is once again addressing the possibility of granting a presidential pardon to Sean “Diddy” Combs. During a Friday (Aug. 1) interview on Newsmax's Finnerty, the president was asked whether he would consider pardoning Combs following his recent federal conviction. In early July, the Bad Boy Records mogul was found guilty of transportation with intent to engage in prostitution, though he was acquitted of more serious charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering. “Well, he was essentially, I guess, sort of half-innocent,” Trump told host Rob Finnerty. But I guess it wasn't as good of a victory.” Trump also reflected on his past relationship with Combs, noting they were once “very friendly” and that he “got along with him great.” However, he said that dynamic shifted when he entered politics, describing Combs as having become “very hostile.” During an Oval Office press briefing in late May, he was asked by Fox News' Peter Doocy whether he would consider a pardon for Combs. “I haven't spoken to him in years,” Trump said. Combs' partial acquittal followed seven weeks of testimony, including statements from singer Cassie Ventura, who accused him of abuse and trafficking during their relationship. He now faces up to 20 years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for Oct. 3. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

This week, “Weapons” star Julia Garner — who was announced to star in a Madonna movie way back in 2022 — confirmed on the podcast “Smartless” that, in spite of reports to the contrary, the project “Like a Virgin” is still very much in gestation. “That's supposed to still happen,” she said (via Variety). Garner was set to star alongside Julia Fox, who would play Madonna BFF and frequent music video co-star Debi Mazar. Fox spoke with IndieWire in 2024 about the movie's reported shelving by Universal, seeming similarly ambiguous. Related Stories The Key to ‘The Naked Gun' Dumb Jokes Is Smart Filmmaking ‘Mother of Flies' Review: The Adams Officially Arrive as America's Next Great Lo-Fi Horror Family “I know it was gonna be either tour or movie and then she went on tour,” Fox said. “So I don't know when the movie will be picking back up again or when they're going to start working on it again. On Smartless, Garner said she was enthused to take on Madonna, because she “just wanted to see if [she] could do it.” The film was — or is — to be directed by the “Vogue” icon herself, for whom Garner auditioned. In May, Deadline revealed that a Netflix series is planned — and Garner does have a long history with the streamer, remaining a mainstay with “Ozark,” “Inventing Anna,” and an upcoming limited series about the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The Madonna TV show would be executive produced by the “A League of Their Own” star, alongside “Stranger Things” EP Shawn Levy. Just last season, Timothée Chalamet earned an Oscar nod as Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown,” while Kingsley Ben-Adir also got stellar notices for his portrayal of Bob Marley. As for Madonna, when whatever it becomes will happen remains uncertain. “Anything that's great… takes a long time,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The month is kicking off with some big real estate news. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, August 1, that the mammoth California mansion formerly owned by Aaron Spelling and his wife, Candy, has been purchased for $110 million by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Aaron's daughter, “Beverly Hills, 90210” star Tori Spelling, previously told People the structure was so huge she never even visited every room of it while living their with her parents. “You know me, I get exhausted very easily. Just taking that elevator up to the second floor was like too much to handle,” she joked to the mag before adding that she was prohibited by her mother from entering the staff quarters out of respect for the employees' privacy. The palatial home, which was remodeled by former owner Petra Ecclestone after she purchased it for $120 million in 2019, offers many perks. Among them are a bowling alley, wine cellar, and beauty salon which Realtor.com says features massage and tanning rooms. Its 56,500 square feet include 14 bedrooms and 27 baths, per TMZ. TMZ says the billionaire Schmidt family plans to use the property for meetings and nonprofit events, although it will remain classified as a single family residence. The luxury California real estate market has struggled lately, and several sellers have had to cut prices. Factors include the recent wildfires of January 2025, flight of the wealthy to lower tax states, and overall economic angst, according to Realtor.com's market snapshot. The $110 million dollar sale price of The Manor, located at 594 S Mapleton Dr, is $10 million less than what Ecclestone previously paid. These market conditions may explain why Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck took their former home off the market in May, after lowering the asking price by almost $9 million and still not finding a buyer.</p>

As “And Just Like That…” spinoff wraps after Season 3, the curtain is closing on a cultural legacy that redefined womanhood for generations. Cynthia Nixon is bidding adieu to her iconic role as Miranda Hobbes, a character she's portrayed from “Sex and the City” to “And Just Like That…” Through it all, Miranda's evolution has been one of the most complex and celebrated arcs in the franchise: from tough New York lawyer to devoted mother, from forgiving Steve's infidelity to ending their marriage and embracing her sexual identity with new love and purpose. “I can't believe our wild beautiful And Just Like That ride is almost over. It has been such a delight from start to finish. While Nixon prepares to close the chapter on Miranda, she leaves fans with a promise of more to come — both on-screen and in her feed: “Get ready for a lot more carousels in the weeks to come! And don't miss these last few episodes: surprises in store! Following the announcement, Kristin Davis, who has portrayed Charlotte York Goldenblatt since 1998. She also offered a touching thank-you to the fans who have supported the show for over two decades: “And to our loyal fans, we love you forever and ever. !You hold me up and I do not take it for granted!!! “While I was writing the last episode of And Just Like That… Season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop. Along with Sarah Jessica Parker, Casey Bloys and Sarah Aubrey, we decided to end the popular series this year with a two-part finale and extended the original series order from 10 episodes to 12.” The final two episodes of “And Just Like That…” Season 3 will air as a two-part finale, beginning August 14 on Max.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dead and Company paid tribute to the late Phil Lesh on the opening night of their Dead 60 anniversary concerts in San Francisco by bringing out Lesh's son Grahame for “Box of Rain.” The Bob Weir and John Mayer-fronted band have sparingly performed the Lesh-sung American Beauty classic, one of the bassist's signature songs, since their inception in 2015; Dead and Company played “Box of Rain” only one other time in the past three years, at their first Sphere weekend since Lesh's death in October 2024. Grahame Lesh — who led an all-star band, similar to his father's Phil & Friends, at a pre-Dead 60 concert Thursday at San Francisco's Pier 48 — handled lead vocals and wielded his father's bass for “Box of Rain,” then stuck around to join Dead and Company for a rendition of “Playing in the Band.” Billy Strings, who opened the show Friday, later joined Dead and Company on “Wharf Rat”: Dead and Company will return to Golden Gate Park, where the Grateful Dead staged at least 14 gigs spanning from 1967 to 1991, on Saturday and Sunday night. Rolling Stone spoke with Bobby Weir about the band potentially reuniting for the 60th anniversary, which Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann, and Mickey Hart discussed before Lesh died. Stevie Nicks Forced to Reschedule Tour Dates After Fracturing Shoulder “I think when Phil checked out, so did that notion, because we don't have a bass player who's been playing with us for 60 years now. Phil had all kinds of ideas that were pretty much unique to him. I grew up with Phil holding down the bottom in his unique way,” Weir said. I haven't thought about it — it's just now occurring to me that it's a possibility that we could do that, since you asked.… I guess we'll just see what the three of us can pull together.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump weighed in again on rumors of a possible presidential pardon for Sean Combs, the hip-hop mogul convicted last month on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, calling him “half-innocent” but agreeing with a host who asked if it was “more likely a no.” Combs was found not guilty on July 2 of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. Yet each of the two prostitution counts could technically land him in prison for up to 10 years when the mogul is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 3. (Legal experts, however, tell Rolling Stone they expect him to get much less.) “Well, he was essentially, I guess, sort of half-innocent,” Trump told Newsmax host Rob Finnerty Friday night. But I guess it wasn't as good of a victory.” But when asked about Trump in 2017, Combs told the Daily Beast, “I think that to be honest, we don't really give a fuck about Trump, because [black people are] in the same fucked-up position. This man literally threatened the lives of us and our families about going to vote … The number one priority is to get Trump out of office.” When asked about a possible pardon in May, Trump said, “I haven't seen him, I haven't spoken to him in years. He used to really like me a lot, but I think when I ran for politics that relationship busted up … I read some little bit nasty statements in the paper all of a sudden.” But he seemed at least somewhat sympathetic to Combs' plight, telling reporters that he “would certainly look at the facts” of the case. “I know people are thinking about it,” he added. Well, he was essentially, I guess, sort of half innocent. During Friday's interview, Trump recalled that he was “very friendly with him. I got along with him great, and [he] seemed like a nice guy. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile. And we don't like to have things cloud our judgment, right? As Rolling Stone reported in May, the mogul's associates began contacting people close to Trump shortly after he won the presidential election last November. During the presidential transition and in the opening months of Trump's second administration, several longtime friends and allies of Combs, who've known the rapper for many years, began reaching out to some Trump transition and administration officials, as well as to others close to the president, two sources familiar with the matter and another person briefed on it told Rolling Stone. Sean Combs Asks Judge to Ditch His Conviction or Retry Prostitution Counts Mary J. Blige Fighting Back After ‘Meritless' Lawsuit From Sean Combs' Ex Misa Hylton Sean Combs Asks to be Released From Jail Ahead of Sentencing As Rolling Stone reported on Thursday, Combs' team has intensified their behind-the-scenes campaign in recent weeks, according to people in and out of the Trump administration. “The pleading has gotten bigger [this month],” a Trump adviser says, referring to a conspicuous uptick in Combs allies' attempts to woo Team Trump. In the past few weeks, longtime Combs allies have offered to pay political operatives, lobbyists, and others with close ties to Trumpland and government officials large financial sums in exchange for help with a potential Trump pardon, three people familiar with the matter tell Rolling Stone. Multiple Trump advisers still feel it would be a deeply unforced error to pardon Combs while the administration is still embroiled in a scandal over their handling of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Stevie Nicks Forced to Reschedule Tour Dates After Fracturing Shoulder Rolling Stone has reviewed a draft copy of the letter, which admonishes Combs for attempting to “reclaim control” and “rewrite history” following his conviction on prostitution charges. Earlier this week, they filed a new motion asking that Combs be released on bail. Southern District of New York prosecutors filed their own motion Thursday night arguing that Combs remain in jail until his sentencing. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former governor, previously the world's biggest movie star, and somehow also occupier of the lowest rung on Netflix's algorithmically baked tower of recommendations? Past tense employed there because this state of affairs has, suddenly, expired, as Deadline reports that Schwarzenegger's TV series FUBAR has been kicked off the Netflix streaming schedule after two seasons. The series starred Da Big Man alongside Monica Barbaro, doing a sort of Alias-y, over-70 spin on True Lies, with a father and daughter both secretly working as operatives for the CIA and trying to stop that dang Diego Luna from blowing everybody up. The series debuted its first season back in May of 2023, and then rolled out a second season back in June 2025, which you probably remember because [note to self: Find someone who remembers FUBAR season 2 coming out back in June and find out why they did that.] But we kid FUBAR, mostly because we never really knew what else to do with it: Yes, it's kind of neat to see Schwarzenegger doing TV stuff, but beyond that very simple novelty, it seemed like a pretty basic spin on two very old premises, mixing “Fathers and daughters struggle to get along!” with “Netflix spy crap you've seen a million times!” Per Deadline, the series notably didn't make much of an impact when it came back a few months ago, just barely cracking the streamer's own Top 10 listings for the week of its premiere. (It's possible that a two-year gap between seasons didn't help; shows like Severance can survive that kind of momentum killer, but FUBAR, by all accounts, was no Severance.) In addition to Schwarzenegger and recent Oscar nominee Barbaro, the series also starred Milan Carter, Travis Van Winkle, Fabiana Udenio, Jay Baruchel, Aparna Brielle, Andy Buckley, Guy Burnett, Carrie Anne-Moss, and Fortune Feimster, who, the law of averages suggests, presumably got off at least a couple of pretty good jokes during two seasons of show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>THR is also debuting new stills from Richard Linklater's homage to 'Breathless' and the French New Wave, which premiered in May at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received rave reviews. When Netflix acquired Nouvelle Vague's U.S. rights shortly after Cannes, some reacted with surprise and dismay that a movie shot on film and about cinema would end up with a streamer. Additionally, THR can report that the largely French-language film will be pushed across all categories. In my humble opinion, it could well end up a finalist for best picture, a category in which non-English-language films have landed many noms in recent years (including France's Netflix-distributed Emilia Pérez earlier this year); best director (Linklater is a beloved auteur, but his only nom in the category came for 2014's Boyhood); and screenplay (it has yet to be determined if Holly Gent, Laetitia Masson and Vincent Palmo Jr.'s script will be classified as adapted or original). Meanwhile, Zoey Deutch, who is luminous as Breathless star Jean Seberg, will be campaigned in the supporting actress race, while French actors Guillaume Marbeck and Aubry Dullin, who eerily resemble the characters they play — Godard and Breathless breakout Jean-Paul Belmondo — will be pushed for lead actor and supporting actor, respectively. Each country's submission is determined by a selection committee comprised mostly of people associated with that country's film industry, who must attest that “creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.” Some selection committees are hesitant to submit a film directed by someone born outside of their country's borders, feeling that doing so would be a missed opportunity to highlight homegrown talent. But other countries enter whichever film they think offers them the best shot at actually landing an Oscar nom. Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland has had films entered by Poland, West Germany and the Czech Republic. France, however, has had bruising experiences with its last two submissions. In 2024, it entered The Taste of Things instead of Anatomy of a Fall; ultimately, the former was not nominated, while the latter went on to five other noms (best picture, director, original screenplay, actress and film editing), suggesting that it almost certainly would have been nominated for — and might have even won — best international feature had it been entered. Given that no other French film has emerged this year, so far, that would appear to offer the nation a better shot than Nouvelle Vague at landing a best international feature Oscar nom, and possibly even a win, it will be very interesting to see how France's selection committee plays it cards.
