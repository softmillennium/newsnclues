                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has reiterated his bearish short-term stance on Ethereum (ETH), highlighting signs of market correction that he first flagged last week. According to the analyst, the primary bounce zone lies near $3,300, a level where he estimates a 70% chance of recovery. Two key support blocks are outlined, with the lower block seen as a high-probability accumulation zone. The wider market appears to be entering a cautious phase, and van de Poppe suggests that ETH's drop could offer a compelling opportunity for mid- to long-term bulls. This view contrasts with other analysts like Mike Novogratz, who still believe Ethereum may finish the year near $4,000. A prominent market signal has just appeared on the Ethereum vs Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) chart, and traders are taking notice. Crypto billionaire and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has pushed back against bearish Ethereum sentiment, forecasting a potential breakout toward $4,000 by the end of 2025. Ethena (ENA) saw a sharp 11.58% daily decline, trading at $0.5413, as high-profile selling and weakening technicals spooked investors. A new wave of micro-cap altcoins is catching fire as momentum rotates back into riskier plays. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins COTI, a privacy-focused Ethereum-based protocol, has joined the Tokenized Asset Coalition (TAC), a group of Web3 and traditional finance leaders aiming to tokenize over $1 trillion in real-world assets (RWAs) on public blockchains. The TAC includes major names such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Circle, Coinbase, Fidelity, and Stellar [1]. Its goals include advancing clearer regulations, improving interoperability, and ensuring strong privacy protections for institutional participants. COTI's contribution to the TAC is centered around its COTI V2, a Layer 2 solution designed to support financial institutions and enterprises in managing tokenized assets with enhanced security, scalability, and compliance. This move positions COTI as a key player in the development of institutional-grade infrastructure for tokenized assets, with a focus on real-world use cases such as real estate and commodities [3]. COTI's background in decentralized payment networks and privacy layers makes it a valuable addition to the coalition, with the potential to lead pilot programs and tools aimed at simplifying asset digitization [4]. COTI's membership places the project at the forefront of this transition, offering opportunities to shape how assets are digitized and managed in a decentralized environment [5]. Regulatory clarity remains a key enabler for the adoption of tokenized assets. Jurisdictions such as Singapore, the UAE, and the EU are actively developing frameworks to support compliant tokenization, creating a favorable environment for projects like COTI to scale. With its emphasis on privacy, compliance, and interoperability, COTI is well-positioned to lead in the next phase of blockchain adoption. As the trillion-dollar vision of tokenized assets moves closer to reality, COTI's role in this ecosystem is likely to have long-term implications for the future of global finance [7].</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto investigator ZachXBT criticized Token2049 for poor sponsor vetting, warning that platinum sponsorships don't equate to legitimacy. Several sponsors he flagged turned out to have shady records. Both later collapsed under fraud investigations, causing billions in investor losses and arrests. Red flags include anonymous teams, low liquidity, overhyped marketing, poor tokenomics and listings only on obscure exchanges. What drives these coins isn't innovation but speculation, influencer buzz and cult-like followings, highlighting how unpredictability fuels their survival. In the unpredictable cryptocurrency market, certain digital assets continue to exist despite facing controversies, significant price drops or lacking substantial underlying value. Though flagged as shady coins, they continue drawing considerable interest from dedicated followers. This sustained engagement is often driven by speculative excitement, strong community support and the allure of rapid profits. He felt the organizers of such events do little due diligence on their sponsors and that a project being a platinum sponsor doesn't increase credibility. This article explores why some coins demonstrate a remarkable persistence despite being sketchy. It discusses five shady coins that continue drawing crypto investors and investigates the reasons for their longevity. It will also explain how newbie traders can protect themselves from such projects. Despite weak fundamentals, many questionable cryptocurrencies persist in the market. While most fail quickly, some survive or briefly thrive due to specific factors. Speculative trading: Sharp price fluctuations attract risk-tolerant traders seeking quick profits. Dedicated communities: Loyal supporters, often driven by memes or nostalgia, keep these projects alive. Low market liquidity: Limited trading activity allows large investors or insiders to influence prices, drawing in speculators. Periodic hype: Social media trends, influencer endorsements or unexpected news can temporarily boost interest in these coins. ZachXBT discussed a few sponsors of TOKEN2049, which persist within the unpredictable crypto market despite opaque operations. Origin: Launched by Gluwa in 2024-2025 and the title sponsor of Token2049, Spacecoin aims to be the world's first decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) powered by satellites. It claims its decentralized satellite network will provide global 5G internet to the 2.9 billion people who currently lack access, to connect the entire world. Controversies: Onchain investigator ZachXBT labeled Spacecoin as “botted” and unreliable, questioning its legitimacy. While botted can be interpreted in many ways, none of the meanings is flattering. For example, in June 2022, it claimed to have undergone several months of refinement and smart contract auditing, without naming a specific audit firm, and no public report was provided. Moreover, there is no verifiable documentation regarding the launch of satellites. What sustains it: Strong promotional efforts, event sponsorships and speculative interest, along with a dedicated community and media attention, keep limited trading activity alive. What sustains it: Speculation around the token and an aggressive marketing drive for trading activity. Controversies: Weex is not regulated by any financial authority with strict standards. Why questionable: There have been social media posts complaining of unusual behavior on the exchange, including frozen accounts and unexpected Know Your Customer (KYC) issues. Origin: Listed as a platinum sponsor at Token2049, DWF is a sketchy market maker, according to ZachXBT, that conducts trades on over 60 exchanges and is engaged in high-profile investments. It has little publicly available information about its background or team. Why questionable: On March 27, 2025, Vite Labs stated its development funds were “rugged” by DWF's market-making services and Binance's decision to delist the project. What sustains it: Recognition from conference sponsorships, promotional narratives and speculative hype around listings keeps minimal trading interest alive. Origin: Founded around 2021, Butunix is a crypto exchange registered in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Controversies: Labeled “sketchy” by ZachXBT probably for drawing the scrutiny of South Korea's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which is part of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), for providing services to Korean customers without the required registration. Why questionable: Limited regulatory oversight and an unclear corporate structure undermine trust. What sustains it: Trading volume is driven by listings of niche altcoins, bonus incentives and speculative traders seeking quick profits. Here are two cases when shady crypto projects became sponsors of prominent events, only to use the credibility they had earned to dupe investors: Authorities arrested several individuals, froze assets and estimated investor losses at over 1 billion Hong Kong dollars. Key promoters, including Steven Lewis and Brenda Chunga, were charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for running a fraudulent pyramid scheme. Some shady coins use bots to create fake trading volume and trick platforms into ranking them higher. For those new to cryptocurrency, identifying suspicious coins early can prevent financial loss and stress. Here are key factors to consider when evaluating a cryptocurrency: Research the team and project history: Look for warning signs such as anonymous founders, frequent rebrands or a lack of reputable partnerships. Evaluate marketing tactics: Be cautious of coins promoted through aggressive marketing, including meme-driven social media, paid influencer endorsements or unrealistic claims like “guaranteed 100x returns.” Assess liquidity: Coins with low trading volume or concentrated ownership are prone to price manipulation by insiders. Examine tokenomics: Watch for red flags like excessively large token supply, unclear token-burning processes or allocations heavily favoring insiders, which may indicate risks of price manipulation or scams. Verify exchange listings: Coins listed only on lesser-known or poorly regulated exchanges may lack transparency. Investigate past issues: Research any history of problems, such as halted withdrawals, scams or regulatory warnings. Use reliable tools and diversify: Avoid relying solely on influencers or trending charts. Shady coins often act as warnings rather than genuine investment opportunities. Despite frequent market crashes or controversies, these coins persist due to the unpredictable, community-driven nature of crypto markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum have all soared over the trailing-three-year period, with the latter two benefiting from public companies establishing digital asset reserves. Strategy holds nearly 2.9% of all Bitcoin that'll ever be mined, while Bitmine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming have begun piling into Ethereum. Despite XRP's abundant near-term catalysts, Ripple's bridge currency lacks the standalone value that would make it desirable for public companies seeking digital asset reserves. Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. With two of Wall Street's three major stock indexes blasting to new highs, investor confidence is soaring in the emotion-driven digital currency space. But there's no mistaking the demand-side boost Bitcoin and Ethereum have enjoyed from the adoption of corporate treasury strategies involving these tokens. Instead of carrying cash or other marketable securities on their balance sheets, some businesses are choosing to use their cash, or issuing stock and/or some form of debt, to purchase digital assets. The concept of the Bitcoin treasury strategy kicked off with Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)(formerly known as MicroStrategy), which began purchasing Bitcoin to hold on its balance sheet in August 2020. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor has been adamant for years that Bitcoin is a superior form of money, especially when compared to the U.S. dollar, which devalues over time as the U.S. money supply increases. The perception of a fixed peak circulating supply is why Bitcoin is typically viewed as a phenomenal inflationary hedge. A number of companies have followed in Strategy's footsteps by adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, many of which are micro- and small-cap businesses that are attempting to drum up hype for their respective companies. Recently, a handful of public companies began shifting their attention to Ethereum. Two notable public companies have dived head-first into the Ethereum treasury strategy: Bitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSEMKT: BMNR) and SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET). Bitmine, whose board is chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, holds 566,776 Ether (ETH), with a goal of gobbling up 5% of the circulating supply. Meanwhile, SharpLink holds 360,807 ETH, worth about $1.36 billion at the time of this writing. Considering XRP's ninefold ascent over the last three years, as well as its numerous near-term catalysts, it would appear there's certainly momentum, on paper, for public companies to add XRP tokens to their balance sheet. But if investors dig below the surface-scratching headlines, they'll discover it's unlikely that XRP will be a sought-after digital asset for corporate America. There's no question that XRP has enjoyed a stellar run-up. President Trump's November victory cleared the way for the eventual resignation of now-former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, who was a constant thorn in the side of digital currencies. Gensler's exit led to the resolution of litigation clouds that had hung over Ripple, whose payment network leans on XRP as its bridge currency for cross-border transactions. North of 300 financial institutions are utilizing RippleNet to facilitate transactions that can validate and settle in three to five seconds. If adoption continues, Ripple's payment network could lead to a demand surge in XRP tokens. While XRP has been firing on all cylinders in recent months due to a confluence of positive factors, it lacks the perceived stand-alone value brough to the table by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Whereas Bitcoin has its limited supply as a catalyst, and Ethereum stands tall as the premier smart contracts blockchain, XRP is simply a bridge currency for Ripple's payment network. What's more, XRP isn't the only bridge available to financial institutions using Ripple's cross-border payment solutions. In select overseas markets, financial institutions aren't using XRP at all to complete transactions. Furthermore, the adoption rate for Ripple's payment platform and XRP remains relatively tame. Though having more than 300 financial institutions using RippleNet globally sounds great on paper, it's a far cry from the 11,000-plus financial institutions relying on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, which has been the standard for cross-border payments spanning decades. Although one publicly traded micro-cap company with a market cap of less than $2 million recently unveiled an up-to-$20 million XRP treasury reserve strategy, investors shouldn't expect XRP to be actively held for any sustained period by nonfinancial (or financial-based) public companies. Before you buy stock in XRP, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and XRP wasn't one of them. Now, it's worth noting Stock Advisor's total average return is 1,039% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500. Don't miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor. Sean Williams has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analysts are watching key technical signals as oversold conditions begin to emerge, prompting speculation about whether a rebound is near—or if further losses lie ahead. Ethereum (ETH) broke below the crucial $3,500 level in early August, wiping out recent gains and shaking investor confidence. The drop, which saw ETH decline over 4.6% in 24 hours, reflects broader crypto market exhaustion and a wave of risk-off sentiment across digital assets. Ethereum (ETH) teeters at key support—buyers face a confidence test as short-term pressure mounts but long-term sentiment stays bullish. Ethereum dropped below $3,500 on August 2 as the market showed signs of fatigue and increased selling pressure. Adding fuel to the bearish fire, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes offloaded over $13 million worth of Ethereum, Pepe (PEPE), and Ethena (ENA) tokens, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence. He also liquidated his entire ENA holdings—over 7.7 million tokens—and transferred 38.86 billion PEPE tokens to Cumberland DRW. On-chain data platform Lookonchain revealed that wallet address “0x3c9E” deposited over 26,000 ETH (valued at $93.6 million) to major exchanges including Binance, OKX, Kraken, and Bybit in the past 48 hours, suggesting more whales are preparing to sell. Despite the heavy selling, some analysts believe Ethereum may be approaching a bottom. Ethereum's Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD are signaling oversold conditions, historically a precursor to short-term reversals. Short-term bearish signals hint at a dip toward strong support levels—ideal entry points expected later this year if the market weakens further. Ethereum appears to be in an oversold condition, which could signal a potential market reversal as key technical indicators point to a shift in momentum. Exchange data further supports the view that many investors are moving ETH off exchanges—possibly into cold storage. Net outflows from centralized platforms on August 1 reached $113 million, a sign that holders might be waiting out the volatility. Michaël van de Poppe, a widely followed crypto analyst, pointed out that continued withdrawals are “putting downward pressure” on both Ethereum and Bitcoin, but also serve as a sign of investor caution rather than panic. According to the analyst @bl_ockchain on X, Ethereum recently tested a key resistance area around $4,000 before pulling back. “$ETH needs a strong move above to flip it into support,” he wrote. Until then, many traders see the current zone as a neutral territory—neither fully bullish nor decisively bearish. Lookonchain also observed that 12 new wallets have purchased 808,347 ETH (around $2.85 billion) since July 9. This includes a single wallet acquiring 16,496 ETH from Galaxy Digital's OTC desk, suggesting confidence in Ethereum's long-term value despite short-term volatility. Despite the current correction, some analysts maintain a bullish long-term view. “This is the roadmap,” he tweeted, adding that Q4 could be Ethereum's breakout season if macro and ETF tailwinds hold. The Ethereum sell-off comes amid a confluence of bearish catalysts: whale exits, technical rejection at $4K, and broader risk aversion. Yet, signs of accumulation, institutional confidence, and oversold conditions suggest the market could soon stabilize. Ethereum daily active addresses hit a one-year high before the recent dip below $3,500. Whether Ethereum holds above its current support near $3,400–$3,500 will be critical in the days ahead. A decisive rebound above $3,800 could reignite bullish sentiment, while further downside might test the $3,200–$3,300 zone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As institutional inflows continue to flood Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), retail and mid-tier investors are increasingly hunting for undervalued tokens that could deliver the next big breakout. These low-cost cryptocurrencies often provide early-stage entry points, where small investments can translate into exponential gains during bullish cycles. At the forefront of this movement is TAPZI, a presale GameFi token designed to redefine Web3 gaming with skill-based earning mechanics and sustainable tokenomics. Unlike luck-driven models, TAPZI focuses on competition, rewarding players for merit while ensuring long-term ecosystem balance. This article reviews five of the best altcoins to buy now under $1 — Tapzi (TAPZI), Cardano (ADA), Hedera (HBAR), and COTI — comparing their growth potential to identify which one could emerge as the true dark horse in 2025. Here is the list of five best altcoins to buy now under $1 and how these tokens can build up a multi-billion-dollar portfolio. These micro-chip coins will help you reap 1000x profits this year. TAPZI is more than just another GameFi project — it's a revolution in Web3 gaming. It brings classic games like Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Rock-Paper-Scissors into the blockchain era, offering fast-paced, stake-based battles with a focus on merit, not chance. 👉 Click Here to Join the $TAPZI Presale Before It's Too Late! Players can participate in kill-to-earn tournaments with peer-to-peer staking rewards, creating a self-sustaining prize pool without treasury subsidies. Its frictionless design allows gameplay across mobile and web without downloads or crypto setup hassles. TAPZI solves three core GameFi challenges: inflated reward systems, luck-based mechanics, and complicated onboarding. Currently priced at $0.0035, the token offers early investors a rare opportunity for exponential growth. Unlike Cardano (ADA), which focuses on slow-and-steady ecosystem growth, or Hedera (HBAR), which caters to enterprises, TAPZI brings fast-paced, skill-driven earning to a massive global 1.5B-strong mobile gaming audience — making it one of the most exciting sub-$1 altcoins to watch in 2025. Built on a foundation of peer‑reviewed research, Cardano focuses on sustainability, scalability, and interoperability, making it a top choice for developers and institutions seeking long‑term reliability. Cardano's smart contract adoption has been steadily increasing, expanding its footprint in DeFi, NFTs, and real‑world applications. Its layered architecture enhances security while maintaining energy efficiency, which has made it a favorite among environmentally conscious investors. Trading at under $1, ADA continues to attract retail buyers looking for stability in a volatile market. While ADA offers stability and institutional credibility, it lacks the explosive upside potential of early‑stage projects. For investors seeking both security and speculative growth, combining ADA's steady foundation with TAPZI's dynamic GameFi model creates a well‑balanced portfolio. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is an enterprise‑grade network designed for high‑speed, low‑cost, and highly scalable applications. Unlike traditional blockchains, its Hashgraph consensus mechanism enables near‑instant finality and significantly reduces transaction costs, making it a go‑to choice for enterprise use cases. HBAR's partnerships with Google, IBM, LG, and other Fortune 500 companies highlight its strong foothold in enterprise adoption. It's being used in tokenization, supply chain optimization, identity solutions, and financial applications, proving its utility beyond speculation. Priced at under $1, HBAR offers an appealing entry for investors seeking exposure to enterprise blockchain solutions with significant growth potential. For investors aiming to diversify, pairing HBAR's corporate‑grade stability with TAPZI's GameFi innovation can balance risk and reward. COTI is a payments‑oriented blockchain leveraging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to deliver fast, scalable, and low‑cost financial transactions. It's built to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems, creating seamless, real‑time payment solutions. COTI has secured enterprise partnerships aimed at building white‑label payment solutions for fintech companies, e‑commerce platforms, and decentralized applications. While COTI fills a niche in fintech, its growth is likely more gradual compared to the explosive, user‑driven potential of TAPZI. BlockDAG (BDAG) blends Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with traditional blockchain infrastructure to deliver a scalable, lightning‑fast network designed for mass adoption. At its current presale price of $0.0016 (with a confirmed launch price of $0.05), BDAG offers early investors a compelling entry point with significant upside potential. Its lower presale entry price makes it particularly appealing to ROI‑driven investors seeking multiples before launch. When comparing these sub-$1 contenders, TAPZI clearly stands out for its early-stage entry point and fast-scaling GameFi model. For risk-tolerant investors, TAPZI emerges as the dark horse, combining early presale growth, innovative tokenomics, and mass-market appeal that could outpace its peers. Sub-$1 altcoins often deliver the most explosive gains during bullish market phases. Their lower price points make them accessible to a broader range of investors while offering significant room for appreciation as adoption grows. What sets these altcoins apart are their robust tokenomics, real-world use cases, and early-stage opportunities. For instance, presale projects like TAPZI not only provide bonus allocations and low entry costs, but also integrate audited smart contracts and anti-dump mechanisms to protect investors. For any forward-thinking investor, a balanced approach is key, blending high-growth presale opportunities with long-term network plays. Among them, TAPZI shines brightest with its GameFi-first model, skill-to-earn economy, and low-barrier presale entry at just $0.0035. This positions it for exponential growth as the Web3 gaming sector accelerates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy (MSTR), the bitcoin-focused corporate entity formerly known as MicroStrategy, launched its Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC) late last month — an offering Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has described as the company's “iPhone moment.” The STRC preferred stock has already raised $2.5 billion, and a newly opened $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) program could extend its scale even further — offering high-yield dividends backed by bitcoin and designed to appeal to yield-seeking investors. STRC (marketed as “Stretch”) is a variable-rate, perpetual preferred stock designed to deliver stable pricing, strong yield, and easy access for income-focused investors seeking indirect bitcoin exposure. Importantly, if any month's payment is missed, a dividend “stopper” activates — preventing payouts to junior securities until STRC is made whole. The stock can be redeemed at the issuer's option once listed on Nasdaq (which it now is), and it includes a fundamental change put right at liquidation value plus any accrued dividends. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including further bitcoin purchases and working capital. Saylor described STRC as a clean, scalable instrument that solves the constraints of previous capital tools like convertible bonds and complex long-duration preferred shares. On July 31, Strategy announced a new sales agreement allowing the company to issue up to $4.2 billion worth of STRC shares through an at-the-market (ATM) offering. This gives Strategy the ability to tap liquidity gradually, adjusting issuance based on market conditions and pricing. Internal guidance suggests that Strategy intends to keep issuance within a narrow band — avoiding sales below $99 or above $101 (before fees), consistent with its target of maintaining a stable $100 trading price. The firm explicitly stated it does not plan to apply this discipline to its other preferred equity programs, reinforcing STRC's unique positioning. The ATM program allows Strategy to meet capital needs flexibly, support its dividend policy, and scale BTC acquisitions further while preserving shareholder alignment. During Strategy's Q2 2025 earnings call on July 31, he called the product his firm's “iPhone moment,” comparing its potential to the kind of consumer breakthrough that redefined an entire industry. At the heart of Saylor's vision is STRC's accessibility. Unlike Strategy's earlier instruments — such as STRK, STRF, and STRD — which he praised as innovative but too complex or volatile for mass adoption, STRC is designed to function more like a yield-enhanced savings account. “If I walk down the street and you ask a hundred people, ‘Do you want a high-yield bank account?' He believes STRC solves two core problems: it strips away long-term volatility by targeting short duration and low price fluctuation, and it offers a consistent premium over typical bank yields. “We've stripped down to a one-month duration and it pays 500 basis points above your bank account,” he said, describing the instrument's 9% variable monthly dividend. Importantly, STRC is engineered to trade near par ($100), giving investors peace of mind — especially those sensitive to price swings. Saylor emphasized that previous products lost retail traction when their principal value fluctuated by 5–10%. “If Stretch actually hits its par and it trades with low volatility, then you could, in theory, sell a hundred billion dollars of it, two hundred billion dollars of it,” he told analysts. That, he argued, would enable Strategy to massively scale its bitcoin holdings without selling any BTC — effectively using its treasury as collateral to monetize liquidity at retail scale. In Saylor's view, this combination — simplicity, stability, and yield — is what makes STRC transformational. Just as the iPhone reimagined how users interacted with mobile computing, STRC could redefine how companies tap capital markets in a bitcoin-native way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Right now, the crypto market is seeing a bearish trend, with key players like Bitcoin and Ethereum facing price drops. Yet, market sentiment holds a bullish edge, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index showing “Greed” earlier this week with BTC reaching a high $119k, hinting at investor optimism. Yesterday, $1,29 billion in liquidations was not all that bad. It could be just institutions shaking off weak hands, always happening. Just how institutions with big money play, taking advantage of the situation. Despite the dip, it is still recording positive developments. The Pectra upgrade has boosted scalability and cut transaction costs, which will definitely help with adoption. Institutional interest in Ethereum is also surging and not stoping. Spot ETH ETFs recorded strong inflows, including $18.27 million into BlackRock's ETHA end of July alone. It's not a secret that institutional backing fuels crypto pump. It's not just BTC and ETH; the general crypto adoption rate is still going at a rapid pace. Despite the storm, crypto always comes up stronger as it matures. Ethereum, still shy of its ATH, and today, could be a strategic moment to invest before prices soar to new highs. Now, staying informed and keep an eye on the best crypto to buy could be the way to make big bank. Bitcoin reached a record monthly close of $115,644, up 7.5%, while Ethereum soared by 49.5%. So don't be a bear as bulls won last month. Tom Lee stated that institutional investors, particularly from Wall Street, are discreetly increasing their crypto holdings. He views today as a bullish time for crypto. Lee is being optimistic, and he might be right. His Optimism contrasts with short-term bearish sentiments driven by factors like macroeconomic uncertainties or sell-offs. As chairman of BitMine (a company transitioning from Bitcoin mining to an Ethereum treasury strategy), Lee is actively shaping corporate crypto adoption. This could be what crypto traders are experiencing. But stay strong, because the storm might come to an end soon. Imagine turning a boring $100 into a full-blown financial retirement with crypto, long before 60, while the rest of the world clocks in at 9 am. Greed is still flashing, and has not reached its full scale yet. 10+ Years Established in 2013, 99Bitcoin's team members have been crypto experts since Bitcoin's Early days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to reports, both countries also intend to depend on bilateral cooperation in aspects like blockchain technology and digital finance. The collaboration was agreed at a high-level virtual meeting between Bilal Bin Saqib, the Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain in Pakistan, and Farkhat Aminov, Director of Kyrgyzstan's National Investment Agency. During the meeting, both sides held detailed discussions on digital finance, regulatory frameworks, and blockchain innovation. They also discussed the importance of sharing knowledge, expertise, and best practices to foster the growth of their digital economies. According to local reports, Bilal Bin Saqib commended Kyrgyzstan's leadership in digital assets innovation during the meeting, expressing Pakistan's interest in developing a joint regulatory structure with them. He also noted that Pakistan is interested in advancing technology with Kyrgyzstan as its partners, proposing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a formal partnership in the crypto space. Meanwhile, both countries have reiterated their commitment to building a secure, transparent, and digital economy that is ready for the future, noting that the collaboration could enhance blockchain and digital finance integration across Central and South Asia. This latest development comes after the Press Information Department of Pakistan announced that both countries had signed several protocols and MoUs to deepen economic and technical cooperation, taking the bilateral trade volume to $100 million. The development comes at a time when Pakistan is trying to leverage its strategic geopolitical position to engage in its role as an important trader and transit hub in the face of economic downturn. “Discussions also focused on enhancing regional connectivity through logistics and transportation. Both sides agreed to deepen cooperation in postal services, cargo and rail transport, and civil aviation,” the PID said. “Both countries underscored the importance of strengthening financial cooperation. The central banks of both countries agreed to collaborate on the development of Islamic banking and financial instruments, including training programs through Pakistan's National Institute of Banking and Finance.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin Swift has made headlines as its ICO gains continue to eclipse what Avalanche, DOGE, and Shiba Inu achieved at comparable points in their early runs. Its unique blend of adaptive rewards, AI governance, and hybrid consensus is drawing in investors seeking more than meme-fueled speculation. Yet none of these projects integrated a protocol where rewards are dynamic, contracts are intelligent, and governance is reputation-weighted from day one. Bitcoin Swift builds on these gaps with a forward-facing approach to blockchain utility. Bitcoin Swift is not positioning itself as just another decentralized chain. Instead, it is marketed as a financial operating system, blending adaptive Proof-of-Yield, AI-powered smart contracts, decentralized identity protection, and hybrid Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms. This architecture is built for scalability, compliance, and long-term decentralization. At its core, Bitcoin Swift's Proof-of-Yield system does what static models cannot. It adjusts block rewards in real time based on network activity, environmental factors, and governance votes. The result is a living ecosystem where incentives evolve alongside user participation. This level of responsiveness is rare in crypto and stands out to those who have grown tired of fixed systems that fail to adapt. Smart contracts hosted on a WASM-compatible engine embed AI agents capable of learning from network patterns and adjusting behavior accordingly. Federated AI oracles supply trusted data streams, strengthening the foundation for decentralized applications. Bitcoin Swift's layered consensus delivers security and adaptability in equal measure. This combination allows Bitcoin Swift to maintain integrity while scaling for future adoption. Bitcoin Swift embeds AI directly into its smart contracts for enhanced functionality. These privacy protections apply equally to transactions and governance, ensuring users retain control over their data. Bitcoin Swift's contributors have successfully completed KYC verification to enhance transparency. Bitcoin Swift has opened its presale with Stage 3 offering BTC3 at just $3. The next stage will increase to $4, with a confirmed launch price set at $15. Every participant at this stage secures access to Bitcoin Swift's on-chain governance and programmable rewards through its Proof-of-Yield system. With such rapid movement between stages and substantial upside potential, Bitcoin Swift is quickly positioning itself as the opportunity that early crypto adopters are looking for. Bitcoin Swift has structured its tokenomics to promote long-term sustainability. This allocation ensures a balanced focus on network incentives, liquidity stability, and project development. Governance is reinforced with AI risk evaluation for all proposals. Decisions are made through quadratic voting weighted by decentralized identity reputation. An emergency council can veto malicious actions, safeguarding network health without sacrificing decentralization. Bitcoin Swift is gaining recognition for reasons beyond price charts. Its hybrid consensus, AI-enhanced smart contracts, and adaptive incentives provide a foundation built for future financial ecosystems. For those seeking opportunities beyond speculative tokens, Bitcoin Swift offers a model of blockchain utility that rewards participation while preserving privacy and decentralization.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bengaluru Police have arrested a 30-year-old software engineer in connection with the theft of approximately Rs 384 crore ($44 million) in cryptocurrency from CoinDCX. The accused, Rahul Agarwal, a permanent employee of CoinDCX, which is a crypto exchange platform, was arrested on July 26 by the Whitefield CEN crime police. Following the discovery, police seized Agarwal's laptop and took him in for interrogation. Agarwal, who is a resident of Carmelaram and originally from Haridwar, Uttarakhand, has denied any involvement in the theft. Investigators further uncovered a suspicious deposit of Rs 15 lakh into Agarwal's bank account from an unknown source. He suggested that one of these files might have been a malicious trap set by the hacker to infiltrate his work system. CoinDCX has confirmed its full cooperation with law enforcement agencies and cybercrime experts as the investigation into this significant cryptocurrency heist continues. Despite major advancements in blockchain technology and cybersecurity measures, large-scale thefts remain a recurring threat. The decentralised and often anonymous nature of digital assets makes them attractive targets for sophisticated cybercriminals, who are constantly in the lookout for vulnerabilities in crypto exchange platforms, hot wallets, and even individual employee systems. India's stance on cryptocurrency has been evolving, with ongoing discussions around clearer regulatory frameworks to govern digital assets. Security incidents like the CoinDCX theft case often require calls for stricter oversight, enhanced consumer protection mechanisms, and mandatory cybersecurity standards for all operational exchanges.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency, why are altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX), and BlockDAG (BDAG) becoming increasingly recognized as more than just speculative investments? The world of altcoins is shifting, and it's doing so rapidly. BNB, ADA, TRX, and BDAG are at the forefront of this transformation, each driven by their own unique factors that entice investors and institutional players alike. Once a simple utility token for trading fee discounts on Binance, it has morphed into a strategic asset that institutional investors are now beginning to embrace. The recent news of several publicly traded companies investing over $500 million in BNB has caught everyone's attention. If analysts' projections are to be believed, we could see BNB reaching or surpassing $1,000 by year-end, largely fueled by corporate treasury strategies that incorporate this altcoin. Despite facing price fluctuations of its own, ADA's recent whale movements have sparked a renewed interest. The fact that it's compatible with mainstream payment systems, including Apple Pay, is a significant plus. This opens doors to broader user adoption and positions ADA as a long-term player in the market. With the Nasdaq listing of Tron Inc. and its treasury holdings, this altcoin is strategically positioning itself to merge blockchain technology with established financial systems seamlessly. Companies are now diversifying their treasury strategies, viewing altcoins as strategic financial assets rather than mere speculative tools. This trend is gaining momentum, especially with companies like Windtree Therapeutics and their recent integration of BNB into treasury management. This shift isn't just an opportunity; it's a necessity. By treating altcoins as strategic assets, companies can create hedges against inflation, unlock new funding avenues, and grow their long-term value. Furthermore, this growing institutional involvement is cultivating a more disciplined investment approach. Investors are now leaning towards tokens that possess clear utility, community backing, and regulatory compliance, steering away from the unrefined speculation that characterized older market cycles. Regulatory compliance is another critical factor playing a role in the adoption of altcoins. This clarity enhances the credibility of SMEs, fostering greater market access. Navigating these regulations can be resource-intensive for SMEs, demanding specialized tools and ongoing training. Still, SMEs that can effectively manage compliance can transform these obligations into competitive advantages, turning potential hurdles into opportunities for both growth and innovation. TRX offers faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions compared to traditional systems, especially in the Asian fintech sector. This blockchain enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, which significantly reduces fees while improving processing times for cross-border payments. Moreover, regulated crypto-assets like TRX are increasingly perceived as complements to traditional finance rather than outright replacements. This perspective allows for a more inclusive financial ecosystem where decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies enhance financial inclusion and support micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The future of altcoins appears bright, positioned to evolve from speculative investments into strategic assets. Growing institutional interest and regulatory advancements will likely drive further adoption of these digital currencies into mainstream finance. As the market matures, investors are expected to prioritize fundamentals, token utility, and on-chain profit-sharing mechanisms.
