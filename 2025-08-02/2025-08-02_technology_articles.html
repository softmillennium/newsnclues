This means that roughly four in ten Steam PC gamers now run AMD CPUs. While this marks a new high for Team Red in the Steam user base, it also underscores the company's slow and steady gains. To provide some context, Intel dominated the Steam gaming market with roughly 77% of gamers five years ago, but has since fallen below 60%. AMD's rise can be attributed mainly to the popularity of its 3D V-Cache CPUs, including the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which have been well-received by gamers and enthusiasts. The demand for high-performance CPUs, especially X3D models, and competitive pricing seem to be chipping away at Intel's former advantage. This shift also means that AMD now commands a larger share of the PC gaming CPU market than it did previously. Overall, Nvidia's share of all discrete GPUs in Steam remains extremely high at 73.94%. By contrast, AMD's latest Radeon 9000-series GPUs based on the RDNA 4 architecture are yet to make an appearance on the Steam chart. This absence is likely due to constrained supply or slow adoption, as insiders note that AMD may not have enough new cards in gamers' hands yet to register in the stats. AMD's strong new desktop GPUs, including the flagship RX 9070 XT, are popular in retail, but their impact isn't yet visible in Steam's latest numbers. On the software side, the OS landscape continues to shift towards Windows 11, likely due to Windows 10's looming EOL, with Linux gaming at its highest steady level in years. The data show that approximately 59.9% of Steam gamers are using Windows 11 (64-bit), a 0.06% increase compared to June, while Windows 10 (64-bit) has slipped to 35.19%, down 0.50%. Meanwhile, macOS usage remains under 2%, while Linux holds a substantial gain of 0.32% bringing the overall market share to 2.89%. For system RAM, 16GB remains the most common configuration, used in approximately 42% of all PCs. Graphics VRAM, or video memory, shows similar trends, as most surveyed gamers still have 8GB of VRAM, which accounts for about 33.66% of all systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Friday was Spider-Man Day (maybe), and to mark the occasion, Sony teased the hero's new suit for his next movie, Brand New Day. Now, Tom Holland's gone and shown the full thing. On his Instagram, the actor released a video this morning of him walking into a room, stepping into the light to display the new costume in its full glory as a new version of Michael Giacchinno's Spider-Man theme plays. (It might even be bigger than the one on his Final Swing suit glimpsed at the end of No Way Home.) Compared to Tobey Maguire's suit and Andrew Garfield's second Amazing threads, it looks in between those in terms of size and length. (However, the MCU's last few Phases have been big on bringing back its surviving villains.) Ruffalo and Mando are the latest additions to the cast, which includes Jon Bernthal as the Punisher and Sadie Sink and Liza Colón-Zayas in mysterious roles. It's still unclear how much we'll get of Zendaya and Jacob Batalon as MJ and Ned, who lost their memories of their lives with Peter at the end of No Way Home. Directed by Daniel Destin Cretton, Spider-Man: Brand New Day swings into theaters on July 31, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Einhaus Group was once a familiar name, with its services available through 5,000 retail outlets in Germany and an annual revenue of around 70 million Euros. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A leading mobile device insurance and service network has initiated insolvency proceedings in the wake of a cyberattack. Germany's Einhaus Group was targeted by hackers in March 2023 and is understood to have paid a ransom(ware) fee of around $230,000 at the time, according to Wa.de and Golem.de (machine translations). However, the once large and successful company, with partnerships including Cyberport, 1&1, and Deutsche Telekom, struggled to recover from the service interruption and the obvious financial strains, which now appear to be fatal. They had encrypted all of Einhaus Group's systems, which were essential for the day-to-day running of the business. Of course, with operational systems down, there was an immediate impact on Einhaus. According to the sources, it once had a workforce of 170 people. How it did this, when it also had to process its usual business administration and claims workloads 'by hand,' is hard to fathom. The afflicted firm also sold its headquarters building in mid-2024 and liquidated various capital investments in an attempt to overcome its rough patch. Einhaus thought it saw light at the end of its dismal tunnel after it found out that three hacker suspects had been apprehended by German law enforcement.

In addition to any satisfaction that the likely ‘Royal' perpetrators would face justice, the public prosecutor's office seized “crypto assets in the high six-figure euro range,” according to news sources in Germany. This wasn't the medicine that Einhaus Group needed, though. Other ransomware victims continue to wait for refunds, too, we understand from the sources. Einhaus Group has been attempting to sue for the return of its funds, but the authorities have rejected its pleas. Now, three companies associated with the group have formally entered insolvency proceedings. Last but not least, Wilhelm Einhaus (72) insists that he will not retire if the worst happens, according to a report by Wa.de. Last week, we reported on a venerable 158-year-old UK-based transportation company collapsing in the wake of a ransomware attack. Northamptonshire-based Knights of Old (KNP) trucks are now off the road, and 700 people have lost their jobs, mainly due to a money-grasping cyberattack, named ‘Akira' in a BBC report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is probably why the Deck and Linux gaming are not supported When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Discovered by Battlefield Wire on X, Battlefield 6's kernel-level Javelin anti-cheat system takes into account Secure Boot functionality and will prevent players from playing the game if the feature is turned off or not supported. At least the game will be easy to run on Windows PCs. This requirement is not that serious for Windows users; however, it is very likely that Battlefield 6's Secure Boot requirement, in addition to Javel's kernel-level snooping, will prevent the game from working on Linux emulators such as Proton, killing Linux gaming support and Steam Deck support from the very start. (Even if it did, there's still little chance Javelin would work in Linux.) This is confirmed by EA's Executive VP Vince Zampella, who told PCGamersN that Battlefield 6 does not work on the Steam Deck. Cheating and anti-cheats have long been problematic on Linux, which does not always support the same secure anti-cheat systems as Windows does. Easy Anti-Cheat, for instance, has Windows and Linux versions of its anti-cheat system, but its Linux variant is less secure than the Windows counterpart, lacking a kernel-level requirement altogether. Since its launch, EA has allegedly blocked over 33 million cheat attempts across 2.2 billion PCs with Javelin. When Javelin was first introduced into Battlefield 2042 last fall, EA allegedly saw match infection rates get cut in half; furthermore, Javelin allegedly has a 99% accurate rate when banning cheaters. This issue will only become more problematic for Linux gamers moving forward. Valorant was one of the first games to incorporate a kernel-level anti-cheat system, which also enforced Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 requirements. But now, we're seeing more publishers embrace these highly restrictive anti-cheat techniques to improve the gaming experience for their players.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Echoing the slogan that exemplified his energy policies during the campaign, he made his message clear: more oil and gas, lower prices, greater exports. Six months into Trump's second term, his administration has little to show on that score. Output is ticking up, but slower than it did under the Biden administration. Pump prices for gasoline have bobbed around where they were in inauguration week. That's because the price of oil, the world's most-traded commodity, is more responsive to global demand and supply dynamics than to domestic policy and posturing. Within the US, a boom in energy demand driven by rapid electrification and AI-serving data centers is boosting power costs for homes and businesses, yet fossil fuel producers are not rushing to ramp up drilling. There is one key indicator of drilling levels that the industry has watched closely for more than 80 years: a weekly census of active oil and gas rigs published by Baker Hughes. When Trump came into office on Janunary 20, the US rig count was 580. That's before you account for the fallout of elevated tariffs on steel and other imports for the many companies that get their pipes and drilling equipment from overseas, said Robert Rapier, editor-in-chief of Shale Magazine, who has two decades of experience as a chemical engineer. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas' quarterly survey of over 130 oil and gas producers based in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico, conducted in June, suggests the industry's outlook is pessimistic. Nearly half of the 38 firms that responded to this question saw their firms drilling fewer wells this year than they had earlier expected. One executive from an exploration and production (E&P) company said, “It's hard to imagine how much worse policies and DC rhetoric could have been for US E&P companies.” Another executive said, “The Liberation Day chaos and tariff antics have harmed the domestic energy industry. Roughly one in three survey respondents chalked up the expectations for fewer wells to higher tariffs on steel imports. “And the bottom line is their profits are going to suffer.” Earlier this month, ExxonMobil estimated that its profit in the April–June quarter will be roughly $1.5 billion lower than in the previous three months because of weaker oil and gas prices. But there's also a lot of caution about wanting to make sure that if there's regulatory reforms, they're going to stick,” said Kevin Book, managing director of research at ClearView Energy Partners, which produces analyses for energy companies and investors. The recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains provisions requiring four onshore and two offshore lease sales every year, lowering the minimum royalty rate to 12.5 percent from 16.67 percent and bringing back speculative leasing—when lands that don't invite enough bids are leased for less money—that was stopped in 2022. “Pro-energy policies play a critical role in strengthening domestic production,” said a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, the top US oil and gas industry group. Meanwhile, she said, drilling on public lands can pollute the air, raise noise levels, cause spills or leaks, and restrict movement for both people and wildlife. Earlier this year, Congress killed an EPA rule finalized in November that would have charged oil and gas companies for flaring excess methane from their operations. “Folks in the Trump camp have long said that the Biden administration was killing drilling by enforcing these regulations on speculative leasing and reining in methane pollution,” said Rowland-Shea. In fact, the top three fossil fuel producers collectively earned less during Trump's first term than they did in either of President Barack Obama's terms or under President Joe Biden. “It's an irony that when Democrats are in there and they're putting in policies to shift away from oil and gas, which causes the price to go up, that is more profitable for the oil and gas industry,” said Rapier. Even though six months may be a significant amount of time in political accounting, investment decisions in the energy sector are made over longer horizons, ClearView's Book said. As long as the planned lease sales take place, oil companies can snap up and sit on public lands until they see more favorable conditions for drilling. “It's an irony that when Democrats are in there and they're putting in policies to shift away from oil and gas, which causes the price to go up, that is more profitable for the oil and gas industry.” “With the kneecapping of wind and solar, that's going to put a lot more pressure on fossil fuels to fill that gap,” Rowland-Shea said. However, the economics of solar and wind are increasingly too attractive to ignore. With electricity demand exceeding expectations, Book said, “any president looking ahead at end-user prices and power supply might revisit or take a flexible position if they find themselves facing shortage.” In your inbox: Five new newsletters by deeply sourced experts WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

AnduinOS is a custom Ubuntu-based Linux distro with one goal: to smoothly transition Windows users to Linux. It achieves this by mimicking the workflows and look of Windows 11. I've recently been examining various Linux distributions that aim to provide a soft landing for those escaping Windows 11, but none have been so bold as to claim that as their sole intention. Ideally, AnduinOS is meant for developers moving from Windows to Linux, but the firm Ubuntu foundation makes it also viable for general consumers. AnduinOS is the creation of Anduin Xue, a software engineer at Microsoft. Yes, the same Microsoft that makes Windows 11. Xue's work on AnduinOS is completed in their spare time, and runs as a non-profit project funded by donations. AnduinOS is relatively new to the scene, and I thought it would be interesting to take it for a test drive on my trusty Lenovo X390, equipped with an Intel Core i5-8265U and 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM. This is the exact same machine that I used to test three other Linux distros which offered an escape route from Windows. The version I tested, v1.3, is based on Ubuntu 25.04 and will receive updates until January 2026. I'm going to use the exact same criteria as my alternative Linux for Windows users live blog. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The ease of installation category refers to how easily I can write the ISO image to a USB flash drive. Most of the time it is pretty easy, but sometimes a Linux distro will take issue and refuse to write. So no terminals, hacks, tricks, or tweaks. Everything has to be achieved using the provided GUI applications. The installation process for AnduinOS is similar to that of Linux Mint or ZorinOS. I encountered one issue during the installation, and it seems to be just bad luck that I ran into it. The issue was that a remote server was not responding, and an optional part of the installation process failed to happen. I tried again the next day, and all was well. If I were to change a few icons, you could fool someone into thinking this is Windows 11, albeit only briefly. Feel free to tell me that I am wrong in the comments. To press the point, it really does look like Windows 11, to the extent that I could put this in front of my parents / partner and they would happily use it. But looks are only part of AnduinOS; remember that AnduinOS also claims to mirror the workflows found in Windows. I am pleased to say that everything just worked: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, webcam, and sound. I threw a few more things at AnduinOS. My Lenovo USB-C dongle with Ethernet, SD card reader, USB 3.0, and HDMI. Digging around, I found an obscure LogiLink USB-to-Ethernet adapter that also worked. In the wild, there will be some edge cases where a device will not work, but these are becoming increasingly rare to see. AnduinOS is very easy to use, and I reiterate, it feels just like Windows 11, but there are a few differences. The first is that there are no annoying notifications/adverts. It is very different from the C:\ setup of Windows (and MS-DOS). That said, most of the time you will be in your home directory, rather than the underlying operating system. I've got a full guide to the Linux Filesystem, which covers what the many different directories are there for. The most important thing to remember is that the user's home directory is where all of your work, downloads, music, videos, etc, are stored. That may sound weird, but a performant machine feels easier to use. I've used older machines with newer Linux distros and Windows; sometimes, they can crawl along, and leave you hanging. My Lenovo X390 has only 8GB of RAM and an Intel i5 8265U CPU. Windows 11 will run on my X390, and yes, it just makes the grade for continued Windows 11 support, but it can be excruciatingly slow to use, forcing me to debloat Windows 11 so that I can get work done. Hence, the last five years have seen me use some version of Ubuntu residing on the 1TB NVMe SSD. Being based on Ubuntu means that we have access to a plethora of applications from the official repositories, Snaps and Flatpaks (containerized applications that run in their own sandbox). Using the Software tool, I was able to update all of the installed software and install key applications for my workflow, chiefly Google Chrome, GIMP, Slack, and Inkscape. So they do not interact with the OS, unless I were to alter their permissions.That said, I was able to change the software sources for two other applications, Endeavour and Evince, so that they favored the AnduinOS sources, which are essentially Ubuntu. It has been just a week since I started using ZorinOS, another Linux distribution that aims to help those transitioning from Windows to Linux. I really like ZorinOS, and it has found a home in my spare laptop, but could AnduinOS claim its spot after a week?For me personally, no. ZorinOS feels more performant on the same laptop, and it works in a similar fashion to AnduinOS. Sure, AnduinOS looks more “Windows 11”, but that can be a good and bad thing. It works, and there is no confusion for those of us moving from Windows. We can get the apps that we know and love (ok, maybe not all the apps) and get to work without being nagged by Windows to read another advert.Give AnduinOS a try if your computer is no longer supported by Microsoft; heck, give it a try anyway. It runs much quicker than Windows 11 did on my six-year-old laptop. Les Pounder is an associate editor at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The findings point to an underrecognized source of seismic hazard in northwestern Canada. These new findings, published July 15 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, challenge that theory. Using high-resolution topographic data, a team of researchers identified an 81-mile-long (130-kilometer-long) segment of the Tintina that produced multiple large earthquakes far more recently. When it ultimately ruptures, the quake could be powerful—potentially exceeding magnitude 7.5. Such a quake would threaten small Yukon communities situated near the Tintina, particularly Dawson City, home to over 1,500 people. Over the last 20 years, there have been a few small earthquakes of magnitude 3 to 4 along the Tintina, but no large ruptures, according to Finley. He and his colleagues set out to determine whether this fault is capable of producing larger quakes. “In the last couple of years, there's been a much more widespread availability of high-resolution topographic data,” Finley told Gizmodo. His team used data collected from satellites, airplanes, and drones to scan the area near the Tintina for fault scarps. These features form when earthquakes rupture Earth's surface, serving as evidence of past quakes. To determine the timing of the earthquakes that created them, they observed landforms left by glacial incursions that occurred 12,000, 132,000, and 2.6 million years ago. This revealed that the fault has produced multiple large earthquakes over the last 2.6 million years, likely slipping several meters each time. Over these millennia, the Tintina has been accumulating strain at a rate of about 0.2 to 0.8 millimeters per year, according to the study. Based on this, Finley and his colleagues estimate that roughly 20 feet (6 meters) of total slip deficit have built up. However, that does not mean this region is in immediate danger. “It's impossible to say, from our current understanding, whether one is imminent or thousands of years away.” The nation's National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM)—which informs seismic building codes and other engineering safety standards—does not currently recognize the Tintina as a discrete seismogenic fault source, according to a UVic release. Finley's findings will eventually be integrated into the NSHM and shared with local governments and emergency managers to improve earthquake preparedness. “What our information does is refine the location of where some of the largest hazards would be in this seismic hazard model,” he said.

This new company hasn't released a drone yet, but it's coming soon and will likely have a slightly different take from current market leaders like DJI. Antigravity's drone is expected to feature 360 cameras with 8K resolution. Antigravity's new drone should arrive later this month. Ironically, as Insta360 encroaches on DJI's drone supremacy, DJI is wading into the world of 360 cameras with its first-ever Osmo 360. The Osmo employs a square 1-inch HDR sensor, can connect directly to DJI's wireless microphones using OsmoAudio, and maintains the Osmo Magnetic Quick-Release system for quick mounting. More interestingly, DJI claims the Osmo 360 can shoot 8K video at 30 fps for 100 minutes, which is a full 20 minutes longer than the Insta360 X5. You can shoot with just a single lens at 4K 120 fps, and you can switch between the front and rear lens without pressing pause. Like DJI's Mavic 4 Pro drone, those in the US can still preorder it from retailers like B&H and Adorama. Here's more you may have missed this week: The first wave of Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems was seriously expensive, but they've been getting steadily more affordable. Netgear's latest release is the Orbi 370 Series, an entry-level, dual-band Wi-Fi 7 mesh. While you only get the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands, not the 6-GHz band, you do get some of the other advantages of Wi-Fi 7, including enhanced security, lower latency, and multi-link operation (MLO), enabling you to connect on both bands simultaneously. This system is suitable for folks with limited devices and internet connections up to 1 Gbps. I'm a big fan of the next system up, the Netgear Orbi 770 Series, and that's what I recommend for families. Like with every other Orbi system, you can subscribe to Netgear Armor ($100/year) for enhanced security and add VPN and ad-blocking for an extra $50 and Smart Parental Controls ($70/year), but you don't need to. You can pick up an Orbi 370 Series 3-pack for $350, a 2-pack is $250, and you can add extra nodes later for $150 each. It's been a week since Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold7 and Galaxy Z Flip7 hit the market, and the company has shared some interesting sales figures. Both devices also saw more than a 25 percent increase in preorders over the Galaxy Z Fold6 series, and carrier stores in the US claim a nearly 60 percent jump for both phones over the 2024 models. It's not just preorders either—Samsung says momentum for both Fold and Flip orders are outpacing the prior generation by 25 percent. Interestingly, Samsung says while black is the typical color of choice for its Fold consumers, this time around, its new Blue Shadow color ate up nearly half of all preorders. While the market is still small, especially in the US, where there are fewer players, Google is expected to debut its third-gen folding phone at an event in August, and Apple is rumored to be launching a folding iPhone in September 2026. Google will be unwrapping its shiny new Pixel hardware at an event in Brooklyn, New York City, on August 20. But many of the details have already been spoiled. The latest leak this week comes from Android Headlines, and there's good news: Prices appear to be the same as last year's Pixel 9 series. There's also potentially confirmation via a leaked image that the Pixel 10 series will feature magnets built into the phone itself, enabling Qi2 wireless charging. The standard has been a bit of a mess, though, as Android phone companies have been slow to adopt Qi2. Samsung's 2025 flagships, for example, are Qi2 Ready, which means there are no magnets baked into the phones, but they can hit Qi2 charging speeds if you use a Qi2 Ready case with magnets. Noted leaker evleaks released several spec details about the phones along with an image of a Pixel 10 and a wireless charging puck attached to it, much like Apple's MagSafe wireless charger. Considering there doesn't seem to be a case on the Pixel 10 in the render, this suggests that magnets are built in. (HMD's Skyline was technically the first Qi2 Android phone.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most conversations around AGI jump straight to cognition, agency, or alignment.

It's a question of why an AI would choose to stay whole.Would love to hear how others in this space—philosophers, engineers, builders—think about this.

What I'm really trying to get at is this:If an AGI is able to self-edit, evolve, and reshape its own objectives—what (if anything) keeps it aligned over time?Is alignment something we can enforce once and for all, or does it require a deeper, internalized structure—something that favors coherence even under freedom?Because if there's no functional or structural reason to stay aligned, then is AGI inherently resistant to alignment, no matter what we do?
