Kimi Antonelli has claimed he is "getting the confidence back" with his Mercedes car after a positive Friday for the team ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend. The Italian rookie has endured a difficult spell recently in his maiden Formula 1 campaign, which has included just one points finish in the last seven races and he failed to make it beyond the first segment of Qualifying for both the Sprint and Grand Prix last time out in Belgium. Mercedes has reverted to an older specification of suspension for the race in Budapest, with the change seemingly producing an upturn in form for Antonelli as he claimed seventh ahead of team mate George Russell in FP1, before finishing 10th fastest later in the afternoon. "Still missing a little bit to the guys in front but I think we're working well, we've been changing the car a lot because obviously it felt like a big step with the old suspension. Long run was good in FP2, just the soft I had a bit of traffic last sector and the lap was not super clean but good feelings ahead of tomorrow." "It always feels good when you're a bit higher up the leaderboard," said the 27-year-old, who has taken one win this season in Canada. "Bit of a strange day, obviously the Aston Martins looked unusually fast today, they seemed to make a decent step forward. McLaren are obviously in a league of their own. "We just need to find that last little bit for it to start clicking again for us.</p>

Roman Stanek beat his Invicta Racing team mate Leonardo Fornaroli to take a maiden Formula 2 pole position at a dramatic Qualifying session in Budapest. Stanek's final attempt of a 1:28.779 put him on provisional pole, but with Fornaroli having made the decision to run later than the rest, his team mate was forced to watch on from the pit lane. The Championship leader matched Stanek through the first two sectors, but lost a tenth in the final section to finish in second place, 0.146s off pole. DAMS Lucas Oil driver Jak Crawford was third, ahead of Hitech TGR's Luke Browning, as AIX Racing's Joshua Duerksen rounded out the top five. Oliver Goethe qualified in sixth place for MP Motorsport, ahead of ART Grand Prix driver Victor Martins, and his fellow Red Bull Junior Arvid Lindblad for Campos Racing. Rodin Motorsport's Alexander Dunne wound up in P9 ahead of the second Campos car of Josep María Martí in P10. This means Martí is set to line up on reverse grid pole for Saturday's Sprint Race, which is set to get underway at 15:55 local time.

'Today is a day where I don't understand anything' - Leclerc baffled by Pole Position

Piastri 'dumbfounded at what happened in Q3' as Leclerc pips McLarens for pole in Budapest

Aston Martin reserve driver Felipe Drugovich will take Fernando Alonso's place for the opening session at the Hungaroring.

Aston Martin have announced that Fernando Alonso is to sit out Friday's opening practice session for the Hungarian Grand Prix due to a muscular injury in his back.

Alonso was present at the Hungaroring for Thursday's media duties and pre-event preparations, some 22 years on from his maiden F1 victory around the Budapest venue.

However, with the first on-track session approaching, a statement from Aston Martin confirmed the Spaniard would play no part in FP1 due to a lingering injury.

Aston Martin's test and reserve driver, former F2 champion Felipe Drugovich, has been called up to take Alonso's spot for first practice, with further updates on the plan for the remainder of the weekend to follow.

“In the days following the Belgian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso has been managing a muscular injury in his back,” read the team's note.

“As he continues with treatment this morning, he has chosen to sit out of FP1. Felipe Drugovich will drive in FP1 alongside Lance Stroll.

“A decision will then be made on Fernando's participation in FP2 and the remainder of the weekend in due course.”

In a later update issued between practice sessions, Aston Martin confirmed that Alonso would return to action for FP2.
