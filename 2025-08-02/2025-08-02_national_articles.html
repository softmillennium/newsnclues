                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Special counsel Jack Smith speaks to the media about an indictment of former President Donald Trump, Aug. 1, 2023, at an office of the Department of Justice in Washington. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before walking across the South Lawn of the White House to board Marine One en route to Joint Base Andrews, Md., Friday, Aug. 1, 2025, in Washington. President Donald Trump walks across the South Lawn of the White House to board Marine One en route to Joint Base Andrews, Md., Friday, Aug. 1, 2025, in Washington. BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) — Federal officials have opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who investigated then-candidate Donald Trump before his reelection to a second term. The Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, on Saturday confirmed the investigation after reporting by other news organizations. Smith was named special counsel to investigate Trump in by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022. Trump and his Republican allies, including Sen. Tom Cotton, have — without offering evidence of wrongdoing— accused Smith of violating the Hatch Act, a federal law that bans certain public officials from engaging in political activity. Smith prosecuted two federal cases against Republican candidate Trump in the lead-up to the November 2024 presidential election. Smith ultimately dropped the cases — neither one had gone to trial — after Trump was reelected, which would have shielded him from prosecution according to longstanding Justice Department practice. Smith then subsequently resigned as special counsel. Cotton, R-Ark., on Wednesday asked the Office of Special Counsel to investigate Smith, alleging that his conduct was designed to help then-President Joe Biden and his vice president, Kamala Harris, both Democrats. Biden had dropped his own bid for reelection following his disastrous performance in a campaign debate against Trump and tapped Harris to succeed him on the ticket. The New York Post was first to report on the investigation into Smith.</p>

A generous plane passenger whose departure from South Carolina had been delayed for four hours tried to make the best of a frustrating situation by ordering pizza for everyone on the flight at Charleston International Airport. America's busiest airports are quietly becoming unexpected food destinations — and smart travelers know just where to grab the best bite before takeoff. Airport lounges have elevated their food offerings even as they remain pricey and require memberships or a certain credit card or frequent-flier status. For the average traveler, regular airport restaurants are still costly, partly due to real estate costs and the challenge of getting staff and ingredients through security, Gary Leff, a Texas-based travel industry expert, told Fox News Digital. They operate in tight spaces and are run by a single concession operator, leading to an "incredible sameness," Leff added. That would be Tortas Frontera, a Mexican restaurant at Chicago O'Hare International Airport in Illinois. "I even choose to connect through Chicago rather than another hub sometimes for it," Leff said. Tortas Frontera by Rick Bayless, the well-known chef, is often named online as a favorite of frequent flyers; one Reddit user raved it offered the "best airport food I've ever had." Other favorites named include O'Hare's Publican Tavern, Wicker Park and Gold Coast Dogs. And while Leff thinks One Flew South, a southern and sushi fusion restaurant at Georgia's Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), is "overrated," many tout that as their favorite flying pit stop. "The most outstanding meal I have EVER had in an airport!" Another southern hub with sought-after food is Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) in Texas. Paschal's is a southern comfort food restaurant at Georgia's Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. "Dallas-Fort Worth is a massive airport with numerous dining options," said Melanie Musson, an insurance expert from Montana who frequently travels with her husband and six kids. "They have several Texas barbecue options, so even when you're just stopping for a layover, you can get a taste of Texas." Among O'Hare's dining options is Gold Coast Dogs in Terminal 3. (Mary Mathis for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Justin Goldsberry, a business owner and seasoned traveler from New Jersey, also said he loves traveling through DFW for its barbecue and seafood. "Since seafood is my favorite, I'm always on the lookout," Goldsberry said. Musson's other favorite place to stop is Root Down at Denver International Airport (DEN) in Colorado, where she and her family have been going for years. "But Root Down isn't the only great eating establishment at DEN," Musson said. "It offers a wide array of chain restaurants and several local options." Reddit users also say they appreciate the variety at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in California. "SFO is a dream for anyone who loves Asian food," Maricel Gentile, owner of Maricel's Kitchen in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital. Gentile frequently travels for culinary events and often gets a bowl of udon or miso soup from Japanese restaurant Wakaba. "It's simple, warm and soulful, perfect before a long flight," Gentile said. SEA is home to Floret, a vegetarian spot that one recent Yelp reviewer said was "hands down … the best/cutest restaurant" she ever visited in an airport, and Beecher's Handmade Cheese, another favorite on the Reddit channels. Employees at travel site The Points Guy also recommended PDX as well as Salt Lake City International Airport in Utah, according to its managing editor, Clint Henderson, in part because they're reasonable. Both prohibit restaurants and shops from charging more than they would outside the airport. Bubby's, shown above, is a favorite restaurant at LaGuardia Airport, said Clint Henderson, managing editor of The Points Guy. Henderson thinks dining at New York's LaGuardia Airport has improved lately. Deirdre Bardolf is a lifestyle writer with Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Families of hostages expressed cautious satisfaction following their meeting with US envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday but said there was nothing “new” in efforts to reach a deal for the release of the captives. Palestinians who managed to return to their homes east of Gaza City found their neighborhood's unrecognizable, filled with rubble and destruction. Palestinians mourned some of the 44 people killed since Friday in northern Gaza, and gathered around those victims whose bodies arrived at Shifa hospital. Every morning, Abeer and Fadi Sobh wake up in their tent in the Gaza Strip to the same question: How will they find food for themselves and their six young children? White House special envoy Steve Witkoff, centre, arrives to meet families of hostages at the plaza known as the hostages square in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, Aug. 2, 2025. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli forces opened fire near two aid distribution sites run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation as crowds of hungry Palestinians again sought food, killing at least 10 people, witnesses and health workers said Saturday — a day after U.S. officials visited a GHF site and the U.S. ambassador called the troubled system “an incredible feat.” Nearly a week has passed since Israel, under international pressure amid growing scenes of starving children, announced limited humanitarian pauses and airdrops meant to get more food to Gaza's over 2 million people, who now largely rely on aid after almost 22 months of war. But the United Nations, partners and Palestinians say far too little aid is still coming in, with months' worth of supplies piled up outside Gaza waiting for Israeli approval. Trucks that enter are mostly stripped of supplies by desperate people and criminal groups before reaching warehouses for distribution. Experts this week said a “worst-case scenario of famine” was occurring in the besieged enclave. On Saturday, Gaza's health ministry said seven more Palestinians had died of malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours, including a child. Palestinians carry sacks of flour taken from a humanitarian aid convoy en route to Gaza City, in the outskirts of Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza Strip, Friday, Aug. 1, 2025. Aid is “far from sufficient,” Germany's government said via spokesman Stefan Kornelius. Families of the 50 hostages still in Gaza fear they are going hungry too, and blame Hamas, after the militants released images of an emaciated hostage, Evyatar David. Near the northernmost GHF distribution site near the Netzarim corridor, Yahia Youssef, who had come to seek aid Saturday morning, described a panicked and grimly familiar scene. Health workers said at least eight people were killed. Israel's military said it fired warning shots at a gathering approaching its forces. Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Younis received two bodies and many injured. Witness Mohamed Abu Taha said Israeli troops opened fire toward the crowds. Israel's military said it was not aware of any fire by its forces in the area. GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to prevent deadly crowding. Israel 's military on Friday said it was working to make the routes under its control safer. Israel and GHF have claimed the toll has been exaggerated. People mourn over the body of a young Palestinian killed while trying to reach trucks carrying humanitarian aid en route to Gaza City, outside the Hamad Al-Qatari Hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza Strip, Friday, Aug. 1, 2025. The GHF — backed by millions of dollars in U.S. support — launched in May as Israel sought an alternative to the U.N.-run system, which had safely delivered aid for much of the war but was accused by Israel of allowing Hamas to siphon off supplies. Hundreds more have been killed along the routes of U.N.-led food convoys. Hamas-led police once guarded those convoys and went after suspected looters, but Israeli fire targeted the officers. “Let's go back to what works & let us do our job,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote Saturday on social media, calling for more and safer truck deliveries. An Israeli strike hit a group of Palestinians trying to secure aid trucks entering northern Gaza from the Israeli-controlled Zikim crossing, killing at least three people, said Fares Awad, head of the health ministry's ambulance and emergency service. Nasser Hospital said it received five bodies after two separate strikes on tents sheltering displaced people in Gaza's south. White House special envoy Steve Witkoff, centre, arrives to meet families of hostages at the plaza known as the hostages square in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, Aug. 2, 2025. Israel's top general Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir warned that “combat will continue without rest” if hostages aren't freed. U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with hostages' families Saturday, a week after quitting ceasefire talks, blaming Hamas's intransigence. I heard that there was pressure from the Americans to end this operation, but we didn't hear anything practical,” said Michel Illouz, father of Israeli hostage Guy Illouz, whose body was taken into Gaza. Samah Matar poses for a photo with her sons Yousef, 6, in her arms, and Amir, 4, who suffer from malnutrition and cerebral palsy, at a U.N.-run school in Gaza City, Saturday, July 26, 2025. In Gaza, malnutrition is often worsened by preexisting conditions and compounded by illnesses linked to inadequate health care and poor sanitation, largely the result of the ongoing war. In part of Gaza City, displaced people who managed to return home found rubble-strewn neighborhoods unrecognizable. Most Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced, often multiple times, and are crowded into ever-shrinking areas considered safe. Destruction, destruction,” said Mohamed Qeiqa, who stood amid collapsed slabs of concrete and pointed out what had been a five-story building. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 60,400 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians but says women and children make up over half the dead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities have launched a manhunt after a shooting at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, left four people dead. Police tape surrounds The Owl Bar in of Anaconda, Mont., on Friday, Aug. 1, 2025, following a fatal shooting. Police and other emergency personnel are seen after a reported shooting in Anaconda, Mont., Friday, Aug. 1, 2025. People are seen in the town of Anaconda, Mont., following a reported shooting, Friday, Aug. 1, 2025. Law enforcement personnel respond to a reported shooting in Anaconda, Mont., Friday, Aug. 1, 2025. Police and other emergency personnel are seen after a reported shooting in Anaconda, Mont., Friday, Aug. 1, 2025. He urged residents late Friday to stay at home and on high alert. “While law enforcement has not received reports of Brown harming any other individuals, he is believed to be armed, and he is extremely dangerous,” Johnson said. Authorities said they would release the names of the victims once all of their families have been notified. “This is a small tight-knit community that has been harmed by the heinous actions of one individual who does not represent what this community or Montanans stand for,” Johnson said. Anaconda, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Butte, is hemmed in by mountains. A smelter stack that's no longer operational looms over the valley. Brown lived next door to The Owl Bar, said owner David Gwerder, who wasn't there during the shooting Friday morning. Gwerder told The Associated Press that the bartender and three patrons were killed and didn't think anyone else was inside. Police and other emergency personnel are seen after a reported shooting in Anaconda, Mont., Friday, Aug. 1, 2025. Brown served in the U.S. Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, said Lt. Col. Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson. Brown was in the Montana National Guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said. He left military service in the rank of sergeant. Brown's niece, Clare Boyle, told the AP on Friday that her uncle has struggled with mental illness for years and that she and her other family members repeatedly sought help. “It's a sick man who doesn't know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn't know where or when he is either.” With no sign of Brown in the white pickup or his home, authorities converged on the Stumptown Road area west of Anaconda by ground and air Friday, locking it down so no one was allowed in or out. The search continued Saturday morning, according to Chase Scheuer, a spokesman for Montana's DCI. As reports of the shooting spread through town earlier Friday, business owners locked their doors and sheltered inside with customers. “For our town to be locked down, everybody's pretty rattled.”</p>

The man accused of trying to assassinate President Donald Trump in Florida last year was barred by a federal judge from seeing classified material related to the case. Judge Aileen Cannon wrote in a ruling Friday that "the United States has made a sufficient showing that the information at issue was classified" and that its disclosure "could cause serious damage or exceptionally grave damages to the national security of the United States." Routh, 59, was recently granted approval to represent himself in his upcoming trial. He was charged with attempting to assassinate Trump, assaulting a federal officer and multiple firearms violations stemming from the Sept. 15, 2024 incident in Florida, the second attempted assassination plot against Trump in a matter of months. On Sept. 15, 2024, Ryan Routh allegedly hid in the bushes outside Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach with a rifle as Trump was playing. His son, Oran Routh, has pleaded guilty to a child porn charge. Prior to allowing Routh to represent himself, Cannon told him in late July that his court-appointed attorneys "will defend you far better than you can defend yourself" and "I strongly urge you not to make this decision." Fox News Digital also reported in July that Routh wrote an unusual letter to the judge asking why the death penalty isn't on the table—and proposing that he be included in a prisoner swap with U.S. adversaries, even suggesting he be sent to freeze in Siberia in exchange for a Ukrainian soldier. At nearly 60, a life of nothingness without love—what is the point? Ryan Routh during his court appearance on Thursday, July 24. "I had wished for a prisoner swap with Hamas, Iran... or China for Jimmy Lai or one of the 40 others, or to freeze to death in Siberia in exchange for a Ukrainian soldier... so I could die being of some use and save all this court mess." He then sarcastically added that the judge could send him away, which would give Trump a symbolic win. A letter allegedly written by Trump assassination suspect Ryan Routh was revealed in a Department of Justice detention memo on Monday, Sept. 23, 2024. (Martin County Sheriff's Office/Handout via REUTERS | Department of Justice) Cannon is the same judge that was presiding over Trump's classified documents case, which she dismissed in July 2024. That case dealt with the FBI's investigation into Trump and its raid on his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022.

Darrin Porcher and Fox News' Chanley Painter join ‘Fox News @ Night' to discuss the tragic murder of two parents in Arkansas, who were killed while trying to protect their children during a violent attack. McGann was charged with two counts of capital murder in connection to the killings of Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, who were found dead on a walking trail. Their daughters, who are 7 and 9, were not hurt and are being cared for by family members, authorities said. Andrew James McGann was booked at the Washington County Detention Center on Wednesday, July 30 at 7:08 p.m. (Washington County Detention Center) Clinton and Cristen Brink were murdered at Devil's Den State Park on Saturday, July 26, 2025. Shortly after — Search crews found Clinton and Cristen Brink dead from apparent stab wounds. Their daughters are found nearby, safe but traumatized. Evening — ASP confirmed that a double homicide occurred at the state park and issued a manhunt alert for an unidentified male suspect. "Let there be no mistake – we do not tolerate violent crime in Arkansas. The victims were identified as Clinton and Cristen Brink, who had recently relocated to the region from South Dakota. "Investigators are asking those who visited the park on Saturday to check cellphone photos and videos or GoPro footage for images of the suspect. They are also asking residents of the area surrounding the park to notify ASP if they have access to security and game camera footage," ASP said in a release on Monday. "I want to thank the public and our media partners for their support as we pursue the man responsible for this heinous crime," ASP Col. Mike Hagar said. 2:30 p.m. CDT — Authorities arrested McGann at a barbershop in Springdale. Authorities said they received "over 500" tips and surveillance video leading to his capture. Police recovered evidence from McGann's car and home linking him to the scene. James Andrew McGann, 28, was arrested on Wednesday, July 30 at a barbershop. Approximately 7 p.m. CDT – McGann was booked into the Washington County Detention Center in Fayetteville, Arkansas. They said that McGann had passed all background checks. "The safety of our students and staff is our highest priority," said Lissa Chidester, director of communications. "While SSPS has not yet been contacted by authorities regarding this matter, the district has and will always comply with requests from law enforcement in any investigation. Our hearts are with the family and loved ones who have suffered this tragic loss." McGann had not yet started his new job in Arkansas at Springdale Public Schools, Jared Cleveland, the district superintendent, confirmed to Fox News. Cleveland said that McGann "has not at any time" been in contact with students or their families. He declined to provide more information, citing the investigation. "Their children are especially in our thoughts and prayers." L-R: Arkansas couple Clinton and Cristen Brink; Andrew James McGann. The mother of a former student provided an email from the teacher's previous school district to Fox News. She said that in 2023, she filed a complaint with the superintendent after her son witnessed McGann behaving inappropriately toward younger females. In response, parents received a letter from the district stating that McGann had been placed on administrative leave while officials investigated complaints of poor classroom management and professional judgment. While the investigation did not find evidence of inappropriate behavior toward a student, it concluded that McGann's classroom management and judgment fell below district expectations. "Mr. McGann, on Wednesday afternoon, notified our Human Resources Department of his decision to resign his position, effective immediately," the email said, in part. The trail head to the Devil's Den trail at Devils Den State Park remains closed Monday, July 28, 2025, in West Fork, Ark. Police in Arkansas are searching for a suspect in the deaths of a couple who investigators said were attacked while on the wooded walking trail with their two young daughters. The trail head to the Devil's Den trail at Devils Den State Park remains closed Monday, July 28, 2025, in West Fork, Ark. Police in Arkansas are searching for a suspect in the deaths of a couple who investigators said were attacked while on the wooded walking trail with their two young daughters. The trail head to the lower section of the Devil's Den trail at Devil's Den State Park remains closed Monday, July 28, 2025, in West Fork, Ark., as police search for a suspect in the deaths of a couple who were attacked while on a wooded walking trail. McGann was charged with two counts of capital murder. "Although everyone is innocent until proven guilty, we did confirm this morning that the suspect's DNA is a positive match to the DNA recovered at the crime scene," Hagar said. We also executed a search warrant at his residence and recovered items consistent with the crime." Authorities confirmed that the suspect has no known adult criminal history. Investigators have not uncovered any prior charges or convictions. Investigators believe the attack was random and have not identified a motive. "It appears to be a completely random event," Hagar said. Hagar revealed that McGann sustained "injuries" during the attack. Police said that Clinton Brink was attacked first, and that Cristen ran the couple's two young children back to their vehicle and then returned to help her husband, where she was also fatally attacked. "We believe that the mother took them to safety and then returned to help her husband," Major Stacey Rhodes said. 9 a.m. CDT — McGann appeared in Washington County Circuit Court for a preliminary hearing. He was formally advised of his rights and the charges against him. Prosecutors confirmed he is being held without bond. Fox News' Brooke Taylor contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Natural disasters may cost more money, but they claim far fewer lives than in decades past. From the wildfires that torched Los Angeles in January to the record-setting heat waves that cooked much of Europe in June, the first half of 2025 has been marked by what now seems like a new normal of ever more frequent extreme weather. It's easy to feel that we live in a constant stream of weather disasters, with one ending only so another can begin, thanks largely to the amplifying effects of climate change. A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. Yet behind the catastrophic headlines is a much more positive story. About 2,200 people worldwide died in storms, floods, heat waves and other “weather‐climate” disasters in the first six months of the year, according to the risk consultancy company Aon's midyear catastrophe report. They tallied 7,700 natural-hazard deaths overall, but if you take out the roughly 5,500 people who died in a single non-weather geological event — a major earthquake in Myanmar in March — you're left with the smallest January-to-June weather death toll since we began keeping records. (Hat tip to Roger Pielke Jr., whose Substack post was where I first saw these figures.) More than 2,000 deaths is still too many, and it doesn't count more recent deadly disasters, like the terrible July floods in Texas's Hill Country that killed at least 135 people. Somehow, even as climate change has intensified many natural disasters and more people are living in harm's way, the actual human toll from these catastrophes has been falling. All of which raises two questions: How have we managed this? And will this trend continue even in an ever-warmer world? I've been writing this newsletter for a few months now, and if I were to boil down its message into one phrase, it'd be this: Wow, the past was much worse than you think. That's certainly the case for deadly natural disasters and extreme weather. But annualized death rates hide just how bloody some of these events were. In 1931, massive flooding in China's Yangtze and Yellow River killed perhaps 4 million people due to drowning, disease, and starvation. An earthquake that hit Tokyo in 1923 killed at least 143,000 people. Until fairly recently, the Earth was a merciless killer. The 21st century has still been marked by the occasional mega-death toll disaster — though most of them have been earthquake related rather than weather-driven — but they've become far rarer. The frequency of storms and floods hasn't abated. The difference is our ability to protect ourselves. There's a paradox in our improving response to natural disasters: Even as the deaths from extreme weather and other catastrophes have been falling, the cost of those events has been rising. The same Aon report that contained the good news about falling deaths also tallied up an estimated $162 billion in economic losses from global natural disasters — some $20 billion above the 21st century average. Yet at the same time, a richer society is one that can invest in warning systems and infrastructure adaptations that can and do vastly reduce the death toll from a disaster. That makes it the second-deadliest wildfire in California history, but it still had a far lower human toll than wildfires from a hundred years ago or more, which killed hundreds and even thousands of people. It's a basic rule of disasters: A richer society has more to lose in property, but it also has the wealth to protect its people. From early warning text chains in Mozambique to cyclone shelters in Bangladesh to heat action plans in India, even some of the poorest countries in the world have built warning and response systems that can blunt the death toll of the worst extreme weather. A new UN report estimates that when the full effects are counted, disasters cost the world over $2.3 trillion every year. We are getting brilliantly good at saving people; we have not yet figured out how to save their homes, crops and jobs. That will require the hard, unglamorous work of preparing for disasters before they happen. But we shouldn't lose sight of one of humanity's greatest triumphs: We are learning, year by year, how not to die when the planet turns against us. The arc of human ingenuity still bends toward safety. A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump said Friday he was ordering two US Navy nuclear submarines to “appropriate regions,” in response to remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council. In what he called an effort to be “prepared,” Trump said in a Truth Social post that he had “ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that.” The president did not specify what type of submarines were being moved or where to, and the Pentagon usually reveals little about any of its subs' movements. Here's a look at the US submarine fleet: The US Navy has 14 Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarines (SSBNs), often referred to as “boomers.” SSBNs “are designed specifically for stealth and the precise delivery of nuclear warheads,” a Navy fact sheet on them says. Each can carry 20 Trident ballistic missiles with multiple nuclear warheads. ‘Very risky business': John Bolton reacts to Trump's nuclear subs order Their movements are among the Navy's most closely guarded secrets. At 560 feet (170 meters) long, the Ohio-class subs displace almost 19,000 tons submerged and have a crew of 159. They can reach a speed of 23 miles per hour. Each can carry 154 Tomahawks with a high-explosive warhead of up to 1,000 pounds, and a range of about 1,000 miles. They can also transport troops, who can be clandestinely deployed from lockout chambers in former ballistic-missile tubes, according to the Navy. Movements of the SSGNs are also highly classified, but in recent years the Navy made occasional note of their presence near military hotspots, to send a message of deterrence. They can also strike land-based targets with Tomahawk missiles, though they carry the Tomahawks in much smaller numbers than the SSGNs. Fast-attack subs come in three forms: the Virginia, Los Angeles and Seawolf classes. They are 360 feet long, displace 6,900 tons and carry a crew of 143. How did a $3 billion US Navy submarine hit an undersea mountain? “This hull section provides for additional payloads to accommodate advanced technology used to carry out classified research and development and for enhanced warfighting capabilities,” the Navy says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House lawmakers have requested billions of dollars for special community funding projects, or earmarks, whose approval hinges on Congress's ability to pass all 12 appropriations bills by the end of September. So far, the House has passed two appropriations bills: Military Construction/Veterans Affairs and Defense. The chamber has had difficulty passing all 12 bills in fiscal years past, so it is likely that, with lawmakers on August recess, Republican leadership will need to do a short-term spending deal ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline. The top five Democrats who requested the most costly earmarks were Reps. Chris Deluzio (D-PA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Melanie Stansbury (D-NM), Ed Case (D-HI), and Eric Sorensen (D-IL). Each House member can request up to 15 projects, but not all are accepted. However, the inclusion of earmarks in the bills does not guarantee that money is on its way to their districts. The appropriations bill must pass the House and Senate and head to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature. Rutherford, 72, has been a member of Congress since 2017. He requested the most earmarks of any Republican, totaling $795,942,500. Among the projects is a $262 million request for a Multi-Aircraft Paint & Strip Facility Planning and Design in Jacksonville, Florida. A $374.6 million request is intended for an F-35 Aircraft Engine Repair Facility, and $45 million is requested for a Child Development Center Planning and Design, both in Jacksonville. “The purpose of Community Project Funding (CPFs) is to give members of Congress, not Washington bureaucrats, the power to decide how a small percentage of discretionary funding is spent,” Rutherford said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. Rutherford said he aims for funding that “helps protect our coastal communities and military installations, and enhances our transportation systems.” “I am proud to have requested, on behalf of my constituents, the funding that our district needs,” the Florida Republican added. “Anyone interested in learning more about the CPFs requested can find them all posted on my website.” He has been a member of Congress since 2017. “Since coming to office, congressman Mast has always fought to protect Florida's waterways, which are vital to the economy and quality of life on the Treasure Coast, and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration is central to that fight,” Kate Constantini, Mast's spokeswoman, told the Washington Examiner. Weber has served as Texas's 14th District representative since 2013. He is a member of the Republican Study Committee. Of that roughly $410 million, $200 million is intended for the Sabine-Neches Waterway Channel Improvement Project for the U.S> Army Corps of Engineers. “Southeast Texas is a critical part of this nation's backbone, sitting right on the Gulf with key waterways and ports that keep America moving,” Weber said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “I'm proud to fight every day to secure Community Project Funding that supports projects advancing the President's priorities—projects that create good jobs, boost our economy, and protect our communities. My commitment is clear: I'll keep standing strong for Southeast Texas and the hardworking families who call this place home.” His largest earmark request totals $257 million for the Upper Ohio Navigation Project, Montgomery Lock for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Other projects include $300,000 for the Somerset County Food Access Project to provide additional food supplies, walk-in cooler panels, box packaging for delivery and pick-up needs, and a refrigerated box truck to address food insecurity in southwest Pennsylvania. Roughly $643,354 will go toward upgrading technology for Westmoreland County law enforcement officials, and $3 million will go to Indiana University of Pennsylvania's College of Medicine for facility infrastructure, equipment, and other expenses for a School of Osteopathic Medicine to increase healthcare access in rural areas. The Washington Examiner reached out to Reschenthaler for comment. He requested a total of $267,687,628 in earmarks for 15 projects. It is a similar waterway project to those above, whose construction has been ongoing since 2004, per the congressman's letter to Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK). Fleischmann said in the letter that this project will increase job flow from Chattanooga to East Tennessee and make it easier for commercial and recreational vessels to pass through the dam. The Washington Examiner reached out to Fleischmann for comment. He sits on the Armed Services and Transportation committees. He is a member of the Progressive Caucus. Of that sum, $275 million is intended to modernize the Montgomery Lock and Dam sites in Upper Ohio, Allegheny, and Beaver counties. But, due to “unanticipated cost escalation” from inflation and market conditions, additional funding is required. The congressman stated upgrading the three sites would bolster an area that supports over 180,000 jobs and brings in $4.8 billion in state and local tax revenue. The playground is intended to be an outdoor physical and social recreational space for all persons, regardless of limitations. The Washington Examiner reached out to Deluzio for comment. Lofgren is serving her 15th term in Congress, having been a member of the House since 1994. One project, totaling $226 million, would construct a levee at the Pajaro River in Watsonville, California, to prevent floods. “I am proud to have asked for enough funding to protect the proud, but poor, community of Pajaro from devastating floods,” Lofgren said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “I certainly know what my Central Coast constituents need more than the Trump administration does. I am disappointed that my request to provide life-saving funding has not yet been honored.” Stansbury is a House Democrat representing New Mexico's 1st District since 2021. She is a member of the Progressive Caucus. Another $8 million is going to an acute care hospital in Valencia County. The Washington Examiner reached out to Stansbury for comment. He left Congress to practice law and serve as a senior vice president to one of the state's oldest hotel companies. Of that total, $90 million is intended for a water treatment facility for the Navy Department at the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Oahu. The incident displaced over 3,500 military families and sickened many residents. The Washington Examiner reached out to Case for comment. Sorensen is an Illinois House Democrat representing the state's 17th District since 2023. He sits on the Agriculture and Armed Services committees. The largest project is funding a Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program for the Army Corps of Engineers in Rock Island, Illinois. The Washington Examiner reached out to Sorensen for comment.</p>

That kind of journalism isn't easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Humans are the dominant species on a dying planet, and we're still clinging to the idea that we can think our way out, invent our way out, maybe even upload our way out. Mark C. Taylor is a philosopher, a cultural critic, and the author of After the Human. It's a sweeping, sometimes dizzying book, one that moves from Hegel to quantum physics to the ethics of soil and fungi. I invited Taylor onto The Gray Area to talk about how all this coalesces into a uniquely ambitious attempt to explain what it is to be human, and why we need a new story, a new self, and, really, a whole new way of thinking and being in the world. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. At the very beginning of this book, you write, “How would your understanding of the meaning of your life change if you knew that next Friday at precisely 12 o'clock midnight, the human race would become extinct?” Why do you want us thinking about total extinction next Friday? Because I think it's a realistic possibility. The real urgency of this book comes out of my concern about climate change, because there's absolutely no doubt that we are facing catastrophic effects in the very near future, and there's a complete blindness or unwillingness to confront the actuality of that problem and to address what needs to be done to dodge it if we can. The problem isn't just that people are not connecting the dots; people do not know the dots that need to be connected. What do you think it means to be “human”? Part of what distinguishes the human is that we can ask the question of what it means to be human. That's a level of self-consciousness and self-reflectivity that is important and in some ways distinctive of the human. And you think the problem is that we've come to think of human consciousness as something special, almost separate from nature? And what Descartes does is to identify being a human with thinking, and [identifying] everything else as a machine, including the human body. From that point on, there's always this effort to distinguish the human from the non-human. How does that lead us to this situation where we are exploiting nature and wrecking our environment? We view the individual as what is most concrete and most real, and we see groups as formed of individuals. That's wrong because there is no such thing as an isolated individual. Every individual is what it is by virtue of its interrelationship to other individuals and entities. Why is the illusion that we are disconnected and separate so powerful? It's a parasite-host relationship, and we are in the process of destroying the host upon which we depend. You cut down all the trees in order to serve the economy and we die. So in that sense, the interrelationship is confirmed. When the current politicians pull out of all climate accords, reinforce fossil fuel, they're destroying the planet without which we can't live. What kind of vision of the self do we actually need, and what are the ideas that are going to get us there? I think ideas will help us get out of it. Another way to think about what Descartes does is that he takes mind out of nature, makes everything but the human mind a machine. So part of what you have to do is put mind back into nature. You have to rethink what we mean by knowledge, what we mean by cognition, what we mean by intelligence and the like. Part of what I've tried to do is try to understand quantum mechanics in terms of relationality and information processing. There's a very important theoretical physicist, Carlo Rovelli, who understands through this notion of relationality or relativity. Then you begin to see the way in which everything is interconnected. And [when] you look at the biological level, [you see that] biological systems are information processing systems. I have diabetes, and that's one of the ways in which I began to understand this. When you understand how autoimmune disease works, you see that it's a coding problem and a misreading problem. One way to understand the mess we're in now is as autoimmune disease, because what autoimmunity involves is the body turning on the body or the body politic turning on itself and destroying itself in certain ways, because it misreads itself. And you can trace this notion of information processing all the way through the physical, biological, the ecological, and try to understand ecological systems as information processing systems. What does it actually mean to think of the mind as something that extends beyond the individual human? I use the images of webs or networks. Think of yourself as a node within an ever-expanding and changing network. And what I am constantly becoming is a function not only of what I have been and what I anticipate, but of my relationships to others at this particular moment and ultimately the whole entire web. And you also need an expanded notion of the mind to understand that there are alternative intelligences. For example, there's some really interesting scientific work being done on plant communication. I mean, Richard Powers's Overstory is an example of that. For me, the relationship between thought and action isn't always so neat, right? It is easy to say that we live in this world of interdependence and co-dependence. Positive feedback is related to these complex systems where change accelerates. There's a pile of sand, add grain after grain — you know there's going to be an avalanche, but you don't know when it's going to occur. That's the bind we're in now, not just with respect to climate, but with respect to these systems that work the same way. Financial bubbles and climate change work the same way. How do you use these ideas then to enact the kinds of changes that need to be made? I'm trying to imagine myself on the other side as an audience member listening and wondering, Okay, now what? The most political, if you will, form of action that I took based on these ideas was that I started a company with a big New York investment banker by the name of Herbert Allen in 1998 called Global Education Network. I started webcasting my classes in 1996 when nobody was doing it. In 1992, I taught a course using teleconferencing with Helsinki. And at that time, I thought that the world would be a better place if everybody could sit down around the table and talk about Hegel or Nietzsche. We tried, and the man I did this with, he put $27 million into that effort, and we failed. I had a vision, and it was all based upon this idea of networks, to make education more widely available through these technologies. Now, what I didn't understand, and I don't think many of us did, was that these technologies that connect also separate. But there was an example of trying to put the ideas into action in a way that would bring us together in certain ways. Do you worry that AI might change our understanding of humanity in even worse ways? That we will just gradually come to think of ourselves more and more as machine-like? Not many people have heard about him, but he is my neighbor here in Williamstown. He has a conference in Sun Valley that brings together the people running the world — technology, media, entertainment, sports — for five days. [Bill] Gates, Warren Buffett — these are really smart guys, but they have a very narrow vision of the world. Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and these people, they have a vision. And I think that what they understand is that whoever controls AI runs the world. Thiel was just on Ross Douthat's New York Times podcast. There was one point at which Ross just asked him straight up, “Do you think the human race should continue?” And he treats it like a gotcha question. He pauses for a while before he can muster an answer to what should be the mother of all “yes or no” questions. But there is this kind of techno-salvation, techno-utopianism, anti-humanism. You talk about this a lot in the book, this idea that we're going to build these tools and we're going to upload our minds and we're going to escape all the problems that come with being mortal meatbags on this planet. Does that just feel like an old story in a new disguise to you? Andreessen is a really important player in this. There's an absolute view of the future that these guys have. And Andreessen has a book; the first line of the book is something like “all serious philosophies are a meditation on death.” For these guys — and again, they are guys — death is an engineering problem. They really believe in anti-aging stuff and they do believe that the human life cycle can be expanded considerably if not infinitely. If you go back to the early years of Christianity, gnosticism was one of its greatest competitors. And gnosticism was a dualistic understanding of being — that the world was completely evil, and the whole point was to get out of this world, and the body was divided between mind and soul. There were concentric spheres and each sphere had a password, had gnosis, took a certain kind of code to get you out of it, and you gradually became more and more detached from the world. That's what this Mars exploration is about. Religion is most interesting where it's least obvious. As you said, it's an old story in a new version. There's this escapism, which is a nihilism. I don't believe there's an afterlife. I always tell my students, I do believe in ghosts; Hegel and Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are my ghosts. If individualism is an illusion, and we are part of this web of life, does death mean something different than what we normally think it means? It's the end of a certain kind of subjectivity, but is it more transformation than the end? Just as I was beginning to write the section on consciousness or plant and animal consciousness, my younger brother fell into a coma for three weeks and died. And the first time I entered that hospital room was when he was in this comatose state, and this is the night before I taught my last class in 50 years. He was hooked up to more machines than you can imagine. And I mean, you see the fragility of life. With my brother, you adjust the dial to fix one thing and another thing gets out of whack. [The] first time I walked into that room, he is in his comatose state and his heartbeat increases. I'm always hesitant to invoke the notion of God. But that doesn't have to be some kind of mushy stuff. It's all these complexly interrelated particles and bits. To bring us back to that thought experiment about imagining the end next week: Do you think we have created a form of life in which it's just too easy to not think about death and therefore too easy to take life for granted? I had a biopsy for cancer and went into septic shock. And the strange thing for me was that, it was a strange and liberating experience. Kierkegaard talks about two moments of infinite resignation: the withdrawal, and then the movement, what he calls faith, which is living in the world as a gift. You may die this afternoon, as might I. I taught a class at noon, and I taught [Jacques] Derrida's Gift of Death, which he wrote at my urging. And at 7 o'clock that night, I was near dead. It's a bit of a ridiculous question, but are you hopeful that we can course-correct? And one of them that I like the best is, “Hope is an act of defiance.” We have to hope. I'm defying what is happening not only in this country, but throughout the world. I do think that intelligence and even wisdom involves this ability to see connections where others don't see it. To see these interrelationships, I mean, you can have information without knowledge, you can have knowledge without intelligence and in some instances you can have intelligence without wisdom. We need to define what all those are. And then you're going to have wisdom. And wisdom is in some sense, I think, trying to understand how this all fits together and how we are an integral — and that's the word — an integral member of this web. And there will be new forms of life that evolve, right? I don't think human life will go away. But it's also very possible that we will bring about our own extinction. And when I posed that question about the world ending next Friday, it was to try to convey the sense of the certainty of death. It makes life more precious in certain ways because of its fragility. So maybe the real question isn't what would we do if the end came next Friday? That's a better way of putting it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court ruled Friday night to uphold a lower court's temporary order blocking the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in Southern California. A three-judge panel of the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals held a hearing Monday afternoon at which the federal government asked the court to overturn a temporary restraining order issued July 12 by Judge Maame E. Frimpong, arguing it hindered their enforcement of immigration law. Immigrant advocacy groups filed suit last month accusing President Donald Trump's administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. The lawsuit included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens as plaintiffs. In her order, Frimpong said there was a “mountain of evidence” that federal immigration enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. How ICE raids turned parts of Los Angeles into ghost towns Federal agents have rounded up immigrants without legal status to be in the U.S. from Home Depots, car washes, bus stops, and farms, many who have lived in the country for decades. Among the plaintiffs is Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a video taken by a friend June 13 being seized by federal agents as he yells, “I was born here in the states, East LA bro!” “It's a very serious thing to say that multiple federal government agencies have a policy of violating the Constitution,” attorney Jacob Roth said. He also argued that the order was unclear on what exactly is permissible under law. “Legally, I think it's appropriate to use the factors for reasonable suspicion,” Roth said “No one has suggested that you cannot consider these factors at all,” Judge Jennifer Sung said. However, those factors alone only form a “broad profile” and don't satisfy the reasonable suspicion standard to stop someone, she said. Sung, a Biden appointee, said that in an area like Los Angeles, where Latinos make up as much as half the population, those factors “cannot possibly weed out those who have undocumented status and those who have documented legal status.”</p>

President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media after he arrived at Prestwick Airport in Ayrshire, Scotland, Friday, July 25, 2025. President Donald Trump speaks with reporters before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, July 25, 2025, in Washington. Protesters display signs reading “Impeach Trump,” during a rally near President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., as part of the “Good Trouble Lives On” national day of action, Thursday, July 17, 2025. NEW YORK (AP) — It would seem the most straightforward of notions: A thing takes place, and it goes into the history books or is added to museum exhibits. But whether something even gets remembered and how — particularly when it comes to the history of a country and its leader — is often the furthest thing from simple. A Smithsonian spokesperson said the removal of the reference, which had been installed as part of a temporary addition in 2021, came after a review of “legacy content recently” and the exhibit eventually “will include all impeachments.” There was no time frame given for when; exhibition renovations can be time- and money-consuming endeavors. In a statement that did not directly address the impeachment references, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said: “We are fully supportive of updating displays to highlight American greatness.” “Based on what we have been seeing, this is part of a broader effort by the president to influence and shape how history is depicted at museums, national parks, and schools,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. “Not only is he pushing a specific narrative of the United States but, in this case, trying to influence how Americans learn about his own role in history.” There is power in being able to shape how things are remembered, if they are remembered at all — who was there, who took part, who was responsible, what happened to lead up to that point in history. In China, for example, references to the June 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square are forbidden and meticulously regulated by the ruling Communist Party government. In Soviet-era Russia, officials who ran afoul of leaders like Josef Stalin disappeared not only from the government itself but from photographs and history books where they once appeared. Jason Stanley, an expert on authoritarianism, said controlling what and how people learn of their past has long been used as a vital tool to maintain power. “If they don't control the historical narrative,” he said, “then they can't create the kind of fake history that props up their politics.” Jackie Kennedy insisted on cuts in William Manchester's book on her husband's 1963 assassination, “The Death of a President.” Ronald Reagan and his wife got a cable TV channel to release a carefully calibrated documentary about him. Those around Franklin D. Roosevelt, including journalists of the era, took pains to mask the impact that paralysis had on his body and his mobility. Trump, though, has taken it to a more intense level — a sitting president encouraging an atmosphere where institutions can feel compelled to choose between him and the truth — whether he calls for it directly or not. “We are constantly trying to position ourselves in history as citizens, as citizens of the country, citizens of the world,” said Robin Wagner-Pacifici, professor emerita of sociology at the New School for Social Research. “So part of these exhibits and monuments are also about situating us in time. Naftali, now a senior researcher at Columbia University, said museum directors “should have red lines” and that he considered removing the Trump panel to be one of them. While it might seem inconsequential for someone in power to care about a museum's offerings, Wagner-Pacifici says Trump's outlook on history and his role in it — earlier this year, he said the Smithsonian had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” — shows how important those matters are to people in authority. “You might say about that person, whoever that person is, their power is so immense and their legitimacy is so stable and so sort of monumental that why would they bother with things like this ... why would they bother to waste their energy and effort on that?” Wagner-Pacifici said. Her conclusion: “The legitimacy of those in power has to be reconstituted constantly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We'd like to release everything, but we don't want people to get hurt that shouldn't be hurt,” he told Newsmax host Rob Finnerty in an interview at the White House. I just don't want people to get hurt.” The sit-down interview comes one week after Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, for nine hours over two days. Maxwell was granted limited immunity for answering the Department of Justice's questions, meaning her statements won't be directly used against her in a new prosecution. She is already serving 20 years in prison for trafficking underage girls. When Finnerty asked Trump about what Maxwell said during the interview, Trump said he didn't know because he hadn't spoken to Blanche about her testimony yet. Trump said he suspected Blanche, whom he praised as a “very talented guy” and a “straight shooter,” was interviewing Maxwell because he also doesn't want people, presumably sexual abuse survivors, to get hurt in a complete release of the Epstein files. “If they were going to use the files, they would've used it before my election,” Trump said, naming former FBI Director James Comey. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Trump was told by Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputy in May that his name appeared multiple times in the Epstein files. Trump and Epstein were once friends, but they had a fallout, and Trump kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida two decades ago. Earlier this week, Trump said Epstein “stole people that worked for me” at Mar-a-Lago, including victim Virginia Giuffre, who committed suicide in April. Earlier Friday, it was reported that Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a similar facility in Texas. She argues her 2021 conviction should be tossed because of a 2007 plea agreement Epstein secured with federal prosecutors in Florida.</p>
