                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first witness, Neera Tanden, testified before the Oversight majority and minority counsel Tuesday, and was not protected by executive privilege per a letter sent by the White House Tuesday. Tanden's interview lasted over four hours and included a lunch break. Anthony Bernal, a senior adviser to former first lady Jill Biden, was supposed to testify in front of the committee on Thursday, but abruptly cancelled his appearance shortly after the White House waived executive privilege. House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY) told the Washington Examiner Tuesday the committee wants answers about “who was calling the shots” during Biden's final two years in office. Both Tanden and Bernal received these letters, along with the seven other aides who will testify as well: Annie Tomasini, Ashley Williams, Michael Donilon, Anita Dunn, Ronald Klain, Bruce Reed, and Steve Ricchetti. The letters claim that there is “Evidence that aides to former President Biden concealed information regarding his fitness to exercise the powers of the President — and may have unconstitutionally exercised those powers themselves to aid in their concealment — implicates both Congress' constitutional and legislative powers.” Before these letters were sent, one of the most notable recent instances of waiving executive privilege was the Biden administration's use of it in relation to the Jan. 6 investigation. Comer told the Washington Examiner that no interviews will be released before all of them have concluded. Transcribed interviews are typically conducted by committee staff over the course of several hours, and both parties are granted extended time for questioning, compared to the five-minute increments afforded to members during publicly televised hearings. The chairman said the committee is especially focused on whether any executive actions were authorized without Biden's explicit approval, and whether the autopen was used to bypass the president at any point during his tenure.</p>

American Airlines flight 1665 returned to Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas shortly after takeoff due to a mechanical issue on Wednesday, June 25. An American Airlines plane made an emergency landing in Las Vegas on Wednesday after smoke and sparks were seen spewing from one of its engines. American Airlines Flight 1665 was forced to return to Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas (LAS) shortly after takeoff due to a mechanical issue, the airline said in a statement. Video from an eyewitness shows dark smoke trailing behind the plane's engines midair. Sparks could also be seen going off from its right engine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The day's heat wasn't expected to be as intense as Tuesday, when at least 50 heat records were matched or broken and 21 places hit triple-digit temperatures. About 127 million Americans remained under National Weather Service heat advisories, down from the previous day. Sizzling temperatures sent utilities scrambling to keep the air conditioning and lights on amid massive demand for power. “It's still going to be, I think, pretty bad across the East,'' meteorologist Bob Oravec of the Weather Prediction Center said Wednesday morning. ”I think today is probably the last day of widespread record potential. The weather service warned of “extreme heat” for a stretch of the country from North Carolina to New York and west to West Virginia. Highs could approach triple digits from New York to Richmond, Oravec said. Temperatures Wednesday morning were “a little bit warmer than expected” because of northwesterly winds bringing “warm leftovers from yesterday,” said former NOAA chief scientist Ryan Maue, a private meteorologist.

(AP Photo/Erik Verduzco) That air mass drawing on cool ocean waters will send temperatures plummeting by the end of the week in Philadelphia, which hit a record high of 101 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, said Ray Martin, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey. Air temperatures will be in the low 70s Fahrenheit (20s Celsius). Boston's forecast high for Friday is 34 degrees lower than what it hit Tuesday. “It's going to feel like a different season,” Oravec said. After one or two days, slightly hotter than normal temperatures are forecast, but not anywhere near the highs from earlier this week, Oravec said. Weather whiplash from one extreme to another occurs more often as the world warms overall from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, scientists said. At night, when the human body needs cooling, temperatures only dropped to 87 Fahrenheit (30 Celsius). A dozen weather stations were 101 degrees or higher, including two New York airports. Boston hit 102, breaking its old record by seven degrees. Augusta, Maine's 100-degrees also broke its old record by seven degrees. Every coastal state from Maine to South Carolina hit 100 degrees somewhere, with Georgia and Florida clocking in at 99 on Tuesday. As temperatures rise “things become less reliable and more unstable,” said Climate Central Chief Meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky. The nation's largest power grid operator, PJM Interconnection, on Monday recorded its highest demand since 2011, with only a slight drop off Tuesday and Wednesday, spokesman Dan Lockwood said. “We have an aging grid infrastructure already in United States, so you can see the impacts of that heat on that infrastructure,” said Kate Guy, senior research fellow at the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy. “At the same time, you're seeing a really big spike in demand. This is what they (utilities) are increasingly experiencing because of climate change,” Guy said. “Frankly, with each year is increased, historic temperatures and that intense heat arriving earlier than ever, just putting an immense pressure on the electrical grid.” State transportation officials say the impact on the concrete roadway in Morris County on Tuesday afternoon forced some lane closures as temporary repairs were made. Crews then began work to replace the damaged areas and repave those sections. Some downtown Chicago streets will close Wednesday night to repair pavement that has buckled due to hot temperatures amid an ongoing heat wave in the city. “Pavement failures or blowouts occur when prolonged high temperatures cause the road to expand and buckle up or blow out, resulting in uneven driving surfaces,” the Illinois Department of Transportation said in a statement.

Reuveni claimed Bove said DOJ should consider telling courts “f*** you.” “For all those reasons,” Bove added, “I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge.” The group also has ties to liberal megadonor George Soros and other left-wing funders.

Bove, who was promoted to a top spot in the DOJ after representing Trump during his criminal cases ahead of his reelection, also came under fire Wednesday for his role in dismissing federal corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.

Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner spoke to Fox News Digital. EXCLUSIVE: The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Commonwealth of Virginia will announce Wednesday that the agency will be the first major cabinet department to relocate out of Washington, D.C. during President Donald Trump's term. Glenn Youngkin and HUD Secretary Scott Turner are set to christen the agency's new home at the already existing National Science Foundation (NSF) building in Alexandria's Carlyle-Eisenhower neighborhood, which is also home to a Wegman's grocery store, a movie theater and several shops and high-end restaurants. HUD's current headquarters on L'Enfant Plaza is also on the Senate DOGE Caucus' list of buildings they want to see sold off to save taxpayer funds. The curved X-shaped granite building, officially called the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, is "underutilized," according to their rubric. Turner noted that the relocation will unlock hundreds of millions in taxpayer savings and address serious health concerns among staff at L'Enfant. "It is time to turn the page on the Weaver Building and relocate to a new headquarters that prioritizes the well-being of HUD employees and properly reflects the passion and excellence of our team," Turner told Fox News Digital. "There are serious concerns with the current state of HUD's headquarters, including health hazards, leaks, and structural and maintenance failures. Many of these risks will needlessly and irresponsibly continue to absorb taxpayer dollars. Relocating is about more than just changing buildings; it's about a mission-minded shift that we hope will inspire every employee." Turner, a former Washington Redskins cornerback, added that it also aligns with President Donald Trump's vision for a "New American Golden Age." Youngkin was equally enthused about HUD's move to the Old Dominion. "Virginia is a great place to be headquartered, and we are excited to welcome the Department of Housing and Urban Development and their over 2,700 headquarters-based employees to the best state in America to live, work, and raise a family," Youngkin told Fox News Digital. Amid plans by then-Elon Musk-led DOGE to relocate federal workers, Youngkin faced criticism for not speaking out more forcefully against the administration — criticism that largely fizzled after Wednesday's announcement revealed the new headquarters would be just a few stops from downtown Washington on the Metro's Yellow Line. "Virginia is the proud home to many public and private sector headquarters, and we thank HUD leadership for trusting us and are committed to supporting your important national mission." Youngkin had taken slings and arrows over his support for such DOGE efforts, including from Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Mount Vernon, who previously criticized his position on federal worker relocation. The HUD relocation, however, falls just across Cameron Run Creek from Surovell's district. "It is a true federal fixer-upper and perfect candidate to be put on the auction block. My For Sale Act will sell off this and five other money pits to downsize Washington's portfolio of underutilized buildings, generate $400 million in revenue, and save taxpayers billions in maintenance." Michael Peters, the commissioner of the General Services Administration, which manages federal real estate, praised the move to Virginia, saying it reflects his agency's commitment to fiscal responsibility and "mission effectiveness." Investments to-date in the Weaver building totaled $90 million over the past 15 years, including plaza, roof and façade repairs. Mold and asbestos containment have plagued the building, which also has only about half of its elevators in working operation. The agency also noted there are about 1,000 more employees at HUD versus NSF – which they calculated to effect a $51-per-square-foot savings on building usage and maintenance.

Arizona Diamondbacks star second baseman Ketel Marte was in tears during a pitching change in the seventh inning of the team's 4-1 win over the Chicago White Sox at Rate Field on Tuesday. Marte, 31, was left in tears after a fan yelled derogatory comments about his late mother. Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte, #4, hugs pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez, #57, in the dugout after he hits a home run against the Chicago White Sox during the fourth inning at Rate Field on June 23, 2025 in Chicago. Lovullo said he heard what the fan said towards Marte, and a Diamondbacks' spokesperson told the Arizona Republic that Lovullo and bench coach Jeff Banis asked for the person to be removed from the game. "It was a terrible moment, fans are nasty, fans go too far," an emotional Lovullo said to reporters after the game. "I just reacted as a dad would when I went out to change pitchers," Lovullo said, per the Arizona Republic. "I could see he was sobbing. Arizona Diamondbacks shortstop Geraldo Perdomo, #2, and second baseman Ketel Marte, #4, celebrate after defeating the Chicago White Sox at Rate Field on June 24, 2025 in Chicago. Lovullo said he loves all of his players and that he is going to protect them. At the end of the day, we're human beings, and we have emotions and I saw him hurting, and I wanted to protect him." Diamondbacks shortstop Geraldo Perdomo said the fan "should be banned, for sure." "We can't continue to do that ... here in MLB." Marte declined to comment on the incident through a team official.

Idaho officials have issued an Amber Alert for two missing teens who may be heading to Utah over their "religious beliefs," according to authorities and local reports. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office believes Allen Larand Fischer, 13, and Rachelle Leray Fischer, 15, both members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FDLS), left their Monteview, Idaho, home and returned to Trenton, Utah, where they previously lived, around June 22. Their older sister, Elintra Dee Fischer, 18, was reported missing on Jan. 1, 2023. On Tuesday, the sheriff's office said that through the course of its investigation, "detectives have been unable to find concrete evidence regarding a vehicle Rachelle and Allen Fischer may have left in."

The sheriff's office said it was "unsure" at this point "if they have left the immediate area or are still close by." The children's mother, Elizabeth Roundy, spoke with FOX 13 Salt Lake City and said she used to be a plural wife, or in a polyamorous marriage, and left the FLDS church in 2020.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: This story was originally published on Monday and has been updated to reflect Andrew Cuomo conceding the mayoral primary race to Zohran Mamdani. Mamdani is a 33-year-old state assemblyman and democratic socialist who surged in the campaign for New York City mayor with a mix of viral videos and proposals appealing to younger progressives. He capitalized on progressive frustration with Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor who was attempting a political comeback with a mayoral run; in one of his videos, he explains New York City's ranked-choice voting system in Hindi and Urdu and likens Cuomo to a Bollywood villain. Mamdani is poised to become the Democratic primary winner. Mamdani's rise caused growing consternation from the Democratic establishment. His critics argue his platform is too far to the left for moderates and certain to be weaponized by local and national Republicans trying to paint the Democratic Party as out of touch. That concern was hard to find at his campaign stops before the election, notably Thursday's festival in Queens. “We've seen a campaign that is powered by the hunger of New Yorkers for a new generation of leadership,” Mamdani told CNN. Here's what to know about Mamdani and his campaign. He is an immigrant from Uganda who was first raised in Cape Town, South Africa, and later in New York City, attending the prestigious Bronx High School of Science before enrolling at Bowdoin College. He is the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, and Mira Nair, an Indian filmmaker whose credits include “Mississippi Masala” and “Monsoon Wedding.” Related article Takeaways from New York City's mayoral primary: Mamdani delivers a political earthquake Prior to his mayoral campaign, Mamdani made national headlines in 2021 when he joined New York City cab drivers on a 15-day hunger strike seeking relief from excessive debt. He also moonlighted as a rapper under the stage name Mr. Cardamom rapping about chapati, an Indian flatbread and worked as foreclosure prevention counselor. Mamdani wants to freeze the rent for nearly 1 million New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments and provide free city bus service, universal childcare and city-subsidized grocery stores. Mamdani has said he will pay for it all by raising taxes on the city's wealthiest, even though he would have little power to do so from City Hall. Taxes can be raised or lowered only by state lawmakers with approval from the governor. “This race is not just symbolic about the future of New York City, this race is symbolic about the future of our country,” Ocasio-Cortez said during a campaign rally packed with more than 2,000 supporters last week. “For so long we have had political leadership, including in the Democratic Party, that has just wanted to play it safe.” “We're really worried about all Democrats going forward if Mamdani were to win,” Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs, told reporters during the call. “Even if he doesn't win the election, if he just wins the Democratic nomination, that can hurt Democrats.” He dismisses Mamdani as an inexperienced leader with unrealistic ideas and suggests Trump would run through Mamdani like “a hot knife through butter.” “I've never had to resign in disgrace,” Mamdani said during one debate. “I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. Mamdani said he believed the phrase was about “a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights,” explaining that the US Holocaust Museum used a similar Arabic word meaning “uprising” to describe the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against the Nazis. “I have shared my opinions with New Yorkers over the course of this race, opinions that always come back to a belief in universal human rights, that means taking on antisemitism and Islamophobia,” Mamdani told CNN. Mamdani's campaign has proposed making an increase of 800% for the city's anti-hate crime program. Still, the criticism to those comments came fast and furious. Mamdani was condemned by the Holocaust Museum and some fellow Democrats for using a phrase they believe encourages violence against Jews. City Comptroller Brad Lander, who ran third in Tuesday night's primary and appeared on stage at Mamdani's party, has said he preferred Mamdani avoid the term altogether. Related article Mamdani's election night coalition: A party with Kal Penn, Ella Emhoff, hundreds of passionate and sweaty supporters “It pains me to be painted as if I am somehow to the very Jewish New Yorkers that I know and love that are such a key part of this city,” Mamdani said. He has also accused a pro-Cuomo PAC of designing a campaign mailer that featured his photo appearing to be altered to make his beard look darker and thicker next to text saying Mamdani “rejects Jewish rights.” The Cuomo campaign said it never sent out the mailer and it was made up by an independent vendor. Mamdani called the strikes ordered by Trump “a new, dark chapter in his endless series of betrayals.” “While Donald Trump bears immediate responsibility for this illegal escalation, these actions are the result of a political establishment that would rather spend trillions of dollars on weapons than lift millions out of poverty, launch endless wars while silencing calls for peace, and fearmonger about outsiders while billionaires hollow out our democracy from within,” he said in a statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani delivered a political earthquake Tuesday in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, riding progressive demands for change in a city facing an affordability crisis to the brink of a stunning victory. Democratic voters rejected a scandal-plagued icon of the party's past, former Gov. Related article Mamdani's election night coalition: A party with Kal Penn, Ella Emhoff, hundreds of passionate and sweaty supporters Mamdani's viral, go-anywhere, talk-to-anyone style of campaigning could send shockwaves through the Democratic Party nationally as its leaders and incumbents face calls from frustrated voters for authenticity and aggressiveness. Republicans, meanwhile, moved immediately to elevate Mamdani, seeing an opportunity to campaign against ideas they see as unpopular with swing voters nationally. The formal outcome won't be known until at least July 1, when New York City releases the initial ranked-choice results. But Mamdani held a clear lead Tuesday night, and Cuomo told supporters he had called Mamdani and conceded the primary. Mamdani's upstart campaign had a lot to overcome — Cuomo's universal name recognition, massive financial backing, endorsements from party leaders and unions — and he acted like it. Mamdani, though, sold his ideas as making life in the city easier to afford, building his campaign around an issue that ranks among the biggest reasons Democrats lost in the 2024 election. He engaged in cross-endorsements with rivals, encouraging supporters to rank them highly as well on their ranked-choice ballots. He campaigned aggressively, including walking the length of Manhattan on Friday. “New Yorkers deserve a Mayor they can see, hear, even yell at. Dan Pfeiffer, a former top aide to President Barack Obama, said on X that Democrats “have a lot to learn” from Mamdani. “Every vulnerable House Democrat will own him, and every Democrat running in a primary will fear him,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said. Mamdani faced attacks from pro-Cuomo forces in the primary over what his opponents described as antisemitic comments, flagging Mamdani's sharp criticism of Israel and his defense of the phrase “globalize the intifada.” He also ran on progressive positions — including freezing rents, offering free public transit, launching city-run grocery stores and more — that Republicans are certain to use to portray Democrats as extreme, much like they have with previous progressive proposals like the “Green New Deal.” Those attacks are unlikely to help the GOP in the mayoral race in New York City, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans almost by about a six-to-one margin. But New York is home to a number of competitive House seats where the GOP could seek to put Democratic nominees on the defensive over Mamdani's positions. It's too soon to sort through everything Mamdani's performance means for the Democratic Party. But it did offer a glimpse at where the party is on some key issues and who within it holds sway with voters. Related article With viral videos and buzzy spots, Zohran Mamdani crafts a Democratic blueprint Mamdani, who would become the city's first Muslim mayor if he wins in November, was a vocal critic of Israel's war in Gaza and didn't back down despite being criticized as antisemitic, a charge he repeatedly denied. He defended his views in an interview with CBS' Stephen Colbert in which he also acknowledged the fears Jewish people have faced since Hamas' October 7, 2023, terrorist attack in Israel. And what I have found also, for many New Yorkers, is an ability to navigate disagreement,” he told Colbert. He also demonstrated the influence of progressive New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed Mamdani. “Billionaires and lobbyists poured millions against you and our public finance system,” Ocasio-Cortez said of Mamdani on X. But Cuomo's campaign was backed by many prominent New York Democrats and groups, including unions and elected officials who had criticized him four years ago but — seeing his lead in the polls — issued devil-we-know statements this year endorsing him. Though ranked-choice ballots need to be counted next week, Cuomo acknowledged the reality he faced on stage Tuesday, telling supporters he had called and congratulated Mamdani. “Tonight was Assemblyman Mamdani's night, and he put together a great campaign. And he really ran a highly impactful campaign. His former political rivals, meanwhile, gloated over Cuomo's apparent failure. “Zohran ran a positive campaign talking about affordability. That just made a huge difference,” former Mayor Bill de Blasio said on CNN. In overwhelmingly Democratic New York City, a victorious Mamdani would ordinarily become the clear front-runner in November's general election. But he instead faces a competitive race with much different contours. First-term Mayor Eric Adams, who was elected as a Democrat four years ago, is seeking reelection as an independent. Adams' break from the party came as he faced backlash after President Donald Trump's Justice Department dropped its corruption charges against Adams, and Adams has cooperated with federal authorities to enforce Trump's mass deportation efforts. “What NYC deserves is a mayor who's proud to run on his record – not one who ran from his record, or one who has no record,” Adams posted on X Tuesday night. “We deserve a mayor who will keep driving down crime, support our police, fight antisemitism, and stand up for working-class New Yorkers.”</p>

While public attention has largely been focused on the Middle East and on President Donald Trump's immigration policy, Republicans in Congress are on the verge of passing massive Medicaid cuts as part of a budget bill that could lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance benefits and, according to one recent estimate, thousands of unnecessary deaths every year. The program, which covers low-income Americans of all ages, is now the country's single largest insurer, covering more than 70 million people. On Tuesday, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the number of US adults without insurance in 2024 had fallen to 27.2 million, down from 31.6 million in 2020. The GOP bill would reverse those gains and then some within a decade. According to one analysis of the House bill published last week in the Annals of Internal Medicine by a trio of Harvard-affiliated researchers, those losses of Medicaid coverage would lead to fewer Americans reporting good health, fewer patients getting preventive health screenings, and, at the end of the day, between 8,200 and 24,600 additional annual deaths. Senate Republicans are not going to adopt the House bill exactly as it is, which means any estimates of its effects are preliminary. But it appears likely GOP senators will keep at least two impactful provisions: new work requirements for many of the people on Medicaid and limits on the financing tools that the states can use to access more federal Medicaid funding. Even short of the worst-case scenario, Americans' health would be worse off under the Republican bill, according to researchers Adam Gaffney, David Himmelstein, and Steffie Woolhandler. The number of Americans who have a personal doctor would drop by 700,000 under Medicaid work requirements; 285,000 fewer people would ever get their blood cholesterol checked, and 235,000 fewer patients would ever have their blood sugar tested. And an additional 385,000 people would have to borrow money or skip paying other bills to afford their medical care. There is plenty of uncertainty in these projections. It is also hard to be sure how these policies would interact with each other: The Harvard researchers noted in their cumulative estimate of the House bill's effects that there would likely be some overlap in the policies' projected effects when combined together. Some of the people who lose their Medicaid coverage would be able to get insurance by other means, offsetting the losses to a degree that can be difficult to predict. But the takeaway from the analysis is clear: A lot of people are going to suffer if these proposals become law. Some GOP senators are reportedly open to providing additional funding for rural hospitals, to relieve the impact on the facilities that would be hardest hit by the proposed Medicaid cuts. But after Republicans narrowly failed to roll back Medicaid during Trump's first term, they seem likely to succeed this time — a step backward from building a true universal health care system. America's lack of universal health care is the main reason we spend more money than any other country in the world while seeing worse outcomes. One recent JAMA analysis found that deaths that could be prevented by accessible health care increased in the United States from 2009 to 2019, while declining in most other comparable countries. You can achieve universal health care via a variety of strategies, including the expansion of private health insurance, but the Republican bill could instead lead to more unnecessary deaths by taking existing benefits away from people, according to the Annals of Internal Medicine study. Medicaid has actually been a rare bright spot in America's often dysfunctional health care system. The program has its own problems — not enough doctors participate because of its low reimbursement rates, for one — but since its expansion through the Affordable Care Act in 2010, research has shown that Medicaid allowed more people to access health care, reduced their financial burden from medical services, and improved their physical and mental well-being. Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials justify the Medicaid cuts by saying that people who can work should be required to work in order to receive government benefits. They claim nobody who deserves to be on Medicaid will lose their coverage. So no one is getting cut.” (Undocumented migrants are already ineligible for federal Medicaid funding. But independent analysts say that most of the people on Medicaid are either children, elderly, disabled — or adults who are already working or caring for another person — meaning they are limited in their ability to work. Most of the projected coverage losses result from people having paperwork problems in documenting their work or proving they should be exempt from the requirements, not because people are actually ineligible under the new rules. That aligns with the experience of Arkansas during Trump's first term. That state tested work requirements in the real world for the first time and 18,000 people lost their health insurance in a matter of months, with no meaningful effect on their employment. The US has made halting progress in its pursuit of a better health system. But in the GOP's proposed future, the problems that have left Americans so frustrated with their health care system are going to get worse.

NEW YORK (AP) — Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday night after Andrew Cuomo conceded the race in a stunning upset, as the young, progressive upstart who was virtually unknown when the contest began built a substantial lead over the more experienced but scandal-scarred former governor. Though the race's ultimate outcome will still be decided by a ranked choice count, Mamdani took a commanding position just hours after the polls closed. With victory all but assured, Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist who ran an energetic campaign centered on the cost of living, told supporters, “I will be your Democratic nominee for the mayor of New York City.” Cuomo, who had been the front-runner throughout a race that was his comeback bid from a sexual harassment scandal, conceded the election, telling a crowd that he had called Mamdani to congratulate him. Cuomo trailed Mamdani by a significant margin in the first choice ballots and faced an exceedingly difficult pathway to catching up when ballots are redistributed in New York City's ranked choice voting process. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani takes the stage at his primary election party, Wednesday, June 25, 2025, in New York. He's running as an independent in the general election. “We are going to take a look and make some decisions,” Cuomo said. Cuomo characterized the city as a threatening, out-of-control place desperate for an experienced leader who could restore order. He brought the power of a political dynasty to the race, securing an impressive array of endorsements from important local leaders and labor groups, all while political action committees created to support his campaign pulled in staggering sums of cash. The party's progressive wing coalesced behind him and he secured endorsements from two of the country's foremost progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani arrives at the NBC studios to participate in a Democratic mayoral primary debate, Wednesday, June 4, 2025, in New York. Unofficial results from the New York City's Board of Elections showed that Mamdani was ranked on more ballots than Cuomo. And the number of votes that will factor into ranked choice voting is sure to shrink. The race's ultimate outcome could say something about what kind of leader Democrats are looking for during President Donald Trump's second term. The primary winner will go on to face incumbent Adams, a Democrat who decided to run as an independent amid a public uproar over his indictment on corruption charges and the subsequent abandonment of the case by Trump's Justice Department. Comptroller Brad Lander, a liberal city government stalwart, made a splash last week when he was arrested after linking arms with a man federal agents were trying to detain at an immigration court in Manhattan. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander is placed under arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and FBI agents outside federal immigration court on Tuesday, June 17, 2025, in New York. Among the other candidates are City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer. Mamdani's grassroots run has been hard not to notice. His army of young canvassers relentlessly knocked on doors throughout the city seeking support. Posters of his grinning mug were up on shop windows. You couldn't get on social media without seeing one of his well-produced videos pitching his vision — free buses, free child care, new apartments, a higher minimum wage and more, paid for by new taxes on rich people. That youthful energy was apparent Tuesday evening, as both cautiously optimistic canvassers and ecstatic supporters lined the streets of Central Brooklyn on a sizzling hot summer day, creating a party-like atmosphere that spread from poll sites into the surrounding neighborhoods. Outside his family's Caribbean apothecary, Amani Kojo, a 23-year-old first-time voter, passed out iced tea to Mamdani canvassers, encouraging them to stay hydrated. New York City feels alive again,” Kojo said, raising a pile of Mamdani pamphlets. Cuomo and some other Democrats have cast Mamdani as unqualified. Critics have also taken aim at Mamdani's support for Palestinian human rights. Cuomo resigned in 2021 after a report commissioned by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and Republican leaders are betting that key GOP holdouts will buckle under enormous pressure to pass his sweeping agenda within days – even as a number are warning they're prepared to sink the multi-trillion-dollar measure without major changes. With the Senate planning a critical vote to begin debate as soon as Thursday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson are both racing to quell rebellions among their centrist and right-wing factions. Behind the scenes, Johnson and his allies are in high-stakes talks with Senate GOP leaders to resolve final sticking points, while stressing to their own House members that they may ultimately need to back the Senate's version because further cross-Capitol negotiations aren't feasible, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, a move certain to cause an outcry among many in his conference. That means GOP holdouts could ultimately be left with this choice: Vote for a plan they detest or sink the bill and endure Trump's wrath. GOP leaders in both chambers are gambling their members will choose the former. But multiple House Republicans are fuming that the Senate rewrote their carefully crafted version of bill – most critically to propose deeper cuts on Medicaid – and are openly calling to blow past Trump's timeline to change it back. Plus Johnson now has at least three Republican hardliners declaring they will oppose the Senate version without even deeper spending cuts: Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland, Chip Roy of Texas and Eric Burlison of Missouri. Some are warning they won't cave – a threat GOP leaders must weigh since they can only afford three defections in each chamber to pass the bill. “If they're trying to jam us with something that we can't support, then I think we need to take those extra days to make sure it's a good product,” said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, who was one of 16 House Republicans who declared in a letter to both GOP leaders on Tuesday that they couldn't support the Senate's Medicaid provisions without major changes. She also met with Johnson about the issue on Tuesday. Malliotakis was among several GOP lawmakers who told CNN she would support a formal “conference committee” between the House and Senate – against the wishes of Trump and GOP leaders, since it would dramatically slow down the president's agenda. Even Rep. David Joyce, a close leadership ally, said he was willing to miss Trump's July 4 deadline to fight for more of the House's original provisions. “I think a good bill deserves to take its time,” the Ohio Republican told CNN. The GOP is largely united on the main tenets of the bill, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts for individuals and businesses, imposing new work requirements on social safety net programs and fulfilling the president's campaign promises like no tax on tips and overtime pay — all while providing hundreds of billions more for the Pentagon and border security agencies. But how to pay for many of those provisions has been far more contentious, including cuts to Medicaid and phasing out Biden-era energy tax credits. Meanwhile, patience is running thin in the Senate, with many Republicans eager to move on and call their House counterparts' bluff. And Trump himself is heaping pressure on Congress, posting on Truth Social on Tuesday: “Lock yourself in a room if you must, don't go home, and GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK.” Senate Republicans are particularly frustrated by the so-called SALT Caucus, the group of House Republicans in New York and California that is demanding bigger deductions on state and local tax payments. Those Republicans cut a deal with Johnson to win their support by raising the amount of state and local levies that eligible taxpayers can deduct to a $40,000 limit. Now, several of those New York Republicans say they won't accept a penny less than that number, even though Senate Republicans say they should jam the House with a less expensive deal. “I'm OK with them making crazy statements like that if they want,” said North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer, referring to the House Republicans from New York. “I hear ‘red line' a lot around here. But those House GOP lawmakers pressing for tax relief said it would be a mistake to assume that they would simply swallow whatever SALT deal the Senate passes. “I think that would be the wrong assumption,” Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican and leading proponent of the House deal, told reporters Tuesday. GOP senators are still tweaking their bill themselves and trying to navigate changes forced on them by the Senate parliamentarian's rulings that some of their provisions are out of order with strict Senate budget rules that they must follow to pass the bill along party lines. At least 20 centrist Republicans in both chambers are trying to reverse the Senate's biggest cuts to Medicaid, which were not part of the House-passed bill. But another group of GOP hardliners – including Sens. And they all met with Trump on Monday night. During a closed-door meeting Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri who has been outspoken about his concerns the bill is cutting too much into Medicaid, said North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis gave out information to senators on how much rural hospitals in states like his could lose if some of the changes the Senate rolled out went into effect. At issue are new proposed limits on how much states can tax health care providers, a levy that helps fund the Medicaid program. Some key Republicans fear that the new proposed limits could devastate Medicaid providers, especially rural hospitals, and are demanding changes. “Senate leadership now needs to fix this,” Hawley said. That will land us in a conference committee. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and a key swing vote facing reelection next year, is pushing for the bill to include a relief fund to providers hardest hit by the new cuts — potentially around $100 billion although multiple sources told CNN that the number has been extremely fluid. “I've been very concerned about the cuts in Medicaid and the impact on my state, but other states as well,” Collins told CNN on Tuesday. “I've also been concerned about the health of rural hospitals, nursing homes, health centers and have been working on a provider relief fund. Tillis, a Republican who like Collins is also up for reelection next year, said that the proposed Medicaid cuts could cost his state $38 billion over 10 years. You just have to do it at a pace that states can absorb, or we're going to have bad outcomes, political and policy.” Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican who leads the House Freedom Caucus, contended that the Senate is moving in the wrong direction, calling for deeper cuts into Medicaid and saying it should more quickly eliminate green energy tax credits enacted under the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democratic New York City Council candidate and former Rep. Anthony Weiner failed on Tuesday in his bid to return to the political scene after a career plagued by scandal. Weiner was running against a menagerie of opponents in New York's 2nd City Council district Democratic primary, including state Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, Sarah Batchu, Andrea Gordillo, and Allie Ryan. The former congressman entered politics in 1991 when he won a contested Democratic primary for the city's 48th council seat, later serving until 1998 when he won election to Congress. In May 2011, Weiner posted a sexually explicit photograph of himself on his Twitter account, saying he meant to send it to a woman who was following him. Weiner was married at the time to former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. He denied posting the image before admitting to doing so in a press conference. Weiner also said he “exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years.” Weiner would resign from Congress less than a month later and disappeared from the political spotlight until reappearing to run for mayor of New York City in 2013. Weiner would be among the front-runners until another sexting scandal tanked his campaign, ultimately leading to him finishing fifth in the race. Weiner would be investigated by the FBI in 2016 for sexting a 15-year-old from North Carolina before he surrendered to the agency and pleaded guilty to a charge of transferring obscene material to a minor. He would be released and sent to a halfway house in 2019. His 2025 candidacy was his first step back into electoral politics in years, and he pleaded with voters to give him another chance. I'm not asking for a pardon,” Weiner said last month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump says a ceasefire between Iran and Israel is in effect after the deal initially faltered leaving Trump frustrated with both sides. U.S. President Donald Trump said a ceasefire between Iran and Israel was in effect Tuesday after the deal initially faltered, and the American leader expressed deep frustration with both sides. Israel had earlier accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace after the truce was supposed to take effect. Iran is insisting that Israel broke the spirit of the ceasefire, claiming that it carried out attacks after it shouldn't have. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israel's war against Iran “brought to ruin” the country's nuclear program. He listed Israel's achievements in the war, including its attacks on top generals and nuclear scientists. A general view shows Tehran skyline, Iran Tuesday, June 24, 2025.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel appeared to hold Tuesday after initially faltering, and U.S. President Donald Trump expressed frustration with both sides, saying they had fought “for so long and so hard” that they do not know what they are doing. But even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Israel had brought Iran's nuclear program “to ruin,” a new U.S. intelligence report found that the program has been set back only a few months after U.S. strikes over the weekend, according to two people familiar with the assessment. They were not authorized to address the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. After the truce was supposed to take effect, Israel accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace, and the Israeli finance minister vowed that “Tehran will tremble.” The Iranian military denied firing on Israel, state media reported, but explosions boomed and sirens sounded across northern Israel in the morning, and an Israeli military official said two Iranian missiles were intercepted. Trump told reporters at the White House before departing for a NATO summit that, in his view, both sides had violated the nascent agreement. He had particularly strong words for Israel, a close ally, while suggesting Iran may have fired on the country by mistake. Click here for an explanation of this decision. Click here for an explanation of this decision. But later he said the deal was saved. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly “Plane Wave” to Iran. Indeed, Netanyahu's office said he held off on tougher strikes against Iran after speaking to Trump. “This proves one simple truth more clearly than ever: diplomacy and dialogue are the only path to resolving the unnecessary crisis over Iran's peaceful program,” he said. The conflict, now in its 12th day, began with Israel targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites, saying it could not allow Tehran to develop atomic weapons and that it feared the Islamic Republic was close. Iran has long maintained that its program is peaceful. Trump phoned Netanyahu after the American bombing on Sunday and told him not to expect additional U.S. military attacks and that he should seek a diplomatic solution with Iran, a senior White House official said. Trump's position was that the U.S. had removed any imminent threat posed by Iran, according to the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about sensitive diplomatic talks and spoke on condition of anonymity. China, which is Iran's largest trading partner and only remaining oil customer, condemned the U.S. attacks and said it was concerned about a “spiral of escalations” without a ceasefire. Trump suggested the ceasefire would allow Iranian oil to continue to flow, saying on social media that China could keep purchasing crude from Iran. An Israeli military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations said Iran launched two missiles at Israel hours into the tenuous ceasefire. One of those attacks killed a high-profile nuclear scientist, Mohammad Reza Sedighi Saber, at his father-in-law's residence in northern Iran, Iranian state TV reported. He said both sides had violated the agreement and used an expletive to hammer home his point. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f—- they're doing,” he said. Netanyahu said Israel agreed to the ceasefire with Iran, in coordination with Trump, after the country achieved all of its war goals, including removing the threat of Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. It's unclear what role Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's leader, played in the talks. Trump said Tuesday that he wasn't seeking regime change in Iran, two days after floating the idea himself in a social media post. “I don't want it,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that the U.S. and Iran are already in early discussions about resuming negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. He called the direct talks and discussions through intermediaries “promising.” Police said they damaged at least three densely packed residential buildings in the city of Beersheba. First responders said they retrieved four bodies from one building and were searching for more. Police said some people were injured while inside their apartments' reinforced safe rooms, which are meant to withstand rockets but not direct hits from ballistic missiles. The attack followed a limited Iranian missile assault Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar in retaliation for earlier American bombing of its nuclear sites. The U.S. was warned by Iran in advance, and there were no casualties. Elsewhere, U.S. forces shot down drones attacking the Ain al-Assad base in the desert in western Iraq and a base next to the Baghdad airport, while another one crashed, according to a senior U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. Some Iran-backed Iraqi militias had previously threatened to target U.S. bases if the U.S. attacked Iran. Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 974 people and wounded 3,458 others, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists. The group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from Iranian unrest, said of those killed, it identified 387 civilians and 268 security force personnel. The U.S. has evacuated some 250 American citizens and their immediate family members from Israel by government, military and charter flights that began over the weekend, a State Department official said.</p>
