                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was treated for dehydration at a Washington area hospital Wednesday, his office said. "Leader Schumer was at the Senate gym this morning and got lightheaded," said a spokesperson for the 74-year-old Democratic leader. "Out of an abundance of caution, he went to the hospital to be treated for dehydration and is now back at work in the Capitol. He wants to remind everyone to drink some water and stay out of the heat," the spokesperson said in a statement. Schumer was absent Wednesday morning from a press conference that he was scheduled to lead. Senate Democrats are mounting an opposition to the massive Republican reconciliation bill that President Donald Trump is pushing the GOP to pass through Congress. Schumer said in an X post that he spoke Wednesday morning with Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayoral candidate who is poised to become the Democratic nominee after taking a commanding lead in the first round of ranked-choice voting Tuesday night. A spokeswoman for Schumer did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for additional information about the senator's health incident. We want to hear from you.

The US government designated three Mexican financial firms as potential money launderers tied to illicit opioid trafficking, as it seeks to clamp down on cartel financing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ARLINGTON, Texas — Southwest Airlines is considering airport lounges, more premium seating and even long-haul international flights to win over high-spending customers, CEO Bob Jordan said Wednesday. "Whatever customers need in 2025, 2030, we won't take any of that off the table. We'll do it the Southwest way but we're not going to say 'We would never do that,'" Jordan said in an interview with CNBC at an airport industry conference. "We know we send customers to other airlines because there's some things you might want that you can't get on us. Southwest is in the middle of a transformation. That has included undoing some of its policies like open seating, a uniform cabin and allowing all customers to check two bags for free, things that had set it apart from rivals in much of its 54 years of flying. But it has faced pressure from competitors, and an activist investor last year pushed the carrier to increase revenue. Southwest and other carriers pulled their 2025 forecasts earlier this year, citing economic uncertainty. Jordan said Wednesday that the airline is continuing to see cheaper fares. "The summer is generally never on sale, and the summer is heavily on sale right now," he said. Despite making major changes to its business model, Jordan said the carrier hasn't seen customers defect to other airlines since it introduced no-frills basic economy tickets and bag fees late last month, policies rivals already had. But making changes at the high end is important, too, he said. Competitors like Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines have added more luxury tourism destinations and roomier, more expensive seats, and they've also invested heavily in airport lounges. For example, earlier Wednesday, American unveiled plans to nearly double its lounge space at its Miami International Airport hub. Jordan said it's "way too soon to put any specifics" on potential changes, but he called out Southwest stronghold Nashville International Airport — where the airline has a more than 50% market share, according to airport data — as a place where customers are hungry for luxury. But getting those things means those customers have to book on another airline, which could make them more likely to add that rival's co-branded credit card to their wallets, too, he said. Jordan said it's also too early to say whether Southwest will make the shift to buying longer-haul aircraft, which it would need to go to Europe; it's relied on the Boeing 737 for more than half a century. Southwest has been forging international partnerships — Icelandair and China Airlines, so far— but a Southwest plane landing in Europe at some point is on the table, he said. "No commitment, but you can certainly see a day when we are as Southwest Airlines serving long-haul destinations like Europe," he said. In the nearer term, Southwest is still awaiting deliveries of Boeing 737 Max 7s, the smallest plane in the Max family, which still hasn't won Federal Aviation Administration certification. Jordan said the manufacturer has made progress with more consistent deliveries recently, but Southwest doesn't expect to fly the Max 7 in 2026.

Kalshi Inc., a prediction market that competes with Polymarket, said it has raised $185 million at a valuation of $2 billion. Paradigm, a venture capital firm focused on cryptocurrency investments, is leading the deal.

Kalshi is similar to Polymarket, which also is completing an investment at a valuation of more than $1 billion. While Kalshi is federally regulated and cleared to operate in the US, Polymarket is not registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and its service is banned for Americans. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia shares rose nearly 3% on Wednesday and headed for a record close for the first time since January, as investors gain confidence that the company's leadership in artificial intelligence won't be dampened by Chinese export controls. Nvidia is now worth $3.7 trillion, making it the largest company in the world by market cap, slightly beating out Microsoft, one of its main customers. Apple is third at about $3 trillion. While Nvidia remains the clear leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) that are being used to build large language models and run AI workloads, the strength of this year's rally is surprising given that the company has said it's locked out of the world's second-biggest economy. In April, the Trump administration issued new rules that cut off sales of the company's H20 AI processor that had been developed to meet prior restrictions. Nvidia said last month that the change instituted by the U.S. government would cost the company $8 billion in sales, and that it had to write off $4.5 billion in inventory. Now, Nvidia isn't counting on any sales from China. "The $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last month. And there's another forthcoming rule that will expand export restrictions on AI chips, Trump administration officials previously said. For the full fiscal year, analysts are expecting 53% revenue growth to almost $200 billion, according to LSEG. Nvidia is holding its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shell pushed back Wednesday on reports that is in talks to buy rival BP. People familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal that Shell was in early-stage talks to acquire BP, though a deal was far from certain. BP shares jumped more than 10% to a session high of $32.94 on the report. Shell, however, subsequently denied talks were talking place. No talks are taking place," a Shell spokesperson told CNBC. "As we have said many times before we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification." It is unlikely Shell would purchase the entirety of BP, people familiar with the matter told CNBC's Brian Sullivan. It is more likely that BP would be split and sold in pieces to multiple companies if a deal did transpire, the people said. BP has as underperformed Shell and U.S. rivals as it has struggled to find direction in recent years, fueling speculation that the British oil major is an acquisition target. BP set ambitious goals five years ago to slash carbon dioxide emissions and invest in renewable energy. But its green pivot came under scrutiny as profits faltered. BP announced a strategic reset earlier this year, doubling down on oil and gas while slashing spending on renewables. Activist investor Elliott Management disclosed in April that it has built a stake of more than 5% in BP, fueling speculation that the oil major would come under pressure to focus on its core fossil fuel business.
