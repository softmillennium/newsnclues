                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The future Emmy winner had her life all laid out to her by a man using colorful phrases. Mariska Hargitay made an arresting visit to the Call Her Daddy podcast this week, speaking about her new documentary portrait of her mother Jayne Mansfield, My Mom Jayne, as well as her work on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, which she's been on, in her words, "since 1926." At the beginning of her career, Hargitay was fairly certain her path was in comedy — not playing a detective for 26 seasons — and she felt pretty entrenched in Los Angeles, living in a large house with several friends. But a visit to the East Coast indicated that her life was about to change. I was 34, and I come to New York, and a friend of mine said, 'You have to go to this psychic on Long Island.' I didn't even know where Long Island was," Hargitay recalled. She continued, "So I drive out to this guy's house on Long Island, and he gives me a psychic reading. And because my mom was famous, I was like, you are just probably gonna Google me, you know, Jayne Mansfield's daughter, and then come up with some bulls---. So I sit down with this guy and he says, 'You see that face?' I have this on [a] recording. And he says, this is my favorite thing I think anyone's ever said to me. He goes like this: 'I don't give a rat's ass what you think.'" Continuing, the psychic said, "'You're gonna be famous for that face.' I was living in a house with, like, 32 roommates because I had this house and it had five rooms. Not an episode, but the whole season because I had so many roommates. Then the punchline: "Swear to God, six months later, I got SVU."

And since that time, she has been a New York City staple — unable to walk to the bagel store without people giving her hugs and telling the woman who plays Detective Olivia Benson all about their personal struggles. Importantly, however, is the phrase rat's ass. "He said, 'I don't give a rat's ass'," Hargitay repeated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anyone see anything they can't explain? A resident living in New York's upper Hudson Valley reported a strange site flying in the sky late Saturday night. New York has a long history with unidentified flying objects, as the state ranks 5th overall for sightings across the United States. It's no secret New York, particularly the state's Hudson Valley area, has a long history with unexplained flying phenomena and other strange sightings. As stated many times, these observations of so-called UFOs can easily be explained as drones, military planes, communication satellites, or even a meteor burning up in the upper atmosphere, though. A resident living in Climax, New York reported to the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting center that they witnessed an object traveling at a hypersonic rate of speed the night of June 21. The report describes what they allegedly saw as "orbs seen through cloud cover at incredible speeds." See Also: Resident in New York's Hudson Valley Reports 'Truly Anomalous' Lights On Multiple Nights The witness say that for about an hour they saw two white orbs "through thick cloud cover", flying across the sky at an extremely fast rate of speed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chuck Russell, the director behind The Blob and A Nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Warriors, is summoning some serious occult energy in his return to horror with Witchboard, a reimagining of the 1986 cult favorite. The first trailer has dropped, and it's packed with eerie imagery, ritualistic vibes, and a whole lot of supernatural mayhem. Set in modern-day New Orleans, Witchboard follows a young couple who unwittingly unlock something ancient and malevolent after discovering a cursed pendulum board in their newly-renovated French Quarter café. What begins as a dream venture quickly spirals into a nightmare of possession, temptation, and full-blown occult terror. Madison Iseman (I Know What You Did Last Summer) leads the cast as Emily, alongside Aaron Dominguez (Only Murders in the Building), Antonia Desplat (Shantaram), and Charlie Tahan (Ozark). Also along for the ride is Stranger Things star Jamie Campbell Bower. I've been keeping an eye out for that over the course of my career, and I wanted to do something even scarier and more imaginative. I wanted to top my other two horror films,” he said. It's fun in that regard, but number one is to scare the hell out of people, and I think we've done that, too.” There's a dreamlike terror to the imagery, flashes of fire-lit rituals, warped bodies, and distorted realities that suggest Witchboard is tapping into something deeply unhinged. The film is set to hit theaters August 15, 2025, All names, trademarks and images are copyright their respective owners.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A coronal hole in the sun could result in visible auroras over about 15 U.S. states tonight (June 25), with the Space Weather Prediction Center expecting a moderate geomagnetic storm. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A "hole" in the sun is sending a high-speed stream of charged particles toward our planet, which could make dancing auroras visible from about 15 U.S. states tonight (June 25). "The aurora may become visible over some northern and upper Midwest states from New York to Idaho," representatives for the Space Weather Prediction Center wrote in an update. If skywaters are treated to a northern lights display tonight, it will be thanks to a coronal hole in the sun's atmosphere. These less-dense areas of the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, enable streams of charged particles, or solar wind, to escape into space at high speeds. When these high-speed streams collide with Earth, they can increase geomagnetic activity, which produces auroras. Storms of a G2 magnitude aren't rare but can produce strong auroras. The U.K.'s Met Office has forecast minor to moderate (G1 to G2) geomagnetic storms on Wednesday, though it noted that a strong G3 storm can't be ruled out. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Auroras occur in the sky when charged particles from the sun hit Earth's upper atmosphere, colliding with oxygen and nitrogen particles. These particles then glow different colors as they shed energy from the collision, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. —NASA's daredevil solar spacecraft survives 2nd close flyby of our sun However, they are tricky to predict, and there's no guarantee that people living in northern states will be able to see anything on the northern horizon. Geomagnetic activity is expected to drop after tonight, with a minor G1 storm forecast for Thursday (June 26), according to the Space Weather Prediction Center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It may be hard to believe, but Jensen Ackles can be called a TV veteran since he has been entertaining TV viewers for nearly 30 years. He first grabbed viewers' attention in 1997 as teen Eric Brady on NBC daytime soap Days of Our Lives before chasing demons alongside Jared Padalecki on The CW's Supernatural for 15 years. Since then, he's appeared on ABC's Big Sky, CBS' Tracker, and as superhero Soldier Boy on The Boys (a role he'll reprise for the Prime Video show's fifth and final season). He also found time behind the camera by directing six Supernatural episodes, an episode of Padalecki's Walker, as well as executive-produce and narrate the short-lived Supernatural spin-off The Winchesters. On the series, a Department of Homeland Security agent is suddenly murdered, so a special task force is created with Meachum and others from different arms of law enforcement. However, that murder investigation leads them to bigger threats that has the potential of destroying Los Angeles. Jessica Camacho, Uli Latukefu, Violett Beane, Elliot Knight, and Grey's Anatomy and Euphoria star Eric Dane round out the cast. Here, Ackles tells us more about why Countdown appealed to him, that surprising TV face we saw in the opening of the series, as well as an update on the Supernatural reunion with Padalecki and Misha Collins on The Boys. Gold Derby: You were looking for something to do under your new Amazon deal, so what was it about Countdown that just seemed like the right thing to start with? Jensen Ackles: Derek Haas [Countdown creator, showrunner, and executive producer], largely. He and I had a couple conversations and then I flew out to L.A., we had lunch, and there was just an instant kind of connection there. Obviously, his resume and pedigree speaks for itself. The guy is well versed in storytelling and character-building and also doing broadcast, which I come from as well. Since Supernatural, I didn't think it would ever get that fun again. This was some of the most enjoyable days on set I have had in my life. I hope that the chemistry off-screen translated onscreen. I believe it did and I hope we get to do it for many more years. How would you describe this guy in your words? He's a inherently good guy that has just been dealt a really, really bad hand. He could have gone the bad route and been a drug dealer or a drug runner or working for the bad guys very easily, which is probably why he did so well undercover. He can relate to these guys more so than somebody who grew up in white-collar America and had loving parents. It's an internal battle, so he fights throughout the series. The fact that he's got this terrible diagnosis — again, he's been dealt a bad hand — but instead of opting to just cash in and be like, "I'm done. We learn of Meachum's health issues in the first episode. Can you clarify what he is actually dealing with? And that was one of the great things that Derek wrote in — this guy is not just a maverick. He's not just a cool guy with sunglasses and smoking cigarettes. Do you know Den of Thieves with Gerard Butler? I'll watch those movies all day. Seeing Milo Ventimiglia in the opening was a big surprise since that has been kept under wraps. I don't know if this is out of the purview of what we should talk about, but that whole thing was filmed with another actor and who did a great job, but they brought him in as a guest star and they shot that whole sequence. Then, I think once they got into the editing room, they were like, "This feel like it needs to be a familiar face." So it's a testament to the Amazon team and a testament to Derek and Jonathan Brown, who directed the first episode and [is] also our producing director, since they were like, "The stakes need to be heightened here because this sets the whole show on its journey." I sent Milo a text and was like, "Bro!" So he came for a costume fitting, but he came to set to say hi. I hadn't seen Milo in maybe a year or two, but we go way back, obviously. It was really good to see him and I was just giddy that he came on. It's too bad his character dies so quickly in the opening! I was already pitching, "Can we do some flashbacks where Milo comes in and we actually know each other?" Derek was like, "Let me do the writing." We find out Meachum may not be the best at romantic relationships since his fellow task force member, DEA agent Amber Oliveros (Camacho), knows his former fiancée. Is there some romantic tension between Meachum and Oliveros that we may see develop over the first season? That is definitely an intentional situation there, but instead of Meachum trying to win her over, he's more like, "I don't need to deal with that. I'm just gonna stay in my lane." But they are partnered up effectively, so you get a bit of a buddy comedy. And Jess just brought it all to the table and did a fantastic job of bringing a really strong character and somebody who's not gonna placate to Meachum at all. That relationship needs that friction, and it will be kind of your classic "will they or won't they?" You directed on Supernatural and Walker, so any chance we're seeing you in the director's chair at all in Season 1? I would absolutely love to direct at some point. Vanessa Joy [Smith], who's our director of photography, is one of the best I've ever worked with in my life. [She] and her crew are just amazing. She did all five seasons of Mayans M.C. and she is an absolute joy. I mean, it's right in her name! So, yeah, if your DP is of that caliber, it's hard for a director to really fail. You're working with Jensen and Misha on The Boys. How would you describe working again with them? We already shot it, and it was like three brothers coming together to have dinner at somebody else's house. It was like, "All right, listen, Mom's not here, but we've got to clear our plates at the end. Everybody just mind your p's and q's. Your email address will not be published.

Lola Amour: courtesy of @lolaamourmusic, photographed by Renzo Navarro PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE: courtesy of @psyfe_official On June 24, 2025 (Tuesday), Japanese boy group PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE — or simply, PSYCHIC FEVER — posted a short video on their social media, which sees members KOKORO and REN covering a short snippet of Lola Amour's 2023 track “Raining In Manila.” It sees them singing the song's chorus, with KOKORO covering the main lines while REN provides backing vocals. Notably, a few days before this on June 21, 2025 (Saturday), Lola Amour also posted a short video on their own social media accounts, which sees the the Filipino funk-pop band covering PSYCHIC FEVER's summer hit “Gelato.” Jokingly referred to by the band as a result of them having “five hours to kill before a show,” the cover sees Lola Amour put their signature laid-back, brass-infused spin on the track. It served as the first single from their self-titled debut album, which came out last April 10, 2024. Meanwhile, PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE's “Gelato” came out last May 15, 2025. It is the lead track from the seven-piece group's latest EP, entitled PSYCHIC FILE III, which was released on May 30.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kate Shemirani's daughter, Paloma, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer. Despite doctors informing her that she had an 80 percent chance of survival with chemotherapy, Paloma refused treatment and instead opted for alternative therapies, reportedly under her mother's influence. In a June 23 interview with BBC Panorama, Paloma's brothers, Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani, blamed their mother Kate's anti-medicine conspiracy theories for her death. They said that Kate's influence led Paloma to reject chemotherapy and medical treatment. Kate Shemirani is a former nurse whose registration was cancelled reportedly due to promoting misinformation about Covid-19. Paloma's elder brother Sebastian said: “My sister has passed away as a direct consequence of my mum's actions and beliefs and I don't want anyone else to go through the same pain or loss that I have.” The brothers alleged that their mother texted Paloma's boyfriend, Ander, saying, "TELL PALOMA NOT TO SIGN [OR] VERBALLY CONSENT TO CHEMO OR ANY TREATMENT". “I wasn't able to stop my sister from dying. But it would mean the world to me if I could make it that she wasn't just another in a long line of people that die in this way,” Gabriel said. According to her sons, Kate's anti-medicine views were accelerated in 2012, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She and her ex-husband, Faramarz Shemirani, reportedly said they have evidence that Paloma died due to medical interventions without a confirmed diagnosis or lawful consent. However, the BBC reported it had seen no evidence to support these claims. Paloma's death highlights that it's essential to rely on credible sources and consult with healthcare professionals for accurate information about cancer. Always seek the advice of your doctor with any questions about a medical condition.</p>
