                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The staff break rooms within federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health may soon get a lot less interesting. Per Axios, the total contract cuts amount to millions worth of funding for Springer Nature. According to data compiled via USA Spending, the open data source of federal spending information, Springer Nature currently has 19 active contracts with federal agencies, including a $5.2 million contract to provide subscriptions to the company's portfolios of journals. Springer Nature declined to comment when contacted by Gizmodo. Trump's attack on Springer shouldn't come as too much of a shock. Earlier this year, the Department of Justice sent letters to medical journals for being “partisan” in the eyes of the administration, in part for promoting “woke” science, like saying climate change is real or that trans people exist. Prior reports indicated that CHEST, a peer-reviewed publication on pulmonary care published by the American College of Chest Physicians, as well as several other publications, received threatening letters accusing them of publishing work influenced by “advertisement (under postal code) or sponsorship (under relevant fraud regulations).” Around the same time, Donald Trump Jr. called for the Department of Government Efficiency to end contracts with Springer Nature because it “pushed gender insanity.” In 2017, the company was accused of restricting access to some research in China, and has issued tons of retractions of research in recent years due to issues with its peer-review process. For what it's worth, most of those threatening letters from the DOJ were signed by then US Attorney Ed Martin, who also threatened to investigate people who criticized Elon Musk and threatened to pull Wikipedia's nonprofit status. Martin resigned from that role last month (and handed over the reins to Fox News host Jeanine Pirro of all people). Not much has come from those threats thus far, though they undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the publishers that received them, as any legal challenge from the government would surely be drawn out and expensive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest artificial intelligence models are not only remarkably good at software engineering—new research shows they are getting ever-better at finding bugs in software, too. AI researchers at UC Berkeley tested how well the latest AI models and agents could find vulnerabilities in 188 large open source codebases. “Many of these vulnerabilities are critical,” says Dawn Song, a professor at UC Berkeley who led the work. Many experts expect AI models to become formidable cybersecurity weapons. An AI tool from startup Xbow currently has crept up the ranks of HackerOne's leaderboard for bug hunting and currently sits in top place. This could help companies keep their software safe but may also aid hackers in breaking into systems. “We didn't even try that hard,” Song says. The UC Berkeley team tested conventional frontier AI models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, as well as open source offerings from Meta, DeepSeek, and Alibaba combined with several agents for finding bugs, including OpenHands, Cybench, and EnIGMA. They then fed the descriptions to the cybersecurity agents powered by frontier AI models to see if they could identify the same flaws for themselves by analyzing new codebases, running tests, and crafting proof-of-concept exploits. The work adds to growing evidence that AI can automate the discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities, which are potentially dangerous (and valuable) because they may provide a way to hack live systems. AI seems destined to become an important part of the cybersecurity industry nonetheless. Security expert Sean Heelan recently discovered a zero-day flaw in the widely used Linux kernel with help from OpenAI's reasoning model o3. “Don't replace your human bug hunters yet,” Moussouris says. Moussouris says she is less worried about AI hacking software than companies investing too much in AI at the expense of other techniques. Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, an associate professor at New York University Tandon and a researcher at Xbow, says the new work shows realistic zero-day discovery across a relatively large amount of code using a wide range of AI-powered tasks. Dolan-Gavitt says he expects AI to drive an uptick in attacks involving zero-day exploits. “That's rare right now, because there are very few people who have the expertise to find new vulnerabilities and build exploits for them,” he says. Smith adds that as it becomes possible for more people to discover vulnerabilities with AI it will be more important to ensure that those vulnerabilities are disclosed responsibly. In work posted online in May, Song and other researchers measured the capacity for AI models to find bugs that earned cash payouts through bug-bounty rewards. Claude Code, from Anthropic, was most successful, finding bugs worth $1,350 on bug bounty boards and designing patches for vulnerabilities worth $13,862 for a cost of a few hundred dollars in API calls. This could make it especially important to closely track how capable these tools are becoming. To this end, Song and other researchers have also established the AI Frontiers CyberSecurity Observatory, a collaborative effort that will track the capabilities of different AI models and tools through several benchmarks. Among all the AI risk domains, cybersecurity is going to be one of the first that could become a major problem, Song says. How do you feel about using AI tools to test software vulnerabilities?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since it began its science operations in July 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has been probing the atmospheres of alien planets to study their potential for habitability. For the first time, however, Webb has discovered its own exoplanet, finding a young system hidden in a swirling cloud of dust and debris. Webb has captured a previously unseen exoplanet, the lightest planet imaged so far—an accomplishment made possible by the space-based telescope's advanced capabilities. The recent discovery, detailed in a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, marks Webb's first discovery of an exoplanet and opens up a new window into hidden, Saturn-like worlds. “The planets are much fainter by orders of magnitudes than their parent stars, and seen from Earth or from JWST, they are angularly very close to them,” Anne-Marie Lagrange, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and lead author of the paper, told Gizmodo. “Hence, when looking at a planet we see only the star.” In order to overcome this issue, the team behind the new discovery used a coronagraph—a telescopic attachment for Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument. The system, named TWA 7, has three distinct rings, one of which is especially narrow while being surrounded by two areas that hold almost no matter. The newly discovered exoplanet, dubbed TWA 7b, is more massive than Neptune but around 30% less massive than Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system. “It is also the first planet explaining gaps in a disk,” Lagrange said. “It is unique to explain disk-planet interactions during the early phases of planetary systems.” Planets form from the material leftover from the birth of a star, which create a swirling disk of matter. Previous observations of these protoplanetary disks has revealed ring-like structures and gaps, which were believed to be signatures of unseen planets. So far, there were no direct observations of those planets. By using Webb to observe young, faint planets, scientists have unlocked a new doorway into the discovery of alien worlds. “In terms of imaging, it opens the possibility to image Saturn-like planets. In further steps, it will allow us to characterize the atmosphere of Saturn-like, non irradiated planets,” Lagrange said. It helps us knowing what is complicated when searching for very light planets.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But we still didn't know what all those 3 billion genetic letters actually do. Now Google's DeepMind division says it's made a leap in trying to understand the code with AlphaGenome, an AI model that predicts what effects small changes in DNA will have on an array of molecular processes, such as whether a gene's activity will go up or down. It's just the sort of question biologists regularly assess in lab experiments. “We have, for the first time, created a single model that unifies many different challenges that come with understanding the genome,” says Pushmeet Kohli, a vice president for research at DeepMind. AlphaGenome is an attempt to further smooth biologists' work by answering basic questions about how changing DNA letters alters gene activity and, eventually, how genetic mutations affect our health. “We have these 3 billion letters of DNA that make up a human genome, but every person is slightly different, and we don't fully understand what those differences do,” says Caleb Lareau, a computational biologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who has had early access to AlphaGenome. Lareau says AlphaGenome will allow certain types of experiments now done in the lab to be carried out virtually, on a computer. For instance, studies of people who've donated their DNA for research often turn up thousands of genetic differences, each slightly raising or lowering the chance a person gets a disease such as Alzheimer's. Lareau says DeepMind's software could be used to quickly make predictions about how each of those variants works at a molecular level, something that would otherwise require time-consuming lab experiments. “You'll get this list of gene variants, but then I want to understand which of those are actually doing something, and where can I intervene,” he says. “This system pushes us closer to a good first guess about what any variant will be doing when we observe it in a human.” Don't expect AlphaGenome to predict very much about individual people, however. “We haven't designed or validated AlphaGenome for personal genome prediction, a known challenge for AI models,” Google said in a statement. This one was trained on troves of experimental data produced by public scientific projects. AlphaGenome could suggest which of those mutations are really causing the root problem, possibly pointing to a treatment. “This type of tool is instrumental in narrowing down which ones mess up proper gene expression.” The same approach could apply to patients with rare genetic disease, many of whom never learn the source of their condition, even if their DNA has been decoded. He thinks AlphaGenome could give medical scientists a new way to diagnose such cases. Others think the models will be used to create a fully virtual laboratory for drug studies. “My dream would be to simulate a virtual cell,” Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, said this year. Kohli calls AlphaGenome a “milestone” on the road to that kind of system. “AlphaGenome may not model the whole cell in its entirety … but it's starting to sort of shed light on the broader semantics of DNA,” he says. Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

A significant security exploit in WinRAR, the popular file archiver software, was recently reported via Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative. The directory traversal vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-6218 is said to take advantage of how a file compression tool handles directory paths within archive files, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by creating and distributing malicious archives. Discovered by independent researcher ‘whs3-detonator,' the vulnerability allows an attacker to run harmful code on a victim's computer. By doing so, they can trick the software to place files outside the intended folder, allowing potential access to restricted system directories. Meaning this vulnerability poses a high risk to confidentiality, as it can expose sensitive data, manipulate system files, and even make a system completely unusable. Given its massive user base of over 500 million users worldwide, WinRAR vulnerabilities are frequently targeted and exploited by a wide range of threat actors.

Intel has begun cutting jobs in California as part of its cost-cutting and restructuring strategy introduced by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The move comes two months after Tan warned that staff reductions were unavoidable and that 15% - 20% of the company's staff would be laid off. Officially, Intel is eliminating excessive management layers, but a CRN report indicates that the company is surprisingly laying off chip design engineers and architects. Additionally, the company is shutting down its automotive chip division, according to Oregon Live. Among the job categories being eliminated are 22 physical design engineers, three physical design engineering managers, and several logic and product development engineers. The company is also removing roles such as cloud software architects and engineering managers, in addition to positions tied to business and project management, including a vice president of IT and multiple technology strategy leads. The filing complies with California's WARN Act, which requires disclosure when 50 or more workers are affected within a 30-day period. The layoffs are scheduled to begin on July 15. Impacted employees have been given either a 60-day notice or a shorter four-week notice, paired with nine weeks of compensation and benefits. Intel is also exiting the automotive chip market. Intel's automotive business is based in Munich, Germany, leveraging its proximity to major European automakers and suppliers. To succeed in developing platforms for software-defined vehicles, Intel's automotive unit had autonomy over product strategy and customer engagement. Most employees in that unit are expected to lose their jobs as the company shifts focus to its core offerings in client and data center solutions. In an internal communication from April, Tan highlighted a shift in performance measurement, criticizing a past practice where leadership success was tied to the size of one's team. He stated that going forward, efficiency and impact with smaller teams will be Intel's way of operation. "I have been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams," Lip-Bu Tan wrote in a letter to employees back in April. "Going forward, this will not be the case. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities." Tan emphasized that leadership would be responsible for determining how best to align personnel changes with the company's strategic priorities, which include laying off 15% to 20% of its personnel.

Users can save any item to a collection they create or refine their search by typing in the chatbot on the left-hand side. The web app also shows you daily inspiration for items and accessories that possibly match your taste. The startup is taking a percentage cut out of each sale. Bornstein, who has held executive positions at companies like Nordstrom, Urban Outfitters, Sephora, and Stitch Fix, said that in the past year, the company was working on technology to bring a catalog of different brands to one place and revamp search to suit AI. And even with my prior startup, we couldn't get people to go beyond something like ‘a red dress, ‘” Bornstien told TechCrunch over a call. And so what we're trying to do is help allow you to ask whatever it is you wanna ask, whether it's I have an occasion, or I have this need, or I'm looking for this very specific kind of thing,” she said. She said that traditional search only showed shoppers items based on tags matching their keywords, which doesn't work in today's world, where customers are asking longer queries. We are also using image visual recognition to satisfy detailed queries where a customer describes the exact product they want,” Belousova said. Over the next year, Daydream will allow users to give the tool more explicit feedback, like “Don't show me any four-inch heels.” It also plans to experiment with a feature that will allow users to ask for a good match with an existing item with personalized suggestions. Plus, it wants to lean into the aspect of social sharing by letting users share their saved items with friends and family for suggestions to buy. Another feature that Daydream is thinking about is to take an existing collection of another user and modify it for their own needs using AI. While Daydream's team has years of e-commerce experience and focuses on fashion, startups like Deft and Cherry are also building multimodal search for shopping. Meanwhile, tech giants like Amazon and Google are focusing on features that use AI to search multiple sites and find the right item for users.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Satellites can accomplish incredible tasks like provide internet, or help monitor wildfires. But many of them ultimately meet a fiery death burning up in the Earth's atmosphere. A new startup called Lux Aeterna wants to change this. The Denver-based company, which is coming out of stealth today, has designed a reusable satellite called Delphi that it aims to launch — and land — in 2027. If successful, it could help slash the cost to get satellite payloads into space. It would also make the process far more flexible than it is today, since satellites are designed to stay in orbit for years and essentially can't be modified for other uses. The startup's pitch was attractive enough to generate $4 million in pre-seed funding, led by Space Capital and including other early-stage funds like Dynamo Ventures and Mission One Capital. Founder and CEO Brian Taylor said the idea for Lux Aeterna came to him last year while he watched his former employer, SpaceX, launch one of its Starship test vehicles into space. As part of that, it has the potential to send larger payloads into space than was previously possible. Size matters for people who build satellites and other spacecraft, since they're often working backwards from the simple constraint of what can fit inside a rocket's cargo area. And Starship is not alone — there are other heavy-lift rockets in the works, too, like Blue Origin's New Glenn. But with the extra space afforded by heavy-lift rockets, Taylor said it's possible to build one that can survive multiple re-entries without having to compromise on the technology because of cost or weight tradeoffs. In the case of Lux Aeterna, that means using a heat shield. There's a reason for that, according to Taylor: Those designs worked. “We definitely looked at what NASA had done in the past on exploratory missions [and] sample return missions, and that really helped justify the architecture that we've gone with,” he said. Taylor declined to get into further specifics about how the Delphi satellite will work, or how Lux Aeterna will refurbish the craft between launches. To be sure, he has plenty of experience in the satellite world. The plan for Delphi is to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2027, perform a full orbital flight, and then come back down to Earth. From there, Taylor said his team is working on a larger production vehicle that will demonstrate far greater reusability. Despite decades of spaceflight innovation, Taylor said he believes the industry is still very young, which leaves plenty of opportunity for a company like Lux Aeterna to establish a long-running business.

We already saw a bunch of key announcements at CES in January, but now that the full spec is here, it's confirmed that HDMI 2.2 will eclipse DisplayPort in maximum bandwidth support thanks to the new Ultra96 cables. In order to ensure a consistent experience across all HDMI 2.2 devices, you'll be seeing new HDMI cables with an "Ultra96" label denoting the aforementioned transfer rate capability. These cables will be certified by the HDMI Forum with clear branding that should make them easy to identify. That being said, you can expect 4K 240 Hz at up to 12-bit color depth without any compression. DisplayPort 2.1b UHBR 20 was the first to do this with some monitors already available on the market, but that standard is limited to only 80 GB/s and HDMI 2.2 edges it by just a bit, which allows for even uncompressed 8K at 60 Hz. It's important to keep in mind that only cables explicitly labeled Ultra96 can allow for all this video goodness. Thankfully, though, if you don't care about the super high resolutions or frame rates, HDMI 2.2 will be backwards compatible. That means you can use the new cables with older ports (or new ports with older cables) and get the lowest common denominator experience. Apart from backwards compatibility, HDMI 2.2 will bring another comfort feature called "Latency Indication Protocol" (LIP) that will help with syncing audio and video together. This only really matters for large, complicated home theater setups incorporating a lot of speaker channels with receivers and projectors (or screens). Little is known about the next-gen Radeon cards, but an earlier leak pointed to limited HDMI 2.2 support for UDNA that would restrict the maximum bandwidth on most models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you think of space exploration and watches, one name immediately comes to mind: Omega. Since its Speedmaster chronograph was selected by NASA half a century ago it has become synonymous with space travel. Now, with private spaceflight proliferating and manned missions to the Moon back on NASA's agenda, a Californian start-up wants to establish a new standard for space watches. Barrelhand, whose watches draw on expertise in 3D printing and materials science, says that its Monolith will be the only watch purpose-built for space exploration. “Space is the harshest environment we've ever gone to,” says founder Karel Bachand. NASA just tried to find off-the-shelf watches that were the best available. Bachand says that even during testing, NASA's engineers flagged that the Speedmaster's accuracy suffered under extreme temperatures or acceleration, and there were other known issues, too. There are tons of opportunities for improvements, but in the last 50 years, there's been no innovation, especially for such a key tool that's life or death in space exploration.” The liquid crystal display would essentially freeze up on a spacewalk. You need mechanical performance; something that can keep track of time when all other systems fail.” A mechanical watch has no such trouble, but needs to be able to function in a more extreme range of temperatures than it would ever face on earth. The Monolith case is 3D printed from an alloy of scandium, aluminum and magnesium usually used in aerospace components. The Monolith, which is still in its prototype stage, uses a modified Sellita SW300-1b movement. Chosen for its rugged nature and ease of service, the movement has been upgraded by Barrelhand for improved magnetic resistance, shock resistance and daily accuracy of +/- four seconds. Bachand, who has a degree in mechanical engineering as well as experience designing clinostat machinery (devices used to study the effects of microgravity on lifeforms) for NASA, founded Barrelhand in 2014. Bachand, who says that engineering for extreme temperature is the single hardest challenge to overcome, is evangelical about the potential for additive manufacturing to solve this, and other problems. By designing a case with an air pocket within its walls, Bachand was able to construct an insulating layer that allows the Monolith to work between the staggeringly inhospitable temperature range between -120°C (-184°F) and +120°C (248°F). It has also allowed Barrelhand to work with high-performance materials: the Monolith case is printed from something called “scalmalloy”, an alloy of scandium, aluminum and magnesium that's usually used in small-scale aerospace components. We're not designing it to be an ultralight watch, but for space exploration, every gram counts. While EVA use might be the most extreme scenario, Bachand says there is also an enormous amount of innovation required to make a watch that's genuinely suited for use within the ISS or other spacecraft. Bachand even threw out the industry-standard rubber gaskets used to seal a watch case against water. “We looked at the airlocks for the ISS and found a partner that can make an O-ring seal with a similar chemical makeup—an aerospace grade fluorosilicone that won't get brittle when it freezes.” “If you've ever opened up a plastic product off Amazon you'll remember being greeted by a harsh chemical smell, commonly known as VOCs [volatile organic compounds]. On Earth, we can just crack open a window and air it out, but the ISS does not have that luxury,” says Bachand, explaining why the Monolith uses only materials that don't emit VOCs. As well as reimagining the idea of a space-going watch, Barrelhand says that in the process (more or less by default) it will create a tool watch that can cope with anything on Earth. For instance, the Monolith is pressure-tested to depths of 580 meters. Bachand says that here, too, the use of 3D printing is key, and that, slowly, they are changing perceptions of a technology generally only associated with design prototyping. “We used Project One as a research platform to test new metal 3D printing. Nevertheless, the end goal is to see the Monolith used in space—and that may prove to be a challenge that goes beyond pure engineering ability. While he follows the official route, Barrelhand is simultaneously taking a “grass roots” approach, courting individual astronauts and scientists who can potentially be more easily convinced of its merits. “A lot of astronauts are watch collectors, but they're also just interested in tools and innovation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I have taken an IV drip of green liquid that looked nearly radioactive. I have been frozen in a cryochamber (and felt amazing afterward) and baked in a one-man, zippable sauna (I didn't). I have eaten more consecutive meals of beef than ever in my life, grinding unrefined Kalahari desert salt over the slabs of fat and protein. I have pumped my vaccinated fist alongside RFK Jr. fans and stem cell enthusiasts and piss-injectors to the pounding beats of Steve Aoki. Welcome to Dave Asprey's 2025 Biohacking Conference: a symposium of tech bros, wellness influencers, psychonauts, and scientists, all hoping to thwart the ravages of time with unorthodox—and often unproven—medical treatments. And, while biohacking isn't new, the rise of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, which champions alternative medicine and freedom of choice over proven interventions like vaccines, has given the concept renewed zeal. The Human Regenerator Jet bed, which claims to promote cellular regeneration. Instead of blindly accepting pharmaceuticals, he says, this community marches to its own holistic drum. “We take supplements that do the same thing. Or maybe we just buy our pharmaceuticals from overseas without a permission slip, and we pay a tiny fraction of the outrageous things in the US.” “We're leading the charge on making America healthy again and most biohackers are pretty much apolitical. Biohacking is a big tent, combining Silicon Valley technology, Burning Man spirituality, and health libertarianism. If anything unites this crowd, it is a distrust of the medical status quo—particularly the pharmaceutical industry—and an appetite for tech-heavy alternatives. The movement started gaining major traction around 13 years ago, when Asprey began organizing a loose-knit band of health fanatics at his annual conferences. But its roots arguably go back much further. The Ammortal Chamber, a $160,000 machine that claims to provide multi-wave pulsed electromagnetic and multi-wavelength light therapy. Grinning cutouts of him greet you at the tops of escalators; his products stock the ad space in conference pamphlets. Patrons roam the halls in his signature anti-blue-light glasses, the auburn lenses making their eyes look like flies, trapped timelessly in amber. He claims to have spent $2.5 million of his multimillion dollar empire—generated largely by his Bulletproof coffee brand and diet plan—on reversing his age via a specialized diet, rigorous exercise, a torrent of supplements, countless stem cell treatments, baths in frigid ice water and shimmering red light, and injections of his own filtered urine as allergy therapy. Whatever myriad of elixirs Asprey is using, it does, on a superficial level at least, appear to be working. At 52, he looks great, standing out in a conference awash with obvious botox and plastic surgery. In his slicked-back hair, punk leather outfits, and signature glasses, it's hard to believe the picture he paints of his former self, resembling “the 300-pound computer hacker from Jurassic Park.” He seems to have even achieved a younger man's temperament: rapping “I'm a Little Teapot” onstage; dancing shirtless and gawky before the masses during Aoki's set, surrounded by a coterie of women, one of whom attempted to flash him, unhooking her bra before being whisked offstage. He shares his de facto leadership of the biohacking sphere with a few other rich renegades, most notably Bryan Johnson, the venture capitalist whose Blueprint Protocol makes Asprey's centenarian goals look quaint. Johnson aims for immortality outright—“DON'T DIE” screams his own movement's slogan—and has even vampirically infused himself with his own son's blood in the quest for the fountain of youth. Not everyone at the conference strives for Asprey-Johnsonian extremes. Then again, not everyone at the conference is in their tax bracket. Some simply want to age with grace and vim, not blunted by medication or hobbling through hospice. In a true embodiment of the conference's “Beyond” theme, some even have plans grander than this carnal plane. “I want to make as much progress in this life as I can,” Winston says, “so that when I die I can go to a different dimension and not have to deal with this 3D Matrix shit.” In the meantime, though, she'd still like to look good. Spiritual evolution is my primary goal, but I'm still human, you know?” Others are simply afraid of the slow, painful crawl through old age and, of course, death itself. Melanie Avalon, 34, host of a biohacking podcast, tells me: “I've been haunted by the concept of aging since I was 12 ... And ever since then I've been searching for ways to stall the aging timeline ... I don't know if immortality is possible, but if there is a way to practically move toward that, it's biohacking.” If the practice sounds inherently self-interested, that's because it is. Since November, then, the biohackers have seen a bright new dawn. With President Donald Trump's re-election, RFK Jr.'s subsequent appointment as secretary of Health and Human Services—people here refer to him as “Bobby,” affectionately, like an old friend—and the initiation of MAHA, years of work have come to fruition. MAHA's agenda legitimizes the biohacking ethos: that we must curb the pharmaceutical industry's influence on public health policy and research, that we are all overmedicated as a result, that self-governance over health is paramount. RFK's antivax crusade has set off alarm bells across the scientific community—most recently, he gutted the Center for Disease Control's vaccine advisory committee and appointed several new vaccine skeptics, just as the US is seeing a resurgence of measles outbreaks. But for the biohackers, it is an almost mythical underdog moment. David, at last, has been armed with his sling across the pit from Goliath. Despite the MAHA fandom, every biohacker I speak to, like Asprey, says they are apolitical. What could possibly be partisan about wanting healthy kids? My only heated exchange over the conference's three days is with Siggi Clavien, founder of Equilibrium Labs, the company that scanned my newborn baby liver. And how dare you take that aspect, and challenge us trying to help children's health?” (Clavien asks me “how dare you” three times over the course of our short interview.) “The biohacking community,” Fabrizio “Fab” Mancini, a chiropractor and frequent flier of the daytime TV medical circuit, tells me, “is not owned by any one entity. I ask Asprey about the vetting process for the slew of vendors and speakers hawking treatments on his trade show floor, many of them expensive, few FDA-approved. “I don't look at anything as being fringe,” he tells me. A man named Sincere Seven is extolling the medicinal virtues of microdosing viper, cobra, and rattlesnake venoms directly into his patients' bloodstream. “I inject venom into you that will induce a rapid healing. Flood the body with white blood cells, kill off viruses, kill off bacteria, kill off tumors, kill off cancers—cause I don't wanna eat that.” (Trace amounts of venoms are currently used in FDA-approved drugs and have been found to be effective in stroke treatment.) Seven is asked by an audience member if snake venom could be used to treat autism. While he hadn't personally tested it yet, Seven stresses, “I'm willing to work with anybody ... Me and my colleagues, we are the clinical trials.” “Oh, my gosh,” a woman breathes in the audience. Whether she is moved or horrified, I can't tell. It's not fair to say that I hate my body, exactly—the thing certainly has its merits, and what's more, biohackers talk constantly of the power of positive language in manifesting your reality—but we've never really hit it off. One of my earliest memories involves my parents calling 911 when I had breathing trouble, the paramedics looming over me so tall I swear they scraped the ceiling. In college I was walloped with Lyme disease, my wrists frozen stiff one morning to the point that I couldn't open my dorm room door. As of this writing, I'm days away from an appointment with my dermatologist, who'll carve a portion from my back to determine whether or not I have skin cancer. I, too, long to throw up my hands and write off Western medicine in all its byzantine expense, to embrace something different and eccentric and even expensive, as long as it means getting healed at last. There are other, better ways to transform health care, of course—ways that could lastingly help the millions who can afford neither chemotherapy nor a cryochamber—like universal health care, stronger regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, and a system more focused on preventative medicine. But these reforms will take political courage and considerable time. This, at its core, is the biohackers' dilemma. Though “Live Beyond 180” is a sleek-enough slogan for this crowd, another strikes me as equally fitting: “Science is dead, long live science.” “The bottom line,” Dr. Fab says, “is that anybody can actually put up a booth and actually sell whatever they feel. That's where an informed consumer is the key.” Information, as we know all too well by now, ain't what it used to be.

If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic. On-Topic: ... anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity. I can't see how this is on-topic. If someone would care to make a case defending it I'd be interested to learn. As a general rule, if you can slip "yes but does he weigh more than... a duck?!" into the comments and have it fit, it probably doesn't belong on HN.Edit: I just noticed several "burn him/them!"
