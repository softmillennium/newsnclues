                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to data provided by Spot On Chain, an Ethereum whale from the ICO era recently sent $12.1 million into the Kraken exchange. The whale in question received a total of 107,000 ETH at Genesis. This massive sum would be worth roughly $243 million at current prices. These tokens cost them just $31,000 back then. Ethereum (ETH) is currently the worst-performing cryptocurrency in the top 10 with a weekly drop of 3.2%, according to CoinGecko data. It is down 1.2% over the past 24 hours. The flagship altcoin is still down 50.5% from the all-time high that was achieved in late 2021 despite the fact that Bitcoin hit a record peak in May. Earlier this week, another Ethereum ICO whale deposited more than $5 million worth of ETH to the Binance exchange after an entire decade of inactivity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price continues moving higher as a ceasefire between Iran and Israel holds, and traders anticipate a round of interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve. Bitcoin's relief rally rose above $108,000, but the bulls may struggle to push and sustain the price above the all-time high of $111,980. Several major altcoins have bounced off their recent lows but are not finding buyers at higher levels. Bitcoin's (BTC) relief rally that started on Monday, following US President Donald Trump's “total ceasefire” announcement between Israel and Iran, rose above $108,000, indicating sustained demand from the bulls. Institutional investors did not stop buying despite increasing geopolitical tensions in the past few days, as seen from the 11 consecutive days of inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange‑traded funds (ETFs). According to Farside Investors' data, the ETFs attracted $3.35 billion in inflows starting June 9. Bitcoin looks set to challenge the all-time high at $111,980, but the cryptocurrency markets may require a catalyst to hold on to the higher levels. The absence of a trigger may extend Bitcoin's stay inside the range for some more time. Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high, pulling altcoins higher? Bitcoin turned up sharply from $100,000 on Monday and rose above the moving averages, indicating solid buying at lower levels. The 20-day exponential moving average ($105,154) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) has jumped into positive territory, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. On the contrary, a slide below the moving averages suggests the BTC/USDT pair may consolidate between $111,980 and $98,200 for a while longer. Ether (ETH) turned up from the $2,111 level on Sunday and reached the 20-day EMA ($2.473) on Tuesday. The 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below $2,323, it signals that bears are selling on rallies. Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, signaling that the range-bound action between $2 and $2.65 may continue for a few more days. On the upside, a break above $2.65 clears the path for a rally to $3 and then to $3.40. BNB (BNB) turned up from the support line of the descending channel pattern on Sunday and reached the resistance line on Wednesday. If buyers do not give up much ground from the resistance line, the prospects of a break above the channel improve. Contrarily, a break below $625 suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the resistance line. Solana (SOL) turned up from $126 on Sunday and broke above the breakdown level of $140 on Monday. A shallow pullback increases the possibility of a break above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could tumble to the solid support at $0.10. If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could slump to $0.40. Related: Ethereum ‘death cross' flashes for the first time since 2022 ETH price crash Hyperliquid (HYPE) rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($33.37) on Monday and rose above the 20-day EMA ($37.13). Buyers may find it difficult to push the price above the $42.50 to $45.80 resistance zone. On the downside, a break below the 20-day EMA signals a lack of buyers at higher levels. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($450) on Wednesday, indicating that lower levels continue to attract buyers. However, if buyers do not cede much ground to the bears, it increases the likelihood of a break above $500. If that happens, the BCH/USDT pair could surge to $550. The pair may then plunge to $375. Sui (SUI) turned up sharply on Monday and reached the 20-day EMA ($2.94) on Tuesday, where the bears are posing a stiff challenge. Sellers will try to pull the price toward the $2.29 to $2 support zone, but the buyers are likely to have other plans. If they manage to do that, the SUI/USDT pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($3.39). Such a move suggests the correction may be over.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As meme coin trading surges in popularity, Telegram-based bots are quickly becoming essential tools for crypto enthusiasts seeking speed, convenience, and automation. One of the most promising new entrants is Snorter Token, a Solana-powered trading bot that fuses meme coin culture with real on-chain functionality. Currently in its ICO phase, SNORT is aiming to disrupt the market by challenging established bots like BonkBot—delivering enhanced features at a fraction of the cost. While Snorter Token embraces the playful energy of meme culture, it's far from a gimmick. With future expansion planned across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Base, and other EVM-compatible networks, Snorter Token is positioning itself as a cross-chain hub for meme coin enthusiasts and automated trading strategies alike. Currently priced under $1, Snorter Token remains in its early stage of development. Having raised $1.2 million to date and with a modest hard cap, the project offers an appealing entry point for early investors ahead of expected growth. SNORT isn't just riding the meme wave—it's delivering a competitive feature set that appeals to both novice and experienced traders: These features combine to offer a smoother, more efficient trading experience—especially for users who find desktop platforms intimidating or overly complex. With over 12,000 followers on X and posts hitting 100,000+ views, the project is gaining significant organic traction. It has also attracted early attention from reputable crypto media platforms like CryptoSpeaker, NewsBTC, Crypto Daily, and CoinMarketCap—bolstering its credibility and appeal among early adopters. But Snorter Token isn't just about appearances. It's setting a new standard in Telegram-based trading by combining viral appeal with functional depth. Unlike early bots like BonkBot, Snorter Token introduces lower fees, advanced trading tools, and multi-chain capabilities—all wrapped in a user-friendly Telegram interface. This seamless blend of culture and technology removes the complexity of traditional platforms, empowering everyday traders with powerful tools right where they already chat and trade. Snorter Token isn't just another meme project—it's a full-fledged trading ecosystem built for the modern trader. With its ICO nearing completion, there's still time to get in early, but its long-term value lies in the real utility it brings to Telegram-based trading. For those looking to trade smarter, capitalize on meme coin volatility, or simply explore the next generation of crypto bots, Snorter Token offers a compelling blend of fun, function, and forward-thinking development.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SoFi Is Getting Back Into Crypto, Starting With Bitcoin and Ethereum San Francisco-based financial services company SoFi will make its return to crypto later this year, offering its users the ability to trade and hold popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the firm announced on Wednesday. The firm also mentioned plans to offer customers stablecoins in the future, along with crypto staking features, borrowing against their crypto holdings, and other services. “The future of financial services is being completely reinvented through innovations in crypto, digital assets, and blockchain more broadly,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto in a statement. “And in doing so, we will continue to stand alone in offering our members unmatched products and services as the only digital one-stop shop for their financial needs.” One such example outlined in the firm's Wednesday announcement is the ability for nationally chartered banks, like SoFi Bank, N.A., to custody crypto and execute services on their behalf. In May, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an interpretive letter permitting national banks to do so, signaling a broader alignment with easing regulations against crypto policies and companies that President Trump's administration has ushered in. In addition to re-enabling crypto trading and custody, the firm says it has “many planned crypto and blockchain innovations” it intends to roll out through its “one-stop shop” of financial services. SoFi did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has been characterized as a platform plagued by governance upheaval, community fragmentation, and high gas fees. Additionally, Ethereum receives a lot of criticism for its slow performance, which lags behind Bitcoin's institutional appeal and Solana's speculative excitement. This is based on the fact that it has maintained functional governance, which enables continued technical advancement. This positions Ethereum as the only blockchain capable of long-term sustainable innovation. Concerns around Ethereum's “identity crisis” reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes blockchain technology valuable in the first place. When critics focus on short-term metrics like transaction costs and processing speed, they're forgetting the revolutionary potential of a truly decentralized computing platform. Ethereum's challenges are the growing pains of building something unprecedented: a global, permissionless computer that no single entity can control or shut down. The governance discussions that appear as "upheaval" to outsiders represent healthy democratic processes that other chains avoid by maintaining centralized control, or by effectively forbidding all change and improvement. This nuanced reality gets lost in narratives that prioritize simplicity over substance. Despite being criticised as a digital “pet rock,” Bitcoin has received widespread respect as the first cryptocurrency to see legitimacy outside of the industry. “Bitcoin-maxis” even point to the chain's inertia as a critical tenet of bitcoin's value. Bitcoin has ossified; initially slow to innovate, improvements are now effectively impossible. Ethereum, by contrast, continues to evolve through major upgrades like the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 and the recent Pectra update. Unlike Bitcoin, the Ethereum community continues to demonstrate that it is capable of meaningful technological innovation. These feats are achieved quickly only by giving up on meaningful decentralization. Some form of centralized leadership may seem like a small price to pay for quicker change, but decentralization matters in the same way that seat belts do. History provides countless examples of centralized systems eventually serving their controllers rather than their users - this is such a common pattern it's practically a law. Ethereum has chosen the most technically and socially difficult but correct route: building a truly decentralized platform that serves the needs of its users. This approach is slower than Solana's and less obvious than Bitcoin's, but it's the only path that delivers both continued innovation and genuine user sovereignty. Earlier this month, Bernstein analysts published a research report stating that "The narrative around value accrual of public blockchain networks is at a critical inflection point,” and “starting to reflect in investor interest in ETH ETF inflows." Ethereum ETFs just completed their longest inflow streak of 2025, with BlackRock's ETHA fund alone adding $492 million in a single week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs experienced $582 million in net outflows during the same period. Despite this positive momentum, the Ethereum community needs to concern itself less with trailing indicators of success like price. The Ethereum community must avoid getting distracted by price movements, governance drama, or competing narratives and unite around their common mission: building credibly neutral infrastructure that serves humanity's needs. Ethereum's ability to innovate while staying decentralized requires developers, researchers, validators, and users to shut out the noise and remain focused on building. This path is harder, but it's the only one that leads to sustainable success.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve's removal of “reputational risk” from formal bank exams could potentially clear the way for banks to engage more openly with cryptocurrency and other previously controversial industries. Legislation is advancing in Congress to regulate stablecoins and digital assets, aiming to clarify the roles of the SEC and CFTC, which could establish a formalized, compliant path for Wall Street institutions to enter the crypto space. When the Federal Reserve Board announced in a Monday (June 23) press release that it would no longer include “reputational risk” in its formal bank examinations and supervision programs, most consumers in the United States likely barely noticed. On Capitol Hill, momentum is accelerating behind two legislative efforts: the GENIUS Act to bring stablecoins under federal oversight, which has passed the Senate and moved onto the House; and another which was unveiled by lawmakers Tuesday (June 24) and intends to create a framework for the development of legislation for digital assets. Its framework could open the floodgates for Wall Street to enter crypto in a structured and compliant manner. That includes not just banks, but asset managers, broker-dealers and pension funds. Crypto, long considered an exotic and high-risk asset class by traditional financial institutions, is inching toward legitimacy. Reputational risk has traditionally served as a catch-all justification for regulators to scrutinize, or even penalize, banks that dealt with industries deemed controversial. “This change does not alter the board's expectation that banks maintain strong risk management to ensure safety and soundness and compliance with law and regulation nor is it intended to impact whether and how board-supervised banks use the concept of reputational risk in their own risk management practices,” the Fed said in the press release. “There's certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, told PYMNTS in April. The Fed's move coincides with a surge in interest among banks and credit unions to offer more digital-first financial products. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “How Zillennials Are Driving Innovation in Financial Services” found that 16% of zillennials — a microgeneration comprising older members of Generation Z and younger millennials — have their primary bank account with a digital-only bank. Against this backdrop, the next wave of financial technology might just include crypto. See also: Going From Zero to Crypto: How Banks and PSPs Can Approach Stablecoins Today's end-users want faster payments, borderless money transfers and access to digital assets. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Credit Union Innovation Readiness Index: The Smallest Credit Unions Step It Up” found that when it comes to innovation, smaller lenders aren't standing still. Crypto markets remain volatile, cyber threats are evolving and the regulatory landscape is still under construction. For banks, entering the space without a clear strategy could prove costly. Banks will also need to reassess their internal capabilities. From hiring blockchain-savvy compliance officers to building secure custody solutions and forging partnerships with crypto-native firms, the cost of entry is high. Crypto-native firms and nimble FinTechs are already seizing market share. In this context, banks that hesitate risk being relegated to providing infrastructure but ceding customer relationships. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republic, a New York-based investment startup, is offering users exposure to SpaceX by issuing a "tokenized" representation of its shares. The company will begin selling the digital tokens this week and eventually plans to expand the offering to other private companies like artificial intelligence darlings OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as Stripe, X, Waymo, Epic Games and more. "We're talking about delivering products to retail investors that they've have been held out of previously," Republic co-CEO Andrew Durgee told CNBC. "The fact that retail investors couldn't own pre-IPO SpaceX has always been crazy to us. The businesses that we target out of the gate we want to have a retail focus, or at least significant retail following." In the crypto world, tokenization is the process of issuing digital representations on a blockchain network of publicly traded securities, real world assets or any other form of value. The move comes as the U.S. crypto industry is testing new regulatory boundaries under President Donald Trump's pro-crypto administration. Since he took office, the Securities and Exchange Commission has moved swiftly to loosen the restraints left on the crypto industry by the previous administration, ending an enforcement case against Coinbase; closing investigations into Robinhood Crypto, Uniswap, Gemini and Consensys without enforcement action; scaling back its crypto enforcement unit; declaring meme coins are not securities and launching a Crypto Task Force that's been holding a series of roundtables on crypto asset regulation. "If you take a step back and look at what the last four to eight years looked like in the space, innovation was very stifled," Durgee said. Now we've gotten to a point where it's certainly become more mainstay." "We've moved from what was ultimately ... nothing but headwinds," he added. Republic will allow investors to invest between $50 and $5,000 in the tokens. Shares of private company can be exchanged by accredited investors in secondary markets; Republic will initially price SpaceX tokens based on how the company's shares are performing there. Tokenized private equity is new territory for regulators and the underlying companies being digitally represented. There are outstanding questions about the legality of the tokens, how Republic will give financial information to investors as required, and how selling private investments to retail investors could provoke stress in the financial markets. "We don't need a company's approval to be able to do these types of offerings, and I do think there will be some companies that will want more control over something like that," Durgee said. Financial institutions are becoming increasingly interested in tokenizing traditional assets because of the often-touted benefits of blockchain technology: lower costs, faster settlement times, greater transparency about ownership and performance and programmable terms, as well as increased accessibility for retail investors and global reach. The announcement comes about a week after Coinbase said it's pushing for SEC approval to offer trading of tokenized public stocks, which would give the crypto services provider an additional revenue stream and put it in closer competition with brokerages like Robinhood and eToro. Competing crypto exchange Kraken recently said it'll offer tokens of U.S. stocks for 24/7 trading in unspecified markets abroad. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has said he sees the "tokenization of every financial asset" as an important step in "the technological revolution in the financial markets." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" 06/25 update: The bitcoin price has suddenly surged back toward touching distance of its all-time high of around $112,000 per bitcoin, climbing to over $107,000 after dipping under $100,000 this past weekend. “Bitcoin's status as a safe-haven asset is still taking shape, but recent signals suggest it's edging closer,” Gadi Chait, head of investment at Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments. “Traditionally seen as volatile, bitcoin's response to recent macro shocks, like the events in the Middle East, has been notably restrained, neither tracking gold perfectly nor mirroring equity sell-offs. Now, as the market digests a Congress game-changer expected to “unleash” trillions, bitcoin and crypto prices are braced for Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before lawmakers—coming after Trump suddenly flipped on firing him. U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has committed to keep interest rates on hold, with some ... More predicting the bitcoin price and wider crypto market could soar once when it begins cutting. “Aside from any geopolitical updates, today's key event will be Fed chair Jerome Powell's testimony in Washington,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. “I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over,” Trump added. The Fed kept interest rates on hold again last week after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that's been put on pause due to fears Trump's global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation. “The most bullish scenario would be confirmation of a Fed dovish policy pivot or a major de-escalation in global trade and geopolitical tensions, either of which could spark renewed interest in risk assets and push bitcoin towards retesting its all-time high.” Expectations around an eventual Fed interest rate cut have been built up by crypto traders and influencers on social media. Two Fed officials, Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago president Austan Goolsbee, have this week joined Fed governor Christopher Waller admitting it may be time to lower interest rates. “It is time to consider adjusting the policy rate,” Bowman told a gathering held in Prague, it was reported by Reuters, while Goolsbee reportedly said that Trump's trade tariffs have “not been what people feared." Last week, Waller has said he doesn't expect Trump's tariffs to drive inflation higher so policymakers should be looking to lower interest rates as early as July.</p>

Recent enforcement action by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) serves as a stark warning to companies handling sensitive data, with firms urged to ensure appropriate data protection measures are in place, an expert has said. The investigation and subsequent fine should remind companies handling sensitive persona data, particularly in the health and biotech sectors, that failure to implement adequate cybersecurity measures will not be tolerated.” The fine stems from a large-scale cyberattack that occurred between April and September 2023. Hackers exploited reused login credentials – previously stolen in unrelated data breaches – to gain unauthorised access to 23andMe accounts through a method known as credential stuffing. Once inside, attackers were able to access a trove of sensitive information, including names, birth years, locations, profile images, racial and ethnic backgrounds, family trees, and even health reports. Credential stuffing attacks are common, and involve attackers re-using passwords gleaned from other attacks, exploiting the common habit of individuals reusing the same login details across different accounts, including work accounts. The situation is often managed by requiring workers to have specific, strong passwords which are changed periodically, having in place multi-factor authentication – which requires a second verification source – and ensuring that usernames are not obvious. McIlwaine said: “23andMe failed to have these basic procedures in place, despite the special category of data that it was processing. This oversight left users' most intimate and immutable data exposed to exploitation.” Consequently, the ICO found that the company was in breach of UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which requires data controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. McIlwaine said: “It is noteworthy that the fine has been levied against 23andMe, Inc, a US corporation. The company settled a $30m class action last year related to the incident and reported a deficit of $2.4 billion, stating that there was substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern, certain affiliates have filed for bankruptcy. We therefore conclude that the fine should have been significantly higher. Two recent executive orders signed by US president Donald Trump regarding international taxation matters may give rise to future investment disputes. Following a year mostly fuelled by refinancing and re-capitalisations, as interest rates continue to fall, acquisition finance looks set to rebound in the first half of 2025 with a resurgence of cheaper debt.
