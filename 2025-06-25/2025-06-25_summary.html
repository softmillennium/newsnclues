Polling consistently shows that voters strongly object to the Medicaid cuts proposed in the GOP reconciliation package.

During a closed-door meeting of Republican senators on Tuesday, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) tried to tamper down fears of voter blowback against the proposed cuts to Medicaid spending in the GOP's budget reconciliation bill, claiming that voters will ultimately “get over it.”

The former Republican Senate leader's comments came after Sen. Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), one of the most vulnerable Senate GOP incumbents in the 2026 midterm elections, expressed concern that the cuts included in the bill could lead to major electoral losses for the party, Punchbowl News reported. 

McConnell responded by saying “failure isn't an option” when it comes to the reconciliation package.

“I know a lot of us are hearing from people back home about Medicaid. But they'll get over it,” he added.

After McConnell's comments faced widespread pushback, a spokesperson for the senator claimed McConnell was referring to “people who are abusing Medicaid” and “the need to withstand Democrats' scare tactics.” 

But several examinations of the legislation have found that the bill's proposed cuts would be detrimental, resulting in tens of thousands of excess deaths annually for people who would lose health coverage.

“Mitch McConnell told Senate Republicans that Americans concerned about losing Medicaid will ‘get over it.' No one will ‘get over' losing a loved one because Republicans in Congress failed them,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) said in response to McConnell's comments.

“Mitch McConnell just told 1.4 MILLION Kentuckians on Medicaid to ‘get over it' when they lose their health care. The @KYGOP does not care about the lives of the people in our Commonwealth,” a post on X from the Kentucky Democratic Party read.

Several polls demonstrate that GOP lawmakers' concern about the public's reaction to Medicaid cuts are warranted. 

While the Republicans' push for stricter “work requirements” to obtain Medicaid is popular, garnering 65 percent support from voters in a recent KFF poll, support for that standard drops to just 35 percent when people are informed that the vast majority of Medicaid recipients already work, and that many individuals and families would be at risk of losing coverage due to new burdensome rules that are included in the reconciliation package.

An Associated Press/NORC poll published this month also found that a majority of voters actually want funding for Medicaid to be increased. Per that survey, 50 percent of Americans believe Medicaid is funded too little, while 31 percent say it's funded the right amount and just 18 percent say the program receives too much funding. Even among GOP voters, only 33 percent believe Medicaid spending is currently too high.

            There is much to unpack with the portion of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding invitation that was leaked to the world. The explicit request for no gifts — the only option, really, for the one of the world's richest individuals; along with the donation pledge to UNESCO's Venice office, the Corila research program into the Venice lagoon, and Venice International University — a declaration of care for a city whose inhabitants are protesting the couple's very presence. But perhaps the most surprising element of all is the invitation's design.
    


            Printed in a wistful italic font and decorated haphazardly with doves, shooting stars, butterflies and the Rialto Bridge, the invitation appears homemade, but not in an artisanal sense. (The illustrations, which include two gondolas, have been compared with those available in Microsoft Word's generic image library). Instead, Bezos and Sanchez's invitation looks like a bit of an afterthought — which, considering the number of guests, the ongoing threat of protesters, which has already resulted in a last-minute venue change, and increasing media attention, may well be the case.
    


            Many took to social media to express their disappointment, criticizing the invitation for falling flat — expectations that have been largely set by assumptions of a billionaire's wedding budget. The decision makes more sense, however, when you consider the dressed-down approach typically associated with tech bros in this class bracket. Bezos himself is often found in jeans, polo shirts and sneakers — though for this occasion he is sure to shape up — and, according to a Wired profile from 1999, he once wore shirts with “hidden snaps under the collar for easy tie removal.” Speed over style and efficiency over glamor. Old habits die hard.
    


            But invitations are more than just carriers of logistical details. For major events, they are the first glimpse of what attendees can expect from the day.
    


            For King Charles and Queen Camila's coronation in 2023, British artist Andrew Jamieson hand-painted an intricate, garden-themed border in watercolor and gouache complete with folklore motifs and coats of arms of the Monarch. The design was then reproduced and printed over 2,000 times on recycled card with gold foil detailing. Similarly, Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, had each of their wedding invitations in 2018 printed using a machine from the 1930s. The pair even went as far as using American ink on English card to symbolize their transatlantic unity.

            Fashion designers, too, have long harnessed the power of a memorable invite as important extensions of their world-building efforts. On Friday, while high-profile guests step out to celebrate the Bezos wedding (scheduled to run June 26-28), a fashionable set of attendees will gather in Paris for another hotly-anticipated event: The debut of a new chief designer at Dior. Jonathan Anderson — a certified hype-generator and master of storytelling on the runway — also distributed his official invitations this week. Guests received porcelain plates with a trio of baby pink eggs glued to the surface and “Dior” printed on the underside. Like all good teasers, the invitation poses more questions than it answers, but it also sets the tone for what's to come on the catwalk. Expect subversion, something a little weird, traditional craft turned cerebral.
    


            Anderson, of course, is not the first designer to capitalize on an operational necessity in this way. In 2023, Alaïa sent attendees a collapsible stool, which they were instructed to carry to the show location. The year before, Balenciaga posted out “genuine artifacts from the year 2022”: iPhone 6Ss, each engraved with the guest's name and show details — often cracked or smashed. More recently, Gucci produced a special edition of the classic “Timor” calendar from Italian designer Enzo Mari and sent it to guests for its Milan Fashion Week show.
    


            Some designers, however, still prefer the ephemeral. Jacquemus, for example, hand-wrote its invites in 2018, and wrapped them in a cotton towel along with a loaf of freshly baked bread.
    


            For sentimental souls, any invitation is a memento of the day — but great invites, such as those designed by luxury fashion houses, can become prized possessions. (Or be sold on eBay for thousands).
    


            With Anderson's Dior debut and the Amazon founder's nuptials overlapping, anyone who found themselves double booked (Kim Kardashian, Anna Wintor, perhaps?) faced a tough decision. Perhaps, the invitation was the clincher.

Company's Starbase launch site in Texas near the Mexican border has seen test failures resulting in large explosions

Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has threatened legal action over falling debris and contamination from billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket launches across the border in the United States.

Mexico's government was studying which international laws were being violated in order to file “the necessary lawsuits” because “there is indeed contamination”, Sheinbaum told her morning news conference on Wednesday.

Last week, a SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during a routine ground test at the Starbase headquarters of Musk's space project on the south Texas coast near the Mexican border.

The explosion, which sent a towering fireball into the air, was the latest setback to Musk's dream of sending humans to Mars.

Mexican officials are carrying out a “comprehensive review” of the environmental impacts of the rocket launches for the neighboring state of Tamaulipas, Sheinbaum said.

The US Federal Aviation Administration approved an increase in annual Starship rocket launches from five to 25 in early May, stating that the increased frequency would not adversely affect the environment.

The decision overruled objections from conservation groups that had warned the expansion could endanger sea turtles and shorebirds.

A lawsuit would be the latest legal tussle between Mexico and a US corporate giant.

In May, Sheinbaum's government said it had sued Google for renaming the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America” for Google Maps users in the United States following an executive order by Donald Trump.

            President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, Emil Bove, was pushed to repeatedly deny several accusations of corruption – one made by a whistleblower at the Justice Department – during his confirmation hearing Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
    


            “I am not anybody's henchman,” Bove said. “I'm not an enforcer. I'm a lawyer from a small town, who never expected to be in an arena like this.”
    


            Trump has nominated several of his personal attorneys to top legal posts in his administration, but his nomination of Bove to the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals marks the first time he has selected one of his lawyers to serve on the federal bench.
    


            For the past six months, Bove has served as a high-ranking official in the Justice Department. In that short time, he has proven himself to be a reliable ally for the president and also been embroiled in a series of major controversies – including dropping federal charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams; investigating officials who worked on cases related to January 6, 2021; and pursuing Trump's deportation goals in ways that prompted a whistleblower to allege Bove intended to ignore court orders and mislead federal judges.
    


            Bove testified on Wednesday that the decision to drop charges against Adams was based on a “substantiated” concern “on the weaponization of the criminal justice system” in the case, though he did not elaborate.
    


            He also cited concerns “about the effect” of the prosecution on Adams' ability to govern and campaign.
    


            Sen. Richard Blumenthal lambasted Bove for not further explaining those decisions when pressed during the hearing, including over questions of whether there was an element of quid pro quo in dropping the charges.
    


            “I am absolutely flabbergasted that you would come before this committee and refuse to tell us basic facts about a case that is at the core of the challenges to the appearance of impropriety that should disqualify you,” the Connecticut Democrat said.
    


            “You were virtually the only attorney in the Department of Justice willing to go to court and make a claim that career prosecutors said violated their basic standard of ethics, and the quid pro quo was a nomination to the Court of Appeals,” Blumenthal added.
    


            Bove was also pushed repeatedly to address allegations made in a recent whistleblower complaint reported on Tuesday.
    


            The whistleblower complaint, filed by a recently fired DOJ attorney and sent to members of Congress, alleges that in a meeting in March, Bove “stated that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts ‘f**k you'” and ignore any orders to stop the hasty deportation of migrants to a prison in El Salvador.
    


            During his opening statements and in response to several questions from senators during Wednesday's hearing, Bove continued to deny allegations of wrongdoing.
    


            “I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge,” Bove said.
    


            The hearing Wednesday was the first time Democratic lawmakers had the chance to grill the reclusive Bove on his time at the Justice Department and his work for Trump. If confirmed, Bove would be one of roughly a dozen judges with the power to review federal cases being appealed in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands.

            Despite his involvement in high-profile cases and controversies, Bove has mostly avoided the limelight.
    


            “He has been right there but kind of in the shadows, he doesn't go on TV, he doesn't talk to the press,” a senior Justice Department official told CNN. “He is a brilliant lawyer, he is just an amazing writer, critical thinker … he clerked for two rock star judges, he worked at Sullivan and Cromwell. He is a legit genius lawyer, but nobody knows who he is.”
    


            Bove graduated from Georgetown Law School in 2008 and then went on to spend a decade working as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he focused on international terrorism and narcotics cases.
    


            During that time Bove successfully brought narco-terrorism charges against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in 2020. He also prosecuted Ahmad Khan Rahimi, the man responsible for a 2016 pressure cooker bombing in New York that left 30 people injured. Rahimi was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
    


            A former colleague who worked with Bove describes him as an “a**-kicker … he is whip smart, has a high level of curiosity, is naturally intelligent, and extremely effective.”
    


            “I wouldn't want to be one of his adversaries,” they said.
    


            Bove joined Trump's legal team in 2023 and worked on three of Trump's criminal cases over the span of roughly 18 months. He sat second chair, alongside now-Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, to represent Trump in his New York hush money trial. Trump was ultimately found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in that case, which he is still appealing.
    


            He also worked on Trump's federal criminal cases related to alleged mishandling of classified documents and allegations of interfering with the 2020 election.
    


            Bove's resume has many of the hallmarks of a federal judge, but he has never served on the bench, and it is unclear how he would rule on major issues.
    


            “He is completely empathic and fair – he is very strategic and thoughtful about applying law to the facts. He is a brilliant writer and critical legal thinker. He will make opinions that come out of the third circuit tighter and better,” the senior Justice Department official said.
    


            Just hours after Trump took office, Bove was tapped to assume the powerful position of interim deputy attorney general – the No. 2 job at the Justice Department, which had him running the sprawling agency while Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Blanche were awaiting confirmation.
    


            His brief tenure has earned him many detractors as he tried to reshape the department to align with Trump's vision and clashed with career officials.
    


            One of Bove's first actions at the department was to issue a memo threatening to prosecute state and local officials who resist the administration's federal immigration crackdown.
    


            “The administration had a directive to depoliticize the department. He was met with instant resistance from entrenched bureaucrats who are not accustomed to change,” his former colleague told CNN. “He was there to execute a mission and institute policy – he was not there to make friends.”
    


            He then ordered the firing of eight senior officials and sent a memo demanding information about all current and former employees who had any involvement in January 6 investigations.
    


            The request became a point of contention between the FBI and DOJ, sparking two lawsuits that aimed to stop the collection or release of any such information, saying that its release would put FBI employees in danger.
    


            His most high-profile controversy has been dropping federal corruption charges against Adams.
    


            Adams was charged in September 2024 with five federal charges of bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy and soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals.
    


            In a memo to prosecutors in February, Bove cited two reasons as to why the case should be dropped: It had been tainted by publicity, and it was preventing Adams from doing his job, which included helping Trump with his immigration crackdown.
    


            Federal prosecutors at first rebuffed his demand to drop the case, and some quit in protest, including the interim US Attorney in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, and the acting chief of the public integrity section of the department.
    


            Bove ended up personally arguing for the case to be dismissed. Judge Dale Ho ultimately agreed to do so in April 2025.
    


            Bove's handling of the Adams case has been the focus of many of the objections to his judicial nomination.
    


            Even the conservative The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board wrote Tuesday, “… his recent handling of the case against New York May Eric Adams doesn't inspire confidence.”
    


            Justice Connection, a coalition of former Justice Department officials, released a video on Monday with statements from formal federal prosecutors warning the public of Bove's alleged unlawful practices.
    


            Ryan Crosswell, a federal prosecutor for more than a decade, was one of the lawyers who resigned over the case.
    


            “We don't bring charges or dismiss them based on political loyalties. Emil Bove asked us to base a prosecutorial decision not on the facts, not on the law, but on a political calculation,” Crosswell says in the video.
    


            “He took on a hard job the first five weeks of the administration doing what the president was elected to do,” said the senior Justice Department official. “Whether someone is qualified to be a judge is not determined by what they did over five-to-six-week period of administration.”
    


            Bove has also drawn scrutiny for his approach to executing the president's aggressive goals on immigration.
    


            On Tuesday, Erez Reuveni, the former acting deputy director for the Office of Immigration Litigation, sent a whistleblower letter to members of Congress and independent investigators in the executive branch regarding Bove's alleged conduct.
    


            Reuveni was an immigration attorney who lost his job after working on the case of mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia.
    


            In the wake of these controversies, the Justice Department points to accomplishments that have occurred under Bove's leadership, including securing the transfer of 29 cartel leaders to face charges in the US. Bove was also a part of the Justice Department team that worked with the DEA to execute the largest fentanyl seizure in history.
    


            But his former colleague says Bove's varied experience is what makes him perfect for the federal bench.
    


            “He has seen it from both sides – he has worked in a federal prosecutors' office, he has worked at DOJ, and he worked in the private sector and defended people targeted by the federal government,” they said. “He is attuned to overreach. He is exactly who you would want on federal bench.”
    


            Unlike some other judicial nominees, particularly those to appellate courts, Bove doesn't have a record of judicial writings that would ordinarily give lawmakers and the public a view into his legal beliefs and principles.
    


            On Wednesday, Bove testified that if confirmed to the bench he would adhere to a conservative judicial philosophy in which jurists read the law for its plain meaning without considering legislative history and other factors.
    


            Asked by Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley what his general approach would be when reviewing an “ambiguous” statute, Bove explained that he would employ a so-called textualist reading of the law in question – embracing a judicial philosophy championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a giant of the conservative legal movement.
    


            “I would consult the context of the operative phrase, consider the statutory structure, look at usages of similar terms by the operative legislature at the time in question … and try to garner as much as can be from those sources, those textual indications,” Bove explained.
    


            He continued: “In the event that I think that those textual considerations don't resolve the matter, philosophically, I would be inclined to exercise restraint and not insert myself or a panel of the 3rd Circuit, if I was confirmed, into a position of declaring what the meaning of the ambiguity is as opposed to deferring back to the legislature on that topic.”

Chinese and Hong Kong scientists succeed in animal trials, but potential problems include risk of devices being left in body and public suspicions

Swarms of tiny robots, each no larger than a speck of dust, could be deployed to cure stubborn infected sinuses before being blown out through the nose into a tissue, researchers have claimed.

The micro-robots are a fraction of the width of a human hair and have been inserted successfully into animal sinuses in pre-clinical trials by researchers at universities in China and Hong Kong.

Swarms are injected into the sinus cavity via a duct threaded through the nostril and guided to their target by electromagnetism, where they can be made to heat up and catalyse chemical reactions to wipe out bacterial infections. There are hopes the precisely targeted technology could eventually reduce reliance on antibiotics and other generalised medicines.

The tiny devices are part of the expanding field of micro- and nano-robots for use in medicine. They have also been developed to deliver drugs and to remove bacteria from medical implants such as stents and hernia meshes.

Experts believe they could be in clinical use for treating infections in bladders, intestines and sinuses in five to 10 years. Scientists in China, Switzerland, the US and the UK are developing more sophisticated versions capable of moving through the bloodstream.

The latest development came from a collaboration of academics at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, and universities in Guangxi, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Yangzhou and Macau.

Researchers in the emerging field acknowledge risks include some of the tiny micro-robots being left behind after treatment which could cause longer-term side effects. Another potential problem, cited by technology experts, is public suspicion at the thought of welcoming robots into the human body and conspiracy theories arising around fears the robots could be activated without consent.

The latest breakthrough, based on animal rather than human trials, involves magnetic particles “doped” with copper atoms which clinicians insert with a catheter before guiding to their target under a magnetic field.

The swarms can be heated up by reacting to light from an optical fibre that is also inserted into the body as part of the therapy. This allows the micro-robots to loosen up and penetrate viscous pus that forms a barrier to the infection site. The light source also prompts the micro-robots to disrupt bacterial cell walls and release reactive oxygen species that kill the bacteria.

The study, published in Nature Robotics, showed the robots were capable of eradicating bacteria from pig sinuses and could clear infections in live rabbits with “no obvious tissue damage”.

The researchers have produced a model of how the technology could work on a human being, with the robot swarms being deployed in operating theatre conditions, allowing doctors to see their progress by using X-rays. Future applications could include tackling bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, stomach, intestine, bladder and urethra, they suggested.

“Our proposed micro-robotic therapeutic platform offers the advantages of non-invasiveness, minimal resistance, and drug-free intervention,” they said.

Prof Sylvain Martel, director of the Nano Robotics Laboratory at the Polytechnique de Montréal in Canada, who was not involved in the research, said the science seemed effective.

“It's like a rocket that you can direct with a magnetic field,” he said.

He predicted micro-robots could be available for treatments in three to five years but possibly not for another decade, as regulators still need to approve their use and the manufacturing processes, which differ from those of standard pharmaceuticals.

“The main advantage with micro-robots is the targeting,” Martel said. “Instead of taking medicine that goes into the bloodstream and a small quantity goes to the right location, you can target.”

He said the public would soon set aside any fears over the idea of having robotic devices in their bodies.

“Maybe at the beginning [they will be afraid],” he said. “But they will get used to it pretty quickly.”

Dr Andrea Soltoggio, a reader in artificial intelligence at Loughborough University, said: “The public may be suspicious about non-biological objects like nano-robots being inserted into our bodies. It may even trigger conspiracy theories.

“But it is important to look at what nano-robots are designed for. In this case, we see an example of a targeted intervention to reduce or eradicate an infection with a localised action.

“Nano-robots' behaviour is often simpler and more targeted than many drugs and they could effectively complement a wide range of therapies.”

The Israeli-run Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which uses private US military firms, has been condemned by the UN.

The anti-poverty group Oxfam America has issued a forceful response to reporting that the Trump administration plans to give tens of millions dollars to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed aid organization which uses private U.S. military firms and whose rollout the United Nations and international aid groups have strongly objected to.

Reuters was first to report on Tuesday that the Trump administration plans to give $30 million to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). A document reviewed by the outlet shows that the amount was authorized last week under a “priority directive” from the White House and the U.S. Department of State. Per Reuters, $7 million has already been dispersed. Sources told the outlet that the administration may approve separate monthly grants for the entity.

Oxfam America president and CEO Abby Maxman said in a statement on Tuesday that the Trump administration is poised to shell out for an aid organization “formed to distribute food parcels without any grounding in the reality of the crisis in Gaza.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Maxman accused GHF of delivering only a fraction of the number of meals that the population needs and alleged the group is distributing food that families can't prepare without fuel and clean water. She also said the organization has pushed aid further out of reach for the vulnerable populations who can't walk long distances to its distribution sites.

“We urge the Trump administration and Congress to instead put its full support behind funding and ensuring safe access for established humanitarian organizations to do the work that is proven to save lives,” added Maxman.

She also highlighted that the distribution sites have been marred by violence.

The U.N.'s human rights office said on Tuesday that at least 410 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces “while trying to fetch from controversial new aid hubs in Gaza — a likely war crime,” according to a U.N. News article posted that same day.

Jonathan Whittall, the head of U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told journalists on Monday that since Israel's total blockade was partially lifted in late May, “people have been killed almost daily while trying to get food.”

In a statement shared with CBS on Tuesday, GHF pushed back on what it called “false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites.” The group also said that the “Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any U.N. convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents,” according to CBS, whose story focused on comments from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East commissioner general decrying GHF.

In that same story, CBS reported that the Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in Gaza over the last day. Fifty-one of those people had died near GHF sites, per CBS, citing the Gaza Ministry of Health.

And on Monday, over a dozen human rights organizations sent a letter to GHF calling for an end to the “privatized, militarized” GHF aid model and urging any parties involved with GHF and the international community in general to press for aid to be distributed through established international relief operations.

“Individuals and corporate entities involved in the planning, financing, or execution of the GHF scheme may incur criminal liability — including under universal jurisdiction statutes — for aiding and abetting war crimes such as the forcible displacement of civilians, starvation as a method of warfare, and denial of humanitarian access,” the letter warned.

The groups behind the letter include the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the Center for Applied Legal Studies, and others.

Hamas militants plant bomb on Israeli military vehicle in Khan Younis, causing it to catch fire

Middle East crisis – live updates

Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in a Hamas attack in the southern Gaza Strip, the Israeli military said on Wednesday, one of the deadliest incidents for the force in months. Meanwhile, Israeli attacks have killed 74 people in the Palestinian territory over the past 24 hours, according to local health authorities.

The seven Israeli soldiers, in the 605th combat engineering battalion, were killed on Tuesday after militants planted a bomb on their vehicle while they were driving in Khan Younis, causing it to catch fire. Hamas later claimed responsibility for the attack.

“Rescue forces and helicopters were dispatched to the scene and made attempts to extract the soldiers but were unsuccessful,” said Brig Gen Effie Defrin, an Israeli army spokesperson, on Wednesday. He added that the 605th battalion was finding and demolishing tunnels, as well as killing militants, in Khan Younis.

Their deaths brought the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza since 7 October 2023 to 879.

More than 56,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Gaza by Israel, according to the health ministry, since the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.

At least 40 Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza were shot by Israeli forces on Tuesday, local medics and officials said.

The incident comes as Israel ends its war with Iran, agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire on Tuesday.

Fighting started anew in Gaza in March, when Israel restarted its war after refusing to move to a second phase of a ceasefire, which could have led to a more permanent truce. Since then, negotiations for a second ceasefire have borne little progress, with Hamas insisting on a total end to the war in Gaza – a demand Israel has rejected.

Since March, humanitarian conditions in the beleaguered strip have deteriorated. Famine-like conditions reign after Israel imposed a nearly two-month siege on any humanitarian aid into the country. Unicef warned last week that 60% of water production facilities in Gaza were not functioning and that there was a 50% increase in acute child malnutrition from April to May.

More than 500 people have been shot dead by Israeli forces as they travelled to get food from a new US- and Israel-backed private organisation called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

Chaos has reigned as hungry Palestinians have had to walk miles and navigate the complicated rules that the GHF and Israel have imposed to access food, with almost daily scenes of Israeli soldiers shooting dozens of people at the sites.

The GHF has been condemned as potentially being complicit in war crimes, for what aid groups have alleged are its violations of the principles of neutrality and independence, pillars of humanitarian work.

On Wednesday, the US president, Donald Trump, said that US strikes on Iran – which targeted three nuclear facilities – could help lead to a breakthrough on Gaza ceasefire negotiations.

“I think great progress is being made on Gaza. Because of the attack that we made, I think we're going to have some very good news. I think that it helped a little bit, it showed a lot of power,” Trump said at a press conference at a Nato summit in the Netherlands.

There have been calls within Israel for a Gaza ceasefire, with Israeli officials and media figures urging the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to end the war. Moshe Gafni, a member of the Israeli Knesset and head of the United Torah Judaism alliance, criticised the continuation of the war in an interview on Wednesday.

“I don't understand at this moment [why we are still fighting there]. I don't understand what the need is … We need some kind of Trump here with us to say: ‘OK, that's it!'” Gafni said.

More rightwing members of the Israeli government have rejected calls for a ceasefire, with the extremist finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, saying on Wednesday that the Israeli military could defeat Hamas in Gaza within two months.

Israel has said that its aim is to return the remaining 50 hostages held in Gaza, 30 of whom are presumed dead.

The last US ceasefire draft involved a 60-day pause in fighting, and redoubled efforts towards long-term peace, as well as the release of half of the living hostages and half of the deceased. Hamas previously proposed releasing fewer hostages as well as including a permanent end to the war in the ceasefire agreement.

On Tuesday, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a statement calling for the ceasefire with Iran to be expanded to Gaza.

“We call on the government to engage in urgent negotiations that will bring home all of the hostages and end the war. Those who can achieve a ceasefire with Iran can also end the war in Gaza,” the forum said in a statement.

Presidents must issue reports on every military action within two days — something Trump didn't do with the Iran strike.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), an ardent loyalist to President Donald Trump, is rejecting the idea that the current commander-in-chief must adhere to the War Powers Act, a half-century-old law that is meant to rein in presidential misuse and abuse of the U.S. military.

Instead, Johnson told reporters on Tuesday that the law itself is unconstitutional, citing a dubious reading of the document.

“Many respected constitutional experts argue that the War Powers Act is itself unconstitutional,” said Johnson, without naming specific experts. “I'm persuaded by that argument.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The speaker added that he believes the law is a “violation of the [Constitution's] Article II powers of the commander-in-chief.”

Johnson also rejected demands for compliance with the law following Trump's military strikes in Iran.

“The strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities were clearly within President Trump's Article II powers as commander-in-chief. It shouldn't even be a dispute,” he said.

Both Congress and the president are granted some control over the use of the military. But while Johnson is correct that Article II describes the president as “commander-in-chief” of the armed forces, he has disregarded the congressional powers laid out in Article I.

Congress, for example, is the only branch of government that has the power “to declare war” — a power the institution last exercised during World War II, despite the U.S. engaging in numerous military conflicts since. Congress also has the power to “raise and support armies,” and to “make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.”

That last statement gives rise to the argument that the War Powers Act is constitutional, despite Johnson's assertions to the contrary.

The War Powers Act stipulates time limits that presidents must adhere to when it comes to use of the military. The law, for example, only allows presidents to use military action in a specific campaign for 60 days before requiring congressional approval; for the military action to continue beyond that time frame, Congress must grant an extension of that use, pass a resolution authorizing military force, or pass a declaration of war — with some exceptions in very specific circumstances. 

Trump's use of the military to attack Iran appears to be over, well before that 60-day limit. However, he may still run afoul of the War Powers Act, as another stipulation in the law requires that every military action taken without congressional approval be reported on to leaders of Congress within 48 hours. 

The law further states that:

The President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situation where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and after every such introduction shall consult regularly with the Congress until United States Armed Forces are no longer engaged in hostilities or have been removed from such situations.

It also states that presidents must submit a report to the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate, describing the “circumstances necessitating the introduction of United States Armed Forces,” as well as the “constitutional and legislative authority” giving them the ability to take the military action, and the “estimated scope and duration of the hostilities or involvement.”

The White House did not provide any such report to those individuals. 

After the attack on Iran over the last weekend, some Democratic and Republican lawmakers had a rare but brief moment of bipartisanship, suggesting that an impeachment vote be held against Trump for violating the law. But after Trump announced the ceasefire between Iran and Israel (as uneasy as it may be), Republicans supportive of that idea backed off.

“I talked to the speaker on the floor just now and told him we wouldn't push [an impeachment resolution] if the cease-fire holds, so it's really in their court,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), who had co-sponsored an impeachment measure, said on Monday evening. 

The House overwhelmingly voted to table the impeachment measure on Tuesday, with 216 Republicans and 128 Democrats — 344 legislators in total — backing that decision. Just 79 Democrats (and zero Republicans) voted to advance the measure.

Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), the author of the impeachment measure that was defeated, blasted the House's decision to ignore the Trump administration's blatant disregard of the War Powers Act.

“President Trump's unilateral, unprovoked use of force without congressional authorization or notice constitutes an abuse of power when there was no imminent threat to the United States,” Green said.

Surveys have shown that most Americans are concerned about the president's intervening actions in the Israel-Iran conflict. A recent Economist/YouGov poll, for example, shows that nearly 1 in 2 Americans (45 percent) do not believe Trump has a clear policy in mind when it comes to Iran. And a Reuters/Ipsos poll published earlier this week finds that a plurality of Americans, 45 percent, opposed the military campaign, while only 36 percent approved. That same poll found that 84 percent of Americans are concerned that the conflict between the two countries will grow.

            New York City is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in, a fact that guided many New Yorkers' votes in Tuesday's mayoral primary election.
    


            Like his fellow candidates, Zohran Mamdani has put affordability at the forefront of his campaign. But his ideas, which include rent freezes for households living in rent-stabilized units, free buses and city-run subsidized grocery stores, have made him stand out.
    


            Mamdani, a 33-year-old three-term state assemblyman, is inching closer to seeing his vision come to fruition after fellow front-runner former Gov. Andrew Cuomo conceded the race to him late Tuesday. Still, Cuomo left the door open to running as an independent in November, which incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is also doing.
    


            If Mamdani ultimately wins, some businesses and labor groups will be celebrating while others are bracing for potential economic consequences.
    


            Critics say his proposals could backfire.
    


            Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who served under former President Bill Clinton, said in a post on X Wednesday morning that he was “profoundly alarmed” about the future of the Democratic party and the country by Mamdani's political stances, including his “Trotskyite economic policies.”
    


            He said he hopes Mamdani, “who showed great ability to learn and adapt during his campaign, will continue to evolve,” including by reassuring New Yorkers of his commitment to a “market economy as an American ideal.”
    


            Mamdani's campaign did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            One group, the Partnership for New York City, which represents a group of nearly 300 CEOs, said many of Mamdani's proposals are pipe dreams. (The group does not endorse mayoral candidates.)
    


            The group's CEO, Kathryn Wylde, said Mamdani's proposals to freeze rent for four years for over a million people in affordable housing and raise the corporate tax rate to 11.5% would hurt New Yorkers.

            “When he says, ‘I am going to tax the rich and tax corporations,' that appeals to young people who say, ‘Oh good, that's not me.' But overall, ultimately, they are stuck with rising costs if businesses have to raise their prices because of rising costs,” Wylde told CNN.
    


            Kenny Burgos, president of the New York Apartment Association, a group that primarily represents rent-regulated property owners, said Mamdani's proposed rent freeze could make it harder for landlords to maintain their properties, which are often older.
    


            For existing tenants, their buildings “could completely deteriorate to a point that no one can live in them.” Or they could be forced to allow the city to manage their properties, which Burgos argued could not be done effectively.
    


            The New York Apartment Association, which has backed Cuomo, supports increasing housing vouchers and targeted rent freezes for some households. “But blanket rent freezes are dangerous,” Burgos said.
    


            Mamdani also proposed building 200,000 new affordable housing units funded by the city.
    


            Burgos raised concerns there, too. “I don't know who invests in a property or invests in an area where the administration is proposing to cap your revenue, freeze your investments. I mean, where does this work?”
    


            Mamdani is quick to brush off such critiques.
    


            “It's not complicated: landlords know they can make a lot more money if Andrew Cuomo is in City Hall,” Mamdani said in a post on X this month. “That's why they're going all in.”
    


            The United Auto Workers union said it endorsed Mamdani because of his working-class agenda. The UAW represents 20,000 members in New York City.
    


            UAW president Shawn Fain praised Mamdani for showing up to picket lines and fighting for better wages.
    


            “The working class is done with business as usual,” Fain said in a statement Wednesday night after Mamdani declared victory. “We were proud to be the first union to endorse Zohran because it's time for a political movement that puts the working class first.”
    


            Mamdani's labor platform calls for additional collective bargaining laws with better wages and working conditions across industries, like the current New York City fast food wage law that sets a minimum wage at $16.50 an hour, higher than the state's minimum of $15.50. Mamdani also said he supports a new local law that would bring New York City's minimum wage to $30 an hour by 2030.
    


            The repercussions of that kind of wage hike could be hard to predict. For example, a California law last year raised the state minimum wage for fast-food workers by $4 an hour to $20 an hour. Some research estimates that businesses reduced their payrolls by thousands, turned more to automation and raised prices to afford the wage increase. However, other research did not reach those conclusions, finding only anecdotal evidence of those effects.
    


            Perhaps Mamdani's most well-known proposal calls for building a network of city-run subsidized grocery stores that would be exempt from paying rent or property taxes. He claimed this would increase food availability, especially in neighborhoods where food stores have closed, at manageable prices.
    


            Billionaire John Catsimatidis, whose business, Red Apple Group, owns the grocery store chains Gristedes and D'Agostino, said if Mamdani wins, come November, “I do not want to continue to do business.” This would mean shutting down nearly 30 New York City-based grocery stores and relocating his companies' headquarters to New Jersey, he told CNN.
    


            “We don't want to do business with socialists,” said Catsimatidis, a frequent Republican donor who, along with his wife, contributed over $500,000 to President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign. The two also donated a combined $36,000 to New York's Democratic Attorney General Letitia James.
    


            “Tell our manufacturers to lower prices. If they lower prices, we'll lower prices,” he said, in response to CNN's inquiry regarding how he aims to make food more affordable.
    


            Mamdani's other proposal to potentially bring food costs down goes to the heart of some of New Yorkers' most beloved street grub.
    


            “New York City has a crisis, and it's called halal-flation,” Mamdani said in a campaign video filmed in December with street food vendors, including those selling halal food. The vendors claimed long wait times and caps on the $200 city-issued permits to sell food forced them to rent permits for nearly $20,000 from existing holders.
    


          TikTok post not found.
        


          Post has been removed or is no longer public.
        


            Vendors featured in the video said they would lower food prices if they didn't have to pay so much for permits.
    


            The Street Vendor Project, a New York nonprofit advocacy group that's part of the Urban Justice Center, helped facilitate the video with Mamdani. The group does not endorse mayoral candidates.
    


            “A lot of (the vendors) were like, ‘It's the first time a mayoral candidate jumped in my halal food cart and asked questions like: What are your problems? How can I help if I become mayor?' And it was a really inspiring moment for them,” said Mohamed Attia, managing director of the Street Vendor Project.
    


            In the video, Mamdani said he would support the Street Vendor Reform Package, a set of bills the Street Vendor Project is hoping to pass in the city council that would ensure more city licenses for vendors and give them support from the city's Department of Small Business Services.
    


            Mamdani is the only candidate to announce support for the entire package, according to Attia.

One expert said new polling shows that more support for vaccines is needed to achieve herd immunity for many diseases.

Most Americans support routine childhood vaccine requirements even as they become more politically charged, according to a new poll released Wednesday.

A survey by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the de Beaumont Foundation found that 79 percent of Americans believe parents should be required to vaccinate their children against preventable diseases to attend school. That includes 72 percent of all parents.

The support cuts across political party lines, with backing from 90 percent of Democrats, 68 percent of Republicans and 66 percent who say they agree with “Make America Great Again,” the political ideology movement aligned with President Donald Trump.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“This just shows that routine vaccination policy is not as controversial as you would believe if you were just reading news and watching influencers,” said survey lead Gillian SteelFisher, director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program and principal research scientist at Harvard Chan School. “This is pretty well agreed ground.”

The poll was conducted online and via telephone between March 10 and March 31, as measles cases soared around the country. The poll had a sample of 2,509 adults aged 18 or older, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 points. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish.

Brian C. Castrucci, president and CEO of the de Beaumont Foundation, a private philanthropy that supports public health including vaccination, said the new polling shows that the medical community must continue to hone its messaging about the need for vaccines. An increase in vaccine hesitancy — people who delay or refuse vaccination — is among the reasons for a decline in childhood vaccination rates. That can prevent herd immunity, the indirect protection of a community from an infectious disease. Some of the most contagious diseases require more than 90 percent of a population to be immune.

“While we do show really strong support for vaccines, 79 percent is a little low compared to what we actually need to get herd immunity,” Castrucci said. “And so there's a lot of work to be done in taking something that we know protects our country and protects our children.” 

Among those who support childhood vaccine requirements, vaccine effectiveness in protecting most children (90 percent) and family responsibilities to keep schools safe (87 percent) were major reasons for their positions.

American adults also overwhelmingly, at 91 percent, believed in the safety of vaccines for most children. The poll distinguished vaccines that prevent childhood diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella from vaccines that prevent COVID-19. Sixty-three percent percent believe vaccines are very safe and 28 percent believe they are somewhat safe. Just 9 percent questioned their safety — 5 percent believe they are not very safe and 4 percent believe they are not safe at all.

About 1 in 5, or 21 percent, do not support childhood vaccine requirements, with more citing the need for parental choice rather than safety concerns as a major reason for that. Among parents surveyed, 88 percent believe vaccines are safe. 

SteelFisher said the polling on parental choice can be revealing for policymakers and the medical community as they shape related health legislation and try to promote collective health choices.

“If people bring empathy to it, you can kind of tamper down some of that vitriol which we see so much and just kind of say, ‘Hey, I hear you.' We should make space for that conversation,” she said. “To me, these kind of data are a reminder you have to know what people are thinking.”

Castrucci agreed, adding that confronting the issue of parental choice will help public health professionals “in how we actively engage with people around, ‘How do you make that choice? Why is this choice important?' And what are the downsides for any one person not choosing to make this choice for themselves, their child and their family?”

The polling comes amid an inflection point in vaccine policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Doctors have increasingly expressed public alarm over Kennedy's actions on vaccines. In May, Kennedy bypassed an independent vaccine panel to announce contradictory guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant people and children. A few weeks later, he fired everyone on that panel — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP — and replaced them with members who have limited relevant experience.

ACIP, which is scheduled to meet Wednesday and Thursday, has long made recommendations that help determine Americans' access to vaccines. Vaccine experts say they'll be closely tracking the panel's actions.

Part of Kennedy's political ascension has included open skepticism of vaccines, with a series of claims over years that are not based in facts. Some of his more ardent supporters include parents. Castrucci said it will be important for doctors to keep challenging the emerging false narratives. 

“We need folks to opt in to these vaccines that we know work and that we know are safe and effective, but just citing data is not helping our argument,” he said. “And so we have to create spaces where these conversations can happen and we can gain trust of parents so that they will opt into childhood vaccinations instead of contribute to the growing pushback that some have against them.”

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 300 others, local officials reported.

Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak said the morning strike ignited a large fire and also damaged a dormitory, a gymnasium, and an administrative building in the city.

The Russian military also struck the nearby town of Samarske, Lysak said. Casualties were reported in both locations. 

"Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded everywhere," he said.  

In Samarske, two people were killed, and 14 injured. Eight were hospitalized, with half of them in critical condition.

"As of now, more than 160 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, 11 people have died," President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media, adding: "The rubble is still being cleared, so the death toll may, unfortunately, increase."

Around 1:30 p.m. local time on June 25, Lysak reported that the death toll in Dnipro rose to 19 and that more than 300 people were injured in the attack.

Almost a hundred of the victims remain in hospital, according to Lysak.

Ukraine's national railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, said that a train traveling from Odesa to Zaporizhzhia was damaged in the attack. 

"Ukrzaliznytsia is preparing a replacement train in Dnipro to evacuate passengers to Zaporizhzhia," the company said in a statement.

In an update, Ukrzaliznytsia said no passengers or railway workers were killed in the attack, though several people sustained injuries and are receiving medical care.

The attack came as NATO leaders convened for a high-level summit in The Hague. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on June 23 that Russia remains the alliance's most immediate and long-term threat.



"They (Ukraine) do want to have the anti missiles. As they call them, the Patriots, and we're going to see if we can make some available," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

"I consider him (Russian President Vladimir Putin) a person I think is misguided," U.S. President Donald Trump said speaking at a NATO press conference in The Hague on June 25.



The Kyiv Independent's Martin Fornusek sits down with Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna on the sidelines of the NATO summit to discuss U.S. President Donald Trump's commitment to the Alliance, how the Israel-Iran escalation affects NATO's focus on Ukraine, and why Europe must take more responsibility for its own defense.

"We covered all the truly important issues," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. "We discussed how to achieve a ceasefire and a real peace. We spoke about how to protect our people. We appreciate the attention and the readiness to help bring peace closer."

The leaders also reaffirmed support for Ukraine, stating that direct contributions to Ukraine's defense and industrial capacity will be counted toward the 5% total.

"The Russians are trying to fully control all movement in the city using their drones," a military spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent. 

Oleg Borsuk, a 61-year-old Ukrainian national, allegedly oversaw the development and modernization of satellite guidance systems (GPS/GLONASS) used in Russian missiles.

Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, local officials reported.

The move represents the U.K.'s first direct use of Russia-linked funds to buy weaponry for Kyiv.

"Obviously we'll be discussing his difficulties, he's got a little difficulty," U.S. President Donald Trump said.



"If we did what everybody here wants us to do, and that is come in and crush them with more sanctions, we probably lose our ability to talk to them about the ceasefire and then who's talking to them?" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.

According to U.S. law enforcement, the suspect worked as the director of a preschool in Pima County, Arizona, and committed a series of sexual offenses against four children aged 4 to 9 between 1984 and 1991.

According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russian forces launched 71 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys from multiple directions, including Bryansk, Millerovo, Kursk, and occupied Crimea. Ukraine's air defenses destroyed 52 of them.

President calls intelligence ‘inconclusive', while defence secretary describes harm to facilities as ‘moderate to severe'

Donald Trump and the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, have admitted to some doubt over the scale of the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear sites by the US bombing at the weekend, after a leaked Pentagon assessment said the Iranian programme had been set back by only a few months.

“The intelligence was very inconclusive,” Trump told journalists at a Nato summit in The Hague, introducing an element of uncertainty for the first time after several days of emphatic declarations that the destruction had been total. “The intelligence says we don't know. It could've been very severe. That's what the intelligence suggests.”

The president then appeared to revert to his claim that “it was very severe. There was obliteration”. Later in the day, he claimed that was the conclusion from “collected intelligence”, and that the Iranian programme had been set back “decades”.

Trump also likened the US use of massive bunker-buster bombs on the Fordow and Natanz uranium enrichment sites to the impact of the US nuclear weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the second world war, using the comparison specifically in reference to their impact in ending a conflict.

Over the course of the day, Trump's claims became more far-reaching, even rejecting reports from the nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), that Iran's 400kg stock of 60% enriched uranium could no longer be accounted for, and appeared to have been moved. Earlier in the week, the vice president, JD Vance, had appeared to admit the US did not know where the highly enriched uranium was, and said it would be a subject of discussions with the Iranians.

Trump claimed there would be a US-Iran meeting next week to negotiate once more about Tehran's nuclear programme. “We're going to talk to them next week with Iran, we may sign an agreement, I don't know,” he said, before adding: “I don't care if I have an agreement or not.”

Trump was also markedly less confident on Wednesday about the ceasefire he had previous declared was “unlimited” and “going to go forever”, even suggesting that a return to conflict could be imminent.

“I dealt with both and they're both tired, exhausted … and can it start again? I guess someday, it can. It could maybe start soon,” he said.

Accompanying Trump to the summit, Hegseth also seemed to downgrade his earlier declaration that Iran's ability to make nuclear weapons in the future had been “obliterated”.

On Wednesday the defence secretary described the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities by US and Israeli bombing as “moderate to severe”. He pledged there would be an FBI investigation of Pentagon leaks, but also claimed the leaked information was false.

Meanwhile the Israeli military said it was still trying to assess the damage inflicted by the bombing campaign, but a senior officer insisted: “We pushed them years backward.”

A statement issued on behalf of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC), said the strikes had destroyed Fordow's “critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable”. It added that the combined US and Israeli strikes “set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years”.

On Tuesday night CNN reported on a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) initial assessment, which tentatively concluded that the deeply buried Fordow site and the underground facilities at Natanz had not been destroyed, and key components of the nuclear programme, including centrifuges, were capable of being restarted within months.

The CNN account of the leak was independently confirmed as accurate by the Guardian and other outlets. The Washington Post noted that it was categorised as “low-confidence”, though a source told the Guardian that further analysis could find even less damage than the initial DIA estimate.

The DIA assessment also found that much of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, which would provide the fuel for making any future nuclear warhead, had been moved before the strikes and may have been moved to other secret nuclear sites maintained by Iran.

For several years, a new facility has been excavated under a mountain, just to the south of the original Natanz facility.

Providing an Israeli perspective on Wednesday, the IDF spokesperson Brig Gen Effie Defrin said the results of the air force's bombing sorties had been “even better than we expected”.

“I can say right now that the estimate is that we struck a significant blow to [Iran's] nuclear infrastructure,” Defrin said. “I can say that we pushed them years backward.”

CNN reported that Israeli intelligence estimates of the setback inflicted on Iran's nuclear aspirations were two years.

The IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, rejected what he described as an “hourglass approach” involving different assessments of how many months or years it would take Iran to rebuild, arguing it distracted from finding a long-term solution to an issue that had not been resolved.

“In any case, the technological knowledge is there and the industrial capacity is there. That, no one can deny. So we need to work together with them,” Grossi said, adding that his priority was the return of IAEA inspectors to the nuclear sites, the only way he said they could be properly assessed.

Nuclear experts described the development as a potential disaster for nonproliferation efforts, and warned of the dangers of Iran deciding to eject the remaining IAEA inspectors in the country and leave the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The treaty obliges Iran and other non-nuclear weapon countries to refrain from any efforts to make a bomb, and to undergo monitoring and verification.

Iran's parliament is preparing a bill clearing the way for a departure from the NPT.

In a remark to reporters a day earlier, Trump had said: 'We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing'

Ukraine's security service (SBU) has charged in absentia a former defense engineer with treason, accusing him of helping Russia target Ukrainian cities by developing navigation systems for cruise and ballistic missiles, the SBU said on June 25.

According to the agency, Oleh Borsuk, a 61-year-old Ukrainian national, fled to Russia in 2009 after resigning from a defense plant in Cherkasy Oblast. He later became deputy general director of Moscow-based design bureau "Navis," a major player in Russia's military-industrial complex.

Borsuk allegedly oversaw the development and modernization of satellite guidance systems (GPS/GLONASS) used in Russian missiles. In 2023 alone, under his leadership, nearly 3,200 satellite navigation units were produced, including those for Iskander tactical missile systems, the SBU said.

These systems are also used in missiles like the Kh-101, Kh-59, and Kalibr — weapons frequently deployed in Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.

The deadliest attacks include the July 8, 2024, strike on the Okhmatdyt children hospital in Kyiv, which killed two adults, including a doctor, and injured more than 50 people, including children. The hospital was hit by a Kh-101 cruise missile in accordance with a programmed route.

Another devastating strike occurred on June 17, when a massive missile and drone assault on Kyiv killed 30 people and injured 172 others. One of the deadliest impacts was a direct hit on a residential building by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, which caused the complete collapse of an entire section of the nine-story residential building. 

According to a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force Yurii Ihnat, the building was struck by a Kh-101 missile.

The SBU has charged Borsuk in absentia under Ukraine's Criminal Code for treason committed under martial law. 

"Since the perpetrator is hiding in the territory of the Russian Federation, comprehensive measures are underway to bring him to justice for crimes against our state," the SBU said.

Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments.

"They (Ukraine) do want to have the anti missiles. As they call them, the Patriots, and we're going to see if we can make some available," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

"I consider him (Russian President Vladimir Putin) a person I think is misguided," U.S. President Donald Trump said speaking at a NATO press conference in The Hague on June 25.



The Kyiv Independent's Martin Fornusek sits down with Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna on the sidelines of the NATO summit to discuss U.S. President Donald Trump's commitment to the Alliance, how the Israel-Iran escalation affects NATO's focus on Ukraine, and why Europe must take more responsibility for its own defense.

"We covered all the truly important issues," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. "We discussed how to achieve a ceasefire and a real peace. We spoke about how to protect our people. We appreciate the attention and the readiness to help bring peace closer."

The leaders also reaffirmed support for Ukraine, stating that direct contributions to Ukraine's defense and industrial capacity will be counted toward the 5% total.

"The Russians are trying to fully control all movement in the city using their drones," a military spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent. 

Oleg Borsuk, a 61-year-old Ukrainian national, allegedly oversaw the development and modernization of satellite guidance systems (GPS/GLONASS) used in Russian missiles.

Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, local officials reported.

The move represents the U.K.'s first direct use of Russia-linked funds to buy weaponry for Kyiv.

"Obviously we'll be discussing his difficulties, he's got a little difficulty," U.S. President Donald Trump said.



"If we did what everybody here wants us to do, and that is come in and crush them with more sanctions, we probably lose our ability to talk to them about the ceasefire and then who's talking to them?" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.

According to U.S. law enforcement, the suspect worked as the director of a preschool in Pima County, Arizona, and committed a series of sexual offenses against four children aged 4 to 9 between 1984 and 1991.

According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russian forces launched 71 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys from multiple directions, including Bryansk, Millerovo, Kursk, and occupied Crimea. Ukraine's air defenses destroyed 52 of them.

ASHGABAT, June 25. /TASS/. As the Doomsday Clock edges ever closer to midnight, Russia is racing to pull the hands back by working to avert nuclear catastrophe, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

"Global security is perhaps the most critical issue today - especially as the infamous Doomsday Clock continues to tick toward midnight," Lavrov said during an address to staff, faculty, and students at Turkmenistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Institute of International Relations. "It is essential to prevent such a scenario, and we are actively engaged in efforts to avert a catastrophe."

According to Lavrov, discussions about the potential outbreak of World War III have become disturbingly routine, particularly against the backdrop of rising revanchist sentiment in Europe.

"It's become almost commonplace to talk about the possibility of World War III," he said. "That's especially alarming given the resurgence of aggressive, belligerent attitudes across Europe. As if two world wars - and countless smaller conflicts over the centuries - weren't enough for today's EU leaders."

Lavrov also pointed to what he described as encouraging developments in global politics.

"There are, however, some positive trends," he noted. "One of them is the emphasis on realism and common sense expressed by the Trump administration, which bases its foreign policy on national interests - both of the United States and of other sovereign nations."

"That's a key difference from the previous Biden administration, which was entirely consumed by a neoliberal, hegemonic agenda," the minister concluded.

Janetta McKenzie is director of the Pembina Institute's oil and gas program.

As Canada's new federal government settles in, we're hearing a repeated commitment to Canada becoming a world-leading “energy superpower.”

In this moment of Canadian unity, as we grapple with challenging trade and sovereignty dynamics with the United States, what should it mean?

In the past, building more fossil-fuel infrastructure – in particular, pipelines – was an obvious choice, because everything was fossil-fuel-powered, and it seemed like it always would be. But now, Canadian decision-makers – laser-focused on enhancing our economic resilience and energy security – must look at global trends and make a call.

The oil-and-gas sector faces a sustained decline, with global demand for oil set to peak in the 2030s, if not sooner. Even demand for LNG is looking increasingly uncertain, with the majority of B.C.'s proposed LNG terminals set to come online in an oversaturated market full of low-cost competitors.

Then there's whether oil and gas build-out benefits Canadians in the ways we've been told. When oil and gas profits skyrocketed as the pandemic subsided, new investment and jobs didn't. Instead, companies increased the returns to shareholders.

What if we thought about how to position our economy for long-term economic prosperity and energy security by investing in the best bets, given global energy trends?

Opinion: Canada can help its allies ditch their dependence on Russian energy

Opinion: To be an energy superpower, Canada must set aside flawed green ideology

In 2025, global investment in clean energy is set to double that of fossil fuels once again, $2.2-trillion to $1.1-trillion. In 2024, investment in low-carbon solutions – such as electrified transport and renewables – grew by 11 per cent, hitting a record $2.1-trillion. All of these trends are driven by dramatic declines in the costs of new power generation and electrification technology.

The global transition to clean energy is accelerating. Becoming an “energy superpower” means equipping ourselves to lead in that world.

Building out a clean, modernized electricity grid – removing barriers to interprovincial electricity transmission, and implementing a predictable regulatory system that favours sustainable development – would enhance our domestic energy security, allowing provinces like Ontario and Quebec to generate more of their own power.

That abundance of low-emitting power would also show the world that Canada is ready for business. As the U.S. pauses its offshore wind approvals, for example, Canada could be ready to provide the clean power that emerging and existing sectors need. Alberta, whose oil and gas sector is vulnerable to trade disruptions with the U.S., could benefit from removing barriers currently throttling investment in local renewable power, too.

In 2025, an “energy superpower” does not invest taxpayer dollars or slacken regulatory guardrails to build new fossil-fuel infrastructure. Some fossil-fuel projects, such as cross-country pipelines, would cost tens of billions and take a decade to build. No private-sector company has put their hand up to take on this type of infrastructure.

This doesn't mean we stop oil and gas production. But it does mean addressing the elephant in the room: Oil and gas producers are responsible for about one-third of Canada's national emissions for 5 per cent of GDP. Oil sands production is incredibly emissions-intensive, and those emissions continue to grow. In 2023, the oil sands alone emitted 80 per cent more emissions than Canada's entire electricity system.

Last month in Calgary, Canada's Energy and Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson claimed, “Every barrel of responsibly produced Canadian oil and every kilowatt of clean Canadian power can displace less clean, riskier energy elsewhere in the world.”

But can Canada claim to be a “responsible” oil and gas producer if the industry isn't fulfilling its commitments to responsible production? This means reducing emissions, and quickly. But despite years of announcements, companies have not meaningfully invested in decarbonization absent policy requiring them to do so — despite millions of taxpayer dollars on the table for carbon-capture projects.

We clearly need an efficient and effective industrial regulatory regime, despite calls from industry to deregulate.

Let's remember why regulation exists: to ensure stable, responsible and predictable energy development with as few negative impacts as possible; to ensure Indigenous communities are fully empowered in any development on their land; and to ensure project proponents produce enough benefits for Canadians to offset the environmental and social impacts of their operations.

If fast-tracking select industrial projects — as the federal government intends, and as B.C. is doing with 18 energy and mining projects — there's an opportunity to improve our regulatory effectiveness. But red-tape reduction for its own sake would lead to new fossil fuel infrastructure built with lax environmental standards and inadequate constraints on pollution, and at high risk of becoming stranded assets in a declining global marketplace.

New York is facing the prospect of electing a staunchly socialist pro-Palestine mayor who wants to control food prices and almost double the minimum wage.

The city appears to be lurching to the Left after Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old outsider, clinched the Democratic nomination, defeating Andrew Cuomo, the moderate establishment candidate.

Mr Mamdani is a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause with a string of celebrity endorsements and more than a million followers on Instagram.

He will contest the November election as a front-runner in a city that has not elected a Republican since 2005. But he may face stiff competition from independents.

His victory in a primary on Tuesday was seen as a litmus test for a Democrat party still licking its wounds following Donald Trump's victory in November.

Born in Uganda, his family moved to New York when he was seven. He has posted campaign videos speaking entirely in Urdu and mixed with Bollywood clips. He also speaks Spanish.

He is a fierce critic of Israel's war in Gaza, putting him at odds with much of the Democratic establishment.

His Muslim faith has also been weaponised by some Maga Republicans, including Charlie Kirk, a populist media personality and podcaster with access to Mr Trump's inner circle.

“Twenty-four years ago a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11. Now a Muslim socialist is on pace to run New York City,” Mr Kirk tweeted.

He added: “The power centres of the West will have Muslim mayors. You become what you import.”

But it is Mr Mamdani's policies that have been most eye-catching.

In videos posted during the primary race that routinely went viral – particularly on TikTok – he called for free bus rides, universal childcare for New Yorkers with children aged six weeks to five years, and rent controls.

He wants to plough $70 billion (£51 billion) into housing and almost double the minimum wage from $16 to $30 an hour.

One of Mr Mamdani's most controversial policies is city-controlled supermarkets, where local authorities would get to decide how much food costs. Business leaders have already threatened to leave the city over the proposal.

John Catsimatidis, the chief executive of grocery chain Gristedes, said he would consider selling or moving his stores if Mr Mamdani is elected.

“If the city of New York is going socialist, I will definitely close, or sell, or move or franchise the Gristedes locations,” he told Fox News.

During the campaign, tweets by Mr Mamdani resurfaced, which called for the New York Police Department to be defunded.

“Queer liberation means defund the police,” he said in one post in 2020.

His high-profile supporters include Emily Ratajkowski, the actress and model, Rachel Zegler, the Snow White actress who regularly posts pro-Palestinian comments on social media, and singer Lorde, who in 2017 cancelled a concert in Tel Aviv after pressure from activists.

As well as being New York's most Left-leaning mayor, he would also become the city's first Muslim leader in a city that is home to about one million Muslims.

Mr Mamdani wove his faith into his campaign, delivering speeches at mosques and speaking to voters while fasting for Ramadan.

In 2021, Mr Mamdani described himself as an anti-Zionist.

“It is Palestine that brought me into organising, and it is Palestine that I will always organise for,” he told a crowd in New York.“Anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism and in the anti-Zionist movement that I believe in and belong to, there is no room for anti-Semitism,” he added.

Last week, Mr Mamdani said that “globalise the intifada” was a legitimate expression that could be used by Palestinian supporters, which earned him staunch criticism from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.

“The very word has been used by the Holocaust Museum when translating the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising into Arabic, which is a word that means ‘struggle',” he said as he defended his position.

The museum hit back: “Since 1987, Jews have been attacked and murdered under its banner. All leaders must condemn its use and the abuse of history.”

Trip Yang, a political strategist, told the BBC the 33-year-old's victory against Mr Cuomo was the “biggest upset in modern NYC history”.

“A massive win for Zohran Mamdani that shows that when Donald Trump is president, New York Democrats want to see their leaders fight with enthusiasm and courage, and that's what Zohran showed voters.”

Mr Cuomo had looked unbeatable as he sought to make a political comeback after facing sexual assault allegations in 2021.

He told The New York Times he was still considering whether to run as an independent in November.

            President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, Emil Bove, was pushed to repeatedly deny several accusations of corruption – one made by a whistleblower at the Justice Department – during his confirmation hearing Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
    


            “I am not anybody's henchman,” Bove said. “I'm not an enforcer. I'm a lawyer from a small town, who never expected to be in an arena like this.”
    


            Trump has nominated several of his personal attorneys to top legal posts in his administration, but his nomination of Bove to the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals marks the first time he has selected one of his lawyers to serve on the federal bench.
    


            For the past six months, Bove has served as a high-ranking official in the Justice Department. In that short time, he has proven himself to be a reliable ally for the president and also been embroiled in a series of major controversies – including dropping federal charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams; investigating officials who worked on cases related to January 6, 2021; and pursuing Trump's deportation goals in ways that prompted a whistleblower to allege Bove intended to ignore court orders and mislead federal judges.
    


            Bove testified on Wednesday that the decision to drop charges against Adams was based on a “substantiated” concern “on the weaponization of the criminal justice system” in the case, though he did not elaborate.
    


            He also cited concerns “about the effect” of the prosecution on Adams' ability to govern and campaign.
    


            Sen. Richard Blumenthal lambasted Bove for not further explaining those decisions when pressed during the hearing, including over questions of whether there was an element of quid pro quo in dropping the charges.
    


            “I am absolutely flabbergasted that you would come before this committee and refuse to tell us basic facts about a case that is at the core of the challenges to the appearance of impropriety that should disqualify you,” the Connecticut Democrat said.
    


            “You were virtually the only attorney in the Department of Justice willing to go to court and make a claim that career prosecutors said violated their basic standard of ethics, and the quid pro quo was a nomination to the Court of Appeals,” Blumenthal added.
    


            Bove was also pushed repeatedly to address allegations made in a recent whistleblower complaint reported on Tuesday.
    


            The whistleblower complaint, filed by a recently fired DOJ attorney and sent to members of Congress, alleges that in a meeting in March, Bove “stated that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts ‘f**k you'” and ignore any orders to stop the hasty deportation of migrants to a prison in El Salvador.
    


            During his opening statements and in response to several questions from senators during Wednesday's hearing, Bove continued to deny allegations of wrongdoing.
    


            “I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge,” Bove said.
    


            The hearing Wednesday was the first time Democratic lawmakers had the chance to grill the reclusive Bove on his time at the Justice Department and his work for Trump. If confirmed, Bove would be one of roughly a dozen judges with the power to review federal cases being appealed in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands.

            Despite his involvement in high-profile cases and controversies, Bove has mostly avoided the limelight.
    


            “He has been right there but kind of in the shadows, he doesn't go on TV, he doesn't talk to the press,” a senior Justice Department official told CNN. “He is a brilliant lawyer, he is just an amazing writer, critical thinker … he clerked for two rock star judges, he worked at Sullivan and Cromwell. He is a legit genius lawyer, but nobody knows who he is.”
    


            Bove graduated from Georgetown Law School in 2008 and then went on to spend a decade working as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he focused on international terrorism and narcotics cases.
    


            During that time Bove successfully brought narco-terrorism charges against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in 2020. He also prosecuted Ahmad Khan Rahimi, the man responsible for a 2016 pressure cooker bombing in New York that left 30 people injured. Rahimi was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
    


            A former colleague who worked with Bove describes him as an “a**-kicker … he is whip smart, has a high level of curiosity, is naturally intelligent, and extremely effective.”
    


            “I wouldn't want to be one of his adversaries,” they said.
    


            Bove joined Trump's legal team in 2023 and worked on three of Trump's criminal cases over the span of roughly 18 months. He sat second chair, alongside now-Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, to represent Trump in his New York hush money trial. Trump was ultimately found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in that case, which he is still appealing.
    


            He also worked on Trump's federal criminal cases related to alleged mishandling of classified documents and allegations of interfering with the 2020 election.
    


            Bove's resume has many of the hallmarks of a federal judge, but he has never served on the bench, and it is unclear how he would rule on major issues.
    


            “He is completely empathic and fair – he is very strategic and thoughtful about applying law to the facts. He is a brilliant writer and critical legal thinker. He will make opinions that come out of the third circuit tighter and better,” the senior Justice Department official said.
    


            Just hours after Trump took office, Bove was tapped to assume the powerful position of interim deputy attorney general – the No. 2 job at the Justice Department, which had him running the sprawling agency while Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Blanche were awaiting confirmation.
    


            His brief tenure has earned him many detractors as he tried to reshape the department to align with Trump's vision and clashed with career officials.
    


            One of Bove's first actions at the department was to issue a memo threatening to prosecute state and local officials who resist the administration's federal immigration crackdown.
    


            “The administration had a directive to depoliticize the department. He was met with instant resistance from entrenched bureaucrats who are not accustomed to change,” his former colleague told CNN. “He was there to execute a mission and institute policy – he was not there to make friends.”
    


            He then ordered the firing of eight senior officials and sent a memo demanding information about all current and former employees who had any involvement in January 6 investigations.
    


            The request became a point of contention between the FBI and DOJ, sparking two lawsuits that aimed to stop the collection or release of any such information, saying that its release would put FBI employees in danger.
    


            His most high-profile controversy has been dropping federal corruption charges against Adams.
    


            Adams was charged in September 2024 with five federal charges of bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy and soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals.
    


            In a memo to prosecutors in February, Bove cited two reasons as to why the case should be dropped: It had been tainted by publicity, and it was preventing Adams from doing his job, which included helping Trump with his immigration crackdown.
    


            Federal prosecutors at first rebuffed his demand to drop the case, and some quit in protest, including the interim US Attorney in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, and the acting chief of the public integrity section of the department.
    


            Bove ended up personally arguing for the case to be dismissed. Judge Dale Ho ultimately agreed to do so in April 2025.
    


            Bove's handling of the Adams case has been the focus of many of the objections to his judicial nomination.
    


            Even the conservative The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board wrote Tuesday, “… his recent handling of the case against New York May Eric Adams doesn't inspire confidence.”
    


            Justice Connection, a coalition of former Justice Department officials, released a video on Monday with statements from formal federal prosecutors warning the public of Bove's alleged unlawful practices.
    


            Ryan Crosswell, a federal prosecutor for more than a decade, was one of the lawyers who resigned over the case.
    


            “We don't bring charges or dismiss them based on political loyalties. Emil Bove asked us to base a prosecutorial decision not on the facts, not on the law, but on a political calculation,” Crosswell says in the video.
    


            “He took on a hard job the first five weeks of the administration doing what the president was elected to do,” said the senior Justice Department official. “Whether someone is qualified to be a judge is not determined by what they did over five-to-six-week period of administration.”
    


            Bove has also drawn scrutiny for his approach to executing the president's aggressive goals on immigration.
    


            On Tuesday, Erez Reuveni, the former acting deputy director for the Office of Immigration Litigation, sent a whistleblower letter to members of Congress and independent investigators in the executive branch regarding Bove's alleged conduct.
    


            Reuveni was an immigration attorney who lost his job after working on the case of mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia.
    


            In the wake of these controversies, the Justice Department points to accomplishments that have occurred under Bove's leadership, including securing the transfer of 29 cartel leaders to face charges in the US. Bove was also a part of the Justice Department team that worked with the DEA to execute the largest fentanyl seizure in history.
    


            But his former colleague says Bove's varied experience is what makes him perfect for the federal bench.
    


            “He has seen it from both sides – he has worked in a federal prosecutors' office, he has worked at DOJ, and he worked in the private sector and defended people targeted by the federal government,” they said. “He is attuned to overreach. He is exactly who you would want on federal bench.”

A key military-industrial site in the Russian city of Taganrog linked to Moscow's production of combat drones and electronic warfare systems was damaged overnight, a Ukrainian official said on June 25, amid Russian reports of Ukrainian drones targeting the area.

"Something unknown flew into the Atlant-Aero plant in Taganrog," Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation center at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council  said. 

"This is an important node in the Russian military-industrial complex, specializing in components for combat drones and control systems."

Kovalenko said the plant is involved in the production of "Orion" drones, electronic warfare complexes, and digital integration systems for strike FPV (first person view) drones and loitering munitions.

Russian authorities reported a wave of overnight Ukrainian drone attacks across multiple regions, including Rostov, which borders eastern Ukraine. Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces shot down 40 Ukrainian drones over several areas, including the Crimean Peninsula and seven over the Rostov region.

Rostov Governor Yuri Slyusar said on Telegram that while there were no casualties, the strikes allegedly caused a fire at a sports complex and damaged a high school and two residential buildings in Taganrog. In nearby Azov, a grain warehouse and industrial facility were hit, he added, without providing further detail.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Throughout Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have extensively invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought.

Ukraine has ramped up its domestic drone production and long-range strike capabilities as it seeks to weaken Russian military infrastructure deep behind enemy lines. Earlier in June, Ukrainian drones targeted long-range Russian bombers in an operation dubbed "Spiderweb."

Russia has escalated its missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, launching hundreds of drones during overnight assaults. Since February 2022, Moscow has launched 28,743 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine

Speaking at the NATO Defense Industry Forum in The Hague on June 24, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine can produce over 8 million drones of various types each year. He called for an increased investment from the allies to reach that potential.

NEW YORK CITY—Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old New York state assemblyman, has claimed victory in the first round of the Democratic primary contest for mayor of the city of New York in the 2025 election, while former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) has conceded—a stunning upset victory.

Mamdani, an Indian-Ugandan immigrant who became a U.S. citizen in 2018, earned 43.5 percent of the first-preference vote. He took office as a New York state assemblyman in 2021, representing the 36th District that covers the Queens neighborhood of Astoria.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday used a profanity to criticize both Iran and Israel for what he said were violations of a ceasefire between the two adversaries.

Reuters

The sportswriter Bill Simmons coined the phrase “the Tyson Zone” to describe the rarified state of being – named after Mike Tyson – in which a celebrity's behaviour becomes so unglued that nothing you hear about them seems impossible anymore. It was almost 20 years ago in his ESPN column that he originated the idea, but Donald Trump was a little later in discovering the powerful sorcery of occupying the Tyson Zone in politics.

He does and says whatever he wants to such extremes that none of it shocks or even matters anymore. The more outrageous his actions, the more he expands the comfy cocoon of the Tyson Zone around himself.

And yet, somehow, the F-word was a new bridge to cross. This he hadn't done before; this was a surprise. There was something in this reaction that mattered. 

How Trump's Israel-Iran ceasefire agreement came together in a chaotic 48 hours

Trump pivots from budget bill to big, beautiful Middle East settlement

On Tuesday as he prepared to leave for a NATO summit in the Netherlands, Mr. Trump faced a barrage of questions about the ceasefire he had declared the previous night between Israel and Iran, which had been breached immediately and explosively. 

“We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” Mr. Trump snarled, physically leaning into the end of the sentence. He finished by barking “Do you understand that?” at the reporters crowding around, before stalking away to his helicopter. 

It read like a true temper tantrum: naked, overwhelmed, a bubbling over of the insides. 

On one hand, Mr. Trump may have been simply expressing intense frustration about a long-running conflict that is intractable, destructive, bloody and, yes, incredibly frustrating on a geopolitical scale. 

There appeared to be an element of aggrieved surprise, as though he had thought he could quell a roiling sea just by saying so. He didn't seem to have accounted for 75 years of conflict in the Middle East, burning even hotter in the past few years, and still more in the past couple of weeks. 

But Mr. Trump's reaction to the world around him – particularly his most energetic responses – are never about the world, but rather about the centre of the universe: Donald J. Trump. What we saw on Tuesday was the President discovering in real time that some forces in the world will not be bent to his will, no matter how badly he wants to claim a big win. 

Around 1 a.m. ET on Monday, Mr. Trump posted on his social-media network, Truth Social, “THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!” The prim, limp politeness of that was overshadowed in strangeness only by the way he signed it, like an official, enforceable order, “DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!” 

By the time day broke in Washington, the ceasefire had been breached and Israel and Iran were each blaming the other. During the same press gaggle in which he launched that expletive, the President said he “didn't like the fact that Israel unloaded right after we made the deal.”

Mr. Trump thinks of himself as the consummate dealmaker. And here he was trying to broker the biggest deal imaginable – what could be more consequential or difficult, after all, than peace in the Middle East – and the whole world could see it failing.

It's plain that Mr. Trump sees the ability to end conflicts as a demonstration of authority and negotiating prowess. He has repeatedly asserted that Russia's invasion of Ukraine would not have happened on his watch, and in the last several days, he's taken to listing off all the accomplishments for which he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. 

On Monday, a Ukrainian parliamentarian who had nominated Mr. Trump for the Nobel for brokering negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv withdrew the nomination. Then a Republican congressman stepped in on Tuesday to nominate him for the hours-old ceasefire.

Re-posting that nomination letter was among the manic blizzard of social-media activity Mr. Trump mashed out aboard Air Force One as it hummed toward The Hague, following his meltdown on the White House lawn. He posted a praise-filled message from the NATO Secretary-General, he wrote a long tirade that combined the alleged stupidity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a flex about his own cognitive testing, and he shared multiple posts about his approval ratings and various brownnosers declaring he should win the Nobel Peace Prize. 

In the decade that he's dominated world news, Mr. Trump has said and done so many things that breach unthinkable boundaries that it's not even worth trying to count them. But he's never dropped an F-word before.

Consider how many times the President – who grew up as a boy with a rich and ruthless father who paved New York City for him, before he became a rich and ruthless man himself – has been told “no” in his life. How often has he not gotten something he really wanted? How many times in the past 10 years? (Once at least, in November, 2020, and we know how that went.) How many times since election night last fall?

Later in the day on Tuesday, Iran and Israel confirmed the ceasefire, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pronounced that “Donald Trump is the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.” By the time he gaggled with reporters aboard his plane, Mr. Trump seemed to be feeling more optimistic and in control. 

“Israel, as you know, turned back. They didn't do that raid this morning,” he said. He added, “So the ceasefire is very much in effect and I think we're going to keep it there for a very long time.”

Now, the President figured he was on his way to NATO to “solve a new set of problems.“ He answered more questions, and then when he'd had enough, he turned away from the reporters to walk back to his private section of the plane.

“Do you think you'll get the Nobel Peace Prize now, sir?” a reporter called after him.

Mr. Trump mustn't have heard her, because he didn't turn back.

The Trump administration has denied executive privilege to the nine aides of former President Joe Biden slated to testify before the House Oversight Committee regarding the allegations that there was a cover-up of the former president's “mental decline.”

The first witness, Neera Tanden, testified before the Oversight majority and minority counsel Tuesday, and was not protected by executive privilege per a letter sent by the White House Tuesday. Executive privilege allows the witness to withhold information from Congress to protect the integrity of the executive branch. The rest of the witnesses will also be denied the same protections as the investigation progresses. 

“In light of unique and extraordinary nature of the matters under investigation, President Trump has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the national interest, and therefore not justified, with respect to particular subjects within the purview of the House Oversight Committee,” read the nine letters obtained by the Washington Examiner. 

Tanden's interview lasted over four hours and included a lunch break. A couple of members from both parties briefly entered the room during the interview.

EX-BIDEN AIDE NEERA TANDEN TELLS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SHE WAS AUTHORIZED TO USE AUTOPEN

Anthony Bernal, a senior adviser to former first lady Jill Biden, was supposed to testify in front of the committee on Thursday, but abruptly cancelled his appearance shortly after the White House waived executive privilege.

House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY) told the Washington Examiner Tuesday the committee wants answers about “who was calling the shots” during Biden's final two years in office. The committee will also continue to investigate why the president's signature was increasingly replaced by the use of an autopen to sign certain executive orders.

Both Tanden and Bernal received these letters, along with the seven other aides who will testify as well: Annie Tomasini, Ashley Williams, Michael Donilon, Anita Dunn, Ronald Klain, Bruce Reed, and Steve Ricchetti. 

The letters claim that there is “Evidence that aides to former President Biden concealed information regarding his fitness to exercise the powers of the President — and may have unconstitutionally exercised those powers themselves to aid in their concealment — implicates both Congress' constitutional and legislative powers.” 

Before these letters were sent, one of the most notable recent instances of waiving executive privilege was the Biden administration's use of it in relation to the Jan. 6 investigation.

Biden has pushed back on all allegations of the autopen usage saying, “I was the one who made the decisions,” arguing that the whole investigation is politically motivated.

The transcripts from the closed-door interviews are slated to be made public, according to a spokesperson for the committee. Comer told the Washington Examiner that no interviews will be released before all of them have concluded. Transcribed interviews are typically conducted by committee staff over the course of several hours, and both parties are granted extended time for questioning, compared to the five-minute increments afforded to members during publicly televised hearings.

The chairman said the committee is especially focused on whether any executive actions were authorized without Biden's explicit approval, and whether the autopen was used to bypass the president at any point during his tenure.

NEW YORK (AP) — A record-smashing heat wave broiled the U.S. East for another day Wednesday, even as thermometers were forecast to soon plunge by as many as 30 degrees in the same areas. 

The day's heat wasn't expected to be as intense as Tuesday, when at least 50 heat records were matched or broken and 21 places hit triple-digit temperatures. About 127 million Americans remained under National Weather Service heat advisories, down from the previous day. Sizzling temperatures sent utilities scrambling to keep the air conditioning and lights on amid massive demand for power.

“It's still going to be, I think, pretty bad across the East,'' meteorologist Bob Oravec of the Weather Prediction Center said Wednesday morning. ”I think today is probably the last day of widespread record potential. It might not be quite as hot as yesterday by a few degrees. But still, high temperatures are expected in the upper 90s across a good section of the East.”




The weather service warned of “extreme heat” for a stretch of the country from North Carolina to New York and west to West Virginia. Highs could approach triple digits from New York to Richmond, Oravec said.

Temperatures Wednesday morning were “a little bit warmer than expected” because of northwesterly winds bringing “warm leftovers from yesterday,” said former NOAA chief scientist Ryan Maue, a private meteorologist. Nantucket, Massachusetts, was above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) when its forecast high was 82.

The high pressure heat dome that has baked the East was forecast to break. A cold front began moving south from New England, bringing with it clouds and cooler temperatures — not only cooler than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), but cooler than normal. 




That air mass drawing on cool ocean waters will send temperatures plummeting by the end of the week in Philadelphia, which hit a record high of 101 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, said Ray Martin, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey. Air temperatures will be in the low 70s Fahrenheit (20s Celsius).

“It's going to feel like a shock to the system, but it's not anything particularly unusual,” said Martin.




Boston's forecast high for Friday is 34 degrees lower than what it hit Tuesday.

“It's going to feel like a different season,” Oravec said. 

However, it won't last. After one or two days, slightly hotter than normal temperatures are forecast, but not anywhere near the highs from earlier this week, Oravec said.

Weather whiplash from one extreme to another occurs more often as the world warms overall from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, scientists said.

Tuesday was likely the peak of the heat, with Baltimore the king of swelter. The city's high of 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) smashed a previous record by four degrees. At night, when the human body needs cooling, temperatures only dropped to 87 Fahrenheit (30 Celsius).

Baltimore was hardly alone. A dozen weather stations were 101 degrees or higher, including two New York airports. Boston hit 102, breaking its old record by seven degrees. Augusta, Maine's 100-degrees also broke its old record by seven degrees.

Every coastal state from Maine to South Carolina hit 100 degrees somewhere, with Georgia and Florida clocking in at 99 on Tuesday. 

As temperatures rise “things become less reliable and more unstable,” said Climate Central Chief Meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky.




The heat meant more demand for power. The nation's largest power grid operator, PJM Interconnection, on Monday recorded its highest demand since 2011, with only a slight drop off Tuesday and Wednesday, spokesman Dan Lockwood said.

“We have an aging grid infrastructure already in United States, so you can see the impacts of that heat on that infrastructure,” said Kate Guy, senior research fellow at the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy. The aging system is less capable of transmitting power at the voltages needed, she said. “At the same time, you're seeing a really big spike in demand. This is what they (utilities) are increasingly experiencing because of climate change,” Guy said. “Frankly, with each year is increased, historic temperatures and that intense heat arriving earlier than ever, just putting an immense pressure on the electrical grid.”

Extreme heat caused the road to buckle in two locations on an interstate highway in northern New Jersey. State transportation officials say the impact on the concrete roadway in Morris County on Tuesday afternoon forced some lane closures as temporary repairs were made. Crews then began work to replace the damaged areas and repave those sections.

Some downtown Chicago streets will close Wednesday night to repair pavement that has buckled due to hot temperatures amid an ongoing heat wave in the city.

“Pavement failures or blowouts occur when prolonged high temperatures cause the road to expand and buckle up or blow out, resulting in uneven driving surfaces,” the Illinois Department of Transportation said in a statement.

In Chesapeake, Virginia, a heat-related malfunction prompted a bridge to remain stuck in the open position.

Emil Bove, nominated by President Donald Trump to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, forcefully denied allegations Wednesday that he urged Justice Department lawyers to ignore court orders to facilitate deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, calling the claims “wildly inaccurate.”

“No, I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,” Bove testified during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. “I will reiterate … I did not advise any Justice Department attorney to violate court orders. The Deputy Attorney General [Todd Blanche] … has confirmed that the account in that whistleblower complaint is not accurate.”

Bove's hearing came one day after Erez Reuveni, a former DOJ career attorney, submitted a 27-page whistleblower complaint accusing senior officials of planning to defy federal court orders related to March deportation flights targeting Venezuelan illegal immigrants. According to Reuveni's account, Bove allegedly told subordinates in a March 14 meeting that “the planes needed to take off no matter what,” even if a court tried to block them. Reuveni claimed Bove said DOJ should consider telling courts “f*** you.”

Bove, speaking under oath, pushed back on the narrative, saying that even the whistleblower acknowledged the department intended to follow court orders.

“Even if that account is taken at face value,” Bove said, “the whistleblower acknowledges that he left the meeting … with the understanding that, of course, the department would advise clients to abide by court orders.”

He also noted that Reuveni signed a legal brief weeks later confirming the government's compliance in one of the disputed cases.

“For all those reasons,” Bove added, “I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge.”

The complaint was submitted to Congress and the DOJ inspector general by the Government Accountability Project, an organization famous for providing legal representation to former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The group also has ties to liberal megadonor George Soros and other left-wing funders. GAP received at least $1.4 million from Soros's Open Society Foundations between 2016 and 2020 and more than $13 million from the Fund for Constitutional Government, according to a 2023 Form 990.

Under questioning from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bove described the complaint as part of a broader ideological fight inside the DOJ.

“This is fundamentally a dispute about the challenges posed by the unelected bureaucracy to the unitary executive and to the people that elected the president and put him in office,” Bove said.

Reuveni was fired in April shortly after raising concerns that the DOJ was ignoring a judge's order by deporting migrants to El Salvador, including one man who was granted protection from deportation there by a Maryland court. He said DOJ leadership circumvented internal legal objections, pressured him to sign a brief making unsubstantiated claims about the deportee, and retaliated when he refused.

Bove, who was promoted to a top spot in the DOJ after representing Trump during his criminal cases ahead of his reelection, also came under fire Wednesday for his role in dismissing federal corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.

Democrats have alleged that the decision, executed over the objections of multiple career prosecutors, was part of a backchannel agreement to secure Adams's cooperation with Trump's immigration agenda.

“There's been some criticism … suggesting that there was some kind of illicit quid pro quo in connection with that motion. That's simply false,” Bove said. “Mayor Adams and lawyers filed a letter on the public docket in that case that stated explicitly there was no quid pro quo … And then critically, Mayor Adams himself was sworn under oath at the hearing, and he explained there were no agreements outside of what was committed to [in] writing.”

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) pressed Bove on whether he pressured career DOJ attorneys to support the motion to dismiss the case against Adams, which began during the Biden adminsitration.

Bove denied that he threatened or incentivized anyone. When asked if he “stated, suggested, or implied” that attorneys could be fired if they refused to sign the brief, Bove replied, “No.”

Bove also denied that any signers were promised a reward or special treatment in exchange for executing the DOJ's wishes.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, testifying at a separate hearing Wednesday before the House Budget Committee, pointed to the timing of the whistleblower complaint as evidence that it was political.

“I find the irony of the timing of it pretty remarkable,” Bondi said. “He takes hits at Emil Bove, who is one of the best human beings I know, one of the smartest, brilliant men I know, who will soon become a federal judge.”

The Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Bove's nomination in the coming weeks.

Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner spoke to Fox News Digital.

EXCLUSIVE: The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Commonwealth of Virginia will announce Wednesday that the agency will be the first major cabinet department to relocate out of Washington, D.C. during President Donald Trump's term.

Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and HUD Secretary Scott Turner are set to christen the agency's new home at the already existing National Science Foundation (NSF) building in Alexandria's Carlyle-Eisenhower neighborhood, which is also home to a Wegman's grocery store, a movie theater and several shops and high-end restaurants.

HUD's current headquarters on L'Enfant Plaza is also on the Senate DOGE Caucus' list of buildings they want to see sold off to save taxpayer funds. The curved X-shaped granite building, officially called the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, is "underutilized," according to their rubric.

Turner noted that the relocation will unlock hundreds of millions in taxpayer savings and address serious health concerns among staff at L'Enfant.

‘FOR SALE': DOGE MOVES TO SELL OFF ALMOST HALF A BILLION IN FEDERAL REAL ESTATE, RELOCATE CABINET AGENCY HQS

"It is time to turn the page on the Weaver Building and relocate to a new headquarters that prioritizes the well-being of HUD employees and properly reflects the passion and excellence of our team," Turner told Fox News Digital.

"There are serious concerns with the current state of HUD's headquarters, including health hazards, leaks, and structural and maintenance failures. Many of these risks will needlessly and irresponsibly continue to absorb taxpayer dollars. Relocating is about more than just changing buildings; it's about a mission-minded shift that we hope will inspire every employee."

Turner, a former Washington Redskins cornerback, added that it also aligns with President Donald Trump's vision for a "New American Golden Age."

Youngkin was equally enthused about HUD's move to the Old Dominion.

"Virginia is a great place to be headquartered, and we are excited to welcome the Department of Housing and Urban Development and their over 2,700 headquarters-based employees to the best state in America to live, work, and raise a family," Youngkin told Fox News Digital.

Amid plans by then-Elon Musk-led DOGE to relocate federal workers, Youngkin faced criticism for not speaking out more forcefully against the administration — criticism that largely fizzled after Wednesday's announcement revealed the new headquarters would be just a few stops from downtown Washington on the Metro's Yellow Line.

"Since the Trump administration started transforming the federal government to better serve the American people, our team has been focused on seizing the new opportunities that this presents for the commonwealth," Youngkin said. "Virginia is the proud home to many public and private sector headquarters, and we thank HUD leadership for trusting us and are committed to supporting your important national mission."

Youngkin had taken slings and arrows over his support for such DOGE efforts, including from Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Mount Vernon, who previously criticized his position on federal worker relocation.

"This is about people's jobs, their lives, their ability to support their families, and it's about the future of the Virginia economy," Surovell told VPM.

The HUD relocation, however, falls just across Cameron Run Creek from Surovell's district.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the Senate DOGE committee chairwoman, praised Youngkin and Turner for the move.

"The Robert C. Weaver Building is a vacant and run-down monument to waste with half a billion dollars in overdue maintenance," Ernst said, calling it a "cross between a ghost town and a horror show."

"It is a true federal fixer-upper and perfect candidate to be put on the auction block. My For Sale Act will sell off this and five other money pits to downsize Washington's portfolio of underutilized buildings, generate $400 million in revenue, and save taxpayers billions in maintenance."

Michael Peters, the commissioner of the General Services Administration, which manages federal real estate, praised the move to Virginia, saying it reflects his agency's commitment to fiscal responsibility and "mission effectiveness."

Investments to-date in the Weaver building totaled $90 million over the past 15 years, including plaza, roof and façade repairs.

HUD expects "significant demand" from the private sector for its old home – located just east of the Smithsonian, south of the National Mall and within walking distance of the new Waterfront Wharf social area.

Mold and asbestos containment have plagued the building, which also has only about half of its elevators in working operation.

The agency also noted there are about 1,000 more employees at HUD versus NSF – which they calculated to effect a $51-per-square-foot savings on building usage and maintenance.

Arizona Diamondbacks star second baseman Ketel Marte was in tears during a pitching change in the seventh inning of the team's 4-1 win over the Chicago White Sox at Rate Field on Tuesday. 

Marte, 31, was left in tears after a fan yelled derogatory comments about his late mother. Marte's mother, Elpidia Valdez, died in a car crash in the Dominican Republic in 2017. Diamondbacks' manager Torey Lovullo consoled the tearful Marte on the mound and put his arm around him during the pitching change.

Lovullo said he heard what the fan said towards Marte, and a Diamondbacks' spokesperson told the Arizona Republic that Lovullo and bench coach Jeff Banis asked for the person to be removed from the game. 

"It was a terrible moment, fans are nasty, fans go too far," an emotional Lovullo said to reporters after the game. "I just reacted as a dad would when I went out to change pitchers," Lovullo said, per the Arizona Republic. "I could see he was sobbing. It hurt."

Lovullo added that he told Marte that he was not alone and that the heckler was "an idiot."

Lovullo said he loves all of his players and that he is going to protect them. 

"I've known Ketel for nine years, and he's had some unbelievably great moments and some hardships as well and some really rough moments in his life and I know those. At the end of the day, we're human beings, and we have emotions and I saw him hurting, and I wanted to protect him."

Diamondbacks shortstop Geraldo Perdomo said the fan "should be banned, for sure."

"That can't happen," Perdomo said. "We can't continue to do that ... here in MLB."

Marte declined to comment on the incident through a team official.

Marte went 2-4 in the win, with a first-inning solo home run that gave the Diamondbacks a 1-0 lead. Marte is once again having an excellent season with the Diamondbacks.

In 52 games, the two-time All-Star has a .316 batting average with 14 home runs and 31 RBI.

The Diamondbacks (41-38) play the White Sox (25-55) play the final game of their three-game series at 2:10 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The Diamondbacks are going for the series sweep, as they won the first two games of the series.

Fox News' Harris Faulkner will host, "America's Most Wanted: Missing Persons," premiering on April 28 on FOX.

Idaho officials have issued an Amber Alert for two missing teens who may be heading to Utah over their "religious beliefs," according to authorities and local reports.

The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office believes Allen Larand Fischer, 13, and Rachelle Leray Fischer, 15, both members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FDLS), left their Monteview, Idaho, home and returned to Trenton, Utah, where they previously lived, around June 22.

Their older sister, Elintra Dee Fischer, 18, was reported missing on Jan. 1, 2023. The Sheriff's Office believes the children "willingly left to return to Trenton, Utah due to religious beliefs."

On Tuesday, the sheriff's office said that through the course of its investigation, "detectives have been unable to find concrete evidence regarding a vehicle Rachelle and Allen Fischer may have left in."

(NCMEC)

"We have confirmed that the vehicle that was initially reported as being involved has not traveled to Idaho during the time that Rachelle and Allen went missing," the sheriff's office said in a Tuesday Facebook post. "Detectives have narrowed down the time frame that the children went missing to [Sunday, June 22] between the hours of 6 [p.m.] and 8 p.m."

(NCMEC)

The sheriff's office said it was "unsure" at this point "if they have left the immediate area or are still close by."

The children's mother, Elizabeth Roundy, spoke with FOX 13 Salt Lake City and said she used to be a plural wife, or in a polyamorous marriage, and left the FLDS church in 2020.

    Editor's Note: This story was originally published on Monday and has been updated to reflect Andrew Cuomo conceding the mayoral primary race to Zohran Mamdani.



            Zohran Mamdani could barely walk a few feet at a recent Juneteenth festival in Queens without a crowd of selfie-demanding admirers trying to stop him.
    


            Mamdani is a 33-year-old state assemblyman and democratic socialist who surged in the campaign for New York City mayor with a mix of viral videos and proposals appealing to younger progressives. He capitalized on progressive frustration with Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor who was attempting a political comeback with a mayoral run; in one of his videos, he explains New York City's ranked-choice voting system in Hindi and Urdu and likens Cuomo to a Bollywood villain.
    


            Mamdani is poised to become the Democratic primary winner. Cuomo conceded to Mamdani on Tuesday night, though ranked-choice votes will be needed to declare a winner.
    


            Mamdani's rise caused growing consternation from the Democratic establishment. His critics argue his platform is too far to the left for moderates and certain to be weaponized by local and national Republicans trying to paint the Democratic Party as out of touch. He's also faced criticism about how he's addressed the Israel-Hamas war.
    


            That concern was hard to find at his campaign stops before the election, notably Thursday's festival in Queens. Mamdani stood onstage awkwardly but joyfully two-stepping and swaying side to side next to other candidates in the primary. Then he walked through the park on a sweltering day, joking that he was fine in his wool suit because he had on an undershirt.
    


            “We've seen a campaign that is powered by the hunger of New Yorkers for a new generation of leadership,” Mamdani told CNN.
    


            Here's what to know about Mamdani and his campaign.
    


            Mamdani is a three-term state assemblyman who represents parts of Queens, one of the the most diverse areas in the nation.
    


            He is an immigrant from Uganda who was first raised in Cape Town, South Africa, and later in New York City, attending the prestigious Bronx High School of Science before enrolling at Bowdoin College. He is the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, and Mira Nair, an Indian filmmaker whose credits include “Mississippi Masala” and “Monsoon Wedding.”

            Prior to his mayoral campaign, Mamdani made national headlines in 2021 when he joined New York City cab drivers on a 15-day hunger strike seeking relief from excessive debt. He also moonlighted as a rapper under the stage name Mr. Cardamom rapping about chapati, an Indian flatbread and worked as foreclosure prevention counselor.
    


            If elected mayor, he would become one of the youngest people to ever hold the post. Mamdani would also become the first Muslim mayor in the history of the city — home to more than half a million Muslims and one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel.
    


            Mamdani wants to freeze the rent for nearly 1 million New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments and provide free city bus service, universal childcare and city-subsidized grocery stores.
    


            Mamdani has said he will pay for it all by raising taxes on the city's wealthiest, even though he would have little power to do so from City Hall. Taxes can be raised or lowered only by state lawmakers with approval from the governor. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has already thrown cold water on the proposal, saying the move is likely to drive more New Yorkers out of the concrete jungle and toward Florida and other lower-tax destinations.
    


            Mamdani's campaign has raised $7 million from thousands of individual donors and mobilized an army of volunteers. He secured the endorsement of Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the United Auto Workers union.
    


            “This race is not just symbolic about the future of New York City, this race is symbolic about the future of our country,” Ocasio-Cortez said during a campaign rally packed with more than 2,000 supporters last week. “For so long we have had political leadership, including in the Democratic Party, that has just wanted to play it safe.”
    


            Democratic establishment concern was laid out in a pre-election call held by Third Way, a national think tank that favors a centrist political agenda. The group released a memo last week, warning that a Mamdani's win would be “a devastating blow in the fight to defeat Trumpism.”
    


            “We're really worried about all Democrats going forward if Mamdani were to win,” Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs, told reporters during the call. “Even if he doesn't win the election, if he just wins the Democratic nomination, that can hurt Democrats.”
    


            Cuomo has made his long career in government and experience with President Donald Trump the cornerstones of his comeback run. He dismisses Mamdani as an inexperienced leader with unrealistic ideas and suggests Trump would run through Mamdani like “a hot knife through butter.”
    


            “He's never done any of the essentials. And now you have Donald Trump on top of all of that,” Cuomo said during a recent debate.
    


            Mamdani responded by zeroing in on Cuomo's sexual harassment scandals, his reputation as a bully and his billionaire donors. Cuomo has repeatedly denied the misconduct allegations.
    


            “I've never had to resign in disgrace,” Mamdani said during one debate. “I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. I have never sued for their gynecological records. And I have never done these things because I am not you, Mr. Cuomo.”
    


            Cuomo and other rivals of Mamdani called out how he's spoken about antisemitism and the Israel-Hamas war.
    


            Mamdani has accused the Israeli government of carrying out a “genocide.” And he defended the use of the slogan “globalize the intifada” as a rallying cry for Palestinian human rights during an interview with The Bulwark.
    


            Mamdani said he believed the phrase was about “a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights,” explaining that the US Holocaust Museum used a similar Arabic word meaning “uprising” to describe the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against the Nazis.
    


            “I have shared my opinions with New Yorkers over the course of this race, opinions that always come back to a belief in universal human rights, that means taking on antisemitism and Islamophobia,” Mamdani told CNN.
    


            Mamdani's campaign has proposed making an increase of 800% for the city's anti-hate crime program.
    


            Still, the criticism to those comments came fast and furious. Mamdani was condemned by the Holocaust Museum and some fellow Democrats for using a phrase they believe encourages violence against Jews.
    


            City Comptroller Brad Lander, who ran third in Tuesday night's primary and appeared on stage at Mamdani's party, has said he preferred Mamdani avoid the term altogether.

            Mamdani's reaction was equally visceral. He became emotional and cried while speaking with reporters about the backlash, detailing the multiple threats and the near-constant harassing calls his office now receives on a daily basis.
    


            “It pains me to be painted as if I am somehow to the very Jewish New Yorkers that I know and love that are such a key part of this city,” Mamdani said. “When I speak, when I speak with emotion I am characterized by rivals as being a monster. I get messages that say, ‘The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim.' I get threats on my life, on the people that I love.”
    


            He has also accused a pro-Cuomo PAC of designing a campaign mailer that featured his photo appearing to be altered to make his beard look darker and thicker next to text saying Mamdani “rejects Jewish rights.” The Cuomo campaign said it never sent out the mailer and it was made up by an independent vendor.
    


            Mamdani called the strikes ordered by Trump “a new, dark chapter in his endless series of betrayals.”
    


            “While Donald Trump bears immediate responsibility for this illegal escalation, these actions are the result of a political establishment that would rather spend trillions of dollars on weapons than lift millions out of poverty, launch endless wars while silencing calls for peace, and fearmonger about outsiders while billionaires hollow out our democracy from within,” he said in a statement.

Ex-Marine and author Dannion Brinkley discusses his near-death experience and shares his life lessons on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Twenty people were injured on Tuesday afternoon when lightning struck a popular summertime lake destination in Lexington County, South Carolina. 

According to county officials, eight adults and 12 children were electrocuted when lightning struck Lake Murray at Dominion Beach Park. Twelve of the victims were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. 

The Lexington County Sheriff's Department, along with the county's fire service and EMS, quickly responded to the scene.

"Strong relationships with other local agencies played a critical role in ensuring a quick, coordinated response, allowing first responders to assess patients efficiently and provide the best possible care," the county said. 

Dominion Beach Park is expected to reopen Wednesday after a safety inspection by local authorities. 

The news of the mass strike comes after a 29-year-old Colorado man was killed in a lightning strike during his honeymoon in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, last Friday.

Over the weekend, four Kentucky women vacationing in Marco Island, Florida were also reportedly struck by lightning. 

According to the National Lightning Safety Council, there have been four fatal lightning strikes in the United States so far in 2025. Those deaths occurred in Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Florida. 

There were 12 lightning fatalities in 2024, according to the organization.

"While lightning fatalities have decreased over the past 30 years, lightning continues to be one of the top storm-related killers in the United States," the awareness group's website says. "In addition, lightning injures many more people than it kills and leaves some survivors with life-long health problems."

The organization advises postponing events if there will be lightning in the area, and notes that lightning can strike up to 10 miles from a thunderstorm.

"Summertime leisure activities such as fishing, boating, camping, going to the beach, etc. contribute to about two-thirds of the lightning fatalities with the remainder related to work or routine daily activities," the group said. "The best way to protect yourself from lightning is to plan ahead so that you can avoid the lightning threat."

            Zohran Mamdani delivered a political earthquake Tuesday in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, riding progressive demands for change in a city facing an affordability crisis to the brink of a stunning victory.
    


            Democratic voters rejected a scandal-plagued icon of the party's past, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Instead, they backed a 33-year-old democratic socialist who energized young voters and progressives with a campaign that could come to represent the first draft of a new playbook.
    


            “I will fight for a city that works for you, that is affordable for you, that is safe for you,” Mamdani said in his celebratory speech just after midnight.

            “We can be free and we can be fed. We can demand what we deserve,” he said.
    


            Mamdani's viral, go-anywhere, talk-to-anyone style of campaigning could send shockwaves through the Democratic Party nationally as its leaders and incumbents face calls from frustrated voters for authenticity and aggressiveness. Republicans, meanwhile, moved immediately to elevate Mamdani, seeing an opportunity to campaign against ideas they see as unpopular with swing voters nationally.
    


            The formal outcome won't be known until at least July 1, when New York City releases the initial ranked-choice results. But Mamdani held a clear lead Tuesday night, and Cuomo told supporters he had called Mamdani and conceded the primary.
    


            “Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won,” Cuomo said.
    


            Mamdani's upstart campaign had a lot to overcome — Cuomo's universal name recognition, massive financial backing, endorsements from party leaders and unions — and he acted like it.
    


            Some of his Democratic rivals portrayed his positions as pie-in-the-sky and impossible to pay for. Mamdani, though, sold his ideas as making life in the city easier to afford, building his campaign around an issue that ranks among the biggest reasons Democrats lost in the 2024 election.

            He sat for interviews with people that disagreed with him. He engaged in cross-endorsements with rivals, encouraging supporters to rank them highly as well on their ranked-choice ballots. He campaigned aggressively, including walking the length of Manhattan on Friday.
    


            “New Yorkers deserve a Mayor they can see, hear, even yell at. The city is in the streets,” Mamdani said on X.
    


            Dan Pfeiffer, a former top aide to President Barack Obama, said on X that Democrats “have a lot to learn” from Mamdani.
    


            “What's happening in NYC is a blaringly loud message to those in the Dem establishment who still cling to old politics, recite focus-grouped talking points, and are too afraid to say what needs to be said,” he said.
    


            Republicans were also thrilled with Mamdani's performance. The House GOP's campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, issued a press release declaring Mamdani “the new face” of the Democratic Party.
    


            “Every vulnerable House Democrat will own him, and every Democrat running in a primary will fear him,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said.
    


            Mamdani faced attacks from pro-Cuomo forces in the primary over what his opponents described as antisemitic comments, flagging Mamdani's sharp criticism of Israel and his defense of the phrase “globalize the intifada.”
    


            He also ran on progressive positions — including freezing rents, offering free public transit, launching city-run grocery stores and more — that Republicans are certain to use to portray Democrats as extreme, much like they have with previous progressive proposals like the “Green New Deal.”
    


            Those attacks are unlikely to help the GOP in the mayoral race in New York City, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans almost by about a six-to-one margin. But New York is home to a number of competitive House seats where the GOP could seek to put Democratic nominees on the defensive over Mamdani's positions.
    


            It's too soon to sort through everything Mamdani's performance means for the Democratic Party. But it did offer a glimpse at where the party is on some key issues and who within it holds sway with voters.

            Mamdani, who would become the city's first Muslim mayor if he wins in November, was a vocal critic of Israel's war in Gaza and didn't back down despite being criticized as antisemitic, a charge he repeatedly denied. He defended his views in an interview with CBS' Stephen Colbert in which he also acknowledged the fears Jewish people have faced since Hamas' October 7, 2023, terrorist attack in Israel.
    


            “There's no room for violence in this city, in this country, in this world. And what I have found also, for many New Yorkers, is an ability to navigate disagreement,” he told Colbert.
    


            He also demonstrated the influence of progressive New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed Mamdani. Other New York Democratic leaders, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and its two senators, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer, remained publicly neutral.
    


            The results similarly laid bare the ineffectiveness of Cuomo's effort — one backed by establishment Democratic forces that blanketed television airwaves but couldn't match the organic groundswell of a state assemblyman who started the race with little public profile.
    


            “Billionaires and lobbyists poured millions against you and our public finance system,” Ocasio-Cortez said of Mamdani on X. “And you won.”
    


            Cuomo had wanted a second act.
    


            The 67-year-old scion of one of New York's most prominent political families was forced out of the governor's office in 2021 amid a cloud of scandal — faced with allegations of sexual harassment that he denied and a report that his administration had covered up nursing home deaths during the coronavirus pandemic.
    


            The governor and the state's two senators stayed on the sidelines. But Cuomo's campaign was backed by many prominent New York Democrats and groups, including unions and elected officials who had criticized him four years ago but — seeing his lead in the polls — issued devil-we-know statements this year endorsing him.
    


            Though ranked-choice ballots need to be counted next week, Cuomo acknowledged the reality he faced on stage Tuesday, telling supporters he had called and congratulated Mamdani.
    


            “Tonight was Assemblyman Mamdani's night, and he put together a great campaign. And he touched young people, and inspired them, and moved them, and got them to come out and vote. And he really ran a highly impactful campaign. I called him, I congratulated him. I applaud him sincerely for his effort, and let's give him a round of applause and thank him for his campaign,” Cuomo said.
    


            His former political rivals, meanwhile, gloated over Cuomo's apparent failure.
    


            “Zohran ran a positive campaign talking about affordability. Cuomo ran a very negative, fear-based campaign. That just made a huge difference,” former Mayor Bill de Blasio said on CNN.
    


            In overwhelmingly Democratic New York City, a victorious Mamdani would ordinarily become the clear front-runner in November's general election. But he instead faces a competitive race with much different contours.
    


            First-term Mayor Eric Adams, who was elected as a Democrat four years ago, is seeking reelection as an independent.
    


            Adams' break from the party came as he faced backlash after President Donald Trump's Justice Department dropped its corruption charges against Adams, and Adams has cooperated with federal authorities to enforce Trump's mass deportation efforts.
    


            “What NYC deserves is a mayor who's proud to run on his record – not one who ran from his record, or one who has no record,” Adams posted on X Tuesday night. “We deserve a mayor who will keep driving down crime, support our police, fight antisemitism, and stand up for working-class New Yorkers.”
    


            Republican Curtis Sliwa was unopposed in the primary and will be the GOP nominee.
    


            And neither Cuomo nor Mamdani had ruled out the possibility of running in November on another party's ballot line if they lost the Democratic contest — Cuomo as the nominee of the newly created Fight and Deliver Party, or Mamdani as the nominee of the Working Families Party.

Senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich provides details on President Donald Trump's latest comments on striking Iran's nuclear facilities and his attendance at a NATO summit.

The U.S. would strike Iran again if the country attempts to rebuild its nuclear program, President Donald Trump said Wednesday.

Trump made the statement during an exchange with reporters while attending a NATO summit in the Netherlands on Wednesday. The U.S. has touted a report from Israel stating that the strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities set back the country's program "many years."

A reporter asked Trump whether he would strike Iran again if it were to rebuild its nuclear facilities.

"Sure," came Trump's blunt response.

The exchange came after NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte praised Trump as a "man of strength" and a "man of peace" during Wednesday's summit.

"I just want to recognize your decisive action on Iran," Rutte said at the start of his joint remarks with the president. "You are a man of strength, but you are also a man of peace. And the fact that you are now also successful in getting this ceasefire done between Israel and Iran — I really want to commend you for that. I think this is important for the whole world."

Rutte also praised Trump's effort to get NATO members to pay more and said the president was "flying into another big success" after all countries—except Spain—agreed to spend 5% of their GDP on defense. He added that Trump achieved something "NO American president in decades could get done."

Leaders of NATO member states had mixed reactions to the strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, with several calling for de-escalation while acknowledging the threat a nuclear Iran would pose to global security.

﻿Republicans are proposing huge cuts to Medicaid. The impact on Americans' health would be devastating.

While public attention has largely been focused on the Middle East and on President Donald Trump's immigration policy, Republicans in Congress are on the verge of passing massive Medicaid cuts as part of a budget bill that could lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance benefits and, according to one recent estimate, thousands of unnecessary deaths every year.

While the GOP's so-called “big, beautiful” bill is a smorgasbord of policy — potentially including everything from blocking AI regulation to restricting the power of the federal courts — perhaps the most consequential changes would be to Medicaid. The program, which covers low-income Americans of all ages, is now the country's single largest insurer, covering more than 70 million people. The legislation approved by House Republicans, which is now being debated and amended by the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years. The upshot is that 10.3 million fewer people would be enrolled in the program by 2034.

Those coverage losses would more than undo the progress the US has made in reducing the ranks of the uninsured over the past few years. On Tuesday, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the number of US adults without insurance in 2024 had fallen to 27.2 million, down from 31.6 million in 2020. The GOP bill would reverse those gains and then some within a decade.

The consequences would be much more severe than the mere loss of a government health insurance card. According to one analysis of the House bill published last week in the Annals of Internal Medicine by a trio of Harvard-affiliated researchers, those losses of Medicaid coverage would lead to fewer Americans reporting good health, fewer patients getting preventive health screenings, and, at the end of the day, between 8,200 and 24,600 additional annual deaths.

Senate Republicans are not going to adopt the House bill exactly as it is, which means any estimates of its effects are preliminary. But it appears likely GOP senators will keep at least two impactful provisions: new work requirements for many of the people on Medicaid and limits on the financing tools that the states can use to access more federal Medicaid funding. The Harvard study broke out the estimated effects by provision and the results are still foreboding: between 3,000 and 9,000 annual deaths attributable to Medicaid work requirements, and between 4,200 and 12,600 deaths if state provider taxes were completely eliminated.

Even short of the worst-case scenario, Americans' health would be worse off under the Republican bill, according to researchers Adam Gaffney, David Himmelstein, and Steffie Woolhandler. The number of Americans who have a personal doctor would drop by 700,000 under Medicaid work requirements; 285,000 fewer people would ever get their blood cholesterol checked, and 235,000 fewer patients would ever have their blood sugar tested. The number of women getting a recommended mammogram within the past 12 months would drop by nearly 139,000. And an additional 385,000 people would have to borrow money or skip paying other bills to afford their medical care. The people affected are low-income and disproportionately Black and Hispanic. 

There is plenty of uncertainty in these projections. It is also hard to be sure how these policies would interact with each other: The Harvard researchers noted in their cumulative estimate of the House bill's effects that there would likely be some overlap in the policies' projected effects when combined together. Some of the people who lose their Medicaid coverage would be able to get insurance by other means, offsetting the losses to a degree that can be difficult to predict.

But the takeaway from the analysis is clear: A lot of people are going to suffer if these proposals become law.

The debate in the Senate has not yet concluded, and the bill could still change. Hospitals are busy on Capitol Hill, lobbying Republicans to reduce the spending cuts and warning lawmakers of the devastating consequences that the legislation would have. Some GOP senators are reportedly open to providing additional funding for rural hospitals, to relieve the impact on the facilities that would be hardest hit by the proposed Medicaid cuts.

But after Republicans narrowly failed to roll back Medicaid during Trump's first term, they seem likely to succeed this time — a step backward from building a true universal health care system.

America's lack of universal health care is the main reason we spend more money than any other country in the world while seeing worse outcomes. One recent JAMA analysis found that deaths that could be prevented by accessible health care increased in the United States from 2009 to 2019, while declining in most other comparable countries. 

You can achieve universal health care via a variety of strategies, including the expansion of private health insurance, but the Republican bill could instead lead to more unnecessary deaths by taking existing benefits away from people, according to the Annals of Internal Medicine study.

Medicaid has actually been a rare bright spot in America's often dysfunctional health care system. The program has its own problems — not enough doctors participate because of its low reimbursement rates, for one — but since its expansion through the Affordable Care Act in 2010, research has shown that Medicaid allowed more people to access health care, reduced their financial burden from medical services, and improved their physical and mental well-being. 

Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials justify the Medicaid cuts by saying that people who can work should be required to work in order to receive government benefits. They claim nobody who deserves to be on Medicaid will lose their coverage. As one White House official put it to Politico earlier this month: “Medicaid does not belong to people who are here illegally, and it does not belong to capable and able-bodied men who refuse to work. So no one is getting cut.” (Undocumented migrants are already ineligible for federal Medicaid funding. Six states cover undocumented adults through Medicaid using the state's own funds, and 14 cover undocumented children.) 

But independent analysts say that most of the people on Medicaid are either children, elderly, disabled — or adults who are already working or caring for another person — meaning they are limited in their ability to work. Most of the projected coverage losses result from people having paperwork problems in documenting their work or proving they should be exempt from the requirements, not because people are actually ineligible under the new rules. 

That aligns with the experience of Arkansas during Trump's first term. That state tested work requirements in the real world for the first time and 18,000 people lost their health insurance in a matter of months, with no meaningful effect on their employment.

The US has made halting progress in its pursuit of a better health system. In 2010, the uninsured rate was 16 percent. Today, it's half of that. But in the GOP's proposed future, the problems that have left Americans so frustrated with their health care system are going to get worse.

Pittsburgh Pirates star Oneil Cruz has gone through a rough few games.

Cruz's error and lackadaisical effort following a passed ball in center field raised eyebrows last week, and then, on Tuesday, he was removed from the game after he lost track of outs.

Pirates manager Don Kelly took Cruz out after he failed to run out a double-play grounder against the Milwaukee Brewers. He grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. Kelly said Cruz was removed because of "energy and effort going down the line."

Cruz told reporters through an interpreter he understood the decision.

"DK had all the rights to do what he did, and I'll back him up on that," Cruz said. "It was my fault because I thought there were two outs in that situation. That's why I let off running to first base."

Kelly said he and Cruz spoke afterward, and he communicated his expectations.

Cruz suffered an outfield blunder against the Texas Rangers. He misjudged a ball and watched it roll to the fence in the first inning of that game.

On top of everything else, Cruz is not hitting like the slugger he has been promised to be. He has batted .156 with 31 strikeouts this month. Overall, he is hitting .211 with an OPS of .736 and 13 home runs. He is leading the National League with 26 stolen bases but leads MLB with 101 strikeouts.

"He's struggling at the plate right now," Kelly said. "It's difficult when you're going through that and trying to figure it out. He's working hard to do that. That's one thing we've got to be mindful of, is not letting that offense carry over to defense and base running, and the energy and effort that we're giving on any other aspects of the game as well."

Cruz maintained that his issue on the basepaths had nothing to do with his slump at the plate.

"They're a really good example," Cruz said. "They always run hard. They always go out there to do their 100%. That's a teaching point for me. I accepted the way DK came to me and explained it and presented it to me."

Pittsburgh fell to 32-48 this season after losing 9-3 to the Brewers. The Pirates are 20-22 since Kelly took over for Derek Shelton as manager.

Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac tells Fox News Digital why he believes the on-court rivalry between WNBA stars Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese has been good for women's basketball.

Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese and Los Angeles Sparks player Rickea Jackson got into a shoving match during their game on Tuesday night.

The incident occurred in the first quarter of their game. Jackson and Sky player Rebecca Allen got tied up going for the loose ball. Jackson and Allen exchanged words when Reese pulled Allen away from the scrum. The WNBA referee called a double technical foul on Jackson and Allen.

As the two continued to jaw at each other, Reese stepped in and pushed Jackson away from her teammate, resulting in the Sparks' second-year player pushing back.

Sparks star Kelsey Plum stepped in to break up the scrum. Coaches and players from both teams then came onto the floor to stop the incident from escalating further.

It appeared cooler heads would prevail. Reese and Jackson were seen hugging each other once the game was over.

Chicago won the game, 97-86, as Reese finished with a double-double. She had 18 points, 17 rebounds, six assists and four steals. Kamilla Cardoso led Chicago with 27 points and seven rebounds.

Azura Stevens had 21 points for the Sparks with Plum scoring 20. Jackson notched 11 points.

Fox News senior correspondent Claudia Cowan joins 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss President Donald Trump and Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon threatening to cut finding to California schools over the transgender athlete ban.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke to Fox News Digital during a tour stop during the Independent Women's Forum bus tour in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Monday. 

McMahon has been a key figure in the Trump administration's mission to counter trans athlete inclusion in women's and girls' sports, directing the Department of Education to launch several Title IX investigations into institutions that have enabled incidents to occur.

Five months into her position, McMahon has helped spearhead the formation of a new federal Title IX Investigations team in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice.

Meanwhile, the ongoing national culture war over the issue burns hotter than it ever has. 

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt and prominent conservative influencer Riley Gaines are among those on the right who have suggested potential criminal prosecution for officials who allow biological males to compete in women's and girls' sports. 

The recent high school sports season has featured several instances of female athletes protesting and demonstrating against transgender opponents, whether it be forfeits or medal podium stunts, in a growing viral trend. 

Fox News Digital (FND): What is your stance on the idea of criminal prosecution coming to officials who don't enforce Title IX and allow [biological] males to compete in girls' sports?

McMahon: "I haven't actually addressed that with the Department of Justice, but it's certainly something that if the president would like us to look into it, we certainly would."

McMahon: "I think it's very important, it's one of the things that I mentioned today when I was delivering my remarks to this group. I congratulated those young women for taking such a stand and I encouraged them to continue to do that. 

"Because that's what's going to make a difference, is to have these women athletes and these girl athletes who are really very strong and deserve the right to be able to play in the sport of their choice, but to compete against girls, because it's just an unfair playing field otherwise."And they have to stand up for their own rights. And also know that we're going to be standing behind them."

FND: What can states [like California, Maine and Minnesota] expect in the second half of the year now that we're going on four to five months since President Trump signed the [Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports] executive order and they're still not following it?

McMahon: "They run the risk of having their federal funding withdrawn. That's the main thing that's on the table. We have a task for that the Department of Education is doing with the Department of Justice to investigate Title IX violations and that's what we're doing. So the penalties are on the table for those that we find to be in violation."

Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday night after Andrew Cuomo conceded the race in a stunning upset, as the young, progressive upstart built a substantial lead over the more experienced but scandal-scarred former governor.

Democratic mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo cast his ballot in New York's mayoral primary. New York City Democrats will decide Tuesday whether to reboot Cuomo's political career, elevate liberal upstart Zohran Mamdani, or turn to a less-polarizing candidate.

Andrew Cuomo. (AP Video: David R. Martin)

NEW YORK (AP) — Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday night after Andrew Cuomo conceded the race in a stunning upset, as the young, progressive upstart who was virtually unknown when the contest began built a substantial lead over the more experienced but scandal-scarred former governor.

Though the race's ultimate outcome will still be decided by a ranked choice count, Mamdani took a commanding position just hours after the polls closed.

With victory all but assured, Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist who ran an energetic campaign centered on the cost of living, told supporters, “I will be your Democratic nominee for the mayor of New York City.”

“I will be the mayor for every New Yorker, whether you voted for me, for Governor Cuomo, or felt too disillusioned by a long-broken political system to vote at all,” he said. “I will work to be a mayor you will be proud to call your own.”




Cuomo, who had been the front-runner throughout a race that was his comeback bid from a sexual harassment scandal, conceded the election, telling a crowd that he had called Mamdani to congratulate him.

“Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won,” Cuomo told supporters.






Cuomo trailed Mamdani by a significant margin in the first choice ballots and faced an exceedingly difficult pathway to catching up when ballots are redistributed in New York City's ranked choice voting process.

Mamdani, a member of the state Assembly since 2021, would be the city's first Muslim and Indian American mayor if elected. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams skipped the primary. He's running as an independent in the general election. Cuomo also has the option of running in the general election.

“We are going to take a look and make some decisions,” Cuomo said.

Cuomo and Mamdani were a study in political contrasts and could have played stand-ins for the larger Democratic Party's ideological divide, with one candidate a fresh-faced progressive and the other an older moderate.

Cuomo characterized the city as a threatening, out-of-control place desperate for an experienced leader who could restore order. He brought the power of a political dynasty to the race, securing an impressive array of endorsements from important local leaders and labor groups, all while political action committees created to support his campaign pulled in staggering sums of cash.

Mamdani, meanwhile, offered an optimistic message that life in the city could improve under his agenda, which was laser-focused on the idea that a mayor has the power to do things that lower the cost of living. The party's progressive wing coalesced behind him and he secured endorsements from two of the country's foremost progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Unofficial results from the New York City's Board of Elections showed that Mamdani was ranked on more ballots than Cuomo. Mamdani was listed as the second choice by tens of thousands of more voters than Cuomo. And the number of votes that will factor into ranked choice voting is sure to shrink. More than 200,000 voters only listed a first choice, the Board of Elections results show, meaning that Mamdani's performance in the first round may ultimately be enough to clear the 50% threshold.

The race's ultimate outcome could say something about what kind of leader Democrats are looking for during President Donald Trump's second term.

The primary winner will go on to face incumbent Adams, a Democrat who decided to run as an independent amid a public uproar over his indictment on corruption charges and the subsequent abandonment of the case by Trump's Justice Department. Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, will be on the ballot in the fall's general election.

The rest of the pack has struggled to gain recognition in a race where nearly every candidate has cast themselves as the person best positioned to challenge Trump's agenda.

Comptroller Brad Lander, a liberal city government stalwart, made a splash last week when he was arrested after linking arms with a man federal agents were trying to detain at an immigration court in Manhattan. In the final weeks of the race, Lander and Mamdani cross endorsed one another in an attempt to boost their collective support and damage Cuomo's bid under the ranked choice voting system.

Among the other candidates are City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer.

Mamdani's grassroots run has been hard not to notice.

His army of young canvassers relentlessly knocked on doors throughout the city seeking support. Posters of his grinning mug were up on shop windows. You couldn't get on social media without seeing one of his well-produced videos pitching his vision — free buses, free child care, new apartments, a higher minimum wage and more, paid for by new taxes on rich people.

That youthful energy was apparent Tuesday evening, as both cautiously optimistic canvassers and ecstatic supporters lined the streets of Central Brooklyn on a sizzling hot summer day, creating a party-like atmosphere that spread from poll sites into the surrounding neighborhoods.

Outside his family's Caribbean apothecary, Amani Kojo, a 23-year-old first-time voter, passed out iced tea to Mamdani canvassers, encouraging them to stay hydrated.

“It's 100 degrees outside and it's a vibe. New York City feels alive again,” Kojo said, raising a pile of Mamdani pamphlets. “It feels very electric seeing all the people around, the flyers, all the posts on my Instagram all day.”

Cuomo and some other Democrats have cast Mamdani as unqualified. They say he doesn't have the management chops to wrangle the city's sprawling bureaucracy or handle crises. Critics have also taken aim at Mamdani's support for Palestinian human rights.

In response, Mamdani has slammed Cuomo over his sexual harassment scandal and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cuomo resigned in 2021 after a report commissioned by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women. He has always maintained that he didn't intentionally harass the women, saying he had simply fallen behind what was considered appropriate workplace conduct.

Follow:


President Donald Trump and Republican leaders are betting that key GOP holdouts will buckle under enormous pressure to pass his sweeping agenda within days – even as a number are warning they're prepared to sink the multi-trillion-dollar measure without major changes.
    


            But tensions are escalating between the House and Senate and between moderates and conservatives who are battling over competing versions – as Trump demands the bill on his desk by July 4.
    


            With the Senate planning a critical vote to begin debate as soon as Thursday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson are both racing to quell rebellions among their centrist and right-wing factions.
    


            Behind the scenes, Johnson and his allies are in high-stakes talks with Senate GOP leaders to resolve final sticking points, while stressing to their own House members that they may ultimately need to back the Senate's version because further cross-Capitol negotiations aren't feasible, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, a move certain to cause an outcry among many in his conference.
    


            That means GOP holdouts could ultimately be left with this choice: Vote for a plan they detest or sink the bill and endure Trump's wrath. GOP leaders in both chambers are gambling their members will choose the former.
    


            “When it comes over, we'll pass it,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told CNN. “We've been talking over a year. The time for voting is now.”
    


            But multiple House Republicans are fuming that the Senate rewrote their carefully crafted version of bill – most critically to propose deeper cuts on Medicaid – and are openly calling to blow past Trump's timeline to change it back.
    


            Plus Johnson now has at least three Republican hardliners declaring they will oppose the Senate version without even deeper spending cuts: Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland, Chip Roy of Texas and Eric Burlison of Missouri. And then there's the parochial issue dogging the GOP: The push led by New York Republicans to increase the amount taxpayers can deduct from their local levies, a deal that GOP senators want to gut and force House members to swallow.
    


            Some are warning they won't cave – a threat GOP leaders must weigh since they can only afford three defections in each chamber to pass the bill.
    


            “If they're trying to jam us with something that we can't support, then I think we need to take those extra days to make sure it's a good product,” said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, who was one of 16 House Republicans who declared in a letter to both GOP leaders on Tuesday that they couldn't support the Senate's Medicaid provisions without major changes. She also met with Johnson about the issue on Tuesday.
    


            Malliotakis was among several GOP lawmakers who told CNN she would support a formal “conference committee” between the House and Senate – against the wishes of Trump and GOP leaders, since it would dramatically slow down the president's agenda.
    


            Even Rep. David Joyce, a close leadership ally, said he was willing to miss Trump's July 4 deadline to fight for more of the House's original provisions.
    


            “I think a good bill deserves to take its time,” the Ohio Republican told CNN. “There's differences in what the Senate's talking about and what can pass here.”
    


            The GOP is largely united on the main tenets of the bill, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts for individuals and businesses, imposing new work requirements on social safety net programs and fulfilling the president's campaign promises like no tax on tips and overtime pay — all while providing hundreds of billions more for the Pentagon and border security agencies. But how to pay for many of those provisions has been far more contentious, including cuts to Medicaid and phasing out Biden-era energy tax credits.
    


            And official estimates that the measure could add more than $3.4 trillion to deficits over the next decade have left many on the right uneasy – in addition to the Senate's proposed $5 trillion increase to the national debt limit.
    


            Meanwhile, patience is running thin in the Senate, with many Republicans eager to move on and call their House counterparts' bluff.
    


            “It's a little arrogant to say the Senate has got to eat exactly what the House proposed. I mean it's a bicameral process,” Sen. Bernie Moreno, a Republican from Ohio.  “I don't look like Alexander Hamilton or James Madison do I? That's just the process our founders created.”
    


            And Trump himself is heaping pressure on Congress, posting on Truth Social on Tuesday: “Lock yourself in a room if you must, don't go home, and GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK.”
    


            Senate Republicans are particularly frustrated by the so-called SALT Caucus, the group of House Republicans in New York and California that is demanding bigger deductions on state and local tax payments.
    


            Those Republicans cut a deal with Johnson to win their support by raising the amount of state and local levies that eligible taxpayers can deduct to a $40,000 limit. Now, several of those New York Republicans say they won't accept a penny less than that number, even though Senate Republicans say they should jam the House with a less expensive deal.
    


            “I'm OK with them making crazy statements like that if they want,” said North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer, referring to the House Republicans from New York. “I hear ‘red line' a lot around here. I hear that a lot, but at the end of day, it turns into a rather light pink.”
    


            But those House GOP lawmakers pressing for tax relief said it would be a mistake to assume that they would simply swallow whatever SALT deal the Senate passes.
    


            “I think that would be the wrong assumption,” Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican and leading proponent of the House deal, told reporters Tuesday.
    


            Any whipping operation among House Republicans, however, is complicated by the still-fluid negotiations in the Senate. GOP senators are still tweaking their bill themselves and trying to navigate changes forced on them by the Senate parliamentarian's rulings that some of their provisions are out of order with strict Senate budget rules that they must follow to pass the bill along party lines.
    


            The biggest headache for Republicans, though, remains the fate of Medicaid.
    


            At least 20 centrist Republicans in both chambers are trying to reverse the Senate's biggest cuts to Medicaid, which were not part of the House-passed bill. But another group of GOP hardliners – including Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin – wants to slash even deeper from the program and have raised major concerns about the impact the bill would have on the deficit. And they all met with Trump on Monday night.
    


            During a closed-door meeting Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri who has been outspoken about his concerns the bill is cutting too much into Medicaid, said North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis gave out information to senators on how much rural hospitals in states like his could lose if some of the changes the Senate rolled out went into effect.
    


            At issue are new proposed limits on how much states can tax health care providers, a levy that helps fund the Medicaid program. Some key Republicans fear that the new proposed limits could devastate Medicaid providers, especially rural hospitals, and are demanding changes.
    


            “Senate leadership now needs to fix this,” Hawley said. “They're the ones who invented this new rural hospital defund scheme that the House says they can't pass. It's going to close rural hospitals. They need to get with rural hospitals, figure out what's going to work for them, and then they need to get the sign off of the House.”
    


            “The leadership needs to work on this with rural hospitals and the House,” he said. “This won't work to not ever talk to the House and hope that they just take the bill. That will land us in a conference committee. I don't want to do that.”
    


            Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and a key swing vote facing reelection next year, is pushing for the bill to include a relief fund to providers hardest hit by the new cuts — potentially around $100 billion although multiple sources told CNN that the number has been extremely fluid.
    


            “I've been very concerned about the cuts in Medicaid and the impact on my state, but other states as well,” Collins told CNN on Tuesday. “I've also been concerned about the health of rural hospitals, nursing homes, health centers and have been working on a provider relief fund. But that doesn't offset the problem with the Medicaid cuts.”
    


            Tillis, a Republican who like Collins is also up for reelection next year, said that the proposed Medicaid cuts could cost his state $38 billion over 10 years.
    


            “That's a big impact,” he told CNN. He added: “I'm very much in favor of moving in that direction. You just have to do it at a pace that states can absorb, or we're going to have bad outcomes, political and policy.”
    


            But if Trump and Senate GOP leaders give in to the demands of those holdouts, it would drive up the already hugely expensive price tag — prompting a revolt on the right.
    


            Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican who leads the House Freedom Caucus, contended that the Senate is moving in the wrong direction, calling for deeper cuts into Medicaid and saying it should more quickly eliminate green energy tax credits enacted under the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act. Harris voted “present” when the bill passed the House by a single vote last month.
    


            But Harris said he would go even further if forced to accept the Senate bill in the coming days.
    


            “If the Senate tries to jam the House with this version, I won't vote ‘ present.' I'll vote ‘NO,'” Harris said Tuesday.

Democratic New York City Council candidate and former Rep. Anthony Weiner failed on Tuesday in his bid to return to the political scene after a career plagued by scandal.

Weiner was running against a menagerie of opponents in New York's 2nd City Council district Democratic primary, including state Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, Sarah Batchu, Andrea Gordillo, and Allie Ryan.

With over 80% of the votes counted on Tuesday night, Weiner held only just over 10% of the share, with Epstein at nearly 40% and Batchu and Gordillo at just over 20%. 

The former congressman entered politics in 1991 when he won a contested Democratic primary for the city's 48th council seat, later serving until 1998 when he won election to Congress.

Weiner then found himself embroiled in scandal as he neared the middle of his seventh term in Congress.

In May 2011, Weiner posted a sexually explicit photograph of himself on his Twitter account, saying he meant to send it to a woman who was following him. Weiner was married at the time to former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

He denied posting the image before admitting to doing so in a press conference. Weiner also said he “exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years.”

Weiner would resign from Congress less than a month later and disappeared from the political spotlight until reappearing to run for mayor of New York City in 2013. Weiner would be among the front-runners until another sexting scandal tanked his campaign, ultimately leading to him finishing fifth in the race.

Then another major scandal hit. Weiner would be investigated by the FBI in 2016 for sexting a 15-year-old from North Carolina before he surrendered to the agency and pleaded guilty to a charge of transferring obscene material to a minor. Weiner was required to register as a sex offender and sentenced to 21 months in prison.

He would be released and sent to a halfway house in 2019. Weiner was freed several months later.

His 2025 candidacy was his first step back into electoral politics in years, and he pleaded with voters to give him another chance.

“I'm not denying. I'm not pointing fingers. I'm not asking for a pardon,” Weiner said last month.

“I've served my time. I accepted responsibility. Now I'm moving forward.”

President Donald Trump says a ceasefire between Iran and Israel is in effect after the deal initially faltered leaving Trump frustrated with both sides.

U.S. President Donald Trump said a ceasefire between Iran and Israel was in effect Tuesday after the deal initially faltered, and the American leader expressed deep frustration with both sides. Israel had earlier accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace after the truce was supposed to take effect. Iran is insisting that Israel broke the spirit of the ceasefire, claiming that it carried out attacks after it shouldn't have.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israel's war against Iran “brought to ruin” the country's nuclear program. He listed Israel's achievements in the war, including its attacks on top generals and nuclear scientists.

The UnitedStates told the United Nations Security Council that the U.S. will will not turn a blind eye to Iran's noncompliance and ongoing threat to regional stability.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel appeared to hold Tuesday after initially faltering, and U.S. President Donald Trump expressed frustration with both sides, saying they had fought “for so long and so hard” that they do not know what they are doing.

But even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Israel had brought Iran's nuclear program “to ruin,” a new U.S. intelligence report found that the program has been set back only a few months after U.S. strikes over the weekend, according to two people familiar with the assessment.

The early report issued Monday by the Defense Intelligence Agency was described to The Associated Press by two people familiar with it. They were not authorized to address the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The report also contradicts statements from Trump, who has said the Iranian nuclear program was “completely and fully obliterated.” The White House called the assessment “flat-out wrong.”

After the truce was supposed to take effect, Israel accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace, and the Israeli finance minister vowed that “Tehran will tremble.”

The Iranian military denied firing on Israel, state media reported, but explosions boomed and sirens sounded across northern Israel in the morning, and an Israeli military official said two Iranian missiles were intercepted.




Trump told reporters at the White House before departing for a NATO summit that, in his view, both sides had violated the nascent agreement. He had particularly strong words for Israel, a close ally, while suggesting Iran may have fired on the country by mistake.

But later he said the deal was saved.

“ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly “Plane Wave” to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!” Trump said in his Truth Social post.

Indeed, Netanyahu's office said he held off on tougher strikes against Iran after speaking to Trump.

Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday the Islamic Republic emerged “proud and steadfast” from the aggression by Israel and the United States.

“This proves one simple truth more clearly than ever: diplomacy and dialogue are the only path to resolving the unnecessary crisis over Iran's peaceful program,” he said.

The conflict, now in its 12th day, began with Israel targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites, saying it could not allow Tehran to develop atomic weapons and that it feared the Islamic Republic was close. Iran has long maintained that its program is peaceful.

If the truce holds, it will provide a global sense of relief after the U.S. intervened by dropping bunker-buster bombs on nuclear sites — a move that risked further destabilizing the volatile region. 

Trump phoned Netanyahu after the American bombing on Sunday and told him not to expect additional U.S. military attacks and that he should seek a diplomatic solution with Iran, a senior White House official said.

Trump's position was that the U.S. had removed any imminent threat posed by Iran, according to the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about sensitive diplomatic talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Israel followed up the U.S. air attacks by expanding the kinds of targets it was hitting.

After Tehran launched a limited retaliatory strike Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, Trump announced the ceasefire.

A protracted conflict could have a broad economic impact if Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping channel.

China, which is Iran's largest trading partner and only remaining oil customer, condemned the U.S. attacks and said it was concerned about a “spiral of escalations” without a ceasefire. Trump suggested the ceasefire would allow Iranian oil to continue to flow, saying on social media that China could keep purchasing crude from Iran.

The deal got off to a rocky start.

An Israeli military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations said Iran launched two missiles at Israel hours into the tenuous ceasefire. Both were intercepted, the official said.

Iranian state television reported that the military denied firing missiles after the start of the ceasefire — while condemning Israel for predawn strikes of its own.

One of those attacks killed a high-profile nuclear scientist, Mohammad Reza Sedighi Saber, at his father-in-law's residence in northern Iran, Iranian state TV reported.

Trump's frustration with the early morning strikes was palpable as he spoke to reporters before departing for the Hague. He said both sides had violated the agreement and used an expletive to hammer home his point.

“We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f—- they're doing,” he said.

Netanyahu said Israel agreed to the ceasefire with Iran, in coordination with Trump, after the country achieved all of its war goals, including removing the threat of Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

In a televised statement, Netanyahu said late Tuesday that Israel took out top generals and nuclear scientists and destroyed nuclear facilities in Natanz, Isfahan and the Arak heavy water reactor. He thanked Trump for his help.

It's unclear what role Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's leader, played in the talks. He said earlier on social media that he would not surrender.

Trump said Tuesday that he wasn't seeking regime change in Iran, two days after floating the idea himself in a social media post.

“I don't want it,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “Regime change takes chaos and, ideally, we don't want to see much chaos.”

Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that the U.S. and Iran are already in early discussions about resuming negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. He called the direct talks and discussions through intermediaries “promising.”

Before the ceasefire was announced, Israel's military said Iran launched 20 missiles toward Israel. Police said they damaged at least three densely packed residential buildings in the city of Beersheba. First responders said they retrieved four bodies from one building and were searching for more. At least 20 people were injured.

Outside, the shells of burned out cars littered the streets. Broken glass and rubble covered the area. Police said some people were injured while inside their apartments' reinforced safe rooms, which are meant to withstand rockets but not direct hits from ballistic missiles.

The attack followed a limited Iranian missile assault Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar in retaliation for earlier American bombing of its nuclear sites. The U.S. was warned by Iran in advance, and there were no casualties.

Elsewhere, U.S. forces shot down drones attacking the Ain al-Assad base in the desert in western Iraq and a base next to the Baghdad airport, while another one crashed, according to a senior U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

No casualties were reported, and no group claimed responsibility for the attacks in Iraq. Some Iran-backed Iraqi militias had previously threatened to target U.S. bases if the U.S. attacked Iran.

In Israel, at least 28 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the war. Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 974 people and wounded 3,458 others, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists.

The group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from Iranian unrest, said of those killed, it identified 387 civilians and 268 security force personnel.

The U.S. has evacuated some 250 American citizens and their immediate family members from Israel by government, military and charter flights that began over the weekend, a State Department official said.

There are roughly 700,000 American citizens, most of them dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, believed to be in Israel.

            Television and film actor Joe Marinelli, who appeared in “The Morning Show” and “Santa Barbara,” to name a few titles, has died. He was 68.
    


            The news was confirmed by his agent Julie Smith, who told CNN via email on Tuesday that Marinelli had been battling throat and stomach cancer for a few years. No other details were provided.
    


            Marinelli had over 50 screen credits, primarily guest roles on popular television programs, with the exception of the daytime soap opera “Santa Barbara.”
    


            In 1988, Marinelli began portraying Bunny Tagliatti on the series. He played Tagliatti, a cross-dressing mobster, in more than 170 episodes through 1990, and won a Soap Opera Digest Award for his performance.
    


            His earlier appearances were in the mid-1980s, on popular shows including “Cagney & Lacey,” “Hill Street Blues” and “L.A. Law.”
    


            The actor went on to appear in a number of popular TV shows through the '90s, with credits including “ER,” “JAG” and “The King of Queens.”
    


            He returned to the daytime world in 1999, where he played Joseph Sorel on “General Hospital.”
    


            While Marinelli continued his work in television into the 2000s with appearances on “The West Wing,” “NYPD Blue” and “House,” he also acted in the acclaimed 2004 Alexander Payne film “Sideways.”
    


            Later credits for the actor included parts in “Insecure,” “Hollywood” and “The Offer.” His most recent project was “The Morning Show,” in which he played show director Donny Spagnoli in 20 episodes. Along with his cast, Marinelli was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award in 2022 for best dramatic ensemble.
    


            On Monday evening, Marinelli's costar from “Santa Barbara,” Leigh J. McCloskey, penned a tribute to the late actor on social media, writing, “He was a great acting partner, teacher, philosophical friend, passionate believer in people, and a storyteller extraordinaire.”
    


            “It saddens me greatly to say goodbye to my old friend and his belief in the goodness, and even the possible greatness of the human adventure,” McCloskey added. “I'm glad I walked this earth with you Joe.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was treated for dehydration at a Washington area hospital Wednesday, his office said.

"Leader Schumer was at the Senate gym this morning and got lightheaded," said a spokesperson for the 74-year-old Democratic leader.

"Out of an abundance of caution, he went to the hospital to be treated for dehydration and is now back at work in the Capitol. He wants to remind everyone to drink some water and stay out of the heat," the spokesperson said in a statement.

Schumer was absent Wednesday morning from a press conference that he was scheduled to lead. Senate Democrats are mounting an opposition to the massive Republican reconciliation bill that President Donald Trump is pushing the GOP to pass through Congress.

Schumer said in an X post that he spoke Wednesday morning with Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayoral candidate who is poised to become the Democratic nominee after taking a commanding lead in the first round of ranked-choice voting Tuesday night.

A spokeswoman for Schumer did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for additional information about the senator's health incident.

The US Treasury building in Washington, DC.

The US government designated three Mexican financial firms as potential money launderers tied to illicit opioid trafficking, as it seeks to clamp down on cartel financing. 

The US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, said it issued the orders “as being of primary money laundering concern” against CIBanco SA, Intercam Banco SA and brokerage Vector Casa de Bolsa SA, according to a statementBloomberg Terminal Wednesday.

ARLINGTON, Texas — Southwest Airlines is considering airport lounges, more premium seating and even long-haul international flights to win over high-spending customers, CEO Bob Jordan said Wednesday.

"Whatever customers need in 2025, 2030, we won't take any of that off the table. We'll do it the Southwest way but we're not going to say 'We would never do that,'" Jordan said in an interview with CNBC at an airport industry conference. "We know we send customers to other airlines because there's some things you might want that you can't get on us. That includes things like lounges, like true premium, like flying long-haul international."

Southwest is in the middle of a transformation. That has included undoing some of its policies like open seating, a uniform cabin and allowing all customers to check two bags for free, things that had set it apart from rivals in much of its 54 years of flying.

But it has faced pressure from competitors, and an activist investor last year pushed the carrier to increase revenue. And airfare in the U.S. has dropped.

Southwest and other carriers pulled their 2025 forecasts earlier this year, citing economic uncertainty. Jordan said Wednesday that the airline is continuing to see cheaper fares.

"The summer is generally never on sale, and the summer is heavily on sale right now," he said.

Despite making major changes to its business model, Jordan said the carrier hasn't seen customers defect to other airlines since it introduced no-frills basic economy tickets and bag fees late last month, policies rivals already had.

But making changes at the high end is important, too, he said.

Competitors like Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines have added more luxury tourism destinations and roomier, more expensive seats, and they've also invested heavily in airport lounges. For example, earlier Wednesday, American unveiled plans to nearly double its lounge space at its Miami International Airport hub.

Jordan said it's "way too soon to put any specifics" on potential changes, but he called out Southwest stronghold Nashville International Airport — where the airline has a more than 50% market share, according to airport data — as a place where customers are hungry for luxury.

"Nashville loves us, and we know we have Nashville customers that want lounges. They want first class. They want to get to Europe and they're going to Europe," he said.

But getting those things means those customers have to book on another airline, which could make them more likely to add that rival's co-branded credit card to their wallets, too, he said.

"I want to send fewer and fewer customers to another airline," he said.

Jordan said it's also too early to say whether Southwest will make the shift to buying longer-haul aircraft, which it would need to go to Europe; it's relied on the Boeing 737 for more than half a century. Southwest has been forging international partnerships — Icelandair and China Airlines, so far— but a Southwest plane landing in Europe at some point is on the table, he said.

"No commitment, but you can certainly see a day when we are as Southwest Airlines serving long-haul destinations like Europe," he said. "Obviously you would need a different aircraft to serve that mission and we're open to looking at what it would take to serve that mission."

In the nearer term, Southwest is still awaiting deliveries of Boeing 737 Max 7s, the smallest plane in the Max family, which still hasn't won Federal Aviation Administration certification. Jordan said the manufacturer has made progress with more consistent deliveries recently, but Southwest doesn't expect to fly the Max 7 in 2026.

NYC Mayoral Race:

Zohran Mamdani during a campaign event in New York, on June 23.

Even Zohran Mamdani's detractors recognize that the vibes are with the 33-year-old democratic socialist.

“It's officially hot commie summer,” hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb said on X, after Mamdani shocked the Democratic establishment by crushing Andrew Cuomo in the party's primary for the New York City mayoral race.

Kalshi Inc., a prediction market that competes with Polymarket, said it has raised $185 million at a valuation of $2 billion. Paradigm, a venture capital firm focused on cryptocurrency investments, is leading the deal.

Kalshi is similar to Polymarket, which also is completing an investment at a valuation of more than $1 billion. While Kalshi is federally regulated and cleared to operate in the US, Polymarket is not registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and its service is banned for Americans.

Nvidia shares rose nearly 3% on Wednesday and headed for a record close for the first time since January, as investors gain confidence that the company's leadership in artificial intelligence won't be dampened by Chinese export controls.

The stock rose as high as $153.55 during the day, exceeding its prior intraday record. It's currently trading at $153.53, which would put it past its closing high of $149.43 on Jan. 6.

Nvidia is now worth $3.7 trillion, making it the largest company in the world by market cap, slightly beating out Microsoft, one of its main customers. Apple is third at about $3 trillion.

While Nvidia remains the clear leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) that are being used to build large language models and run AI workloads, the strength of this year's rally is surprising given that the company has said it's locked out of the world's second-biggest economy.

In April, the Trump administration issued new rules that cut off sales of the company's H20 AI processor that had been developed to meet prior restrictions. Nvidia said last month that the change instituted by the U.S. government would cost the company $8 billion in sales, and that it had to write off $4.5 billion in inventory. Now, Nvidia isn't counting on any sales from China.

"The $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last month.

And there's another forthcoming rule that will expand export restrictions on AI chips, Trump administration officials previously said.

Still, in its earnings report in May, Nvidia reported a 69% increase in year-over-year revenue, powered by a 73% surge in its data center business. For the full fiscal year, analysts are expecting 53% revenue growth to almost $200 billion, according to LSEG.

Nvidia is holding its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

Shell pushed back Wednesday on reports that is in talks to buy rival BP.

People familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal that Shell was in early-stage talks to acquire BP, though a deal was far from certain. The talks are moving slowly, one person told the Journal.

BP shares jumped more than 10% to a session high of $32.94 on the report. Shell, however, subsequently denied talks were talking place. BP shares were last up about 2%. 

"This is further market speculation. No talks are taking place," a Shell spokesperson told CNBC. "As we have said many times before we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification."

It is unlikely Shell would purchase the entirety of BP, people familiar with the matter told CNBC's Brian Sullivan. It is more likely that BP would be split and sold in pieces to multiple companies if a deal did transpire, the people said.

BP has as underperformed Shell and U.S. rivals as it has struggled to find direction in recent years, fueling speculation that the British oil major is an acquisition target. 

BP set ambitious goals five years ago to slash carbon dioxide emissions and invest in renewable energy. But its green pivot came under scrutiny as profits faltered. BP announced a strategic reset earlier this year, doubling down on oil and gas while slashing spending on renewables.  

Activist investor Elliott Management disclosed in April that it has built a stake of more than 5% in BP, fueling speculation that the oil major would come under pressure to focus on its core fossil fuel business.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said Spain's refusal to meet the NATO defense spending target of 5% of gross domestic product will mean a tougher trade deal for the southern European country.

Speaking at a news conference at NATO's annual summit in the Netherlands, Trump said it was "terrible" that Spain wouldn't commit to meeting the target by 2035.

"You know they are doing very well. The economy is [doing] very well. And that economy could be blown right out of the water with something bad happening," Trump said.

"You know what we're going to do? We're negotiating with Spain on a trade deal and we're going to make them pay twice as much — and I'm actually serious about that. I like Spain … it's a great place and they are great people, but Spain is the only country out of all of the countries that refuses to pay," he continued.

"So, they want a little bit of a free ride, but they will have to pay it back to us on trade because I am not going to let that happen. It's unfair," Trump said.

His comments come shortly after NATO allies agreed to more than double their defense spending target from 2% of GDP to 5% by 2035.

In a joint declaration, the Western military bloc said it was "united in the face of profound security threats and challenges," in particular the long-term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security and the "persistent threat" of terrorism.

Earlier in the day, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the country would meet NATO's new capabilities targets, which refer to measures members should take to defend themselves and the broader military alliance.

However, Sanchez said Madrid considers current defense spending of 2% of GDP as "sufficient, realistic and compatible with the welfare state," Reuters reported. Sanchez also reportedly thanked NATO allies for "respecting Spain's sovereignty."

A Spanish government spokesperson was not immediately available when contacted by CNBC.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday doubled down on his claim that U.S. bomb strikes completely destroyed Iran's nuclear program, and he bristled at the attention being paid to an initial American intelligence report that suggests otherwise.

"It's been obliterated, totally obliterated," Trump said of the Iranian nuclear site at Fordo during a news conference, before he departed a NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands.

A preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment, however, found that America's airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites did not completely destroy those facilities.

Rather, the U.S. bombings likely set Iran's nuclear program back by a few months, not years, according to the assessment, which was first reported by CNN and matched by other outlets including NBC News.

Trump on Wednesday acknowledged the existence of the Defense Intelligence Agency's report, which has not been made public but has been described to journalists by people familiar with it. But he suggested the data that informed it was insufficient.

"They did a report, but it was like, if you look at the dates, it's just a few days after, so they didn't see" the sites, Trump said.

"The report was not a complete report," he said.

He added that the assessment said the damage from the U.S. attacks "may be very severe," and complained that news outlets ignored that component in their reporting.

The reporting undermines claims from Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that the Saturday night strikes on Iran's Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan sites had totally "obliterated" the country's nuclear program.

The White House angrily pushed back on the report. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the initial assessment "flat-out wrong" and slammed the "anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community" who leaked the report's findings to the press.

Hegseth piled on, saying in a statement Tuesday evening that "anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission."

The Pentagon has launched a "leak investigation" with the FBI, Hegseth said Wednesday. He also noted that the report was preliminary and was labeled "low confidence."

Speaking alongside Trump at the press conference, Hegseth criticized "fake news" and defended the strikes.

"If you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordo, you better get a big shovel and go really deep, because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated," he said.

The White House also sent reporters a screenshot of a statement from Israel's Atomic Energy Commission, declaring that the U.S. strike on Fordo "destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable."

The commission said that the combined strikes from the U.S. and Israel have "set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years."

Classified briefings for the House and Senate on the situation in Iran, initially set for Tuesday, were both abruptly delayed that same morning.

The Senate briefing was reportedly rescheduled for Thursday and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said his chamber's briefing will be held Friday.

A crucial government panel of vaccine advisors is holding its first meeting Wednesday since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed several vaccine critics to the group. 

Earlier this month, Kennedy in a stunning step removed and replaced all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group reviews vaccine data and makes recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts.

ACIP members are independent medical and public experts who make recommendations based on rigorous scientific review and evidence. It is unclear how Kennedy's new members, given some of their skepticism of immunizations, will affect vaccine policy and availability in the U.S. 

"Vaccines are not all good or bad," Dr. Martin Kulldorff, the new ACIP chair, said in opening remarks.

"If you think that all vaccines are safe and effective and want them all, or if you think that all vaccines are dangerous and don't want any of them, then you don't have much use for us. You already know what you want," said Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who questioned lockdowns and other public health measures early in the Covid-19 pandemic.

"But if you wish to know which vaccines are suitable for you and your children and at what ages, then we will provide you with evidence-based recommendations," he added.

During a full-day meeting Wednesday in Atlanta, the panel will evaluate data on Covid-19 vaccines and RSV shots, with a vote on recommendations for the latter. The group will convene again on Thursday to review data on shots for the flu and other diseases. 

The CDC director has to sign off on those recommendations for them to become official policy.

Kulldorff said ACIP will create new work groups, which are staff that review published and unpublished data and develop recommendation options to present to the committee. One new work group will review the childhood vaccine schedule, while another will examine shots that have not been subject to reviews in more than seven years, he said.

The latter group may examine the universally recommended hepatitis B vaccine and ask whether it is "wise" to administer the shot to every newborn before they leave the hospital, among other topics, Kulldorff added.

"This was supposed to be a regular practice of the ACIP, but it has not been done in a thorough and systematic way. We will change that," Kulldorff said.

Ahead of the meeting, one of Kennedy's new appointees stepped down from the panel.

In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew from ACIP during a mandatory review of each member's financial holdings, without providing further details. It is unclear what his financial holdings are.

Ross is a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology and has served on another CDC advisory panel focused on breast and cervical cancer.

A CDC web page on conflict of interest disclosures for ACIP members does not appear to list any for Kennedy's members, apart from Dr. Cody Meissner.

Kennedy's eight new members include some well-known vaccine critics, such as Dr. Robert Malone.

Malone bills himself as having played a key role in the creation of mRNA vaccines, but has gained a large following for making baseless and disproven claims about Covid-19 shots. 

Another new member, Retsef Levi, has pushed to stop giving mRNA vaccines, falsely claiming in a post on X that they cause "serious harm including death, especially among young people."

Another member, Vicky Pebsworth, is a nurse on the board of The National Vaccine Information Center. That organization has been widely criticized as a leading source of misinformation and fearmongering about immunization.

During the meeting on Wednesday, Pebsworth revealed that she owns stock and health-care sector funds that include vaccine manufacturers. But she said her holdings are under the amount the government considers to be a conflict of interest, allowing her to participate in the ACIP meeting.

Kennedy fired previous ACIP members for having what he called "persistent conflicts of interest." But all HHS agencies and their advisory panels have had rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years.

America's Top States for Business 2025 will be revealed July 10 - stay tuned for coverage of this year's rankings

On a massive, 2,250-acre site about 250 miles north of New Orleans, hundreds of construction workers and tons of heavy equipment are turning former soybean fields into what will be the largest data center in the Western Hemisphere. And in the process, officials say, they are transforming Louisiana's economy.

"It put us on a scale that has a lot of people, not just domestically, but internationally, sort of rethinking Louisiana," Secretary of Economic Development Susan Bourgeois told CNBC.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, announced in December that it had chosen Louisiana as the site for its largest data center to date — a $10 billion hub for its rapidly growing artificial intelligence operations. The announcement set off the public phase of a sprawling, real world experiment in the promise and the peril of data centers — which have become among the most sought-after trophies in the battle between the states for business.

Data centers are essentially giant collections of computer servers, which are needed to process enormously complex operations for things like artificial intelligence and data storage. They typically take up massive spaces and use huge amounts of power and water, but they employ very few people. Meta's newest data center will ultimately create just 500 permanent jobs, though employment will briefly swell to about 5,000 during construction. Nonetheless, Meta found itself with no shortage of suitors willing to meet its demands.

"We set out looking for a place where we could expand into gigawatts pretty quickly, and really get moving within that community on a large plot of land very quickly," said Rachel Peterson, vice president of data centers for Meta. "We looked at finding very, very large contiguous plots of land that had access to the infrastructure that we need, the energy that we needed, and could move very, very quickly for us."

Louisiana was one of the few states that could deliver a site as large as Meta needed — the equivalent of about 1,700 football fields. The state had already purchased most of the land, in rural Richland Parish, back in 2006 in hopes of luring an automotive plant that never materialized.

As for the energy — the Meta site will use roughly twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day — local utility Entergy said it could deliver.

"What I see is an opportunity for this industry to grow in a way it hasn't seen in many decades," said Phillip May, CEO of Entergy Louisiana. The company is seeking regulatory approval to build not one, but three gas-fired power plants at the site, at a cost of more than $3 billion.

The one piece Louisiana did not have was one that Bourgeois said was non-negotiable for Meta: a program to allow the company to avoid paying potentially billions of dollars in sales tax on the equipment to build and operate the center.

Last June, only six months after taking office, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law a 20-year sales tax exemption for data centers built before 2029. The fact that the state was courting Meta at the time was not disclosed.

"The Meta folks made it clear to us from day one that in order for a project like this to happen in any state, that exemption or rebate — whatever the formula is — has to exist," Bourgeois said.

"It's one of the things that we look at," said Peterson. "Obviously these are very high investment capital projects for us and any others who are developing data centers and investing them. So, we do look at the overall cost of the project to make sure it's in line with what we'd expect," she added.

A recent CNBC investigation found that in just the past five years, 16 states have handed out nearly $6 billion in similar sales tax breaks, and that is just the ones that have been disclosed. More often, the amounts are either undisclosed, or, as appears to be the case in Louisiana, officials don't know the exact cost yet.

An analysis by the state's Legislative Fiscal Office in May said the incentive could cost the state "tens of millions of dollars or more each year, possibly through (fiscal year) 2059."

But whatever the cost, Bourgeois said the benefits of the project outweigh it.

"This wasn't about what the state would win or lose, just that one isolated sales tax," she said. "This was about we want to compete with Texas. We want to compete with Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, all our Southern neighbors."

Meta earned $164.5 billion in revenue last year.

There are also concerns about the energy needs of the facility, even though Entergy has committed to generate massive amounts of electricity to support it.

The Louisiana Public Service Commission is considering the utility's proposal to build three new power plants. But a citizen's group, Alliance for Affordable Energy, is warning that the project could compromise the state's power grid and increase electricity rates statewide.

"While they're building new power plants, they're also adding a huge consumer of electricity," said Jackson Voss, Climate Policy Coordinator for the group. "Which means we're all still facing the same vulnerabilities that we were before, but now with a huge new data center added on."

Louisiana has a spotty track record on grid reliability. According to U.S. Department of Energy data analyzed by CNBC for this year's America's Top States for Business study, the average Louisiana customer lost power for 9.7 hours in 2023, the most recent data available, ranking the state in 40th place, though Entergy by itself performed substantially better.

Still, as many as 100,000 Entergy customers in the New Orleans area lost power on Memorial Day weekend when the regional power grid became overloaded.

Entergy's May said that the added generation capacity for the Meta facility — including 1,500 megawatts of solar power in addition to the gas-fired plants — will make the grid more stable, not less. And he said the project will ultimately reduce electric bills across the state.

"We're getting new power plants that will be improving in terms of the efficiency. There will be lower fuel costs as a result of adding incremental, more efficient power plants," he said.

Plus, he said, while Entergy will pay for the power plants, Meta will pay for the infrastructure to connect to them.

"So, hundreds of millions of dollars of support from this customer that would not otherwise have been there had Meta not come."  

More important, he said, the project will be a huge economic boost for Richland Parish — one of the poorest areas in the state, if not the nation.

"This massive $10 billion investment, coupled with the billions of dollars that we're going to invest ourselves, is going to bring new opportunities for these communities," he said.

"500 jobs in Richland Parish, or even in this northeast Louisiana region, is transformational," Bourgeois said.

Plus, she said, this project opens the door for more of the same.

"I could try to sell Louisiana to the world for a long time," she said. "The fact that [Meta] chose us makes my job a lot easier."

ESPN is renewing its media deal with the Premier Lacrosse League and taking an equity stake in the organization.

The five-year deal will begin with the 2026 season and include all PLL regular-season games as well as All-Star, playoff and championship games and Women's Lacrosse League games. The deal comes as pro lacrosse has seen gains across broadcast, partnerships and attendance. It will also be added to the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

Alongside the deal, Disney-owned ESPN said it will take a minority stake in the league. A person familiar with the terms, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic details, said the investment gives ESPN a 3% stake.

"ESPN are not only experts in their understanding sports fans, but they are also great predictors of audience and growth," PLL co-founder and president Paul Rabil told CNBC. "It's validating that they came in to invest in what we're building, and then as a partner, in addition to the expansion of coverage that they'll be giving."

Rabil said the media deal with ESPN has been critical to the sport's growth. He said the network has been investing in lacrosse for roughly three decades.

The partnership also seems to be paying off for ESPN. During the 2024 season, viewership on ABC for the PLL's championship game was up 9% year over year. The league also had its most-viewed All-Star game in its history, which aired on ESPN.

The PLL is also seeing growth in nearly all metrics. Since 2019, paid tickets are up 34%, attendance is up 13%, ticket revenue is up 149% and sponsor dollars are up more than 100%, Rabil said.

The league, now in its seventh season, has financial backing from the likes of Joe Tsai, the Chernin Group, Arctos, the Kraft Group and CAA.

Last year, PLL announced it was starting a Women's Lacrosse League, which is currently in its inaugural season.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

The U.S. entering the Israel-Iran conflict over the weekend has dominated media headlines, but the rustlings this week at the "Summer Davos" conference in Tianjin, China, were more about navigating a future less intertwined with Washington.

A decade ago, goods, capital, tech and talent flowed between the so-called East and West; now it's about flows between Global South countries, said Ben Simpfendorfer, Hong Kong-based partner at management consultancy Oliver Wyman.

"The mood [in Tianjin] reflects a changed world order. The Global South is more connected than ever."

Global South loosely refers to less developed economies, especially countries outside the U.S. and European orbits. Think Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East — all regions China has sought to develop trade and political relations with.

"There are 130 neutral countries that are willing to do business across geopolitical fractures and are looking for business, and many of them are run by leaders who are relatively internationalist ... I do look forward to opportunities in the Global South," said Aparna Bharadwaj, managing director at Global Advantage Practice at a WEF panel.

China, which has been deepening its relationship with the Global South, had its Premier Li Qiang urging more trade for "reshaping" the world order at the WEF forum on Wednesday.

"We could be moving to a world where Asia and the Middle East emerge as a new and compelling economic bloc that are still integrated to a degree with Europe and the United States but that integration fluctuates," Simpfendorfer said.

Since 2007, the Swiss-based World Economic Forum has run a summer version of its Davos gathering in China, alternating between the cities of Tianjin and Dalian, both in the northern part of the country.

But as local Chinese governments have ramped up their own conferences and the overall economy has slowed, foreign businesses interested in China have not had to rely as much on Summer Davos matchmaking. Disruptions from the pandemic and U.S-China tensions have also taken their toll.

This year though, even otherwise quiet groups of attendees turned into slightly aggressive crowds to snag spots for select events including talks on artificial intelligence and the economic outlook.

Seats filled up fast for the release of WEF's annual "Top 10 Emerging Technologies" report — now in its third year of collaboration with the Dubai Future Foundation. Previously, the report had been created by the forum with Scientific American.

Some prominent leaders took the opportunity to visit China. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa Azín were among the top political leaders attending this year.

"The U.S. tariff shock has been a wake-up call for the Global South in general about the need to diversify," Simpfendorfer said, citing recent conversations with businesses in Malaysia and Vietnam.

But he pointed out that it won't be easy to shift from targeting one U.S. market to multiple Global South markets.

To attract trade partners, countries from Egypt to Vietnam to China are all trying to enhance their economic competitiveness.

"It's a wake-up call for Chinese multinationals to build out genuinely international businesses," Simpfendorfer said, adding that the learnings from the past two decades would no longer be a good guide for the next 20 years, given the transformational impact of artificial intelligence.

Egyptian Minister of Investment and Trade Hassan El Khatib told CNBC's Chery Kang on the sidelines of the forum on Tuesday that the country aspires to be in the top 20 in business competitiveness by 2030, following a major reform program launched last year to spur private sector development. He emphasized Egypt's labor pool and engineering talent, and noted how the country was courting investors from around the world.

As U.S.-China tensions remain far from resolved, more countries may be keen to take the Chinese premier up on his invitation to reshape the world.

—  CNBC's Bernice Ooi contributed to this report.

Johnson Chui, Head of Global Issuer Services at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, talks about recent renewed interest in Hong Kong as a market, as it attracts a wave of foreign investors and IPOs. 

Eswar Prasad, professor at Cornell University and former head of IMF's China division, talks about why both U.S. and China are feeling the pressure to "lower the temperature" on their trade relationship.

Joe Ngai, Chairman of McKinsey China, believes that corporates in China have shown resilience despite external threats including tariff uncertainties and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

China's fiscal revenue growth stalls in May. The central government's fiscal revenue grew just 0.1% in May from a year earlier, slowing from a 1.9% expansion in April. Non-tax revenue declined 2.2%, its first annual drop since 2014, while tax revenue saw a modest gain of 0.6% from a year earlier.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang urged not to turn trade into a political matter. He was speaking at the opening plenary of the World Economic Forum's annual conference in China, often dubbed "Summer Davos." The Chinese leader called on other countries to collaborate on trade and pledged to "make China a mega-sized consumption powerhouse."

Beijing tempers criticism of Israel. China initially pledged to support Iran shortly after Israel's attack on June 12. Despite that initial show of support for Iran, Beijing's rhetoric has shifted to become more measured.

— Anniek Bao

Mainland China and Hong Kong stocks rose early Wednesday amid mixed trading in the region, as investors weighed a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, and fresh commentary from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Mainland China's CSI 300 was up 0.35%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes major Chinese companies — had gained 0.77% as of 12:20 p.m. local time.

According to data provided by Spot On Chain, an Ethereum whale from the ICO era recently sent $12.1 million into the Kraken exchange. 

The whale in question received a total of 107,000 ETH at Genesis. This massive sum would be worth roughly $243 million at current prices. These tokens cost them just $31,000 back then. 

Ethereum (ETH) is currently the worst-performing cryptocurrency in the top 10 with a weekly drop of 3.2%, according to CoinGecko data. It is down 1.2% over the past 24 hours. 

The flagship altcoin is still down 50.5% from the all-time high that was achieved in late 2021 despite the fact that Bitcoin hit a record peak in May. 

Earlier this week, another Ethereum ICO whale deposited more than $5 million worth of ETH to the Binance exchange after an entire decade of inactivity.

 Bitcoin price continues moving higher as a ceasefire between Iran and Israel holds, and traders anticipate a round of interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve. 

Key points:

Bitcoin's relief rally rose above $108,000, but the bulls may struggle to push and sustain the price above the all-time high of $111,980.

Several major altcoins have bounced off their recent lows but are not finding buyers at higher levels.

Bitcoin's (BTC) relief rally that started on Monday, following US President Donald Trump's “total ceasefire” announcement between Israel and Iran, rose above $108,000, indicating sustained demand from the bulls.

Institutional investors did not stop buying despite increasing geopolitical tensions in the past few days, as seen from the 11 consecutive days of inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange‑traded funds (ETFs). According to Farside Investors' data, the ETFs attracted $3.35 billion in inflows starting June 9.

Bitcoin looks set to challenge the all-time high at $111,980, but the cryptocurrency markets may require a catalyst to hold on to the higher levels. The absence of a trigger may extend Bitcoin's stay inside the range for some more time.

Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high, pulling altcoins higher? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin turned up sharply from $100,000 on Monday and rose above the moving averages, indicating solid buying at lower levels.

The 20-day exponential moving average ($105,154) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) has jumped into positive territory, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. Sellers are expected to defend the zone between the downtrend line and the all-time high of $111,980.

If the price turns down from the overhead zone but finds support at the 20-day EMA, it signals that the bulls are buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to clear the overhead zone. 

On the contrary, a slide below the moving averages suggests the BTC/USDT pair may consolidate between $111,980 and $98,200 for a while longer.

Ether (ETH) turned up from the $2,111 level on Sunday and reached the 20-day EMA ($2.473) on Tuesday.

The 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. If the price rises above the moving averages, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to $2,738 and then to $2,879.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below $2,323, it signals that bears are selling on rallies. The pair may then retest the solid support at $2,111.

XRP's (XRP) sharp bounce off the $2 support on Monday indicates that the bulls are vigorously defending the level.

Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, signaling that the range-bound action between $2 and $2.65 may continue for a few more days.

The next trending move is likely to begin if buyers drive the price above $2.65 or sellers pull the XRP/USDT pair below $2. If the $2 support breaks down, the pair could decline to the $1.61 level. On the upside, a break above $2.65 clears the path for a rally to $3 and then to $3.40.

BNB (BNB) turned up from the support line of the descending channel pattern on Sunday and reached the resistance line on Wednesday.

If buyers do not give up much ground from the resistance line, the prospects of a break above the channel improve. The BNB/USDT pair could ascend to $675 and, after that, to $698.

Contrarily, a break below $625 suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the resistance line. The pair may then tumble to the support line near $580, extending the stay inside the channel for a few more days.

Solana (SOL) turned up from $126 on Sunday and broke above the breakdown level of $140 on Monday.

The recovery is facing selling at the 20-day EMA ($147), but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to slide below $140. A shallow pullback increases the possibility of a break above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the SOL/USDT pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($160).

Sellers will have to pull and sustain the price below the $140 support to prevent the upside. The pair could then drop to $123 and eventually to $110.

Dogecoin (DOGE) rebounded off the $0.14 support on Sunday, but the relief rally may face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.17). 

If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the bears will make one more attempt to pull the DOGE/USDT pair below $0.14. If they manage to do that, the pair could tumble to the solid support at $0.10.

Alternatively, if buyers push the price above the 20-day EMA, the next stop could be the 50-day SMA ($0.20). Sellers will try to halt the recovery at the 50-day SMA, keeping the pair inside the $0.14 to $0.21 range for some more time.

Cardano (ADA) rebounded off the $0.50 support on Sunday, but the recovery is likely to face selling at the moving averages.

If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA ($0.61), it suggests that the bears are selling on every minor rally. That increases the risk of a break below the $0.50 support. If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could slump to $0.40.

Instead, if buyers pierce the 20-day EMA, the pair could reach the 50-day SMA ($0.69). Sellers are expected to defend the zone between the 50-day SMA and the downtrend line, but if the bulls prevail, the pair will signal a potential trend change.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($33.37) on Monday and rose above the 20-day EMA ($37.13).

If buyers maintain the price above the 20-day EMA, the HYPE/USDT pair could surge to $42.50. Buyers may find it difficult to push the price above the $42.50 to $45.80 resistance zone.

On the downside, a break below the 20-day EMA signals a lack of buyers at higher levels. That opens the doors for a fall to the 50-day SMA and later to the crucial support at $30.50.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($450) on Wednesday, indicating that lower levels continue to attract buyers.

The price has reached the overhead resistance of $500, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. However, if buyers do not cede much ground to the bears, it increases the likelihood of a break above $500. If that happens, the BCH/USDT pair could surge to $550.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($424). The pair may then plunge to $375.

Sui (SUI) turned up sharply on Monday and reached the 20-day EMA ($2.94) on Tuesday, where the bears are posing a stiff challenge. 

The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory signal that bears hold the edge. Sellers will try to pull the price toward the $2.29 to $2 support zone, but the buyers are likely to have other plans.

The bulls will try to arrest the decline and push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the SUI/USDT pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($3.39). Such a move suggests the correction may be over.

As meme coin trading surges in popularity, Telegram-based bots are quickly becoming essential tools for crypto enthusiasts seeking speed, convenience, and automation.

One of the most promising new entrants is Snorter Token, a Solana-powered trading bot that fuses meme coin culture with real on-chain functionality. 

Currently in its ICO phase, SNORT is aiming to disrupt the market by challenging established bots like BonkBot—delivering enhanced features at a fraction of the cost.

Summary

While Snorter Token embraces the playful energy of meme culture, it's far from a gimmick. 

Built directly into Telegram, the bot allows users to trade trending Solana tokens, monitor real-time market data, and even mirror the moves of top-performing wallets—all without ever leaving the app.

With future expansion planned across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Base, and other EVM-compatible networks, Snorter Token is positioning itself as a cross-chain hub for meme coin enthusiasts and automated trading strategies alike.

Currently priced under $1, Snorter Token remains in its early stage of development. Having raised $1.2 million to date and with a modest hard cap, the project offers an appealing entry point for early investors ahead of expected growth.

More than just a utility tool, Snorter Token delivers value from multiple angles—as both a practical trading bot and a promising crypto asset. It's positioned not only as a product but as a foundational piece of a growing, revenue-generating ecosystem.

SNORT isn't just riding the meme wave—it's delivering a competitive feature set that appeals to both novice and experienced traders:

These features combine to offer a smoother, more efficient trading experience—especially for users who find desktop platforms intimidating or overly complex.

Snorter Token is quickly evolving from a quirky meme project into a serious contender in the Telegram trading space. With over 12,000 followers on X and posts hitting 100,000+ views, the project is gaining significant organic traction.

It has also attracted early attention from reputable crypto media platforms like CryptoSpeaker, NewsBTC, Crypto Daily, and CoinMarketCap—bolstering its credibility and appeal among early adopters.

The team's branding—a fun, meme-ready mascot paired with a humor-driven tone—taps perfectly into Web3 culture, making the project both marketable and community-friendly.

But Snorter Token isn't just about appearances. It's setting a new standard in Telegram-based trading by combining viral appeal with functional depth.

Unlike early bots like BonkBot, Snorter Token introduces lower fees, advanced trading tools, and multi-chain capabilities—all wrapped in a user-friendly Telegram interface.

This seamless blend of culture and technology removes the complexity of traditional platforms, empowering everyday traders with powerful tools right where they already chat and trade.

Snorter Token isn't just another meme project—it's a full-fledged trading ecosystem built for the modern trader. With its ICO nearing completion, there's still time to get in early, but its long-term value lies in the real utility it brings to Telegram-based trading.

For those looking to trade smarter, capitalize on meme coin volatility, or simply explore the next generation of crypto bots, Snorter Token offers a compelling blend of fun, function, and forward-thinking development.

San Francisco-based financial services company SoFi will make its return to crypto later this year, offering its users the ability to trade and hold popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the firm announced on Wednesday. 

SoFi previously offered the capability to buy and sell crypto, and even acquired the notoriously difficult-to-obtain New York BitLicense in 2019—but the firm stopped offering crypto services in 2023 after “careful consideration.” 

The firm also mentioned plans to offer customers stablecoins in the future, along with crypto staking features, borrowing against their crypto holdings, and other services.

“The future of financial services is being completely reinvented through innovations in crypto, digital assets, and blockchain more broadly,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto in a statement.

“Crypto and blockchain innovations can and will be threaded through each of our businesses and capabilities, including buying, paying, saving, investing, borrowing, and protecting,” he added. “And in doing so, we will continue to stand alone in offering our members unmatched products and services as the only digital one-stop shop for their financial needs.”

The firm's intentions to re-enter the crypto market shouldn't come as a surprise, as the move was outlined by Noto during a January earnings call. 

During that call, Noto leaned on the need for crypto regulations, highlighting that his firm would be “aggressive” once further clarity was provided.

One such example outlined in the firm's Wednesday announcement is the ability for nationally chartered banks, like SoFi Bank, N.A., to custody crypto and execute services on their behalf. 

In May, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an interpretive letter permitting national banks to do so, signaling a broader alignment with easing regulations against crypto policies and companies that President Trump's administration has ushered in.

In addition to re-enabling crypto trading and custody, the firm says it has “many planned crypto and blockchain innovations” it intends to roll out through its “one-stop shop” of financial services. 

Shares of SoFi Technologies (SOFI) are up about 0.7% today to $15.96, with the price up about 13% so far this year.

SoFi did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

Ethereum faces widespread perception as a network in crisis. It has been characterized as a platform plagued by governance upheaval, community fragmentation, and high gas fees. Additionally, Ethereum receives a lot of criticism for its slow performance, which lags behind Bitcoin's institutional appeal and Solana's speculative excitement.



This narrative misses Ethereum's central purpose and strategy. Both of which are driven by deliberate decentralized innovation, which is now beginning to pay off.



Ethereum has chosen the more difficult but ultimately more sustainable path. This is based on the fact that it has maintained functional governance, which enables continued technical advancement. It also preserves credible decentralization, creating competitive advantages that neither pure stability nor pure speed can replicate. This positions Ethereum as the only blockchain capable of long-term sustainable innovation.



Concerns around Ethereum's “identity crisis” reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes blockchain technology valuable in the first place. When critics focus on short-term metrics like transaction costs and processing speed, they're forgetting the revolutionary potential of a truly decentralized computing platform.



Ethereum's challenges are the growing pains of building something unprecedented: a global, permissionless computer that no single entity can control or shut down. The high gas fees demonstrate real demand for blockspace on the world's most secure and decentralized smart contract platform.



The governance discussions that appear as "upheaval" to outsiders represent healthy democratic processes that other chains avoid by maintaining centralized control, or by effectively forbidding all change and improvement. This nuanced reality gets lost in narratives that prioritize simplicity over substance.



Despite being criticised as a digital “pet rock,” Bitcoin has received widespread respect as the first cryptocurrency to see legitimacy outside of the industry. “Bitcoin-maxis” even point to the chain's inertia as a critical tenet of bitcoin's value. Since the chain rarely updates, except for predictable supply halvings, bitcoin can remain a “digital gold.” However, this simplicity is a ceiling, not a strength.



Bitcoin has ossified; initially slow to innovate, improvements are now effectively impossible.



“Bitcoin-maxis” would argue that the chain's ossification only strengthens the asset's immutable value. But, bitcoin's liquidity is tenuous; it relies on perception, and recent reports demonstrate that bitcoin's value isn't an inherent certainty.



Ethereum, by contrast, continues to evolve through major upgrades like the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 and the recent Pectra update. Unlike Bitcoin, the Ethereum community continues to demonstrate that it is capable of meaningful technological innovation.



Many of Ethereum's critics point to the impressive speed and low costs of other chains as examples of where Ethereum is failing. These feats are achieved quickly only by giving up on meaningful decentralization.



Ethereum is a credibly neutral world computer with thousands of projects innovating on it precisely because of its ethos of decentralization.



Some form of centralized leadership may seem like a small price to pay for quicker change, but decentralization matters in the same way that seat belts do. It's an inconvenience until it's necessary; until an account is de-platformed, or the system makes an unpopular choice because of centralized interests that are not in line with its users' values.



History provides countless examples of centralized systems eventually serving their controllers rather than their users - this is such a common pattern it's practically a law. Traditional financial institutions routinely freeze accounts, deny services, or impose arbitrary fees based on political or business considerations.



Decentralization is not a long-term goal; it is a foundational necessity for building systems permanently free from corruption.



Ethereum has chosen the most technically and socially difficult but correct route: building a truly decentralized platform that serves the needs of its users. That's the hard thing to do, but it's also the right thing to do, because it produces the best result in the long term.



This approach is slower than Solana's and less obvious than Bitcoin's, but it's the only path that delivers both continued innovation and genuine user sovereignty.



It is beginning to see results, too. Earlier this month, Bernstein analysts published a research report stating that "The narrative around value accrual of public blockchain networks is at a critical inflection point,” and “starting to reflect in investor interest in ETH ETF inflows."



Ethereum price is certainly trending upwards. Ethereum ETFs just completed their longest inflow streak of 2025, with BlackRock's ETHA fund alone adding $492 million in a single week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs experienced $582 million in net outflows during the same period.



Despite this positive momentum, the Ethereum community needs to concern itself less with trailing indicators of success like price. As John Maynard Keynes famously warned, “the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”



The Ethereum community must avoid getting distracted by price movements, governance drama, or competing narratives and unite around their common mission: building credibly neutral infrastructure that serves humanity's needs. Ethereum's ability to innovate while staying decentralized requires developers, researchers, validators, and users to shut out the noise and remain focused on building. This path is harder, but it's the only one that leads to sustainable success.

              Highlights            



                        The Federal Reserve's removal of “reputational risk” from formal bank exams could potentially clear the way for banks to engage more openly with cryptocurrency and other previously controversial industries.                      


                        Legislation is advancing in Congress to regulate stablecoins and digital assets, aiming to clarify the roles of the SEC and CFTC, which could establish a formalized, compliant path for Wall Street institutions to enter the crypto space.                      


                        As zillennials — a microgeneration comprising older members of Generation Z and younger millennials — gravitate toward digital-first banking and FinTechs gain ground, traditional banks face questions around crypto integration and offerings.

When the Federal Reserve Board announced in a Monday (June 23) press release that it would no longer include “reputational risk” in its formal bank examinations and supervision programs, most consumers in the United States likely barely noticed.

However, in the corridors of compliance offices, FinTech startups, financial institutions and cryptocurrency-native firms, the reverberations were immediate.

On Capitol Hill, momentum is accelerating behind two legislative efforts: the GENIUS Act to bring stablecoins under federal oversight, which has passed the Senate and moved onto the House; and another which was unveiled by lawmakers Tuesday (June 24) and intends to create a framework for the development of legislation for digital assets.

The market structure bill seeks to clarify the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regarding regulating digital assets, delineate which tokens qualify as securities or commodities, and create a unified registration regime for crypto exchanges. Its framework could open the floodgates for Wall Street to enter crypto in a structured and compliant manner. That includes not just banks, but asset managers, broker-dealers and pension funds.

Together, these developments may mark a tipping point. Crypto, long considered an exotic and high-risk asset class by traditional financial institutions, is inching toward legitimacy. The question now looming large: Are banks ready?

Reputational risk has traditionally served as a catch-all justification for regulators to scrutinize, or even penalize, banks that dealt with industries deemed controversial. Historically, that has included everything from cannabis businesses to payday lenders to crypto firms. By removing this factor, the Fed signaled a shift from values-based supervision to risk-based supervision grounded in financial stability and consumer protection.

“This change does not alter the board's expectation that banks maintain strong risk management to ensure safety and soundness and compliance with law and regulation nor is it intended to impact whether and how board-supervised banks use the concept of reputational risk in their own risk management practices,” the Fed said in the press release.

“There's certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, told PYMNTS in April. “This is not a confrontational posture.”

But it's not just about removing a hurdle. The Fed's move coincides with a surge in interest among banks and credit unions to offer more digital-first financial products.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “How Zillennials Are Driving Innovation in Financial Services” found that 16% of zillennials — a microgeneration comprising older members of Generation Z and younger millennials — have their primary bank account with a digital-only bank. Only 11% of zillennials bank with a regional bank, less than the 22% who bank with a local bank or credit union.

Against this backdrop, the next wave of financial technology might just include crypto.

Today's end-users want faster payments, borderless money transfers and access to digital assets. Banks can either innovate or be disintermediated.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Credit Union Innovation Readiness Index: The Smallest Credit Unions Step It Up” found that when it comes to innovation, smaller lenders aren't standing still.

Still, the transition is not without peril. Crypto markets remain volatile, cyber threats are evolving and the regulatory landscape is still under construction. For banks, entering the space without a clear strategy could prove costly. Crypto in 2025, ultimately, isn't about hype; it's about infrastructure, compliance and risk management.

Banks will also need to reassess their internal capabilities. From hiring blockchain-savvy compliance officers to building secure custody solutions and forging partnerships with crypto-native firms, the cost of entry is high.

The flip side of the equation is the competitive landscape. Crypto-native firms and nimble FinTechs are already seizing market share. Companies like Coinbase, Circle, Fireblocks and Anchorage Digital have built robust infrastructure, compliant pathways and brand loyalty among digital-first users.

In this context, banks that hesitate risk being relegated to providing infrastructure but ceding customer relationships. The alternative is to lean into innovation, embrace partnerships and compete in trust, usability and security.

 ETH's two-week chart signals a bearish crossover, resembling a 2022 setup that preceded a 40% decline in the price of Ethereum. 

Key takeaways:

Ethereum has printed its first two-week death cross since 2022, historically linked to a ~40% price drop.

ETH faces downside risks while trading below two key trendlines. 

Strong network usage and volume indicate bullish potential.

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has printed its first “death cross” on its two-week chart since the 2022 bear market.

The bearish crossover occurred as ETH's 20-period exponential moving average (20-2W EMA; the red wave) slipped below its 50-period EMA (the blue wave). In mid-2022, a similar crossover preceded a 40% decline in Ether price.

The lead-up to Ether's death cross closely resembles the 2022 setup: a strong local top, followed by a multimonth consolidation phase, then a slow breakdown marked by lower highs. 

Additionally, in both past and present setups, Ethereum first closed below its 20-period EMA, then slid beneath the 50 EMA, forming a local bottom. It later tested these levels as resistance multiple times before reclaiming them.

As of June 2025, ETH was struggling to break above the 20- and 50-period EMAs despite repeated attempts.

Continued rejection at these moving averages keeps downside risks elevated, eyeing declines toward $1,835—a Fibonacci level from the 2021-2022 era—as the next price floor.

A decisive retaking of the 20-period and 50-period EMAs as support may increase ETH's potential of rallying toward the $3,500-4,000 price range, aligning with the Fibonacci targets.

Supporting this possibility, ETH's price rise since May has been accompanied by its strongest volume since July–August 2022, during the last bear market recovery phase. 

Also, Ether funds have witnessed their strongest inflows since 2021 in recent weeks, netting $2.43 billion so far in 2025 and managing $14.29 billion in assets overall.

The uptick in trading activity indicates renewed interest from retail and institutional participants. But the momentum appears to extend beyond mere speculation.

On June 24, the Ethereum network processed 1.45 million successful transactions, its highest daily count since January 2024, according to data resource Nansen.

The current surge points to increased utility demand from DApps, DeFi protocols, layer-2 interactions, and staking participation, all of which strengthen Ethereum's network value. 

That could lay the groundwork for a sustained recovery, aligning with both fractal and volume-based signals, if the trend persists.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Republic, a New York-based investment startup, is offering users exposure to SpaceX by issuing a "tokenized" representation of its shares.

The company will begin selling the digital tokens this week and eventually plans to expand the offering to other private companies like artificial intelligence darlings OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as Stripe, X, Waymo, Epic Games and more. The Wall Street Journal first reported the story Wednesday.

"We're talking about delivering products to retail investors that they've have been held out of previously," Republic co-CEO Andrew Durgee told CNBC. "The fact that retail investors couldn't own pre-IPO SpaceX has always been crazy to us. Now that's going to be attached to the upside of these pre-IPO businesses. The businesses that we target out of the gate we want to have a retail focus, or at least significant retail following."

In the crypto world, tokenization is the process of issuing digital representations on a blockchain network of publicly traded securities, real world assets or any other form of value. Holders of tokenized assets don't have outright ownership of the assets themselves.

The move comes as the U.S. crypto industry is testing new regulatory boundaries under President Donald Trump's pro-crypto administration. Since he took office, the Securities and Exchange Commission has moved swiftly to loosen the restraints left on the crypto industry by the previous administration, ending an enforcement case against Coinbase; closing investigations into Robinhood Crypto, Uniswap, Gemini and Consensys without enforcement action; scaling back its crypto enforcement unit; declaring meme coins are not securities and launching a Crypto Task Force that's been holding a series of roundtables on crypto asset regulation.

"If you take a step back and look at what the last four to eight years looked like in the space, innovation was very stifled," Durgee said. "The reality is the space was just difficult for most to understand and consume. Now we've gotten to a point where it's certainly become more mainstay."

"We've moved from what was ultimately ... nothing but headwinds," he added. "And now we're finally in a place industrywide, where we actually have tailwinds and we have some room to really innovate."

Republic will allow investors to invest between $50 and $5,000 in the tokens. Typically, those wanting to invest in private companies are required to meet a minimum closer to $10,000 and need to meet specific income or net-worth requirements. Shares of private company can be exchanged by accredited investors in secondary markets; Republic will initially price SpaceX tokens based on how the company's shares are performing there.

Tokenized private equity is new territory for regulators and the underlying companies being digitally represented. There are outstanding questions about the legality of the tokens, how Republic will give financial information to investors as required, and how selling private investments to retail investors could provoke stress in the financial markets.

"We don't need a company's approval to be able to do these types of offerings, and I do think there will be some companies that will want more control over something like that," Durgee said. "The reality is the structure that we're using, which was built on securities law from the 1930s, in a lot of instances allows us the leeway to give these types of offerings. People are going to really have to start to question how they're going to approach some of these innovations, and how far they will want to push that risk envelope."

Financial institutions are becoming increasingly interested in tokenizing traditional assets because of the often-touted benefits of blockchain technology: lower costs, faster settlement times, greater transparency about ownership and performance and programmable terms, as well as increased accessibility for retail investors and global reach.

The announcement comes about a week after Coinbase said it's pushing for SEC approval to offer trading of tokenized public stocks, which would give the crypto services provider an additional revenue stream and put it in closer competition with brokerages like Robinhood and eToro.

Competing crypto exchange Kraken recently said it'll offer tokens of U.S. stocks for 24/7 trading in unspecified markets abroad.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has said he sees the "tokenization of every financial asset" as an important step in "the technological revolution in the financial markets."

Dogecoin continued its upward trend over the past 24 hours, gaining 1.67% to close at $0.167 as bulls broke through a key resistance level.



The move comes amid ongoing macroeconomic tensions, including heightened trade disputes and geopolitical risk, which have injected volatility into broader crypto markets.



DOGE's performance stands out as it climbs steadily off its weekly lows, forming a strong support base and flashing early signs of accumulation.



News Background



Price Action

DOGE traded within a healthy 3.4% range from $0.162 to $0.168.



The most dramatic movement occurred in the final 60 minutes of the session, when price jumped briefly to $0.168 at 07:26 UTC before entering a short-term retracement.

That surge was supported by a 0.28% price gain on heavy volume exceeding 11.7 million units. However, subsequent candles showed profit-taking and the formation of a descending channel, as DOGE dropped back to $0.166 by 08:04 UTC. 



Notable selling spikes were seen at 07:51 and 08:03, where volume exceeded 4.9 million units.



Technical Analysis Recap

• DOGE posted a 1.67% gain over 24 hours, from $0.164 to $0.167

• Price broke above $0.166 resistance during the 16:00–17:00 window with above-average volume

• Key support established around $0.162–$0.163 with strong volume backing during 13:00 hour

• Highest price reached was $0.168; the session's range was $0.0055 (3.4%)

• Late-session volatility saw a brief 0.28% surge followed by a 0.73% retracement into a descending channel

• RSI remains neutral; momentum indicators suggest potential continuation if $0.165 support holds.

Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) remains one of the most misunderstood companies in the digital assets space, Wall Street broker Bernstein said in a research report Wednesday.

Bernstein raised its Coinbase price target to $510 from $310, and reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. The shares Wednesday morning were more than 4% higher at around $360 in early trading.

While broader sentiment leans bearish, Coinbase is cementing its role as crypto's "universal bank," and is bridging retail, institutional, and on-chain infrastructure at a scale unmatched by peers, the report said.

"Coinbase will be a beneficiary of the GENIUS Act and soon to follow CLARITY Act," analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

Bernstein said the exchange is the only crypto-native firm in the S&P 500 and continues to dominate U.S. trading despite competitive pressure.

Coinbase's stablecoin business, responsible for roughly 15% of total revenue, is scaling rapidly with integrations like Shopify, the report noted.

On the institutional side, Coinbase powers custody for eight of the eleven Bitcoin ETF issuers, the broker noted.

With its recent acquisition of Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange globally, and the explosive growth of its Ethereum Layer 2 network, Base, which is already hosting tokenization pilots like JPMorgan's JPMD coin, Coinbase is quietly assembling the core infrastructure of the next financial system, the report added.

 As tensions escalate around the globe, Byte-Sized Insight explores how crypto behaves in crisis, from Bitcoin's market resilience to blockchain's role in preserving journalism and dispersing aid. 

As geopolitical tensions rise in the Middle East and global markets brace for volatility, Byte-Sized Insight's latest episode explores how crypto reacts under pressure and whether it can provide more than just price movement.

In the first half of the episode, host Savannah Fortis speaks with Cointelegraph's Ray Salmond and Marcel Pechman, who offer expert commentary and break down how Bitcoin (BTC) has performed amid growing fears of US involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict.  

“There's a lot of uncertainty… and we see this reflected in the price action of gold, silver, US Treasurys and Bitcoin,” Salmond explains. 

Pechman warns that while Bitcoin has rallied 25% in recent weeks, it's still perceived as a risk asset and could fall again if panic spreads. Still, both analysts point to long-term investor conviction and global liquidity trends as reasons Bitcoin continues to attract demand.

The episode also highlights how decentralized technologies are being used in the real world, beyond tradeable cryptocurrencies, especially in places where central systems break down. 

Megan Klimen, founding officer of the Filecoin Foundation, discusses the organization's work with Fasila, a group helping local journalists in conflict zones preserve their reporting on decentralized storage.

“This is journalism that often gets destroyed when there are regime changes… There's not always a long-term record,” Klimen says. 

In the episode, we also hear from Vivek Raman, CEO of Etherealize, who explains how Ethereum and stablecoins are becoming essential infrastructure for financial access. 

In times of crisis, crypto's real test isn't only about how fast it moves markets, but about what it enables. Whether preserving truth or providing access, this episode reminds listeners that the utility of decentralized tech may be its most important feature.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Imagine a ship caught in a fierce storm, battered by large waves and swaying wildly yet staying afloat. It indicates that beneath the turmoil, resilience persists, suggesting that smooth sailing will follow once the storm passes.

Similarly, when an asset's price refuses to decline despite bearish signals from key indicators, it suggests underlying strength and a potential bull run ahead.

That's the current situation in the XRP market and mirrors conditions in the bitcoin market that foreshadowed BTC's historic run higher from $70,000 to $100,000 late last year. Let's have a look at both.

XRP is the payments-focused cryptocurrency used by the Fintech company Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions. The two, however, are not interchangeable.

The underlying strength in XRP is evident from the way prices have been behaving relative to the MACD histogram in recent weeks.

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is an exponential moving average (EMA)--based trend-following indicator widely tracked by both institutions and retail investors to identify price trends and measure trend momentum.

The MACD bars crossing from negative to positive indicate a bullish shift in momentum, suggesting the start of an uptrend in the asset's price. A crossover below zero suggests otherwise, with consecutive deeper bars indicating a strengthening of the downward momentum.

XRP's weekly chart MACD, used by traders to gauge long-term trends, crossed below zero in the first week of March, signaling a renewed downtrend.

However, a pronounced downtrend has not yet materialized, with prices mainly trading back and forth between $2 and $2.60, barring occasional short-lived dips below $2.

The divergence, marked by persistently bearish MACD and largely directionless trading, hints at bullish vibes or resilience beneath the surface – bulls successfully absorbing supply.

This prolonged divergence means the potential for a sudden bull revival and price increases. The bull case is supported by the upward-sloping 50-, 100- and 200-week simple moving averages (SMA).

The above-discussed divergence in XRP is similar to the conditions in BTC last year when the weekly MACD kept flashing red throughout the Summer. At the same time, BTC traded range-bound, barring occasional short-lived dips below $60,000.

CoinDesk noted the divergence in mid-September last year when BTC changed hands at around $59,000. Weeks later, BTC rose to $70,000, eventually topping the same in November to hit record highs above $100,000.

Let's see if XRP follows the same path.

06/25 update below. This post was originally published on June 24

Bitcoin and crypto have rebounded after a major escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict sent prices spiraling amid fears of a “doomsday” scenario.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has climbed back over $100,000 per bitcoin, helped by U.S. president Donald Trump's shock prediction of “massive” crypto investment.

06/25 update: The bitcoin price has suddenly surged back toward touching distance of its all-time high of around $112,000 per bitcoin, climbing to over $107,000 after dipping under $100,000 this past weekend. 

The rally has emboldened bitcoin price bulls who remained optimistic in the face of geopolitical unrest over the last two weeks.

“Bitcoin's status as a safe-haven asset is still taking shape, but recent signals suggest it's edging closer,” Gadi Chait, head of investment at Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments.

“Traditionally seen as volatile, bitcoin's response to recent macro shocks, like the events in the Middle East, has been notably restrained, neither tracking gold perfectly nor mirroring equity sell-offs. Its V‑shaped recovery back above $105,000 in under 48 hours after falling into the nineties, highlights its growing liquidity and integration into mainstream portfolios.”

Now, as the market digests a Congress game-changer expected to “unleash” trillions, bitcoin and crypto prices are braced for Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before lawmakers—coming after Trump suddenly flipped on firing him.

U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has committed to keep interest rates on hold, with some ... More predicting the bitcoin price and wider crypto market could soar once when it begins cutting.

“Aside from any geopolitical updates, today's key event will be Fed chair Jerome Powell's testimony in Washington,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments.

Trump posted to his Truth Social account over night that the Federal Reserve board should “activate," forcing Powell, who he's branded “too late,” to cut rates by "at least two to three points," and "save the U.S. more than $800 billion per year.”

“I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over,” Trump added.

The Fed kept interest rates on hold again last week after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that's been put on pause due to fears Trump's global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation.

“All eyes are on the Federal Reserve chair Jerome's testimony before Congress and Friday's PCE inflation print to determine how close the Fed may be to its long-awaited policy pivot,” Ray Youssef , the chief executive of NoOnes, said via email.

“The most bullish scenario would be confirmation of a Fed dovish policy pivot or a major de-escalation in global trade and geopolitical tensions, either of which could spark renewed interest in risk assets and push bitcoin towards retesting its all-time high.”

Expectations around an eventual Fed interest rate cut have been built up by crypto traders and influencers on social media.

“Buckle up,” one crypto trader posted to X alongside a hopeful prediction that “trillions” will flow in to crypto once the Fed eventually cuts rates—now priced at a 22% chance in July, up from just 10% last week, according to the CME FedWatch tracker.

The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last year, with some predicting the bitcoin price will climb ... More even higher once the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.

Two Fed officials, Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago president Austan Goolsbee, have this week joined Fed governor Christopher Waller admitting it may be time to lower interest rates.

“It is time to consider adjusting the policy rate,” Bowman told a gathering held in Prague, it was reported by Reuters, while Goolsbee reportedly said that Trump's trade tariffs have “not been what people feared."

Powell has pointed to the expected increase in inflation as a result of Trump's so-called Liberation Day of global trade tariffs as reason to take a “wait-and-see” approach to adjusting interest rates.

Last week, Waller has said he doesn't expect Trump's tariffs to drive inflation higher so policymakers should be looking to lower interest rates as early as July.

“If you're starting to worry about the downside risk [to the] labor market, move now, don't wait,” Waller told CNBC.

Adequate data protection measures are paramount. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images

25 Jun 2025, 9:55 am  

Recent enforcement action by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) serves as a stark warning to companies handling sensitive data, with firms urged to ensure appropriate data protection measures are in place, an expert has said. 

The ICO fined genetic testing company 23andMe £2.31 million (153 pages/3.2 MB) for failing to adequately protect the sensitive personal data of over 155,000 UK users. The penalty follows a joint investigation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioners of Canada amid growing international concern over the security of genetic biometric data. 

David McIlwaine, cyber security expert at Pinsent Masons, said: “The monetary penalty notice and fine levied by the ICO illustrates that 23andMe's IT security posture was insufficient at the time of attack. The investigation and subsequent fine should remind companies handling sensitive persona data, particularly in the health and biotech sectors, that failure to implement adequate cybersecurity measures will not be tolerated.”

The fine stems from a large-scale cyberattack that occurred between April and September 2023. Hackers exploited reused login credentials – previously stolen in unrelated data breaches – to gain unauthorised access to 23andMe accounts through a method known as credential stuffing. Once inside, attackers were able to access a trove of sensitive information, including names, birth years, locations, profile images, racial and ethnic backgrounds, family trees, and even health reports. 

Credential stuffing attacks are common, and involve attackers re-using passwords gleaned from other attacks, exploiting the common habit of individuals reusing the same login details across different accounts, including work accounts. The situation is often managed by requiring workers to have specific, strong passwords which are changed periodically, having in place multi-factor authentication – which requires a second verification source – and ensuring that usernames are not obvious. 

McIlwaine said: “23andMe failed to have these basic procedures in place, despite the special category of data that it was processing. This oversight left users' most intimate and immutable data exposed to exploitation.”

Consequently, the ICO found that the company was in breach of UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which requires data controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The ICO criticised the company's slow response and inadequate security systems, stating that “the warning signs were there”, but 23andMe failed to act, leaving users more vulnerable to exploitation and harm. Further, the ICO emphasised that the nature of the compromised data – genetic and familial information – made the breach particularly serious, as such data is not only deeply personal but also permanent.

McIlwaine said: “It is noteworthy that the fine has been levied against 23andMe, Inc, a US corporation. The company settled a $30m class action last year related to the incident and reported a deficit of $2.4 billion, stating that there was substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern, certain affiliates have filed for bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the ICO levied the fine of £2.31m after concluding that a monetary penalty remained appropriate in order to provide an effective, proportionate and dissuasive response to the infringements.”

“The ICO states that it did take into account the company's current and significantly deteriorated financial position. We therefore conclude that the fine should have been significantly higher. We wait to see what enforcement action the ICO may take in relation to the fine,” he said.

Truth Social operator, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp, has filed a Form 19b-4 to list the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF on NYSE Arca.

According to a June 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ETF, proposed under the ticker symbol B.T., would hold 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum.

The product is structured as a commodity-based trust, with Yorkville America Digital named as sponsor and Crypto.com's affiliated trust entity, Foris DAX Trust Company, acting as custodian for both crypto assets.

The ETF aims to provide a simplified, single-ticker exposure to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. If approved, it would trade on NYSE Arca and offer retail and institutional investors access to spot Bitcoin and Ethereum markets through traditional brokerage platforms.

The latest Form 19b-4 submission follows Trump Media's June 16 announcement that it had filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC.

While the S-1 covers disclosure and structural details required for a public offering, the 19b-4 is a separate procedural step seeking regulatory approval for the product to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange. Both forms are necessary before the ETF can launch.

The Form 19b-4 reiterates key elements first outlined in the S-1, including the fund's passive investment strategy and the use of CME CF benchmark reference rates to calculate net asset value. 

According to the filing, the fund's Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings will be custodied in cold storage by Foris DAX Trust Company, a Crypto.com affiliate. In addition to custody, Crypto.com will also serve as the execution agent and provide staking and liquidity services to support the fund's operations.

With the 19b-4 now submitted, the SEC will begin its formal review process. The Commission has up to 240 days to make a final decision, though an initial response is typically issued within 45 days.

With crypto ETFs seeing heavy demand in the U.S., Trump Media has now put forward its second offering. The earlier proposal, filed June 3 via NYSE Arca, seeks to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, a spot product focused solely on Bitcoin, using the same sponsor and custodian as the dual-asset fund.

As of now, it remains under SEC review, with the agency's final decision expected by Jan. 29, 2026, if all extensions are used.

A trader who continues to build a following with timely calls on Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins is issuing a warning on the broader crypto market.

Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen tells his 1 million followers on the social media platform X that he sees Bitcoin breaking support at $100,000.

“Will likely see BTC back at its bull market support band soon, back in the mid-$90,000 range.”

The bull market support band is formed by the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) and the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA).

The analyst says his prediction is based on Bitcoin's price action in the last two years, when Bitcoin started to roll over and gave up gains in the third quarter.

“I've mentioned for a while on Youtube that Bitcoin would likely start exhibiting some weakness around mid-June as the Q3 weakness starts to present itself.

The same thing happened the last couple of years.

I think the next low is around August/September.” 

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,092.

Looking at the altcoin market, Cowen warns that his expected Bitcoin correction will trigger a brutal capitulation event for alts.

“It may be finally time to rip the band-aid off for ALT / BTC pairs.

To the range lows!” 

A bearish altcoin versus Bitcoin chart indicates that alts are losing value faster than BTC.

The dendritic cell (DC)-initiated and sustained cancer immunity cycle is indispensable for effective endogenous and therapeutically mobilized antitumour T cell responses1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. This necessitates the continuous migration of antigen-carrying DCs from the tumour microenvironment (TME) to the tumour draining lymph nodes (tdLNs)7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Here, through longitudinal analysis of human and mouse tumours, we observed a progressive decrease in migratory conventional DCs (mig-cDCs) in the tdLNs during tumour progression. This decline compromised tumour-specific T cell priming and subsequent T cell supply to the TME. Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) and its substrate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as key modulators of DC migration. Advanced tumours disrupted cGMP synthesis in DCs to decrease their motility, while PDE5 perturbation preserved the cGMP pool to restore DC migration. Mechanistically, cGMP enhanced myosin-II activity through Rho-associated factors, extending the paradigm of cGMP-regulated amoeboid migration from Dictyostelium to mammalian immune cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 using sildenafil restored mig-cDC homing to late-stage tdLNs and sustained antitumour immunity in a DC-dependent manner. Our findings bridge fundamental DC interstitial motility to antitumour immunity, revealing that its disruption in chaotic TME promotes immune evasion, and its enhancement offers a promising direction for DC-centric immunotherapy.

Advances in computer-vision AI have led to more advanced facial-recognition tools that can be used to identify and track people. Credit: John Keeble/Getty

Imaging research in the popular field of computer vision almost always involves analysing humans and their environments, and most of the subsequent patents can be used in surveillance technologies, a study has found.

Computer-vision research involves developing algorithms to extract information from images and videos. It can be used to spot cancerous cells, classify animal species or in robot vision. But much of the time, the technologies are used to identify and track people, suggests the study published in Nature on 25 June1.

Computer scientists need to “wake up” and consider the moral implications of their work, says Yves Moreau, a computational biologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, who studies the ethics of human data.

Human-surveillance technologies have advanced in the past few years with the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and imaging capabilities. The technologies can recognize humans and their behaviour, for instance, through face or gait recognition and monitoring for certain actions.

Police forces and governments say that AI-powered surveillance allows them to better protect the public. But critics say that the systems are prone to error, disproportionately affect minority populations and can be used to suppress protest.

The analysis assessed 19,000 computer-vision papers published between 1990 and 2020 at the leading Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, as well as 23,000 patents that cited them. The researchers looked in depth at a random sample of 100 papers and 100 patents and found that 90% of the studies and 86% of the patents that cited those papers involved data relating to imaging humans and their spaces. Just 1% of the papers and 1% of the patents were designed to extract only non-human data.

And the trend has increased. In a wider analysis the researchers searched all the patents for a list of keywords linked to surveillance, such as ‘iris', ‘criminal' and ‘facial recognition'. They found that in the 2010s, 78% of computer-vision papers that led to patents produced ones related to surveillance, compared with 53% in the 1990s (see ‘Surveillance-enabling research'). Almost “the entire field is working on faces and gaits, on detecting people in images, and nobody seems to be saying, ‘wait what are we doing here?'” says Moreau.

Although many have assumed that there was a pipeline from computer-vision research to surveillance, that is “very different than having actual empirical evidence”, says Sandra Wachter, who studies technology and regulation at the University of Oxford, UK.

Mitotic onset is a critical transition for eukaryotic cell proliferation. The commonly held view of mitotic control is that the master regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), is first activated in the cytoplasm, at the centrosome, initiating mitosis1,2,3. Bistability in CDK activation ensures that the transition is irreversible, but how this unfolds in a spatially compartmentalized cell is unknown4,5,6,7,8. Here, using fission yeast, we show that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, and that the bistable responses differ markedly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a stronger response in the nucleus driving mitotic signal propagation from there to the cytoplasm. Abolishing cyclin–CDK localization to the centrosome led to activation occurring only in the nucleus, spatially uncoupling the nucleus and cytoplasm mitotically, suggesting that centrosomal cyclin–CDK acts as a ‘signal relayer'. We propose that the key mitotic regulatory system operates in the nucleus in proximity to DNA, which enables incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage to be effectively monitored to preserve genome integrity and to integrate ploidy within the CDK control network. This spatiotemporal regulatory framework establishes core principles for control of the onset of mitosis and highlights that the CDK control system operates within distinct regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm.

At mitotic onset, the cell undergoes many rapid changes across the cell, including modifications to the nuclear membrane, chromosome condensation, disassembly of cytoskeletal microtubules and formation of the mitotic spindle9. These changes are driven mainly by cyclin–CDK complexes10 through phosphorylation of hundreds of different substrates10,11,12. However, a full understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the CDK control network has been difficult to establish. This is in part owing to the existence of multiple different cyclin–CDK complexes and regulators in most eukaryotes, which have potential overlapping and redundant functions, making interpretation of experiments complex12,13,14,15. In addition, in vitro systems designed to investigate the dynamics of CDK activation that take account of cellular spatial compartmentation have been limited5,6,14. Finally, there is a lack of precise and simultaneous single-cell measurements of in vivo CDK activity and endogenous levels of CDK and its regulators16,17.

The Cdk1 kinase in complex with its regulatory subunit cyclin is the main driver triggering cellular changes at mitotic entry18. Its activity increases gradually during the cell cycle until late G2, when it increases more rapidly to bring about the onset of mitosis through a combination of cyclin accumulation and regulation of Cdk1 tyrosine residue phosphorylation (Y15 in most eukaryotes) near its ATP binding site4,5,6,19,20. The inhibitor Wee1 kinase family phosphorylates Y15 to inactivate Cdk1, while the activator Cdc25 family dephosphorylates this site21,22,23,24. Cdk1 also phosphorylates Wee1 and Cdc25, respectively inactivating and activating them25,26,27,28. Theoretical modelling and biochemical experiments of these positive (Cdk1 and Cdc25) and double-negative (Cdk1 and Wee1) feedback loops have shown they are able to abruptly increase Cdk1 activity at mitotic entry4,5,6. Furthermore, these feedback loops can lead to bistability and hysteresis, where for a given concentration of cyclin, CDK activity can either be high if the state of the system is mitotic or low if it is in interphase4,6,8. This ensures that the mitotic transition is irreversible and that the interphase and mitotic states are clearly distinguished, thus preventing cells from slipping back and forth between them4,5,6,29.

The eukaryotic cell contains multiple spatial compartments, the most prominent being the nucleus and cytoplasm. Such spatial complexity poses a challenge to understanding how a cell coordinates mitotic entry across the cell7,13,16,30,31. Previous studies have suggested that the initial mitotic CDK activation is triggered in the cytoplasm at the centrosome, the spindle pole body (SPB) in yeasts, which acts as a mitotic signalling hub that controls the timing of mitosis, from yeast to humans1,2,3,16,32. This view has been challenged by experiments using Xenopus egg extracts, which suggest that the nucleus might control the timing of mitosis33,34. Differential localization of mitotic regulators such as Wee1 (enriched in the nucleus)35 also raise the possibility of differences in the bistable responses between the nucleus and cytoplasm7.

Schizosaccharomcyes pombe (fission yeast) has been an excellent model system for understanding core principles in eukaryotic mitotic control36. This is partly owing to the relative simplicity of its cell cycle control architecture, with only one mitotic cyclin–CDK complex, the B-type cyclin Cdc13, complexed with the Cdk1 homologue Cdc237,38. Cell cycle control can be further simplified by engineering a Cdc13–wild-type Cdc2 (Cdc2(WT)) fusion, which can drive the entire cell cycle36. Here we use fission yeast to reveal the underlying spatiotemporal regulatory principles of how CDK orchestrates the onset of mitosis in vivo.

We explored whether there were differences in CDK substrate phosphorylation in different subcellular locations by reanalysing data from an earlier fission yeast phosphoproteomics experiment, to determine when CDK substrates are phosphorylated during the cell cycle11. We focused on sites that were phosphorylated in late G2 and mitosis using a localization annotation method39 to categorize phosphorylation sites on the basis of their cellular compartment11. Sites in the nucleus increased before the cytoplasm, cytoplasm periphery, the centrosome and SPB, and the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). There was no significant correlation between the sensitivity of the sites to CDK activity, as judged by half-maximal inhibition concentrations (IC50 values)11 and the timing of increases in phosphorylation at mitotic onset (Extended Data Fig. 1b). These results suggest that mitotic CDK activation occurs first in the nucleus before activation in other compartments, including the cytoplasm and SPB.

An unequal two-sample, left-tailed t-test was performed to test whether nuclear sites had an earlier rate change compared with sites in other compartments.

There was no variability with the estimated rate change points for cytoplasmic periphery and SPB sites.

Cells were imaged in Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) with 5-min time intervals.

Images were acquired every 10 min in YE4S medium at 36 °C.

To investigate this, new single-cell sensors were required to assay CDK activity in the nucleus and cytoplasm in unperturbed cells. To assay nuclear CDK activity, we developed the CDK sensor NucCDK, which resides in the nucleus but translocates to the cytoplasm upon phosphorylation by nuclear CDK (Fig. 1c,d and Methods). NucCDK sensor readout increased gradually throughout G2, switching to a rapid increase before stoppage of cell elongation, a feature of mitotic cells40 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d–f). We tested whether this switch occurred at mitotic onset using a temperature sensitive cdc25-22 mutant that blocks cells in late G2 (ref. 41) at 36 °C. Unlike wild-type cells, there was no rapid switch at 36 °C, confirming that the switch was associated with mitotic onset (Fig. 1e,f). Thus, this switch provides a readout of mitotic CDK activation.

SynCut3 is a CDK sensor that assays cytoplasmic CDK activity42. It is localized in the cytoplasm in interphase but translocates into the nucleus upon CDK phosphorylation42. We used this sensor (hereafter referred to as CytCDK) with NucCDK, and performed dual-colour imaging to determine the timing of CDK activation simultaneously in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2a,b).

Experiments were done in YE4S medium, with images taken every 5 min. h, PDF of time differences from nuclear activation to cytoplasmic activation using NucCDK–mScarletI and CytCDK V2–mNG. n = 123 cells; 1 of 3 biological repeats. i, Representative trace in the Cdc13–analogue-sensitive Cdc2AF (Cdc13–Cdc2AFAs) background from block and release from G2. DMSO was added after 11 time points of image acquisition as a control. A 3-min delay (shown with dashed lines) of when sensor readouts begin to decrease owing to normal cell cycle CDK inactivation. Mean Tdelay is shown below the graph, with s.d. in brackets. n = 30 cells; 1 of 2 biological repeats.

The readouts of NucCDK and CytCDK increased rapidly at the onset of mitosis, with the increase in NucCDK readout preceding that of CytCDK (Fig. 2c). We characterized the time delays between the lines as representing the rapid increase in sensor readouts at two points: near the beginning of the rapid increase of NucCDK and close to the peak (Methods). The time delays were about 12 min and 7 min near the beginning and near the peak, respectively, suggesting that nuclear CDK activation precedes cytoplasmic CDK activation (Extended Data Fig. 2a). To further investigate this delay, we systematically identified the initial point where the rate change occurs for each sensor readout, marking the change in CDK activity from a gradual to a rapid increase owing to mitotic CDK activation (Fig. 2c and Methods). We observed a time delay between nuclear and cytoplasmic activation of 5–10 min, similar to the previous estimate of approximately 12 min near the beginning of the increase in NucCDK readout (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2b). These experiments indicate that nuclear CDK activation occurs before cytoplasmic CDK activation, raising the possibility that the increase in nuclear CDK activity might bring about the subsequent increase in cytoplasmic CDK activity.

However, the time delay at mitotic onset between the NucCDK and CytCDK readouts could be due to a delay either in CDK phosphorylation of the sensors or to differences in sensor translocation kinetics. To distinguish these possibilities, we first acutely inhibited CDK activity after release from a G2 block during the rapid increase in CDK activity at mitotic onset, in a strain carrying an analogue-sensitive (As) version of the Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) fusion protein36 and both NucCDK and CytCDK (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 2c,d and Methods). Upon release from the G2 block, there was a delay of around 6 min in the increase of NucCDK and CytCDK, similar to our estimate of 5–10 min (Fig. 2e). However, when cells were blocked and released during mitosis, there was no detectable delay between the increases of NucCDK and CytCDK, suggesting that both sensors translocate rapidly after CDK phosphorylation, and that the approximately 6-min delay is due to differences in the timing of CDK activation between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2f). We also examined the response of the sensors after CDK inhibition. There was no delay between CDK inhibition and a change in NucCDK readout, but there was a delay of around 3 min in the change in CytCDK readout (Extended Data Fig. 2d). The decay half-lives for the sensors were both less than 5 min, indicating that the readouts of the sensors decay rapidly (Extended Data Fig. 2e).

We also characterized the in vivo sensitivities of NucCDK and CytCDK to CDK activity by determining the CDK inhibition dose–response curves for both sensors (Methods). This revealed that NucCDK is more sensitive to CDK activity than CytCDK (Extended Data Fig. 2f). To test whether this might affect our observation on the order of CDK activation, we developed a version of CytCDK that was more sensitive to CDK activity (CytCDK V2; Methods). CytCDK V2 had similar sensitivity to CDK activity as NucCDK (Extended Data Fig. 2g), so we repeated the dual sensor experiments. CytCDK V2 showed an earlier gradual increase in readout during G2, but the timing of the transition to a rapid increase representing CDK activation was the same as when using CytCDK (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2h), confirming our intepretation of the sequential order of nuclear and cytoplasmic CDK activation.

Overall, these experiments indicate that NucCDK readout increases before that of CytCDK at mitotic onset owing to differences in the timing of CDK activation between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We performed a further experiment to determine whether nuclear CDK activation occurs sequentially before cytoplasmic CDK activation by genetically bringing about a more gradual increase in CDK activity at mitotic onset, with the assumption that at mitotic onset a critical nuclear CDK activity threshold has to be reached to trigger the subsequent increase in cytoplasmic CDK activity17 (discussed further below). The more gradual increase in nuclear CDK activity would mean that it takes longer to reach this critical threshold, extending the delay in the increase of cytoplasmic CDK activity. We used a mutant strain carrying an analogue-sensitive version of the Cdc13–Cdc2(T14A/Y15F) fusion protein36 (Cdc13–Cdc2AF) that abolishes the CDK Y15 feedback loops thus making the increase in CDK activity more gradual. In the strain expressing the Cdc13–Cdc2AFAs fusion, the delay in the increase of NucCDK and CytCDK was extended to 13 min after release from G2 (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 2i,j). These results further support that there is a sequential order of nuclear and cytoplasmic CDK activation, and that nuclear CDK activity has a role in controlling the timing of the increase of mitotic cytoplasmic CDK activity.

The sensors are CDK substrates that are also phosphatase substrates, which may influence the timing of the switches in sensor readout43. Greatwall kinase links CDK activity to PP2A–B55 phosphatase activity, so that when CDK is activated at mitotic onset, PP2A–B55 is inactivated, resulting in a rapid increase in substrate phosphorylation43,44,45. Therefore, Greatwall might influence the delay between switches in sensor readout of NucCDK and CytCDK or CytCDK V2 through phosphatase regulation. However, deletion of ppk18, which encodes the main Greatwall kinase in fission yeast44, had no significant effect on the timing of the switches (Extended Data Fig. 2k).

We conclude from the sensor data and the phosphoproteomics analysis that there is a sequential temporal order in CDK activation at mitotic onset, with activation occurring first in the nucleus.

The translocation of cyclin B1 in human cells at the onset of mitosis is important for mitosis16,31, so we determined whether translocation of cyclin–CDK also occurs in fission yeast, coupling cytoplasmic activation to nuclear activation. We performed timelapse microscopy of Cdc13 levels using Cdc13 tagged with superfolder GFP (sfGFP) combined with a nuclear mask to segment the nucleus (Methods). We observed a decrease in nuclear intensity of Cdc13 just before SPB separation, with a corresponding increase in the cytoplasm, indicative of nuclear export at mitotic onset (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). This was followed by a decrease throughout the cell after spindle assembly due to Cdc13 degradation at mitotic exit (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). For subsequent experiments, we used the mean of the top 15% of pixels as an estimate of nuclear intensity, as nuclear area comprises approximately 15% of cell area46. This gave similar results to using a nuclear mask (Extended Data Fig. 3c), but avoided excessive light exposure. Timelapse imaging of Cdc2–mNeonGreen (mNG) indicated a similar nuclear export happening before spindle assembly, followed by further export after Cdc13 degradation (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 3d). We performed dual-colour imaging of Cdc13–sfGFP with NucCDK and CytCDK to identify when Cdc13 export occurs in relation to nuclear and cytoplasmic activation. We found that nuclear activation occurred about 5 min before export of Cdc13, whereas cytoplasmic activation occurred concurrently with export (Fig. 3c–e). A similar 5-min difference was observed for Cdc2–mNG with respect to nuclear activation, suggesting that Cdc13 and Cdc2 translocate as a complex (Extended Data Fig. 3e). When we calculated the nuclear and cytoplasmic mean Cdc13–sfGFP intensities at nuclear and cytoplasmic activation, we found the nucleus had a higher value, indicating differences in the cyclin threshold for CDK activation between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 3f). These differences are unlikely to be due to differences in sensor sensitivities, because the rate change point in sensor readout does not change with sensors that have different sensitivities (Fig. 2). This indicates that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, where there is a higher cyclin threshold, and this is followed by a fraction of the nuclear cyclin–CDK translocating to the cytoplasm, which overcomes the cyclin threshold in the cytoplasm to activate cytoplasmic CDK.

Bistability (multiple stable steady states of a system) and hysteresis (state of system dependent on its history) in Cdk1 activity has been shown in Xenopus egg extracts using steady-state measurements of Cdk1 activity on non-degradable cyclin6,8. However, to our knowledge, hysteresis in CDK activity has not been directly tested in vivo, and potential spatial differences have not been investigated in any system. Furthermore, hysteresis and positive feedback loops can be dispensable for stable oscillations in certain conditions5. Therefore, we determined the dynamic single-cell phase plots in the nucleus and cytoplasm in vivo, which represent the naturally occurring phase orbits in the dynamical system5, and investigated whether hysteresis would allow translocation of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) to the cytoplasm without collapse of the mitotic state in the nucleus. The phase plots enable us to visualize the different states of CDK activity for different concentrations of cyclin4,5,6.

The phase plots using data from Fig. 3c–f indicated a significant difference in the phase orbits between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Extended Data Fig. 3g). This was confirmed using the Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) fusion protein tagged with mNG, which confines analysis to a single cyclin–CDK complex36, together with NucCDK and CytCDK V2. The dynamics of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT)–mNG mimicked uncomplexed Cdc13 for both nuclear export and sensor readout profiles (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). The nuclear and cytoplasmic phase orbits were plotted on the same phase space, after normalization to minimum and maximum of sensor readouts (Fig. 4a). Notably, the nuclear phase orbit cycled around a much larger region of phase space than the cytoplasm. A high amount of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) accumulated in the nucleus before CDK activation to the high-activity mitotic state, with little increase in activity before that point. There was an approximately vertical line on the far right of the orbit at the point of CDK activation, consistent with an underlying bistable trigger. In the nucleus, once the system had reached the mitotic high CDK activity state, it was able to tolerate decreases in Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) without collapsing back to the low-activity state. By contrast, only a small amount of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) was needed in the cytoplasm for CDK activation, and a small decrease in Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) resulted in collapse out of the cytoplasmic mitotic state (Fig. 4a). Overall, the phase orbit in the cytoplasm was much narrower compared to the one in the nucleus. This suggests that CDK activity in the nucleus is much more stable with respect to cyclin–CDK fluctuations compared with CDK activity in the cytoplasm. The individual nuclear phase plots extended and shrunk significantly horizontally compared with the cytoplasm, also suggesting less sensitivity to cyclin–CDK concentrations (Fig. 4b).

Sensor readouts were normalized to minimum and maximum values for comparison. b, Ten representative traces for nucleus and cytoplasm. c, Phase plots for the nucleus in Cdc13–Cdc2(WT)–mNG background.

Normalized to minimum and maximum values. f, Representative phase plot for the cytoplasm in the Cdc13–Cdc2AF–mNG background. Normalized to minimum and maximum values. Green dots represent individual time points, with distances separated by a time interval of 5 min.

Single-cell phase plots of the nucleus after normalization to minimum and maximum of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT)–mNG mean intensities indicated a considerable gap between the low-activity and high-activity states, and after nuclear export the system was not prone to collapse back to the low-activity state (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, the orbits were very similar in different single cells, suggesting the CDK regulatory system oscillates with robustness to biological noise. By contrast, the normalized cytoplasm phase plots showed that the gaps between the high-activity and low-activity states for the same Cdc13–Cdc2(WT)–mNG intensity were less pronounced, and the cytoplasm was more sensitive to Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) accumulation (Fig. 4d).

We repeated the experiments using Cdc13–Cdc2AF–mNG36. This tested whether CDK Y15 feedback loops are responsible for the stability in oscillations and for the distinction of the low and high CDK activity states in the nucleus and cytoplasm5. Nuclear export appeared less switch-like, suggesting that it is influenced by the altered CDK activity regulation (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). The sensors displayed a linear increase in sensor readout (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h), and the phase diagrams of both the nucleus and cytoplasm exhibited almost a complete collapse of their orbits, with approximately linear profiles (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4i,j). Thus, the CDK Y15 feedback loops promote oscillations between different states in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the nucleus, when export occurs, the system is subsequently prone to collapse, indicating that in the Cdc13–Cdc2AF strain, translocation comes with the risk of the nucleus collapsing back to the interphase state (Fig. 4e). We conclude that the CDK Y15 feedback loops provide stable oscillations in the nucleus, facilitating translocation of cyclin–CDK from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and produce a weaker response in the cytoplasm. This is likely to reflect the underlying steady-state hysteretic responses that differ between the nucleus and cytoplasm5. Furthermore, our data suggest that at mitotic onset, the CDK Y15 feedback loops are major drivers in hysteresis and the increase in substrate phosphorylation, rather than phosphatase inactivation43.

Our results do not support the view that mitotic CDK activation is triggered first in the cytoplasm at the centrosome or SPB thereby dictating mitotic onset timing1,3,32. Therefore, we investigated the possible role of cyclin–CDK at the SPB at mitotic onset. In fission yeast, CDK activation at the SPB has been shown to act through a polo kinase (Plo1)-mediated feedback loop, dependent on Plo1 association with the SPB scaffold protein Cut12 (refs. 1,47,48,49,50) (Fig. 5a). The mutant cut12.s11 promotes earlier recruitment of Plo1 to the SPB and global Plo1 activation48,49, so we determined whether cut12.s11 advanced the timing of nuclear CDK activation (Fig. 5b). Cell length is a proxy for cell cycle position in fission yeast51. Length at nuclear CDK activation assayed using NucCDK (Fig. 5c, left) and cell length at cell division (Fig. 5c, right), were found to be the same in both cut12.s11 and wild-type cells. This indicates that promoting premature CDK activity at the SPB does not affect either nuclear CDK activation or the timing of cell division. This is in line with previous reports that promoting SPB feedback under a normal cell cycle context does not influence mitotic timing47.

The y axis of CytCDK sensor readout was scaled on the basis of minimum and maximum values for CytCDK in Cdc13 wild-type cells. h, Model of CDK activation. During interphase, cyclin B–CDK accumulates in the nucleus, and CDK activity increases gradually, with a high threshold for activation. In late G2, CDK activation occurs and is amplified by CDK-Y15-dependent feedback loops. Subsequently, cyclin B–CDK nuclear export (dependent on centrosomal cyclin B–CDK) and cyclin B degradation occur, and high CDK activity is maintained by CDK-Y15-dependent feedback loops. Thus, the nuclear CDK system undergoes stable oscillations with respect to cyclin B–CDK concentration. By contrast, in the cytoplasm, a lower threshold for activation enables cytoplasmic CDK to activate upon import of cyclin B–CDK from the nucleus. Degradation of cytoplasmic cyclin B results in an immediate drop in CDK activity. Therefore, the cytoplasmic CDK system oscillates in an unstable manner with respect to cyclin–CDK concentration.

We next investigated the role of cyclin–CDK localization at the SPB for mitotic control using the hydrophobic patch mutant of Cdc13 (Cdc13(HPM)), which does not localize to the SPB during G239 (Fig. 5d). This property is conserved with mammalian cyclin B1(HPM), which also does not localize to the centrosome39. Cells containing only Cdc13(HPM) do not display signs of mitotic entry, a phenotype partly rescued by tethering Cdc13(HPM) back to the SPB52. We performed timelapse microscopy of Cdc13(HPM)–sfGFP and wild-type Cdc13 (Cdc13(WT))–sfGFP using the CDK sensors (Methods) in a strain with other cyclins deleted. Cdc13(WT)–sfGFP displayed normal sensor readouts and Cdc13 dynamics (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). NucCDK in the Cdc13(HPM)–sfGFP mutant showed that activation in the nucleus still occurred, even though Cdc13(HPM)–sfGFP did not localize to the SPB (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). However, this nuclear CDK activation was not followed by a decrease in nuclear levels, indicating that export from the nucleus did not take place (Fig. 5f).

We repeated the timelapse experiments with Cdc13(HPM)–sfGFP and CytCDK and found that cytoplasmic CDK activation was also absent (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 5f). Therefore, although nuclear activation still occurs, cytoplasmic CDK activation is impaired, a probable consequence of Cdc13(HPM)–Cdc2(WT) not being exported from the nucleus.

We propose that Cdc13 localization to the SPB is not required for CDK activation in the nucleus, but is required for the translocation of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) to the cytoplasm and subsequent activation of cytoplasmic CDK. These results are consistent with previous phosphoproteomics data39, which showed phosphorylation of nuclear substrates with Cdc13(HPM) was similar to that with Cdc13(WT), whereas phosphorylation of SPB and cytoplasmic substrates was impaired. They also support the sequential ordering of nuclear activation and cytoplasmic activation, with Cdc13 SPB localization having an important role in bringing about this ordering of events.

Here we have revealed the underlying spatiotemporal regulatory framework in fission yeast that determines how CDK orchestrates the onset of mitosis in vivo (Fig. 5h), based on precise measurements of cyclin–CDK levels, the sensing of in vivo CDK activity and the generation of in vivo phase plots, to investigate the effects of cellular compartmentation in single unperturbed cells.

Our work has shown that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, thereby controlling the timing of mitotic onset. Promoting activity at the SPB had no effect on the timing of nuclear CDK activation or timing of cell division. However, in the absence of cyclin B–CDK localization to the SPB, CDK activation occurs only in the nucleus. This spatially uncouples the onset of mitosis, with the nucleus entering the mitotic state, whereas the cytoplasm remains in a G2-like state. We propose that this is owing to the absence of signal propagation brought about by nuclear export of cyclin B–CDK to the cytoplasm. This stresses the importance of signal propagation for spatially coherent mitotic onset, and supports the view that the SPB acts as a signalling hub, but as a signal-relaying hub rather than one that controls the timing of mitotic onset.

We also generated novel in vivo single-cell phase plots of CDK activity versus concentrations of cyclin B and of cyclin B–CDK complexes simultaneously in both nucleus and cytoplasm. These showed that the CDK oscillator operates in very different regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the nucleus, there is a strong bistable or hysteretic response, which can buffer against fluctuations in cyclin B–CDK concentrations in both interphase and mitosis, resulting in stable oscillations of CDK activity. By contrast, the response in the cytoplasm is much weaker. The strong bistable response and higher cyclin B threshold for CDK activation in the nucleus reduces susceptibility to ‘noise' and to the risk of slipping in and out of mitosis, helping to maintain genomic stability5,29. This regulation could be owing to the higher concentrations of CDK regulators in the nucleus such as Wee1 and Cdc25 (refs. 7,35,46). By contrast, the less well stabilized CDK circuit and lower cyclin B threshold in the cytoplasm allows cytoplasmic CDK to respond rapidly to the translocation of cyclin B–CDK from the nucleus. Therefore, the cytoplasm may exist in a more fluid state, where the distinction between interphase and mitosis is reduced. The translocation of cyclin B–CDK links the different oscillatory orbits between the nucleus and cytoplasm, leading to coherent mitotic entry, with the nucleus enforcing control over the cytoplasm7. Theoretical modelling of the metazoan mitotic network7 has proposed differences between the nucleus and cytoplasm in bistable responses and cyclin B thresholds similar to those that have been shown here experimentally. Bistability is a common characteristic of biological signalling networks and cell transitions6,53,54, and we have shown that the responses can be very different between cellular compartments.

Modelling of the mammalian mitotic network has suggested that nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) creates a potential ‘stress' at mitotic entry55, owing to dispersion of cyclin B1–Cdk1 and Greatwall kinase, resulting in mitotic collapse—a collapse that is prevented by Cdk1 -Y15 feedback loops, which retain high CDK activity55. The nuclear export of cyclin B–CDK observed here in fission yeast can potentially lead to a similar stress in the nucleus. This is also prevented by CDK Y15 feedback loops which help to retain high CDK activity, ensuring that nuclear mitotic events such as chromosome condensation and mitotic spindle formation continue. By contrast, the cytoplasm is ill-suited for propagating CDK activity because of its weaker bistable response. We propose that the strong bistable response in the nucleus allows propagation of CDK activity from the nucleus to the cytoplasm without collapse of nuclear CDK activity. Although the fission yeast cyclin B–CDK(T14A/Y15F) (CDKAF) is viable, it exhibits sluggish mitotic progression and aberrant timing of mitotic entry, and generates a higher frequency of inviable cells36,42.

The fission yeast CDK regulatory framework can be expected to be relevant to other eukaryotes. The Xenopus extract studies proposing that the nucleus is the ‘pacemaker' for the cell cycle33,34 suggest that our observations are not simply due to differences between a closed versus open mitosis. In human cells, the mechanism behind cyclin B1 nuclear translocation before NEBD is thought to be due to either Cdk1 phosphorylation of transport machinery or through a spatial positive feedback mechanism based on cyclin B1 autophosphorylation whereby the nucleus promotes the translocation of cyclin B116,31. This translocation is thought to be important for triggering NEBD17. In fission yeast, the translocation of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm could be functionally anagolous to translocation of cyclin B1–Cdk1 triggering NEBD. Therefore, although the precise mechanisms may lead to specific differences, the general concepts of the nucleus acting as the mitotic pacemaker and translocation being an important aspect for the onset of mitosis may be conserved16,33,34.

Why does the initial mitotic CDK activation and strong bistable or hysterisis response occur in the nucleus? A major vulnerability of the mitotic cell cycle is the risk of premature CDK activation and mitotic onset when DNA is incompletely replicated or has unrepaired damage56. Having the CDK regulatory system within the nucleus, positions the bistable circuit close to DNA, so incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage can be readily integrated with control of CDK activity57,58. Such a tight association between DNA and CDK activation would help to ensure genome integrity. It also enables genome content (ploidy) to be more easily monitored, which is necessary given that cell size at mitosis increases with ploidy42. Thus, DNA may serve as a platform for control of CDK activity and the initiation of mitotic entry42,57.

The principles we that have developed here will be a useful guide for future experiments in the more complex metazoan cells for investigating how CDK brings about cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the signalling network in the CDK oscillator system has been shown to have similar features to other biological oscillators, such as bistability and positive feedback loops59. Therefore, our work here should also be useful for understanding how other biological oscillators operate across space and time in vivo.

Sensors were expressed under the low expression constitutive calmodulin (cam1) promoter60. The sensors were tagged with either mNeonGreen or mScarletI61,62. NucCDK was derived from a minimal budding yeast CDK-dependent transport module, which was shown to be exported out of the nucleus after phosphorylation by Cdc28 (budding yeast Cdk1)63 (Fig. 1c). This sensor functions similarly to a CDK2 translocation-based sensor, based on a fragment of human DNA helicase B fragment (DHB), which translocates to the cytoplasm upon CDK2 phosphorylation64. The MCM2-3 sensor module displayed a readout patten that increased at S phase, similar to that of early CDK substrates, consistent with observations in budding yeast11,63 (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Although this version of the sensor is useful for the G1/S transition given its high sensitivity to CDK activity65, we aimed to reduce its sensitivity so that it can be used to read out activity at G2/M. The module contains a full CDK consensus site beginning with a serine, next to the Mcm3 NLS. Mutation of this residue to alanine (MCM2-3 Ala) reduced the readout of the sensor and rendered it prominently nuclear, albeit with a modest increase after stoppage of cell elongation (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Therefore, we hypothesized that mutating this serine to a threonine could alter the sensitivity of the sensor as it has been shown that CDK has a greater specificity towards serine residues than threonine residues, and, furthermore, that threonines are preferentially dephosphorylated by PP2A66,67. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e, this mutation markedly altered the profile of the sensor, and gave a readout of CDK activity throughout the cell cycle. We refer to this sensor as NucCDK. The profile was very similar to a recent CDK Forster resonance energy transfer sensor tagged with a NLS, developed in fission yeast, indicating that NucCDK is biased towards sensing nuclear CDK activity68. We did not notice a significant difference in the pattern when using a nuclear mask for determining the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio in mean intensities, as opposed to using the mean of top 15% of pixels and bottom 85% of pixels as estimates for nuclear and cytoplasmic mean intensities, respectively, as has been previously used in fission yeast46 (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Unless stated that a nuclear mask was used, the top 15% and bottom 85% method was used for sensor readout measurements.

Syncut3 (CytCDK) translocation into the nucleus is dependent on phosphorylation of T19 by CDK42. CytCDK V2 was developed in a similar manner to NucCDK except T19 was mutated to a serine, for increased sensitivity to CDK activity.

The timecourse analysed for Fig. 1a was from the Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) fusion experiment in which Cig1, Cig2 and Puc1 had been deleted (∆CCP), and cells grown in EMM4S + SILAC (stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture) medium at 32 °C (ref. 11). Localization annotation for CDK sites was implemented as previously described39. In brief, the order of determining the localization of a protein by priority based on existing literature was as follows: (1) direct visualization of fluorescently tagged proteins labelled at the endogenous locus; (2) fluorescently tagged proteins from exogenous nmt41 or nmt81 promoters; (3) indirect methods suchs as chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, fractionated western blotting and immunoprecipation experiments. Only sites annotated as being late sites as well as belonging to solely one spatial compartment were used for analysis.

Strains were grown, and cell cultures and media were prepared as described69. Strains were constructed either by transformation or genetic crossing, as described69. All experiments were done in exponentially growing cells at 2.5–4.0 × 106 cells per ml. Insertions were checked with colony PCR and sequencing in the case of deletions. All strains and plasmids used are listed in Supplementary Table 1. EMM powder (MP Biomedicals) with ammonium chloride and dextrose was used, supplemented with adenine at final concentrations of 0.15 g l−1 where required. Where yeast extract with adenine, leucine, histidine and uridine (YE4S) was used, supplements were added at 0.15 g l−1 final concentrations. The Cdc13 strain internally tagged with sfGFP is described in ref. 70.

Except for some data in Figs. 2 and 4, microscopy was done on 1% agarose pads, using GeneFrames, to prevent drying of pad during acquisition71 (125 μl, Thermofisher AB-0578). N-propyl gallate (Sigma, 02370) was added to the agarose pads at 0.1 mM final concentration to prevent photobleaching72.

A 1-ml culture of cells was spun down once at 2,000 rpm (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5424) for 30 s, to minimize stress. Approximately 50 μl of supernatant was left and mixed. Two microlitres of cell culture was spread across an agarose pad and left to dry for a few minutes. A coverslip (Epredia, 22 × 32 mm, no. 1.5) was placed onto the pad, but only pressure along the gene frame was applied to seal up the frame. Nail polish was added along the frame to ensure that the coverslip and frame were sealed.

Imaging was done on a Nikon Ti2 inverted microscope equipped with a perfect focus system (PFS), an Okolab environmental chamber, and a Prime BSI sCMOS camera (Photometrics). A Nikon 100x Plan Apo oil immersion lens with a NA of 1.45 was used for imaging. Image acquisition was controlled using µManager V2.0 software73. 2 × 2 pixel binning was done to improve fluorescence signal detection with a resulting pixel size of 130 nm × 130 nm. Unless stated otherwise, imaging was done at 25°. Except for data shown in Extended Data Fig. 2a, where 5 z-slices were collected, 7 slices were collected with 0.5-μm step sizes. Fluorescence excitation was done using a SpectraX LED light engine (Lumencor). Imaging for mNG-tagged proteins was done with the YFP channel (both in excitation and emission) to minimize the influence of cell autofluorescence74. We did not notice any issues with growth or cell length at division under the imaging conditions used.

Cells contained a copy of Cdc13WT or Cdc13HPM expressed under the native Cdc13 promoter and a second copy of Cdc13WT, expressed under the thiamine-repressible nmt41 promoter39. Cells were initially grown in EMM without thiamine but for experiments, cells were washed once in EMM + thiamine and placed on a 1% EMM + thiamine agarose pad. Thiamine was added to EMM at a final concentration of 30 μM. Only cells that were born around the beginning of acquisition and blocked at the end of acquisition were considered for analysis. The total acquisition was 80 time points with time intervals of 10 min, for around 13 h in total in acquisition.

Unless otherwise stated, all analysis was done using custom scripts written in Matlab R2022a.

For processing and analysis of fluorescence z-stacks, maximum intensity projections were used using Fiji75. Cells were segmented using a custom algorithm as described52. Nuclear masks were obtained with Fiji, using MCM2-3 Ala to identify the nucleus. Cells were tracked using LineageMapper76. With the exception of cases where mutants that block cells in G2 were used, only cells that were born and that divided within the timelapse acquisition period were used for analysis.

For histograms, the left edges of bins are inclusive, while the right edges are not inclusive except for the last bin. Bin widths were set to the time interval used for image acquisition, with the exception of Fig. 3e. Violin plots display distributions as kernel density estimates. The median value is plotted as a white circle. The black rectangle represents the IQR, and the black solid line represents 1.5× IQR.

For Extended Data Fig. 2a, the time delay between the lines in the rapid rise of the NucCDK and CytCDK readouts were measured at the point of nuclear CDK activation, indicated by a change in the rate of increase of the sensor readout, and around 75% of the activation peak.

For all other figures, points representing CDK activation were identified using an automated rate change analysis algorithm. Sensor traces were lightly smoothed using the Matlab function, smoothdata and the algorithm sgolay to assist in identifying change points. However, plots in figures represent the raw data. To confine analysis to the period in G2 where the rate change in sensor readout occurs, the trace was cropped to 10–15 time points before the maximum peak in sensor readout, up to the maximum peak. The abrupt changes in sensor readout were identified using a change point algorithm77,78 in Matlab called findchangepts, where abrupt changes in the slope were identified using the specifier ‘linear'. A similar process was followed to identify points of stoppage of cell elongation.

For the phosphoproteomics analysis to determine statistical significance of nuclear substrate phosphorylation compared to the other compartments, the rate change analysis was similarly performed on individual sites.

We used an analogue-sensitive sensitive version of Cdc2, Cdc2as, that renders it susceptible to inhibition by the ATP analogue 1-NmPP179, to determine how quickly the sensors respond to changes in CDK activity. Experiments were performed on soybean lectin-coated MatTec dishes in YE4S medium at 32 °C, with 3-min intervals42. Cells were blocked in G2 for 3 h using 1 μM 1-NmPP1 and released following 3× washes using YE4S medium. Subsequently, either 10 μM 1-NmPP1 was added to the dish to inhibit CDK activity or DMSO (control) was added. The mean decay curves were fitted using either a two-exponential model (NucCDK) or a one-exponential model (CytCDK) to determine the half-lives of decay.

Dose–response curves of NucCDK and CytCDK/CytCDK V2 to CDK inhibition were done similarly as described11,42. We used the Cdc13–Cdc2AFAs strain to remove potential non-linear responses in phosphorylation of the sensors due to CDKY 15 feedback loop activation. Cells were blocked at 32 °C in YE4S for 1.5 generations. They were washed (3×) and released into release medium containing varying concentrations of 1-NmPP1. Image acquisition was done after 12 min from the first wash on microscope slides.

The mNG tag was used at the C terminus of the Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) fusion, as it has better photophysical properties compared with sfGFP and allowed use of the YFP channel, which is less affected by cellular autofluorescence61,74. Experiments for Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 4 were done using the CellASIC ONIX V1 microfluidics platform with Y04C microfluidics plates (Merck) at 32 °C in YE4S, as they are the optimal conditions used for Cdc13–Cdc2AF80. All 4 experimental conditions—Cdc13–Cdc2(WT)–mNG + (NucCDK–mScarletI or CytCDK V2–mScarletI) and Cdc13–Cdc2AF–mNG + (NucCDK–mScarletI or CytCDK V2–mScarletI)—were done on the same plate using a flow rate of 2.5 pound per square inch (psi). Fifty microlitres of culture at an optical density of 0.2–0.3 was added to plate. Images were acquired every 5 min.

Phase plots shown in figures were plotted after lightly smoothing the raw data using the matlab function smoothdata with the algorithm sgolay to reduce noise and improve the quality of the phase plots.

Named “Gwada negative,” it originated from a blood sample taken 15 years ago.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Most people are familiar with the four broad human blood types—A, B, AB, and O—and it's likely they may even know that they come in positive or negative varieties (an indicator of what's called an Rh factor) as well. However, that's really only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the complexity of human blood types. In fact, humans theoretically contain millions of different blood types, as there are more than 600 antigens that have been identified on human blood cells. Any combination of those antigens could be considered a new blood type. 

However, the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) only recognizes 47 distinct blood type groups, with the latest being added just last year after a 50-year-long mystery. Now, according to a press statement published on LinkedIn by the French Blood Establishment (EFS), a 48th member has officially joined the party. Some 15 years ago, researchers received blood from a French woman originating from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, colloquially referred to as “Gwada.” The patient drew blood while undergoing routine tests before surgery.

An unusual antibody associated with this blood was discovered in 2011, but it wasn't until 2019 that DNA sequencing found that a genetic mutation was responsible for the unique blood type, which was officially recognized by the ISBT this month. The researchers named the group “Gwada negative,” after the patient's homeland, and confirmed that the woman inherited the blood type from her parents, who each contained the mutated gene.

“[This] is undoubtedly the only known case in the world,” Thierry Peyrard, a medical biologist at EFS, told Agence France-Presse (AFP). “She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself.”

Its immensely important to know the antigen make-up of your blood before undergoing blood transfusions, as mismatch can trigger a life-threatening immune response. Essentially, your body thinks the antigens attached to the foreign blood cells are invaders. Although there are potentially millions of blood types, transfusions made with blood that matches your type according to the well-established ABO-Rh type system have a 99.8 percent chance of success. This is because your body's immune response doesn't attack all antigens equally, so even if there are some differences, the transfusion will likely be a success. 

However, it's still important to identify these ultra-rare blood types so that life-threatening immune responses can be avoided. “Discovering new blood groups means offering patients with rare blood a better level of care,” the EFS team said in a press statement.

Although the current number of blood groups sits at 48, that likely won't be the last count. Advancements in gene sequencing have supercharged the discovery of these blood groups. For example, the 44th member of this group, known simply as “Er,” was discovered in 2022, meaning that scientists are currently discovering more than one new blood group a year. 

2025 might hold one or two more blood-based surprises of its own.

Trump Administration Ousts National Science Foundation from Headquarters Building

Employees at the National Science Foundation say they've been blindsided by a plan for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to take over their offices

By Robin Bravender & E&E News 

The headquarters of the U.S. National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia.

CLIMATEWIRE | The Department of Housing and Urban Development is expected to announce Wednesday that it's moving into the headquarters of the National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, according to the union representing NSF employees.

But as of Tuesday evening, staff at the science foundation hadn't been informed by management about their building's incoming occupants, leaving them feeling blindsided and unsure about where they're expected to work.

One NSF employee said that they had “literally zero idea” the move was coming until reports began circulating among staffers Tuesday evening. That person was granted anonymity because they fear retaliation.

Jesus Soriano, president of the union that represents NSF employees, said he was expecting a press conference Wednesday morning in the NSF lobby including HUD Secretary Scott Turner and Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Soriano said he was informed about the plans by NSF employees.

Soriano sent an alert to union members Tuesday evening informing them that NSF's management “learned this afternoon [from HUD]” that the Wednesday news conference would include an announcement that “HUD will take over the NSF building” and that the science agency was not involved in the decision.

The union, Soriano wrote, “understands that there is no planning except that the HUD secretary may take over the 18th and 19th floors” and start planning the HUD move over the next two years. “There is no planning for NSF, no identified future location, appropriation for a new building or a move,” he wrote.

HUD and the General Services Administration announced in April that HUD wanted to move out of its current location in the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building near L'Enfant Plaza in Washington. That building, which opened in 1968, faces over $500 million in deferred maintenance and modernization needs, GSA said. The building would be at half of its capacity with every HUD staffer at headquarters, according to GSA.

An NSF spokesperson directed a request for comment to GSA. GSA, the White House and a Youngkin spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It's unclear what happens to the staff at NSF, where more than 1,833 employees work in the building, according to the employee union. The science agency moved into the Alexandria office from Virginia's Ballston area in 2017.

“Is the government more interested in the technological and scientific leadership of this country or on using taxpayer dollars to offer luxury accommodations to government officials?” Soriano said.

The union said in a press release Tuesday that it was told that plans for NSF headquarters include a dedicated executive suite for the HUD secretary on the 19th floor, the construction of an executive dining room, reserved parking spaces for the secretary's cars, exclusive use of an elevator for the secretary and a space dedicated to hosting the secretary's executive assistants on the 18th floor.

For over a century, scientists have puzzled over a fundamental mystery in our evolutionary history: how did mammals go from sprawling like lizards to striding like cats and dogs? This transition -- from a sprawled stance (like a lizard) to an upright (parasagittal) posture -- marked a pivotal moment in mammal evolution. While the earliest non-mammalian synapsids, the ancestors of living mammals, had a sprawling posture, researchers debated when and how the upright postures of modern mammals evolved.

Now, a groundbreaking study in PLOS Biology led by Dr. Robert Brocklehurst, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB) at Harvard University, offers a surprising answer: the path to upright posture wasn't linear, but full of unexpected detours, evolutionary experimentation, and dramatic anatomical upheaval.

"The evolution of mammals has previously been characterized as a series of steps from sprawling, to semi-sprawling, to upright," said Brocklehurst. "However, what we discovered was a more nonlinear evolutionary progression throughout mammalian history."

All mammals -- from bats and whales to moles and humans -- share a distinctive way of moving: they hold their limbs underneath their bodies, unlike the sprawling posture with limbs out to the side. This posture enables more efficient movement and is tied to mammals' ability to adapt to diverse lifestyles, from digging to flying. This dramatic transition was also accompanied by big changes in limb bone shape and mechanics. To assess these changes, the team analyzed the humerus (upper arm bone) of over 60 non-mammalian synapsid fossils and 140 living animals, including mammals, reptiles and amphibians.

Using a novel analytical technique, pioneered in senior author Professor Stephanie Pierce's lab (also in OEB), researchers mapped each bone's surface to measure traits like length, mass distribution, muscle leverage, and torsion (the degree to which the bone twists along its length). These traits correlate with specific modes of locomotion and allowed the researchers to reconstruct posture and locomotion in the fossils.

"By correlating bone shape and limb biomechanics with posture, we could test how well the fossil bones were optimized for specific functional tasks, like upright walking versus sprawled walking," Brocklehurst said. The researchers achieved this by mapping the fossil non-mammalian synapsids onto a functional adaptive landscape, similar to a topographic map, with peaks and valleys that relate to high and low performance of different locomotor postures.

"We expected to see a neat progression -- from sprawling pelycosaurs to a bit more upright therapsids, then cynodonts, then fully upright mammals," said Brocklehurst. "Instead, we found bursts of innovation."

The findings suggest that mammal evolution involved a series of adaptive radiations, with each major ancestral groups exploring a range of forelimb functions and postures -- some of which were closer to modern mammals, others not.

"The path to upright posture wasn't a straight line," says Pierce, "the ancestors of mammals weren't steps on a ladder with modern mammals at the top. Mammals have been evolving and radiating into many different niches and habitats throughout their history, and their postures reflect that variation."

One fossil, a close relative of today's marsupials and placentals, showed bone features consistent with a modern upright gait, suggesting that fully parasagittal postures evolved relatively late in mammalian history as opposed to previously held hypotheses. This result supports recent work from the same lab on the backbone and hindlimb.

"Our work challenges the idea that posture changed gradually and early on," said Pierce, "instead, it shows that upright posture and locomotion were a late evolutionary innovation, not an early defining trait of the mammalian lineage."

The researchers also challenge the long-held idea that the earliest non-mammalian synapsids sprawled in a similar way to living lizards or crocodiles. "Our study showed that most synapsid limbs functioned differently than those of modern reptiles. They're not just copies of reptiles, but distinctive animals in their own right that are a little different from anything that's alive today," says co-author Kenneth Angielczyk of Chicago's Field Museum.

To compare such a wide range of bones -- spanning hundreds of species, including those hundreds of millions of years apart in age and wildly different in shape -- the team had to overcome major technical hurdles. Traditional methods that describe shape in similar structures didn't work. So, the team re-engineered an existing R software package designed for a different task, transforming it into a novel "slice-based" landmarking tool tailored for this study. Co-author Magdalen Mercado, former undergraduate student in the Integrative Biology program at Harvard, helped gather the extensive dataset as part of her senior thesis and research in the Pierce lab.

The study builds on a rich scientific legacy -- both at Harvard and in paleontology. Pierce, who is also Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology in the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), noted that, "Researchers and former MCZ curators, like Alfred Sherwood Romer and Farish Jenkins, Jr., were grappling with these same questions a century ago. Now, with new tools and data, we can revisit those ideas and see the story more clearly."

This study marks the first large-scale evolutionary analysis of mammalian posture using quantitative biomechanics. But that's just the beginning. The team is now building detailed models of forelimbs in select fossil species to understand how joints and muscles functioned in ancient animals, offering even deeper insights into the evolution of mammalian motion.

As Brocklehurst put it: "Understanding how mammals came to walk upright isn't just about bones, it's about uncovering the dynamic history of life on Earth."

This previously unknown symbiotic relationship helps keep methane—a major greenhouse gas—trapped in the ocean.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When you live in the ocean's aphotic zone, where absolute darkness reigns, you need some creative solutions to some pretty existential questions. Chief among them: what are you going to eat? 

For a variety of ocean floor-dwelling species, including mussels, worms, and sponges, that answer lies with chemosynthetic bacteria—organisms that flourish around methane seeps where the gas escapes the Earth's crust. A new study shows that three species of the sea spider genus  Sericosura also demonstrate a similar ability, which helps explain why these spindly-legged organisms are found in such abundance near methane seeps. The results of the study were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). 

Despite the name, sea spiders aren't actually spiders (though, that'll likely be of little comfort to an arachnophobe). Although they look remarkably similar, sea spiders have a thinner cephalothorax than their eight-legged land-based lookalikes, and their legs tend to have more joints. Oh, and they also live in the deep ocean—one of biology's true final frontiers of scientific inquiry. This hard-to-reach ecosystem is why many aspects of their lives remain a mystery.

“Our study aimed to examine the ways in which often overlooked animals might take advantage of novel energy sources, such as methane,” Shana Goffredi, the senior author of the study from the Occidental College of Los Angeles, said in a press statement. “While the deep sea feels far away, all organisms are interconnected, and the processes in one ecosystem affect another.”

In 2023, Goffredi—along with two students, including Bianca Dal Bó—embarked on a two-week research expedition on the R/V Atlantis to study these creatures in their deep-sea habitats. With the help of a piloted submersible named Alvin, they examined and collected sea spider specimens located 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) below the ocean surface from the Del Mar and Palos Verdes seeps in California and the Sanak seep in Alaska. Of the 36 specimens recovered, three of the spiders represented entirely new species. 

“I had seen animal samples in preservatives in the lab for so long, so it was beautiful to finally see them moving around in their natural habitat,” Dal Bó said in a press statement. “It made me feel all the more connected to my project and these fascinating ecosystems.”

While performing experiments on board, Goffredi and Dal Bó incubated the sea spiders in seawater with methanol and a heavy isotope of methane. Because this isotope is rare in nature, the researchers could track its impact on the sea spiders, including if it was ingested. They found that methylotrophic bacteria located on the sea spiders' exoskeletons served as a source of a food. 

“Evidence from tissue isotopic analysis, microbiome sequencing, and live-animal incubations followed by 13C-methane isotope probing confirms active incorporation of methane-derived carbon into spider tissues,” the authors wrote. “This research highlights a previously unknown interaction between an animal lineage and chemically fueled microbes, introducing another symbiotic pathway for direct microbial transfer of methane carbon into animal biomass in the deep sea.”

This transfer of methane carbon into animal biomass is particularly important for scientists to understand, as methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases. Sea spiders—with the help of other deep ocean-dwelling animals—are doing their part to keep these gases locked away in the ocean, so they don't reach the atmosphere and exacerbate the ongoing climate crisis. 

“While the deep sea feels really far away, all organisms are interconnected,” Goffredi told CNN. “Even though they're small, these animals have a big impact in that environment. We can't ever hope to sustainably (use) the oceans if we don't really understand the oceans.”

The skin acts as the body's first line of defense against external threats. However, as we age, the epidermis -- the outermost layer of skin -- gradually becomes thinner and loses its protective strength. About 90% of the cells in this layer are keratinocytes, which originate from deeper layers of the epidermis and migrate upward, ultimately forming the skin's protective barrier. To combat aging's impact on skin, numerous studies have emphasized the benefits of vitamin C (VC), a vitamin well known for its role in skin health and antioxidant properties.

Now, researchers in Japan have discovered that VC helps thicken the skin by directly activating genes that control skin cell growth and development. Their findings, published online in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology on April 20, 2025, suggest that VC may restore skin function by reactivating genes essential for epidermal renewal.

This study was led by Dr. Akihito Ishigami, Vice President of the Division of Biology and Medical Sciences at Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology (TMIG), Japan, in collaboration with Hokuriku University, and ROHTO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Associate Professor Ayami Sato from TMIG (currently at the Toyo University); Associate Professor Yasunori Sato, Professor Toshiyuki Kimura, and Mr. Hideki Tanaka (currently at the University of Fukui Hospital) from Hokuriku University; and Ms. Florence, Ms. Akari Kuwano, Mr. Yasunari Sato, and Mr. Tsuyoshi Ishii from ROHTO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd also co-authored the study.

"VC seems to influence the structure and function of epidermis, especially by controlling the growth of epidermal cells. In this study, we investigated whether it promotes cell proliferation and differentiation via epigenetic changes," explains Dr. Ishigami, while talking about this study.

To investigate how VC affects skin regeneration, the team used human epidermal equivalents, which are laboratory-grown models that closely mimic real human skin. In this model, skin cells are exposed to air on the surface while being nourished from underneath by a liquid nutrient medium, replicating the way human skin receives nutrients from underlying blood vessels while remaining exposed to the external environment.

The researchers used this model and applied VC at 1.0 and 0.1 mM -- concentrations comparable to those typically transported from the bloodstream into the epidermis. On assessing its effect, they found that VC-treated skin showed a thicker epidermal cell layer without significantly affecting the stratum corneum (the outer layer composed of dead cells) on day seven. By day 14, the inner layer was even thicker, and the outer layer was found to be thinner, suggesting that VC promotes the formation and division of keratinocytes. Samples treated with VC showed increased cell proliferation, demonstrated by a higher number of Ki-67-positive cells -- a protein marker present in the nucleus of actively dividing cells.

Importantly, the study revealed that VC helps skin cells grow by reactivating genes associated with cell proliferation. It does so by promoting the removal of methyl groups from DNA, in a process known as DNA demethylation. When DNA is methylated, methyl groups attach to cytosine bases, which can prevent the DNA from being transcribed or read, thereby suppressing gene activity. Conversely, by promoting DNA demethylation, VC promotes gene expression and helps cells to grow, multiply, and differentiate.

The study suggests that VC supports active DNA demethylation by sustaining the function of TET enzymes (ten-eleven translocation enzymes), which regulate gene activity. These enzymes convert 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), a process in which Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+. VC helps maintain TET enzyme activity by donating electrons to regenerate Fe2+ from Fe3+, enabling continued DNA demethylation.

The researchers further identified over 10,138 hypomethylated differentially methylated regions in VC-treated skin and observed a 1.6- to 75.2-fold increase in the expression of 12 key proliferation-related genes. When a TET enzyme inhibitor was applied, these effects were reversed, confirming that VC functions through TET-mediated DNA demethylation.

These findings reveal how VC promotes skin renewal by triggering genetic pathways involved in growth and repair. This suggests that VC may be particularly helpful for older adults or those with damaged or thinning skin, boosting the skin's natural capacity to regenerate and strengthen itself.

"We found that VC helps thicken the skin by encouraging keratinocyte proliferation through DNA demethylation, making it a promising treatment for thinning skin, especially in older adults," concludes Dr. Ishigami.

This study was supported by grants from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI: grant number 19K05902.

A Sodom and Gomorrah Story Shows Scientific Facts Aren't Settled by Public Opinion

Claims that an asteroid or comet airburst destroyed the biblical Sodom captured the public's imagination. Its retraction shows that scientific conclusions aren't decided by majority rule in the public square

By Mark Boslough 

The Destruction Of Sodom And Gomorrah, painting by John Martin, 1852.

In 2021 a multidisciplinary team of researchers claimed that a Tunguska-sized airburst, larger than any such airburst in human history, destroyed a Bronze Age city near the Dead Sea. The story went viral. This alleged destruction of Tall el-Hammam around 1650 BCE, with reports of melted pottery and mudbricks, pointed to the Bible, the team concluded in Scientific Reports, noting “what could be construed as the destruction of a city by an airburst/impact event.”

News outlets from Smithsonian to the Times in Britain covered the report. It had all the ingredients—with authors touting its connection to the biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah—to make it pure clickbait gold. On the day it was published, one of the co-authors posted links on his blog to their three press releases. A week later he asserted that it was “the most read scientific paper on Earth” based on 250,000 article accesses.

Science, however, is not a popularity contest, and the “cosmic outburst” story indeed holds a different lesson than the one first supposed, about how the public should hear incredible claims. In April, just before the study passed the 666,000 mark, Scientific Reports retracted the finding, writing that “claims that an airburst event destroyed the Middle Bronze Age city of Tall el-Hammam appear to not be sufficiently supported by the data in the Article,” and that “the Editors no longer have confidence that the conclusions presented are reliable.” Independent scientists (I was one of them) had alerted them to faulty methodology, errors of fact and inappropriate manipulation of digital image data. One study co-author responded to the retraction in an online post with claims that the editor had caved to harassment by skeptics, concluding that the “court of public opinion is much more powerful than a shadowy hatchetman spamming a corrupt editor's inbox.”

Public opinion does influence policy decisions and funding priorities in science. People are interested in new medical cures and new starry discoveries, which helps explain why we have a NASA and an NIH. That's why it is important for the public to be scientifically literate and well informed. But scientific facts are determined by the scientific method, logic and evidence, all presented in peer-reviewed publications that require reproducible results. Scientists don't vote on findings, but they do achieve consensus by convergence on understandings based on multiple studies across many fields.

The Sodom airburst paper instead represented the nadir of “science by press release,” in which sensational but thinly supported claims were pitched directly to the media and the public. Press releases, rife with references to Sodom and biblical implications, appeared to be focused as much on titillation as on science.

A meme, in its original definition, is a self-propagating unit of cultural information that is highly fit in the evolutionary sense. Like genes, memes can be engineered. Science by press release can be an effective first step in the creation and laundering of such memes into the public's collective consciousness. The authors of the Sodom airburst paper did this well. Their press releases were quickly picked up and repeated by both online clickbait media and mainstream media.

The Sodom airburst meme was so successful that it achieved pop culture status and public acceptance within a year of the paper's publication, in this “Final Jeopardy!” question: “A 2021 study suggested that an asteroid that struck the Jordan Valley c. 1650 B.C, gave rise to the story of this city in Genesis 19.” (Winning answer: “What is Sodom?”)

I am under no illusion that this myth will suddenly be rejected by the public just because the paper was retracted. It is a sticky and compelling idea that has been around since it was suggested by astronomer Gerald Hawkins in 1961. I think it is far more likely that it will join the large and growing pantheon of persistent false beliefs, folk facts and urban legends. Contrary to that bastion of error, scientists know that humans use more than 10 percent of their brains, vaccines don't cause autism, “detox diets” don't cleanse our bodies, toads don't give us warts, and bulls don't hate the color red.

Many of those myths are harmless. It won't hurt you to avoid kissing toads, for example. Belief in other scientifically incorrect claims can be extremely dangerous. Avoid vaccinating your children, and you subject them to the risk of serious illness or death.

What would it hurt if most people thought that God sent an asteroid to wipe out the people of Sodom, because of their wicked ways? That could go either way. The Old Testament, in Ezekial 16:49-50, says that they were punished because they were “arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.” Would it be a bad thing if fear of an asteroid makes us better people? But it could also generate opposition to planetary defense programs to plan for and prevent the impact of an asteroid if we discover one on a collision course. If the majority of people think it's God's will and that we've got it coming, then why shouldn't we just accept our fate?

Ultimately, science-informed choices are always the best ones, whether they involve personal decisions about vaccination or public policies for climate change mitigation. When faith inspires people to better themselves, I'm all for that, too. It shouldn't take irrational and unscientific fear of fire and brimstone from an asteroid airburst to make us want to be more humble, kind and generous than the people of Sodom supposedly were.

Single crystals and shape-controlled nanocrystals are well known to exhibit facet-dependent catalytic properties. However, few studies have investigated how those nanocrystals evolve and (de)activate during reactions, calling for the development of nanoscale time-resolved operando methods. In this context, we have designed Cu nanocubes as a model system to elucidate the underlying driving force of dynamic nanocatalyst reconstruction during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Operando electrochemical liquid-cell scanning transmission electron microscopy (EC-STEM) and synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy reveal the size- and potential-dependent complete transformation from (100)-oriented Cu@Cu2O nanocubes to polycrystalline metallic Cu nanograins under CO2RR conditions. In addition, machine learning-assisted operando four-dimensional STEM reveals that large Cu nanograins derived from nanocubes form mainly crystalline domains, while their smaller counterparts are more amorphous due to faster evolution kinetics. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations suggest that CO drives the ejection of single Cu atoms, resulting in few-nanometre Cu clusters and the surface migration of highly mobile copper carbonyl (Cu–CO) species. Combined, these multimodal operando methods and theoretical approaches pave the way for understanding the complex structural evolution of energy-related nanocatalysts under electrochemical conditions.

See Vaccine Recommendations Backed by Science in These Handy Charts

These graphics will guide you through science-based vaccine guidelines for children and adults

By Jen Christiansen & Meghan Bartels edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Jen Christiansen

Vaccines are a marvel of modern medicine: the carefully tested and regulated technologies teach people's immune systems how to fight off potentially fatal infections, saving both lives and health care costs.

But for as long as vaccines have existed, people have opposed them, and in recent years the antivaccine movement has gained visibility and power. Now the Department of Health and Human Services is led by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.—an environmental lawyer with no medical training and a history of antivaccine activism. And these lifesaving medical interventions are coming under threat.

Access to COVID vaccines this fall is already expected to be limited to people aged 65 years or older and to those with underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to severe disease. And in June Kennedy dismissed all 17 sitting members of a crucial vaccine oversight group, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which, in the past, has made independent, science-based recommendations on vaccine access for people in the U.S. The dismissals came just weeks before the panel's next scheduled meeting; Kennedy appointed eight new members in advance of the meeting, which is still set to begin on June 25.

As a public resource, Scientific American has created graphics outlining the vaccines recommended by ACIP as of its final meeting in 2024.

Vaccine recommendations have always been in flux as new products have been developed and continuing research has suggested better practices: The COVID pandemic required brand-new vaccines for a novel virus, for example. And in the U.S., the stunning success of the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine led to its recommendation for everyone aged 26 or younger, meanwhile the oral polio vaccine was discontinued in favor of the inactivated injected vaccine.

But traditionally, these decisions have been made by scientists based on solid research done within the confines of accepted ethical practices. These principles mean, for example, that a vaccine's side effects are carefully monitored and evaluated against its immune benefit and that potential replacement vaccines are tested against their predecessors, not—as Kennedy has proposed—an inert placebo that would leave people vulnerable to an infection that doctors already have the tools to combat.

Kennedy's decision to replace ACIP wholesale and the comments he has made about deviating from standard vaccine policymaking practice suggest that new recommendations won't be backed by established vaccine science—hence our reproduction of the vaccine recommendations as of the end of 2024.

Note that these are generalized recommendations; people should talk with their health care providers about individual risks and needs, as well as how to proceed after missing a dose. Pregnant people can consult additional resources from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for vaccines recommended during pregnancy. People planning to travel internationally should also check what vaccines are recommended for their destination and consult with a health care professional more than a month before departure.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): This respiratory virus hospitalizes an estimated 58,000 children and 177,000 older adults each year in the U.S. Annually in the country, it kills between 100 and 500 children under five years old and about 14,000 older adults.

Hepatitis A and B: Both of these viruses cause liver infections. Severe cases of hepatitis A can require liver transplants, while chronic cases of hepatitis B can lead to other liver problems, including liver cancer.

Rotavirus: This common gastrointestinal virus causes diarrhea that is sometimes severe enough to require hospitalization. Infections are most common in children under three years old, and the virus can withstand handwashing and common hand sanitizers.

Diphtheria: This bacterial infection has become rare in the U.S. through vaccination; before the vaccine was available, case rates could be as high as 200,000 annually. The infection can manifest in the respiratory system or the skin. Half of untreated people die; children under age five and adults more than 40 years old are most vulnerable.

Tetanus: Sometimes called lockjaw because an early symptom is muscle pain and spasms in the jaw, tetanus is caused by toxins from a bacterium. Doctors don't have a cure for tetanus, and the infection has become rare in the U.S. only through vaccination.

Pertussis/whooping cough: This bacterial infection is sometimes nicknamed the “100-day cough” for its most characteristic symptom. U.S. infection levels have generally run between 10,000 and 20,000 diagnosed cases per year; the disease hospitalizes more than one in five infected children under six months old.

Haemophilus influenzae type b infection: This bacterium—unrelated to the influenza virus—causes a host of infections, including mild cases in the ears and lungs but also severe cases in systems such as the bloodstream and central nervous system. Before the vaccine was developed, the U.S. saw 20,000 severe infections annually in children under five years of age, and one in 20 of these cases was fatal.

Pneumococcal disease: The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause a range of infections, including so-called invasive infections that tend to be more serious. Pneumococcal disease can include pneumonia—pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizes more than 150,000 people in the U.S. each year. But other types of pathogens also cause pneumonia, and pneumococcal disease can manifest anywhere in the body.

Polio: This virus most frequently causes asymptomatic infections, but symptomatic infections can have quite severe symptoms, including paralysis of one or more limbs or even of the muscles involved in breathing. Polio can also trigger new symptoms many years after the initial infection in what's called postpolio syndrome.

COVID: In the five years since COVID emerged, this disease has contributed to the deaths of more than 1.2 million people in the U.S.; weekly death tolls remain in the hundreds. The virus also causes lingering and sometimes debilitating systemic issues known as long COVID, including in children.

Influenza: This respiratory virus is most prevalent in North America between October and May. Although many cases can be treated at home, flu infections can be very serious, particularly in young children and adults aged 65 or older, as well as people with immune issues and other chronic conditions. During the 2023–2024 season, the CDC reported 34 million cases of flu, 380,000 hospitalizations and 17,000 deaths.

Chickenpox: The varicella-zoster virus causes a characteristic itchy rash of small blisters that appear in conjunction with a fever, headache and other mild symptoms. Severe cases can cause more systemic infections, pneumonia, brain swelling and toxic shock syndrome. Adults who did not have chickenpox as a child are more vulnerable to serious infection.

Measles: Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known to experts, and historically most children contracted it before the age of 15. Doctors have no cure for measles; they can only treat its symptoms. About one in 1,000 cases causes brain inflammation; even rarer complications can occur years after the initial infection. The measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine has dramatically reduced caseloads in the U.S. since the late 1960s, however.

Mumps: Mumps is a viral infection characterized by the swelling of certain salivary glands, but other organs can also be affected, including the testicles, ovaries, brain, spinal cord and pancreas. Mumps can also trigger miscarriage early in pregnancy.

Rubella: Sometimes called German measles, rubella is a viral infection that is unrelated to measles but also causes a rash. For most people, rubella is a mild illness, but it triggers serious birth defects in as many as 90 percent of cases in which the virus infects someone during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

Meningococcal disease: Infection of the blood or the membranes of the central nervous system by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis kills 10 to 15 percent of people who are treated; cases that aren't fatal can include a range of long-term issues.

Human papilloma virus (HPV): Infection with this virus leaves people susceptible to cancer, particularly cervical cancer; nearly 38,000 cancers per year are attributed to the virus.

Mpox: The virus that causes mpox was first identified in 1958 but more regularly infects animals than humans. In 2022 it began spreading in people worldwide, however. The infection is characterized by a painful rash and flulike symptoms. The vaccine is only recommended for people who are likely to be exposed to the virus.

Dengue: Dengue is a mosquito-borne illness that is most common in tropical regions. In severe cases, it can damage blood vessels and interfere with the blood's ability to clot. Vaccination is not available in the contiguous U.S., but it is available in U.S. territories and freely associated states for children aged nine to 16 who have had the disease before and live in a region where the infection is common.

Shingles: This infection is caused by the same virus as chickenpox, which remains in the body after a chickenpox infection. When the previously dormant virus reactivates, it can cause shingles, a painful localized rash that is most common in people aged 50 or older and can lead to ongoing pain, vision issues and neurological problems.

It's no secret that women often become less interested in sex with age. However, orgasm and satisfaction have been shown to not decline significantly with age. A new study suggests regular sexual activity may limit vulvar pain, irritation, and dryness, which are all common reasons women have less sex as they get older. Results of the study are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The Menopause Society.

Estrogen deficiency during and after menopause may reduce the life expectancy of women and impair their quality of life through a condition called genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). In 2014, GSM was defined as a collection of symptoms and signs associated with decreased estrogen and sex steroid levels. GSM includes genital, sexual and urinary symptoms -- all of which can affect the frequency of sexual activity for women aged in their 40s to 70s.

In this new study involving more than 900 women aged 40 to 79 years, researchers sought to examine the association between sexual regularity and vulvovaginal-related problematic menopause symptoms. The vulva refers to the external female genitalia, and the vagina to the internal anatomy. Common problems experienced with menopause include itching, burning, pain, decreased lubrication, and changes in skin appearance.

Engaging in sexual activity in the past 3 months was defined as regular sexual activity, whereas engaging in sexual activity in the past year (but not in the past 3 months) was considered lower sexual activity. Not surprisingly, the researchers confirmed that the proportion of women having regular sexual activity decreased significantly with age, which aligns with the fact that Female Sexual Function Index scores for sexual desire, arousal, and lubrication also significantly decreased with age. The Female Sexual Function Index consists of 19 questions on female sexual function under six domains. Noteworthy, however, was that the scores for orgasm and satisfaction did not change with age.

Based on the results of the study, the researchers determined that some sexual functions and symptoms change with age but may be maintained in women who engage in more regular sexual activity. This study also revealed that women with regular sexual activity showed a low prevalence of GSM-related symptoms.

Study results are published in the article "Cross-sectional study of the association between regular sexual activity and sexual function and genitourinary syndrome of menopause-related symptoms."

"The findings highlight the importance of diagnosing and treating GSM. Only 2.9% of the participants reported using hormone therapy. Local low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is safe and highly effective at alleviating bothersome vulvovaginal symptoms contributing to pain and avoidance of intercourse. And although optimal sexual health is integral to overall well-being, it is also imperative to recognize the effect these symptoms can have on women who aren't sexually active. Treatment should be offered to anyone with symptoms, whether engaging in sexual activity or not. Normalizing use of local low-dose estrogen therapy should be a thing," says Dr. Monica Christmas, associate medical director for The Menopause Society.

Fibrosis is a major complication of Crohn's disease (CD) marked by excess deposition of extracellular matrix, leading to stricturing and functional impairment. As mechanistic characterization and therapeutic options are lacking, we paired single-cell and spatial transcriptomics in 61 samples from 21 patients with CD and 10 patients without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal strictures were characterized by increased immune cells, including IgG+ plasma cells, CCR7-hi CD4+ T cells and inflammatory fibroblasts. Spatial transcriptomics showed that key subsets colocalize within diseased tissues and identified additional populations such as interstitial cells of Cajal and enteric neurons. Furthermore, we mapped gene expression onto intestinal biogeography, finding that known genetic risk loci are enriched within discrete spatial modules, defined by the presence of inflammatory fibroblasts and lymphoid follicles. Altogether, our datasets chart the key transcriptomic and cellular networks in stricturing CD and highlight the spatial organization of multicellular genetic risk factors.

Mantle upwellings drive large-scale surface volcanism and facilitate continental breakup and ocean basin formation. However, the spatial characteristics and internal composition of these upwellings alongside how they are modified by plate tectonics are poorly resolved. Afar, East Africa, is a classic triple junction comprising three rifts at various stages of evolution thought to be underlain by a mantle upwelling or plume, allowing examination of the controls on the mantle upwelling. Here we present geochemical data from >130 samples of ‘young' volcanoes spanning the rifts defining the triple junction to show that the underlying mantle comprises a single, asymmetric upwelling. Using statistical modelling to integrate our data with existing geochemical and geophysical constraints, we suggest that Afar is fed by a spatially and chemically heterogeneous upwelling, which controls the composition and relative abundance of melt in all three rift arms. We identify repetitive signatures in mantle compositions in rift regions, whose variability is a longer wavelength in faster-extending rift arms. This suggests more rapid channelized mantle flow occurs where rifting rates are higher and the plate is thinner, aiding flow of the upwelling towards the faster-spreading Red Sea Rift. Our findings demonstrate how the evolution of mantle upwellings is influenced by the dynamics of overriding plates.

The role of mantle upwellings, sometimes interpreted as mantle plumes, in driving volcanism during continental breakup has long been debated (for example, refs. 1,2,3,4). Moreover, our understanding of rift–plume interactions remains incomplete because only a small fraction of Earth's upwellings are situated under continents5, and there are a limited number of upwellings associated with ongoing continental rifting6. The Afar triple junction—where the Arabian, Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates intersect—is a ‘classic' example of magma-assisted continental rifting. Here rifting occurred diachronously with the onset of the Gulf of Aden Rift (GoA) at ~35 million years ago (Ma) (ref. 7), the Red Sea Rift (RSR) at ~23 Ma (ref. 8) and the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) at ~11 Ma (ref. 9). Both intraplate stresses tied to the slab pull effect of Neo-Tethys subduction10 and thermal weakening by a mantle upwelling are thought to have driven rifting11. The diachronous onset has led to each rift (GoA, RSR and MER) being in a different phase of maturity (ocean formation, proto-oceanic formation and mature continental rifting, respectively), and all three rifts are currently volcanically and tectonically active12, making it an ideal location to study the interactions between mantle upwelling and rifting and how these coevolve.

The driver of melt production in Afar is debated, with some models suggesting decompression melting with minimal plume involvement13, whereas others propose the upwelling of hot, deep mantle14,15,16,17 or, indeed, multiple upwellings18,19. While several discrete segments of the RSR have been studied in terms of magma petrogenesis (for example, refs. 16,20), a paucity of high-precision geochemical data has hampered evaluation of the spatial characteristics of upwelling across the broader region and rigorous testing of existing models of the links between tectonics and upwellings.

In this Article, we implement a comprehensive sampling strategy, targeting evolutionarily young volcanoes spanning the three rifts (Fig. 1). We analyse rocks that are Quaternary in age (less than 2.58 Myr old) and from volcanoes that have been active during the Holocene, which began 11.7 thousand years ago21. By targeting younger rocks, we make a direct comparison with geophysical data across the region, enabling an integrated exploration of mantle petrogenesis and dynamics. Our approach utilizes statistical methods, including semi-parametric regression using splines and K-means cluster analysis to integrate and analyse these geophysical and geochemical data to explore models of upwelling that can explain our data.

Source data

Mantle upwellings that originate between depths of 1,000 and 2,800 km are anomalously hot zones and/or zones of an enriched composition that reduce the solidus temperature of the mantle, enabling increased partial melting22. Mantle upwellings are widely accepted to contain a variety of domains of differing proportions (for example, high μ (HIMU, U/Pb), enriched mantle I (EMI), enriched mantle II (EMII), common component (C) and Focus Zone (FOZO) (for example, refs. 5,22,23,24,25)). Such domains typically exhibit an isotopically distinct and enriched composition (generally low 87Sr/86Sr, high 143Nd/144Nd and high 206Pb/204Pb24) relative to those of bulk silicate Earth (BSE)5. Trace-element ratios such as Ce/Pb and ∆Nb have previously been used to indicate enriched upwellings (>30 (ref. 26), >0 (ref. 27), respectively) and La/Sm to suggest the melt fraction relative to the study region, with a lower-than-average value suggesting an elevated melt fraction19. Mantle upwellings are also commonly associated with reduced (lower) seismic velocities (that is, shear-wave velocity (vs) and P-wave velocity)28,29. These reduced seismic velocities are caused by elevated temperatures and/or the presence of fluids and partial melt30.

Crustal assimilation, where crust components are incorporated into the magma, can obscure these geochemical indicators of a deep mantle plume. However, within the Afar region, crustal contamination has played a relatively minor role in recent magmatism14 compared with earlier stages of rifting14,26 due to the thinning of the present-day crust and because it has been extensively intruded by mafic melts along the length of the rift axes. Seismicity analysis indicates that recent magmatic activity beneath the rift axes in Afar is transient31 and, in turn, that magmas are unlikely to reside in crustal reservoirs long enough to extensively assimilate crustal lithologies. Nevertheless, we investigate this issue further in our analysis (‘Probing the presence of mantle upwelling(s) in Afar').

Our study includes over 130 rock samples, with many from previously unstudied volcanoes, roughly doubling the number of high-quality analyses from the area (Fig. 1). The 79 Afar samples included in our study were carefully selected from a repository covering the broader Afar region (details in Methods). These were supplemented by 52 additional samples collected during fieldwork in the MER. To examine spatial trends in the geochemistry of surface volcanism, we analysed all samples for major and trace elements alongside radiogenic isotopes (Sr, Nd, Pb; Methods). We also integrated existing data for 93 rock samples from the open-source GEOROC data repository32 (https://georoc.eu/; see Methods for selection criteria), as well as the classic GoA catalogue from ref. 19. In addition, we leveraged recent spatial compilations of geophysical variables, such as the depth of the Mohorovičić discontinuity (Moho)31 (Methods) and vs at regularly spaced depths (40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 km (ref. 30)) across the region. These variables provide well-established proxies for the boundary between the crust and mantle and for the presence and abundance of melt within the lithosphere and asthenosphere30. Collectively, this information allows us to infer details about the depth, compositional characteristics and relative abundance of partial melts distributed across all three rifts.

On the basis of these samples, we infer wide geochemical variability across the study region (Fig. 1). The ∆Nb ranges from −0.26 to 0.94 and the La/Sm ratio ranges from 0.4 to 4.6. The radiogenic isotopes 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb, 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd also display a large range (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1), with enrichments relative to BSE occurring in all three rifts. Local variability in these radiogenic isotopes is observed within some volcanoes, for example, Boset–Bericha; however, this variability is smaller than the regional range determined for Afar (Fig. 1).

Error bars show the uncertainty associated. Black error bars are the average uncertainty of the dataset; grey are the maximum uncertainty. Uncertainties for data points in a are smaller than the symbols. The global mantle endmember compositions (including depleted mid-ocean-ridge-basalt mantle (DMM) and prevalent mantle (PREMA)) are shown as fields behind from refs. 5,49. The histograms show the distribution of all data analysed in our study, including our >130 data points.

Across the study region, the depth of the Moho varies, being shallowest in the RSR (~16 km) and deepest in the MER (31 km). Like the geochemical data, the Vs at 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 km depths shows regional variability: 3.81–4.05, 4.06–4.17, 4.00–4.15, 3.97–4.10 and 4.02–4.10, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1). All rifts show zones of high and low Vs (relative to ref. 30) in the mantle that vary laterally and in depth.

To evaluate the potential influence of crustal assimilation—which again is considered minor in the Afar region14—on mantle composition and upwelling, we assess the correlation between key geochemical and geophysical indicators (see Fig. 4a) and the depth to the Moho. The Moho, the boundary between the crust and mantle, serves as a proxy for crustal thickness, which is widely thought to influence the degree of assimilation26 (Methods). We found that most indicators, including Pb isotopes—a reliable indicator of crustal assimilation33—exhibit only a weak, but statistically significant, correlation with Moho depth (see Fig. 4a). Further, Ce/Pb exhibits a strong negative correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient of −0.7), indicating that where the crust is thin, the Ce/Pb values are high, and vice versa. This trend can be attributed to minimal crustal assimilation across most of the Afar region, although the degree of assimilation increases as the crust thickens within the MER.

Overall, our dataset shows geochemical and geophysical variability across the study area. The observed variations are consistent with the presence of an upwelling across all three rifts. The spatial trends observed in all variables implicate an underlying complexity to the location of partial melts.

We used our data to test multiple conceptual models of mantle upwelling dynamics. The initial conceptual model we considered is a simple, homogeneous mantle upwelling at the triple junction (for example, ref. 19). This model expects variables (geochemical and geophysical) that indicate deep upwelling to change radially with distance from the upwelling centre (C1C—one centre, circular, concentric; Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 2). Therefore, this model assumes that variables change linearly from the upwelling centre due to lateral spreading. Extending this model, we then allow the upwelling to be spatially and temporally heterogeneous, as reported for the Hawaiian34 and Canary Island35 volcanoes. This mechanism yields a similar pattern to the linear C1C model but accommodates compositional fluctuations over the radial distance corresponding to a chemically pulsed upwelling (Fig. 3). This model fits a single spline per parameter for all data against distance from the upwelling centre (spline C1C). The optimum spline allows for regional variations to be accounted for while minimizing noise (optimal smoothing). This approach of both linear and spline fits is applied to all further models described in this section, allowing for homogeneous and heterogeneous upwelling(s), respectively. Note the starting composition of the upwelling is not constrained within the model parameters.

The upwelling scenarios for Afar tested in this study. The diagrams (left) are labelled with the code associated with each model (see Extended Data Table 2 and the ‘Statistical models considered' section within Methods for further details). The locations of the purported mantle upwellings are shown by the star symbol. The number of lines shown on the schematic graphs equals the number of models that must be fitted for that model variant (linear, dashed; spline, continuous). Note that each model variant has been illustrated with an indicator that decreases with a reduction in upwelling proportion. R, rift; U, upwelling.

We additionally tested whether the spatial geochemical and geophysical variations observed (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1) are best explained through the presence of three small-scale upwellings, which have been proposed on the basis of geophysics and numerical models (for example, ref. 36, C3C—three centres, circular, concentric; Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 1). We tested this model using three upwellings: one centred on the triple junction, one in the northern RSR and one in the southern MER, with the positions of these loci informed by previous models and observations (Methods). This model fits one linear/spline regression per variable (against distance) from the nearest upwelling centre and assumes that the upwellings are compositionally identical and from the same deep source.

It is plausible that the variable tectonic regime (for example, extension rate, crustal thickness) between the three rifts12 introduces further complexity to the geochemical and geophysical signals. Accordingly, we introduce three further models, C1D, C3D and C3X (Fig. 3, Extended Data Table 2 and Methods) to account for these regional differences. Models C1D (one centre, different spreading) and C3D (three centres, different spreading) consider one upwelling and three small-scale upwellings, respectively, while allowing for distinct distance-dependent patterns for each rift, thereby modelling the distribution of variables across each rift independently. Unlike the other models, C3X (three independent centres, different spreading) allows each small-scale upwelling to have a distinct signature, as well as permitting an independent distribution along each rift (Methods).

To test these models (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 2), we identify 14 key geochemical and geophysical variables (for descriptions, see Extended Data Table 2) and calculate the distance, using the spherical cosine law (Methods), between the purported upwelling centre15,19,37 and each observation site (Methods). We then apply two-deep cross-validation (100 iterations) to find the optimum linear fit (representing a homogeneous upwelling) and penalized B-spline fit (representing a heterogeneous upwelling) to each of the variables, using all data points, over a radial distance of 500 km—the radial limit of samples considered within our study (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 2). The predictive performance of each fit is then assessed by calculating the mean standardized root-mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP), where a value of 1 indicates a lack of predictive capability, and 0 indicates a perfect predictive ability (Fig. 4c).

Red squares indicate where the correlation is significant (P ≤ 0.05), and blue squares indicate that the correlations are not deemed significant (P > 0.05). b, Splines (a smooth, flexible polynomial curve) of the best overall model—that is, C1C—for selected variables. Symbols show the data within the study (locations denoted by symbols shown); 95% confidence intervals are indicated by the shaded background. The numbers of data observations (n) for La/Sm, 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and vs at 100 km depth are 269, 218, 185 and 184, respectively. Uncertainties in data values are shown by error bars (average in black, maximum in grey). c, The mean standardized RMSEP for each of the models tested. Individual linear model results are shown by red squares, and the mean of those results is displayed by the dashed red line. Individual spline results are shown by blue circles, and the mean of those results is shown by a blue line. All models were run for 100 iterations to capture the probable uncertainty distribution, as shown by the data points. Mean (red and blue dotted lines) and 95% confidence interval (shaded) of results using perturbed data (within the uncertainty of each data point) are also shown (300 perturbation runs each using 100 iterations).

For all models, we observe the B-spline fit (a class of polynomial function; Methods) to have the best predictive performance, compared with a linear fit (Fig. 4c). This indicates that a compositionally heterogeneous upwelling in Afar is most probable (Fig. 4b,c).

The analysis indicates that the overall best predictive model is the B-spline fit of model C1D, wherein a single, heterogeneous mantle upwelling is present, albeit with differing distributions of geochemical and geophysical variables between rift arms (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 2). This model yields a mean standardized RMSEP of 0.59 (Fig. 4c), lower than that of the other models. To further validate our results, we carried out sensitivity analysis, varying the geochemical and geophysical data about their known uncertainties (Methods). The results confirm that model C1D remains the most accurate predictive model (see shaded areas in Fig. 4c).

While the RSR and MER have a high sample density, there is limited sample availability from the GoA due to poor access. When excluding the GoA from our analyses, the overall trend between the models remains effectively the same (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Although the three rifts share a single, compositionally heterogeneous upwelling, they appear to behave independently, implying that some feature of their tectonic regime modulates the observed signals.

Many of the optimum splines for each rift display distance-dependent sinusoidal patterns (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 2). Importantly, our analysis indicates that the variability observed for some variables within the MER exhibits greater amplitude and shorter periodicity with distance from the centre of the upwelling compared with those of the RSR (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 2). Further, the observed variation in Pb isotopes within the RSR suggests that the upwelling may be chemically heterogeneous for some elements, whereas others show a narrower range in composition (for example, 87Sr/86Sr is more heterogeneous than 143Nd/144Nd; Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). Although ∆Nb values are almost consistently positive (>0) across the region (except around Boset–Bericha Volcano), we identify small-scale differences in La/Sm and vs at 100 km depth, within the likely melt-rich zone of the asthenosphere26, with distance to upwelling centre in each rift (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 2). These small-scale differences indicate locally variable degrees of melting across the study region, agreeing with previous studies that reported low-velocity areas (for example, refs. 36,38). This raises the question of whether the zones of locally higher melt fraction, low vs and variable geochemistry observed in one rift correspond, spatially and compositionally, to those observed in the other two rifts. If so, this could indicate a shared melt source.

To address the spatial heterogeneity patterns observed and investigate the potential shared melt source, we carried out principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means cluster analysis using all variables post-standardization (Methods). Across all variables, the K-means cluster analysis algorithm seeks to group similar observations while minimizing the within-cluster total sum of squares for a pre-specified number of clusters. Our K-means cluster analysis shows a higher number of clusters that are smaller in geographic size for the MER (50–100 km length scale; four clusters) compared with the RSR (150–200 km length scale; three clusters) (Fig. 5 and Methods). Several clusters (clusters 1–3) are found to co-exist in different rift arms. For example, samples assigned to cluster 3 are observed in the distal section of the RSR, as well as in locations closer to the MER rift centre (Fig. 5). The three clusters (1–3) observed across the RSR match the initial ~200 km clustering sequence observed across the MER. This sequential repeated clustering may indicate that they are derived from a shared source melt. However, the sequence of these melts—as indicated by clusters—within the MER occurs over a shorter distance compared with that of the RSR.

a, Segments are shown in blue from north to south: Erta Ale Volcanic Segment (EAVS), Tat'Ale Volcanic Segment (TAVS), Alayta Volcanic Segment (AVS), Dabbahu Volcanic Segment (DVS), Gabillema Volcanic Segment (GVS), Adda'do Magmatic Segment (AMS), Fentale-Dofen Magmatic Segment (FDMS), Boset Magmatic Segment (BMS), Aluto-Gedemsa Magmatic Segment (AGMS) and Corbetti Magmatic Segment (CMS). Rift axis (dotted line) is shown. b,c, Enlarged maps of the boxes shown in a. d,e, PCA bi-plot (principal component 1 versus principal component 2) when considering the six isotopic systems (Extended Data Table 3) showing the samples and their component scores relative to those of the mantle endmembers. Values used for the mantle endmembers—Pan-African Lithosphere, EMI, EMII, DMM and HIMU—are shown in Extended Data Table 3. The topography shown is from the 1 arcsec (∼30 m resolution) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model48.

The spatial distribution of clusters reflects spatial variations in the composition and abundance of melt, which share some cursory similarities to the magmatic segments observed at the surface (Fig. 5). However, when inspecting in detail, we observe clear differences. For example, volcanic systems within both magmatic segments and the adjacent rift flanks are commonly allocated to single clusters, and the boundaries between clusters and known magmatic segments are typically mismatched (Fig. 5). In Afar, the length of the region containing clusters is longer than that of magmatic segments. We therefore infer that the compositional variability of mantle upwelling is unlikely to be related to the along-axis segmentation of crustal subvolcanic plumbing systems.

Taken together, our data can be explained through a single upwelling model with internal heterogeneity between rifts (for example, refs. 31,34,39,40), as shown by the spline model. Crucially, the K-means cluster analysis indicates the signatures of geochemical variability (clusters) are repeated across rifts, implicating pulses of upwelling from the same source, as inferred for other mantle plumes (for example, refs. 35,39,40). Rifts act as natural channels for upwelling melt from deeper mantle sources41. Considering the high extension rate in the RSR (10.5–19.5 mm yr–1 (ref. 42)) compared with that of the MER (∼5.2 mm yr–1 (ref. 42)), it is plausible that a mantle flow rate is impeded by the narrowing of the rift in the MER. This process would lead to a ‘bottleneck' effect41,43,44, which in turn may result in a different length scale of mantle heterogeneity (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2) between the RSR and MER (Fig. 5). Further, a contrast in crustal thickness is evident between the rifts, with the MER crust being thicker (25–33 km (ref. 45)) than that of RSR (16–25 km (ref. 46); Extended Data Fig. 1). Assuming a correlation between crustal and overall plate thickness, this effect is expected to introduce differences in mantle flow rate along each rift in Afar. A progressive thickening of the overlying lithosphere away from the upwelling centre in the MER should reduce the volume capacity for melt, impeding mantle flow. Consequently, the heterogeneous nature of the pulsed upwelling would exhibit a more condensed spatial pattern within the MER compared with RSR, as we observe (Fig. 5).

We conclude that variations in melt composition and abundance in and around Afar are best explained by a heterogeneous pulsing mantle upwelling that is not symmetrical (Fig. 5) but is instead shaped by both variable lithospheric thinning and extension rates within each rift (Fig. 6). While this model investigates principally the likelihood of a singular or three small-scale upwelling scenarios, our results demonstrate that for either option, a single heterogeneous upwelling provides the best match to observations in the region. The detected variations in melt composition and abundance between the MER and RSR imply that the length scale of heterogeneities within magma-assisted rifting environments may be controlled not only by the upwelling itself, but also by the extension rate and plate thickness. If this model is correct, it demonstrates that the evolution of a mantle upwelling can be influenced and shaped by the dynamics of the overriding plates.

All samples and previously published data used in this study must originate from a volcano that has been active within the Holocene21 (Fig. 1), with the sample estimated to be of Quaternary age (<2.58 Ma). An essential criterion was that all samples have a precisely known location with accurate coordinates.

Previously published geochemical data were obtained from GEOROC19,32. Once downloaded, the data files were filtered to include only data within Ethiopia (including the MER and Afar). These data were further filtered using the following criteria:

The values for the sample must relate to whole-rock geochemistry as opposed to mineral separates.

The individual sample must have major-element, trace-element, 87Sr/86Sr, 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb isotope values available.

The coordinates must be specific to the individual sample's location rather than providing an average coordinate for a broader study area.

Ninety-three lavas, 11 welded tuffs and one pumice sample, from various volcanoes in Afar (Erta Ale Volcanic Segment, Ayelu, Abida, Yangudi, Dama Ali, Kerub, Ela, Didoli, Abbahu, Afdera, Tat Ali and Manda Hararo), were selected for geochemical analysis50,51,52. The samples were collected during the CNR/CNRS projects in Afar during the 1960s53 and stored in the Afar Repository at the University of Pisa, Italy (http://repositories.dst.unipi.it/index.php/home-afar). A further 52 samples from the Boset–Bericha Volcanic Complex (BBVC) were collected during three field seasons54, in November 2012, April–May 201555 and February 201756.

Sample preparation, for major, trace and isotope analyses, was carried out at the University of Southampton. Samples were cut with a saw to remove any weathered sections, and cut surfaces were ground down to reduce any potential contamination by metals from the saw blade. Rock samples were then crushed using a fly press and placed in double-layered plastic bags before crushing to minimize metal contamination during the crushing process.

The crushed material was separated into three size fractions (>1 mm, 0.5–1 mm, <0.5 mm) using Teflon sieves, retaining the middle fraction (0.5–1 mm) for analysis. The selected fraction was cleaned by ultrasonicating in Milli-Q water then dried overnight in an oven at 85 °C. The cleaned rock chips were then hand-picked under a microscope to remove any extraneous (non-rock) material. An aliquot of cleaned chips was used for Pb isotope analysis. For major-element, trace-element, 143Nd/144Nd and 87Sr/86Sr isotope analysis, the remaining rock chips were ground to a fine powder using an agate mortar and pestle, again to minimize contamination with metals.

Samples were prepared for whole-rock trace-element analysis using 0.05 g (for BBVC samples) or 0.075 g (for all other samples) powdered sample. The powdered samples were digested in sealed Savillex Teflon vials with 15 drops concentrated HNO3 and 2 ml HF on a hotplate at 130 °C for 24 h (for all samples excluding those from the BBVC) or with 50 drops HF and 0.2 ml HNO3 on a hotplate at 130 °C for 24 h (for BBVC samples only). The HNO3/HF was evaporated off, and the samples were refluxed in 6 M HCl for another 24 h on a hotplate at 130 °C. The 6 M HCl was evaporated off, and the samples were redissolved in 6 M HCl. Mother solutions were prepared by adding 6 M HCl and Milli-Q water (total 30 ml) to the dissolved samples. Daughter solutions were prepared using 0.5 ml of mother solution, diluted to 5 ml with 3% HNO3 (containing the internal standards 5 ppb In/5 ppb Re/20 ppb Be), resulting in an overall dilution factor of ~4,000.

Trace-element analyses of the daughter samples were undertaken on the Thermo Scientific X Series 2 quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) at the University of Southampton. Samples and standards were spiked with internal standard elements and corrected for interferences and the blank and then calibrated using a suite of international rock standards. Accuracy was monitored using reference materials JA-2, BCR-2 and JB-2 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

For Pb isotope analysis, 0.3 g of cleaned, picked rock chips (0.5–1.0 mm) were weighed into Pb Savillex Teflon vials and leached on a hotplate with 4 ml 6 M HCl for 1 h (15 min for obsidian and pumice samples, to avoid full dissolution of the sample). Samples were rinsed several times in Milli-Q water then 0.5 ml concentrated HNO3 before adding 3–4 ml of concentrated HF. Samples were digested, following the same procedure as for trace elements, and refluxed on a hotplate at 130 °C for 24 h, before being evaporated to dryness. Then 0.5 ml concentrated HCl was added, and the sample was evaporated to dryness. Then 0.5 ml concentrated HNO3 was added and again evaporated to dryness. The final residue was reconstituted in 0.5 ml HBr and refluxed for 1 h. The samples were cooled and centrifuged for 5 min. Pb was isolated using a single-stage HCl anion-exchange chromatographic resin separation method57, with AGX-1×8, 200–400 mesh resin. Following this, the Pb isolate was dried down, redissolved in HNO3 and analysed using the double-spike method of ref. 58. The samples were subsequently analysed on a Thermo Scientific Neptune multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at the University of Southampton (UK), achieving an NBS SRM 981 reproducibility of 206Pb/204Pb = 16.9404 ± 24 (142 ppm), 207Pb/204Pb = 15.4969 ± 26 (168 ppm), 208Pb/204Pb = 36.7149 ± 66 (180 ppm) (2 s.d.; n = 44). Pb isotope measurements of the standard are within error of the accepted values (206Pb/204Pb = 16.9412, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.4988, 208Pb/204Pb = 36.7233). Accuracy was 47 ppm for 206Pb/204Pb, 123 ppm for 207Pb/204Pb and 174 ppm for 208Pb/204Pb.

For Sr and Nd analysis, the remaining mother solutions from the preparation of trace-element solutions (see the preceding) were used for all samples except those of the BBVC. An aliquot of each mother solution was used to give a volume of liquid containing at least 1 μg Sr and 200 ng Nd and evaporated to dryness in Savillex Teflon vials on a hotplate at 130 °C. Sample residues were reconstituted in 200 μl 1.75 M HCl. For the BBVC samples, rock chips were leached in 4 ml 6 M HCl for 30 min in Savillex Teflon vials (obsidian samples for only 15 min to avoid full dissolution of the sample). The samples were then rinsed with Milli-Q water and HNO3, and then the same digestion procedure as for the preceding trace-element analysis was followed. The final mother solutions were prepared using HCl and Milli-Q water to 30 ml for felsic samples and 20 ml for mafic samples.

All samples were then passed through ion-exchange column chemistry using an AG50-X8 200–400 mesh resin cation column to separate the Sr and Nd fractions. The sample fractions were subsequently evaporated to dryness, ready for further column chemistry.

Sr was further isolated through Sr-spec resin columns following the methodology of ref. 59. Samples were then evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 1.5 ml 1 M HCl and loaded onto outgassed tantalum filaments with 1 μl of Ta-activator. Sr isotopic analysis was performed on a thermal ionization mass spectrometer Thermo Scientific Triton Plus at the University of Southampton. Reference material SRM NIST987 (87Sr/86Sr = 0.710258; GeoREM) was used to monitor accuracy and gave average 87Sr/86Sr values of 0.710243. All samples were normalized to NBS SRM-987 87Sr/86Sr = 0.710248 (ref. 60), while reproducibility was ±0.000020 (28.2 ppm, 2 s.d.; n = 464). Accuracy was 21 ppm.

The Nd aliquot from the cation column was followed by an Ln-spec resin (50–100 μm) (ref. 59). The samples were then evaporated to dryness and 3% HNO3 was added to produce a solution of 50 ppb. 143Nd/144Nd analyses were undertaken on the ThermoScientific Neptune MC-ICP-MS at the University of Southampton. Corrected Nd isotopic compositions were obtained using a method based on ref. 61 through adjustment to a 146Nd/144Nd ratio of 0.7219 and a secondary normalization to 142Nd/144Nd = 1.141876. Reference material JNdi-1 was measured as an unknown (143Nd/144Nd of 0.512124, 2 s.d. (refs. 62,63)), achieving an average 143Nd/144Nd of 0.512115 with an external reproducibility of ±0.000008 (2 s.d., 15.2 ppm) across six analysis sessions over 2 years. The total column blanks (when blank acid is run through the column procedure) were negligible (<20 pg) compared with the total amounts analysed (1 μg and 200 μg) for Sr and Nd, respectively.

We use the vs model of ref. 30 for inclusion in our analysis. The three-dimensional velocity model is created through a joint inversion of Rayleigh-wave phase velocities from ambient noise and teleseisms30,64. The vs model is parameterized every 5 km vertically with 0.1° × 0.1° pixel size for the upper 50 km. For deeper depths, an irregular spacing was used, increasing from 10 to 50 km spacings to match that of ref. 38. For further details on the creation of the velocity model, the reader is directed to refs. 30,64 and references therein.

For the analysis in this Article, the vs model was interpolated to 1 km depth using a linear interpolation; we then extracted one-dimensional columns of velocity with depth at the same resolution as our pixel size (0.1° × 0.1°).

The gridded Moho depth map was produced from the vs maps of ref. 64, described in the preceding. The vs model was interpolated to a vertical grid spacing of 1 km. A velocity slice at the 3.75 km s–1 contour was extracted, which mapped best to previous receiver function measurements65,66,67,68,69, active source experiments (for example, ref. 45) and previous S-wave models (for example, ref. 70).

As described in the text, five models were considered (Extended Data Table 2), with each model being tested using a linear fit and a spline fit (Fig. 3). We note that a spline fit itself can be linear if that is the best-fitting line.

Empirical models are estimated for the variation of each of 14 geochemical quantities (each of which is represented generically by random variable Y) as a function of distance d ∈ [0, 1,800] km for the five different models. Models are specified that explore the variation of Y with d in increasing complexity. The simplest model (C1C) assumes the existence of a single upwelling centre (at 11.192° N, 41.784° E; Figs. 1 and 3), with respect to which d is defined for all three rifts. The variation of Y with d is assumed common to all rifts. Model C3C assumes the existence of three upwelling centres (at 11.192° N, 41.784° E; 14.008° N, 40.458° E; and 6.626° N, 37.948° E; Fig. 1) on the basis of ref. 36; observations are allocated to the nearest upwelling centre, facilitating calculation of a single d for each observation. Like model C1C, the variation of Y with d is assumed common to all rifts, regardless of upwelling allocation. Model C1D assumes one upwelling centre (like C1C) for calculation of d, but now the variation of Y with d is assumed to be different across rifts. Model C3D duplicates C3C for estimation of d, but variation of Y with d is assumed to be different across rifts. Finally, in model C3X, we consider the presence of three upwelling centres, with different variation of Y with d for each combination of upwelling and rift.

For models C1C and C1D, the distance between each sample and the upwelling locus centred on Lake Abhe (11.192170° N, 41.783750° E) is calculated. For models C3C, C3D and C3X, the distance between each sample and each of the three upwelling locations (Figs. 1 and 3) is measured, and then each sample is assigned to its nearest upwelling centre. The distance (d) between two locations (upwelling and sample) is calculated using the spherical cosine law:

where a is the angle (in radians) from the North Pole to the sample location, b is the angle (in radians) from the North Pole to the upwelling location, C is the difference (in radians) between the longitude values of the sample and upwelling, and R is the radius of the Earth in metres (6,371 × 103).

For each model, the variation of Y with d is described using a penalized B-spline (for example, refs. 71,72), the characteristics of which are selected to provide optimal predictive performance. First, for a large index set of locations equally spaced on the domain of distance, we calculate a B-spline basis matrix, B (for example, ref. 73) consisting of p equally spaced cubic spline basis functions. Then the value of Y on the index set is given by the vector Bβ for spline coefficient vector β to be estimated. The value of p is specified to be sufficiently large to provide a good description of a highly variable Y. For a given dataset, we penalize the difference between consecutive values in β using a roughness penalty, such that the penalized spline exhibits optimal roughness, providing optimal predictive performance.

For a sample of n1 training data, consisting of vectors of geochemical and geophysical quantities (y1) and distances (d1), we first allocate each element of d1 to its nearest neighbour in the index set and hence construct the appropriate spline basis matrix B1 for the sample. We then assume that \({\bf{y}_{1}}={B}_{1}\bf{\upbeta} +\bf{\upepsilon}\), where the elements of ε are independently and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian random variables. We penalize the roughness of β using a first-different penalty λβ'Pβ, where \(P=D{^\prime} D\) and D is a first-difference matrix (with elements \({D}_{{ij}}=-1\) if \(i=j\); \(=1\) if \(j=i+1\); and \(=0\) otherwise (for example, ref. 74). For a given choice of \(\lambda\), we then find the optimal value of β by minimizing lack of fit:

We can evaluate the predictive performance of the resulting spline description using a tuning set of n2 observations (independent of the training set) represented by vectors y2 and d2. We again start by finding the appropriate spline basis matrix B2 for this sample. Then we can calculate the predictive mean square error for the tuning sample:

for each of a set of representative choices of values for λ. We can then select the optimal value of λ using

The value \({\text{MSE}}_{{{\mathrm{Tune}}}}\left({\lambda }^{* }\right)\) is a biased estimate of predictive performance since the value of \({\lambda }^{* }\) was tuned to minimize its value. We can obtain an unbiased estimate for the predictive performance of the spline model using a test set of n3 observations (independent of the training and tuning sets) represented by vectors y3 and d3 (and corresponding spline basis matrix B3). Then the predictive performance is estimated using:

We exploit cross-validation to evaluate MSETest by partitioning the full sample of data into k > 2 groups at random, withholding one group for tuning and another group for testing and retaining the remaining k – 2 groups for training. We then loop exhaustively over all possible combinations of choice of train, tune and test groups, evaluating overall predictive performance on the test data over all iterations, noting that each observation occurs exactly once in the test set. For models requiring separate model fits to subsets of data (C1D, C3D, C3X), MSETest is estimated using predictions from optimal predictive models for each subset. Further, we can repeat the analysis for different initial random partitioning of observations into k groups to assess the sensitivity of overall predictive performance to this choice. We are careful to use the same cross-validation partitions to evaluate each of the five models so that predictive performances can be compared fairly.

To quantify model performance over all 14 geochemical quantities \((j=\mathrm{1,2},\ldots ,13)\), we define the overall standardized MSETest

where MSETest,j is the predictive performance for the jth geochemical indicator, and \(\,{s}_{j}^{2}\) is the sample estimate for the variance of that quantity. The estimation of the splines and the testing of their predictive performance was repeated over 100 iterations. Results from each iteration and the mean of the SMSE are shown in Fig. 4.

For comparison, we also evaluate linear regression models for the variation of Y with d. In the current notation, these can be thought of as simple models with basis matrix B = [1 d], where 1 is a vector of appropriate length with each element = 1. Β in this case is a 2-vector with elements corresponding to intercept and slope coefficients. Linear regression is approached using penalized B-spline models as the roughness coefficient λ → ∞. That is, linear regression corresponds to a penalized B-spline model with very large λ. Therefore, a penalized B-spline model is guaranteed to perform at least as well as linear regression.

To explore the effect of uncertainty on model performance, a perturbation analysis was undertaken. This analysis required the generation and modelling of nPert new data samples. Each of these data samples corresponded to a perturbation of the original data sample. A value of nPert = 300 was selected to ensure that 95% uncertainty bands for predictive performance on perturbed data could be estimated with confidence.

In perturbed sample q, \({q=1,2,\ldots ,n}_{{{\mathrm{Pert}}}}\), the value \({y}_{{ijq}}^{* }\) of the ith observation for variable j was obtained by perturbing the corresponding value \({y}_{{ij}}\) in the original data sample, using additive Gaussian noise \({e}_{{ijq}}\), the standard deviation \({\sigma }_{{ij}}\) of which was informed by the known value of measurement uncertainty for that observation of the variable. Mathematically:

The complete modelling procedure was then applied to each perturbed data sample in turn. The predictive performance of different models was assessed over the nPert perturbations, as illustrated in Fig. 4, in terms of 95% uncertainty bands. The figure indicates that model C1D provides the best predictive performance on perturbed data, as well as for the original unperturbed sample. Note that, since noise has been added to observations in the perturbation analysis, the overall performance of models on perturbed data is poorer than on the original sample, as expected.

We tested the influence of crustal assimilation further by excluding cases where Ce/Pb values fall below 20 and which could feasibly be associated with crustal assimilation26,33. Using additional analysis, we confirm that excluding cases in which Ce/Pb < 20 does not affect our overall results (Extended Data Fig. 3a), suggesting that primary mantle compositional fluctuations (relative proportions of compositional mantle endmembers) exert the first-order control on eruptive compositions at the surface.

PCA requires each sample or object to have the same number of values for each variable, so the dataset was reduced to 94 samples. PCA is carried out only on radiogenic isotope compositions of the samples where data are available for the mantle endmembers investigated (Afar plume, Pan-African Lithosphere, Depleted Mantle, EMI, EMII, HIMU; Fig. 5 and Extended Data Table 3; ref. 75). While other purely geochemical studies on Afar (for example, refs. 14,37) have included sub-crustal components such as the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, we decided not to include this endmember as it can sometimes be indistinguishable from certain mantle endmembers (EM1), especially in cases where the sub-continental lithospheric mantle is metasomatized. The preferred values used for the endmembers in our models are provided in Extended Data Table 3. Each object is standardized before being included in the PCA:

where \({\bar{y}}_{j}\) is the mean of variable j, and sj is the standard deviation of the variable j:

where Nj is the number of objects within variable j.

Approximately 90.5% of the variance is explained within the plane of the first two eigenvectors, increasing to 95.5% when including the third eigenvector. The first principal component (PC-1) is most influenced by 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb, whereas the second principal component (PC-2) is dominantly influenced by 206Pb/204Pb and 87Sr/86Sr. The third principal component (PC-3) is dominated by 207Pb/204Pb and 143Nd/144Nd (Supplementary Table 3).

K-means cluster analysis76 was carried out on the samples using the 13 standardized variables (excluding Moho depth; Extended Data Table 1; refs. 77,78,79,80,75). The K-means algorithm assigns each object to a singular cluster that does not overlap with another (partitional clustering), minimizing the total sum of squared errors from the centre point of each cluster, known as the centroid, to each data point.

To find the optimum number of clusters (k)—which reduces the within-cluster total sum of squared errors with the lowest number of clusters—we run the K-means algorithm specifying k to be 1/20 over 1,000 iterations for each k (Supplementary Fig. 1). We then select four clusters on the basis of k = 4, reducing the within-cluster total sum of squares by 60% from k = 1 and the range over the 1,000 iterations being minimized when k ≥ 4. The cluster assignments for each object, out of the 1,000 iterations, are selected by finding the iteration number that is closest to the mean within-cluster total sum of squares of that k value (shown by the blue line in Supplementary Fig. 1).

The question of whether Earth is alone in harboring life has captivated humanity for millennia. In recent years, scientists have turned to Earth-like planets in other solar systems that may show the most promise, but many revolve around stars that emit much stronger solar radiation than our own. Now, a new study offers evidence that life as we know it may be able to thrive on those Earth-like exoplanets.

Published June 12th in Astrobiology, the new research demonstrated that lichen found in the Mojave Desert survived for 3 months under levels of solar radiation previously considered lethal. The common lichen, Clavascidium lacinulatum, was injured, but able to recover and replicate. The results show that photosynthetic life may be possible on planets exposed to intense solar radiation.

"The study was motivated by a curious observation," said Henry Sun, Associate Research Professor of Microbiology at DRI and one of the lead authors of the study. "I was just walking in the desert and I noticed that the lichens growing there aren't green, they're black. They are photosynthetic and contain chlorophyll, so you would think they'd be green. So I wondered, 'What is the pigment they're wearing?' And that pigment turned out to be the world's best sunscreen."

Life on Earth has evolved to withstand solar radiation known as UVA and UVB rays, which encompass longer wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation. UVC rays represent the shorter, more damaging wavelengths; these are filtered by Earth's atmosphere and therefore do not reach the surface. UVC radiation is so lethal to life, in fact, that it is used to sterilize air, water, and surfaces of microorganisms like viruses and bacteria. Even a brief exposure to UVC radiation will damage an organism's DNA and prevent it from reproducing.

Scientists have wondered, then, whether many of the Earth-like planets discovered in recent years could possibly harbor life. Many of these planets revolve around stars known as M and F stars that emit intense UVC radiation, especially during solar flares.

"After the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, which can see extremely far into space, the excitement shifted from finding life on Mars to these exoplanets," Sun said. "We're talking about planets that have liquid water and an atmosphere."

Sun and his graduate student at the time, Tejinder Singh, collected the lichen from the Mojave Desert near their homes in Las Vegas. They then placed it next to a UVC lamp in a controlled laboratory setting for 3 months straight. Remarkably, half of the algal cells in the lichen remained viable and replicated when rehydrated.

"In order for a microorganism to persist on a planet, it has to last longer than a day," Sun said. "So, our experiment had to be long enough to be ecologically significant. We also wanted to go beyond just activity and demonstrate viability."

To explore how this was chemically possible, Sun teamed up with chemists from the University of Nevada, Reno. They conducted two experiments that demonstrated how lichen acids are the natural world's equivalent of the additives used to make plastics UV-resistant.

They investigated the lichen's protective layer by cutting a cross-section of it and found that the top layer was darker, like a human's suntan. Lichen is composed of algae or cyanobacteria living symbiotically with fungi; when the algal cells were separated from the fungi and protective layer, exposure to the same UVC radiation killed the cells in less than a minute.

The discovery that lichen has evolved this protective layer to UVC radiation was surprising, Sun said, because it isn't necessary for their survival. Earth's atmosphere was already filtering out UVC rays by the time lichen appeared, so the protection is a mere bonus thanks to their remarkable UVA and UVB protection.

Some of the damage that occurs from exposure to intense solar radiation is the result of chemical reactions with the atmosphere, particularly the production of ozone when oxygen, nitric oxide, and UV radiation interact. To test the lichen's protection under different atmospheric conditions, the researchers placed it in an oxygen-free box with the UVC light and found that the radiation damage was further reduced.

"We came to the conclusion that the lichen's top layer - a less than millimeter thick skin, if you will - assures that all the cells below are protected from radiation. This layer acts as a photo stabilizer and even protects the cells from harmful chemical reactions caused by the radiation, including reactive oxygen."

The study offers evidence that planets beyond Earth, and beyond our solar system, may be inhabitable. In fact, "they may be teeming with colonial microorganisms that, like the lichens in the Mojave Desert, are 'tanned' and virtually immune to UVC stress," the researchers write.

"This work reveals the extraordinary tenacity of life even under the harshest conditions, a reminder that life, once sparked, strives to endure," said Tejinder Singh, who led the study with Sun and is now at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. "In exploring these limits, we inch closer to understanding where life might be possible beyond this planet we call home."

The staff break rooms within federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health may soon get a lot less interesting. According to a report from Axios, the Trump administration has canceled funding and contracts to Springer Nature, including payments for subscriptions to the company's publications, which include the magazine Scientific American and prominent peer-reviewed research journals under the Nature portfolio.

Per Axios, the total contract cuts amount to millions worth of funding for Springer Nature. According to data compiled via USA Spending, the open data source of federal spending information, Springer Nature currently has 19 active contracts with federal agencies, including a $5.2 million contract to provide subscriptions to the company's portfolios of journals. Springer Nature declined to comment when contacted by Gizmodo.

Trump's attack on Springer shouldn't come as too much of a shock. Earlier this year, the Department of Justice sent letters to medical journals for being “partisan” in the eyes of the administration, in part for promoting “woke” science, like saying climate change is real or that trans people exist. Prior reports indicated that CHEST, a peer-reviewed publication on pulmonary care published by the American College of Chest Physicians, as well as several other publications, received threatening letters accusing them of publishing work influenced by “advertisement (under postal code) or sponsorship (under relevant fraud regulations).”

Springer received a letter as well, per Axios. In addition to questioning the editorial practices of the publisher, it also alleged that Springer had ties to China and was censoring information at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party. Around the same time, Donald Trump Jr. called for the Department of Government Efficiency to end contracts with Springer Nature because it “pushed gender insanity.”

Attacking Springer for publishing legitimate research that doesn't match the preferred positions of the administration is a pretty terrible reason to cut off access to the information provided by the company's wealth of journals. But Springer is not without its issues. In 2017, the company was accused of restricting access to some research in China, and has issued tons of retractions of research in recent years due to issues with its peer-review process.

For what it's worth, most of those threatening letters from the DOJ were signed by then US Attorney Ed Martin, who also threatened to investigate people who criticized Elon Musk and threatened to pull Wikipedia's nonprofit status. Martin resigned from that role last month (and handed over the reins to Fox News host Jeanine Pirro of all people). Not much has come from those threats thus far, though they undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the publishers that received them, as any legal challenge from the government would surely be drawn out and expensive.

The latest artificial intelligence models are not only remarkably good at software engineering—new research shows they are getting ever-better at finding bugs in software, too.

AI researchers at UC Berkeley tested how well the latest AI models and agents could find vulnerabilities in 188 large open source codebases. Using a new benchmark called CyberGym, the AI models identified 17 new bugs including 15 previously unknown, or “zero-day,” ones. “Many of these vulnerabilities are critical,” says Dawn Song, a professor at UC Berkeley who led the work.

Many experts expect AI models to become formidable cybersecurity weapons. An AI tool from startup Xbow currently has crept up the ranks of HackerOne's leaderboard for bug hunting and currently sits in top place. The company recently announced $75 million in new funding.

Song says that the coding skills of the latest AI models combined with improving reasoning abilities are starting to change the cybersecurity landscape. “This is a pivotal moment,” she says. “It actually exceeded our general expectations.”

As the models continue to improve they will automate the process of both discovering and exploiting security flaws. This could help companies keep their software safe but may also aid hackers in breaking into systems. “We didn't even try that hard,” Song says. “If we ramped up on the budget, allowed the agents to run for longer, they could do even better.”

The UC Berkeley team tested conventional frontier AI models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, as well as open source offerings from Meta, DeepSeek, and Alibaba combined with several agents for finding bugs, including OpenHands, Cybench, and EnIGMA.

The researchers used descriptions of known software vulnerabilities from the 188 software projects. They then fed the descriptions to the cybersecurity agents powered by frontier AI models to see if they could identify the same flaws for themselves by analyzing new codebases, running tests, and crafting proof-of-concept exploits. The team also asked the agents to hunt for new vulnerabilities in the codebases by themselves.

Through the process, the AI tools generated hundreds of proof-of-concept exploits, and of these exploits the researchers identified 15 previously unseen vulnerabilities and two vulnerabilities that had previously been disclosed and patched. The work adds to growing evidence that AI can automate the discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities, which are potentially dangerous (and valuable) because they may provide a way to hack live systems.

AI seems destined to become an important part of the cybersecurity industry nonetheless. Security expert Sean Heelan recently discovered a zero-day flaw in the widely used Linux kernel with help from OpenAI's reasoning model o3. Last November, Google announced that it had discovered a previously unknown software vulnerability using AI through a program called Project Zero.

Like other parts of the software industry, many cybersecurity firms are enamored with the potential of AI. The new work indeed shows that AI can routinely find new flaws, but it also highlights remaining limitations with the technology. The AI systems were unable to find most flaws and were stumped by especially complex ones.

“The work is fantastic,” says Katie Moussouris, founder and CEO of Luta Security, in part because it shows that AI is still no match for human expertise—the best of the model and agent combination (Claude and and OpenHands) were only able to find around 2 percent of the vulnerabilities. “Don't replace your human bug hunters yet,” Moussouris says.

Moussouris says she is less worried about AI hacking software than companies investing too much in AI at the expense of other techniques.

Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, an associate professor at New York University Tandon and a researcher at Xbow, says the new work shows realistic zero-day discovery across a relatively large amount of code using a wide range of AI-powered tasks.

Dolan-Gavitt says he expects AI to drive an uptick in attacks involving zero-day exploits. “That's rare right now, because there are very few people who have the expertise to find new vulnerabilities and build exploits for them,” he says.

“I think the agentic stuff is fascinating for zero-day discoveries,” says Hayden Smith, a cofounder of Hunted Labs, a startup that provides various tools including some incorporating AI for analyzing code for weaknesses. Smith adds that as it becomes possible for more people to discover vulnerabilities with AI it will be more important to ensure that those vulnerabilities are disclosed responsibly.

In work posted online in May, Song and other researchers measured the capacity for AI models to find bugs that earned cash payouts through bug-bounty rewards. The effort showed that these tools could potentially earn tens of thousands of dollars. Claude Code, from Anthropic, was most successful, finding bugs worth $1,350 on bug bounty boards and designing patches for vulnerabilities worth $13,862 for a cost of a few hundred dollars in API calls.

In a blog post in April, Song and several other AI security experts warn that steadily improving models are likely to benefit attackers over defenders in the near future. This could make it especially important to closely track how capable these tools are becoming. To this end, Song and other researchers have also established the AI Frontiers CyberSecurity Observatory, a collaborative effort that will track the capabilities of different AI models and tools through several benchmarks. Among all the AI risk domains, cybersecurity is going to be one of the first that could become a major problem, Song says.

Since it began its science operations in July 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has been probing the atmospheres of alien planets to study their potential for habitability. For the first time, however, Webb has discovered its own exoplanet, finding a young system hidden in a swirling cloud of dust and debris.

Webb has captured a previously unseen exoplanet, the lightest planet imaged so far—an accomplishment made possible by the space-based telescope's advanced capabilities. The recent discovery, detailed in a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, marks Webb's first discovery of an exoplanet and opens up a new window into hidden, Saturn-like worlds.

“The planets are much fainter by orders of magnitudes than their parent stars, and seen from Earth or from JWST, they are angularly very close to them,” Anne-Marie Lagrange, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and lead author of the paper, told Gizmodo. “Hence, when looking at a planet we see only the star.” In order to overcome this issue, the team behind the new discovery used a coronagraph—a telescopic attachment for Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument. The coronagraph recreates the effect of a solar eclipse, blocking the light from a star to make its surroundings more visible.

Using the coronagraph, the scientists spotted a young planetary system that's only a few million years old. The system, named TWA 7, has three distinct rings, one of which is especially narrow while being surrounded by two areas that hold almost no matter. In Webb's image, something lies within the heart of the narrow ring, which the scientists behind the study concluded is an exoplanet.

The newly discovered exoplanet, dubbed TWA 7b, is more massive than Neptune but around 30% less massive than Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system. TWA 7b, designated a sub-Jupiter, has a mass similar to that of Saturn's and orbits around a star that formed approximately 6.4 million years ago. The planet maintains a large distance of 52 astronomical units (in which 1 au is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun) from its star.

“It is also the first planet explaining gaps in a disk,” Lagrange said. “It is unique to explain disk-planet interactions during the early phases of planetary systems.” Planets form from the material leftover from the birth of a star, which create a swirling disk of matter. Previous observations of these protoplanetary disks has revealed ring-like structures and gaps, which were believed to be signatures of unseen planets. So far, there were no direct observations of those planets. The mass and orbital features of TWA 7b, however, match the predicted properties of an exoplanet that may have formed in the gap between the first and second ring of the disk.

By using Webb to observe young, faint planets, scientists have unlocked a new doorway into the discovery of alien worlds. “In terms of imaging, it opens the possibility to image Saturn-like planets. In further steps, it will allow us to characterize the atmosphere of Saturn-like, non irradiated planets,” Lagrange said. “It is a big step. It helps us knowing what is complicated when searching for very light planets.”

First came AlphaFold. Now comes AlphaGenome for DNA.

When scientists first sequenced the human genome in 2003, they revealed the full set of DNA instructions that make a person. But we still didn't know what all those 3 billion genetic letters actually do. 

Now Google's DeepMind division says it's made a leap in trying to understand the code with AlphaGenome, an AI model that predicts what effects small changes in DNA will have on an array of molecular processes, such as whether a gene's activity will go up or down. It's just the sort of question biologists regularly assess in lab experiments.

“We have, for the first time, created a single model that unifies many different challenges that come with understanding the genome,” says Pushmeet Kohli, a vice president for research at DeepMind.

Five years ago, the Google AI division released AlphaFold, a technology for predicting the 3D shape of proteins. That work was honored with a Nobel Prize last year and spawned a drug-discovery spinout, Isomorphic Labs, and a boom of companies that hope AI will be able to propose new drugs.

AlphaGenome is an attempt to further smooth biologists' work by answering basic questions about how changing DNA letters alters gene activity and, eventually, how genetic mutations affect our health. 

“We have these 3 billion letters of DNA that make up a human genome, but every person is slightly different, and we don't fully understand what those differences do,” says Caleb Lareau, a computational biologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who has had early access to AlphaGenome. “This is the most powerful tool to date to model that.”

Google says AlphaGenome will be free for noncommercial users and plans to release full details of the model in the future. According to Kohli, the company is exploring ways to “enable use of this model by commercial entities” such as biotech companies. 

The research represents a shift in how we may predict the weather.

Lareau says AlphaGenome will allow certain types of experiments now done in the lab to be carried out virtually, on a computer. For instance, studies of people who've donated their DNA for research often turn up thousands of genetic differences, each slightly raising or lowering the chance a person gets a disease such as Alzheimer's.

Lareau says DeepMind's software could be used to quickly make predictions about how each of those variants works at a molecular level, something that would otherwise require time-consuming lab experiments. “You'll get this list of gene variants, but then I want to understand which of those are actually doing something, and where can I intervene,” he says. “This system pushes us closer to a good first guess about what any variant will be doing when we observe it in a human.”

Don't expect AlphaGenome to predict very much about individual people, however. It offers clues to nitty-gritty molecular details of gene activity, not 23andMe-type revelations of a person's traits or ancestry. 

“We haven't designed or validated AlphaGenome for personal genome prediction, a known challenge for AI models,” Google said in a statement.

Underlying the AI system is the so-called transformer architecture invented at Google that also powers large language models like GPT-4. This one was trained on troves of experimental data produced by public scientific projects.

Lareau says the system will not broadly change how his lab works day to day but could permit new types of research. For instance, sometimes doctors encounter patients with ultra-rare cancers, bristling with unfamiliar mutations. AlphaGenome could suggest which of those mutations are really causing the root problem, possibly pointing to a treatment.

“A hallmark of cancer is that specific mutations in DNA make the wrong genes express in the wrong context,” says Julien Gagneur, a professor of computational medicine at the Technical University of Munich. “This type of tool is instrumental in narrowing down which ones mess up proper gene expression.” 

The same approach could apply to patients with rare genetic disease, many of whom never learn the source of their condition, even if their DNA has been decoded. “We can obtain their genomes, but we are clueless as to which genetic alterations cause the disease,” says Gagneur. He thinks AlphaGenome could give medical scientists a new way to diagnose such cases. 

Eventually, some researchers aspire to use AI to design entire genomes from the ground up and create new life forms. Others think the models will be used to create a fully virtual laboratory for drug studies. “My dream would be to simulate a virtual cell,” Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, said this year. 

Kohli calls AlphaGenome a “milestone” on the road to that kind of system. “AlphaGenome may not model the whole cell in its entirety … but it's starting to sort of shed light on the broader semantics of DNA,” he says. 

Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

The multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI. 

The stigmatized idea could get a massive boost from “tech bros”—and some scientists are cheering them on.

Montana just passed a new bill backed by longevity enthusiasts that will enable access to drugs and therapies that are not approved by the FDA.

User interaction is required, but impact could be severe

A significant security exploit in WinRAR, the popular file archiver software, was recently reported via Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative. The directory traversal vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-6218 is said to take advantage of how a file compression tool handles directory paths within archive files, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by creating and distributing malicious archives.

Discovered by independent researcher ‘whs3-detonator,' the vulnerability allows an attacker to run harmful code on a victim's computer. Although user interaction is necessary for the attack to be successful, the attacker can essentially manipulate the file paths handled by WinRAR during extraction. By doing so, they can trick the software to place files outside the intended folder, allowing potential access to restricted system directories.

The vulnerability gets a 7.8/10 score on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) which is a standardized framework for assessing and rating the severity of security vulnerabilities. Meaning this vulnerability poses a high risk to confidentiality, as it can expose sensitive data, manipulate system files, and even make a system completely unusable.

RARLAB, the company behind WinRAR and the RAR file format has thankfully patched the vulnerability in its latest beta release. According to the patch notes, WinRAR v7.11 (and earlier) as well as Windows versions of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code and UnRAR.dll are all at risk, while Unix versions of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code, UnRAR library, and RAR for Android, are unaffected. Users are strongly advised to manually update to the latest WinRAR 7.12 Beta 1 release to protect their systems against the CVE-2025-6218 vulnerability.

Given its massive user base of over 500 million users worldwide, WinRAR vulnerabilities are frequently targeted and exploited by a wide range of threat actors. Back in April, we reported an issue that enabled the software to execute without the Windows Mark of the Web (MotW) security pop-up. This is the same Windows alert that warns users against running untrusted software downloaded from the internet. Fortunately, this issue was addressed via the official release notes for WinRAR version 7.11 confirming a patch for the vulnerability and additional technical details about the fix.

We're a month away from the arrival of the next Marvel movie in Fantastic Four: First Steps, and Marvel is reminding us in style with a brand new trailer—one that really wants you to feel the stakes that are riding on this movie, in more ways than one.

Prior looks at First Steps leaned into the Silver Age retro-kitsch of its world, and then the arrival of Julia Garner's Silver Surfer to herald the threat of the dread, Galactus. But now this final big trailer for the film really wants to remind us that we kind of already have an inkling how this might go down for the Fantastic Four. And that the arrival of Ralph Ineson's devourer of worlds is very grave news indeed.

Because yes, hanging over the threat of Galactus' arrival on this particular Earth in Marvel's multiverse, we know that, thanks to the set up at the end of Thunderbolts, at some point the Fantastic Four have to make their way from this reality to the prime reality of the MCU. Whether they'll have done so after beating back Galactus successfully, or whether they're looking to other realities in the hope they might be able to help find a new home, remains to be seen. Or maybe we should believe Kevin Feige and that ship is not at all related to this version of the Fantastic Four!

However it goes, things are going to get quite dire for Richards family and their friends before all that—we'll find out how dire when Fantastic Four: First Steps hits theaters in one month, on July 25.

The axe swings.

Intel has begun cutting jobs in California as part of its cost-cutting and restructuring strategy introduced by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The move comes two months after Tan warned that staff reductions were unavoidable and that 15% - 20% of the company's staff would be laid off. Officially, Intel is eliminating excessive management layers, but a CRN report indicates that the company is surprisingly laying off chip design engineers and architects. Additionally, the company is shutting down its automotive chip division, according to Oregon Live.

Among the job categories being eliminated are 22 physical design engineers, three physical design engineering managers, and several logic and product development engineers. The company is also removing roles such as cloud software architects and engineering managers, in addition to positions tied to business and project management, including a vice president of IT and multiple technology strategy leads. Employees in California are engaged in the development of CPU and GPU products.

According to a notification submitted to the state, 107 employees based at Intel's Santa Clara headquarters will be laid off. The filing complies with California's WARN Act, which requires disclosure when 50 or more workers are affected within a 30-day period. The layoffs are scheduled to begin on July 15. Impacted employees have been given either a 60-day notice or a shorter four-week notice, paired with nine weeks of compensation and benefits. 

Intel is also exiting the automotive chip market. The division, which operated within the Client Computing Group, will be shut down. Intel's automotive business is based in Munich, Germany, leveraging its proximity to major European automakers and suppliers. As of 2024 – 2025, the unit is (or was?) led by Jack Weast, a longtime Intel veteran, Intel fellow, and former VP at Mobileye. To succeed in developing platforms for software-defined vehicles, Intel's automotive unit had autonomy over product strategy and customer engagement. Most employees in that unit are expected to lose their jobs as the company shifts focus to its core offerings in client and data center solutions. 

The cuts are part of Intel's larger effort to eliminate layers of bureaucracy and improve execution speed. In an internal communication from April, Tan highlighted a shift in performance measurement, criticizing a past practice where leadership success was tied to the size of one's team. He stated that going forward, efficiency and impact with smaller teams will be Intel's way of operation. 

"I have been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams," Lip-Bu Tan wrote in a letter to employees back in April. "Going forward, this will not be the case. I am a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities." 

Tan emphasized that leadership would be responsible for determining how best to align personnel changes with the company's strategic priorities, which include laying off 15% to 20% of its personnel. Earlier this month, it turned out that the company will lay off 15% to 20% of its fab staff as well as outsource a significant portion of marketing operations to Accenture, which is projected to use AI to communicate with Intel customers.

Nearly a year after raising a mega seed round of $50 million, e-commerce veteran Julie Bornstein's startup Daydream is releasing its AI-powered chatbot for shopping with a focus on fashion.

After testing the product with select users, the company is today releasing the chatbot to all users in a public beta. People can sign up for the chatbot, which will ask them their name, birthdate, price range they shop in, and brand preferences, if any. 

You can type a query like “I want a dress to wear to the wedding this summer in Paris” or upload an image and add more context through text to search for a clothing item. 

Users can save any item to a collection they create or refine their search by typing in the chatbot on the left-hand side. If they like an item but want to modify some aspects, like colors or style, they can tap on the “Say More” button visible on any of the items to edit the search.

Based on the parameters users provided during onboarding and feedback the app gets from them, it saves different items. Daydream creates a style passport for them that drives a lot of suggestions. The web app also shows you daily inspiration for items and accessories that possibly match your taste. 

Right now, Daydream doesn't have an integrated checkout flow, so when a user clicks on an item, they are redirected to a merchant's website to complete a transaction. The startup is taking a percentage cut out of each sale. Daydream said that at launch, it has more than 8,000 brands on the platform, with the company onboarding new merchants free of cost.  

Bornstein, who has held executive positions at companies like Nordstrom, Urban Outfitters, Sephora, and Stitch Fix, said that in the past year, the company was working on technology to bring a catalog of different brands to one place and revamp search to suit AI.

“Having worked in e-commerce my whole career, search has always been the forgotten child, and it never worked very well. In some ways, people were trained to just be very narrow in the way that they search for anything in the fashion world. And even with my prior startup, we couldn't get people to go beyond something like ‘a red dress, ‘” Bornstien told TechCrunch over a call.

“But once Chat GPT launched, you know, consumers started to get trained on how to think about the potential of prompting. And so what we're trying to do is help allow you to ask whatever it is you wanna ask, whether it's I have an occasion, or I have this need, or I'm looking for this very specific kind of thing,” she said.

Maria Belousova, who joined the company this year as CTO, said that Daydream did a lot of work on understanding the nuances of items in the catalog. She said that traditional search only showed shoppers items based on tags matching their keywords, which doesn't work in today's world, where customers are asking longer queries.

“We are doing quite a bit to understand the details of the product, such as knowing stylistic attributes like embellishments, silhouette, or even social attributes like who would wear this dress, such as a bride or a guest in a wedding. We are also using image visual recognition to satisfy detailed queries where a customer describes the exact product they want,” Belousova said.

Over the next year, Daydream will allow users to give the tool more explicit feedback, like “Don't show me any four-inch heels.” It also plans to experiment with a feature that will allow users to ask for a good match with an existing item with personalized suggestions. Plus, it wants to lean into the aspect of social sharing by letting users share their saved items with friends and family for suggestions to buy. Another feature that Daydream is thinking about is to take an existing collection of another user and modify it for their own needs using AI.

While Daydream's team has years of e-commerce experience and focuses on fashion, startups like Deft and Cherry are also building multimodal search for shopping. Meanwhile, tech giants like Amazon and Google are focusing on features that use AI to search multiple sites and find the right item for users.

Satellites can accomplish incredible tasks like provide internet, or help monitor wildfires. But many of them ultimately meet a fiery death burning up in the Earth's atmosphere. Others use their last bit of fuel to move to so-called “graveyard” orbits, where they circle the planet in a perpetual deep freeze.

A new startup called Lux Aeterna wants to change this. The Denver-based company, which is coming out of stealth today, has designed a reusable satellite called Delphi that it aims to launch — and land — in 2027.

If successful, it could help slash the cost to get satellite payloads into space. It would also make the process far more flexible than it is today, since satellites are designed to stay in orbit for years and essentially can't be modified for other uses.

These attributes have already piqued the interest of the Department of Defense, which has made low-Earth orbit an important part of the United States' military strategy. 

Venture capitalists have also taken notice — and written checks. The startup's pitch was attractive enough to generate $4 million in pre-seed funding, led by Space Capital and including other early-stage funds like Dynamo Ventures and Mission One Capital.

Founder and CEO Brian Taylor said the idea for Lux Aeterna came to him last year while he watched his former employer, SpaceX, launch one of its Starship test vehicles into space. 

“I want to fill Starship with something amazing, and something that changes the entire industry,” Taylor recalled thinking during an interview with TechCrunch. 

Starship is the biggest rocket ever built. As part of that, it has the potential to send larger payloads into space than was previously possible. Size matters for people who build satellites and other spacecraft, since they're often working backwards from the simple constraint of what can fit inside a rocket's cargo area. And Starship is not alone — there are other heavy-lift rockets in the works, too, like Blue Origin's New Glenn. 

It's hard to design a satellite that can survive the brutal forces of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere at high speeds. But with the extra space afforded by heavy-lift rockets, Taylor said it's possible to build one that can survive multiple re-entries without having to compromise on the technology because of cost or weight tradeoffs.

In the case of Lux Aeterna, that means using a heat shield. In the rendering the startup released Wednesday, the Delphi satellite's conical heat shield is reminiscent of the ones that protected some of NASA's most famous spacecraft.

There's a reason for that, according to Taylor: Those designs worked. 

“We definitely looked at what NASA had done in the past on exploratory missions [and] sample return missions, and that really helped justify the architecture that we've gone with,” he said. “I think it's very important, when you're doing something ambitious like this, that you're not reinventing the wheel on everything, right?”

Taylor declined to get into further specifics about how the Delphi satellite will work, or how Lux Aeterna will refurbish the craft between launches. (The design appears to involve the ability to fold the satellite bus structure so that it fits safely behind the heat shield.) 

To be sure, he has plenty of experience in the satellite world. In addition to working on Starlink at SpaceX, Taylor also worked on Amazon's Kuiper satellite program, and at space infrastructure startup Loft Orbital. 

The plan for Delphi is to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2027, perform a full orbital flight, and then come back down to Earth. Then Lux Aeterna wants to do that all over again to prove out Delphi's reusability.

From there, Taylor said his team is working on a larger production vehicle that will demonstrate far greater reusability. 

Despite decades of spaceflight innovation, Taylor said he believes the industry is still very young, which leaves plenty of opportunity for a company like Lux Aeterna to establish a long-running business. 

“It's not to the maturity level of [computer] chips. It's not at the maturity level of automotive,” he said. Satellite reusability will help change that. And while Taylor is committed to that cause, he said he's thrilled about all the things he can't imagine that will exist in a space-based economy. 

“We don't know what we don't know is going to come,” he said. “That's probably the most exciting part.”

Full finalized spec released.

The HDMI Forum has officially finalized HDMI 2.2, the next generation of the video standard, rolling out to devices throughout the rest of this year. We already saw a bunch of key announcements at CES in January, but now that the full spec is here, it's confirmed that HDMI 2.2 will eclipse DisplayPort in maximum bandwidth support thanks to the new Ultra96 cables.

The key improvement with HDMI 2.2 over its predecessor, HDMI 2.1, is the bump in bandwidth from 48 GB/s to 96 GB/s. In order to ensure a consistent experience across all HDMI 2.2 devices, you'll be seeing new HDMI cables with an "Ultra96" label denoting the aforementioned transfer rate capability. These cables will be certified by the HDMI Forum with clear branding that should make them easy to identify.



This new bandwidth unlocks 16K resolution support at 60 Hz and 12K at 120 Hz, but with chroma subsampling. That being said, you can expect 4K 240 Hz at up to 12-bit color depth without any compression. DisplayPort 2.1b UHBR 20 was the first to do this with some monitors already available on the market, but that standard is limited to only 80 GB/s and HDMI 2.2 edges it by just a bit, which allows for even uncompressed 8K at 60 Hz.

It's important to keep in mind that only cables explicitly labeled Ultra96 can allow for all this video goodness. As always, the HDMI Forum will allow manufacturers to make the claim that their devices are HDMI 2.2 compliant, but without actually enforcing the bandwidth rule. Therefore, it's important to look for the Ultra96 label so you know you're getting the real deal.



Thankfully, though, if you don't care about the super high resolutions or frame rates, HDMI 2.2 will be backwards compatible. That means you can use the new cables with older ports (or new ports with older cables) and get the lowest common denominator experience. For instance, if you plug an HDMI 2.2 Ultra96 cable in a TV with only HDMI 2.1 support, you should still get HDMI 2.1 features and speeds without any issues.

Apart from backwards compatibility, HDMI 2.2 will bring another comfort feature called "Latency Indication Protocol" (LIP) that will help with syncing audio and video together. This only really matters for large, complicated home theater setups incorporating a lot of speaker channels with receivers and projectors (or screens). If you're part of the crowd, expect reduced lip-sync issues across the board.

The first HDMI 2.2 devices will likely start to roll around toward the last quarter of the year, with AMD's upcoming UDNA GPUs rumored to be among the first to adopt the standard. Little is known about the next-gen Radeon cards, but an earlier leak pointed to limited HDMI 2.2 support for UDNA that would restrict the maximum bandwidth on most models.

As it stands right now, AMD's Radeon Pro cards are the only ones that support the full DisplayPort 2.1b UHBR20 standard, with the RX 9000 series being limited to only 54 GB/s (down from the 80 GB/s maximum). It remains to be seen if AMD pulls something similar with UDNA and only offers the full HDMI 2.2 bandwidth with their workstation GPUs.

If you're looking for a premium laptop, this early Prime Day deal on the Dell Inspiron 15-inch touchscreen laptop is one you won't want to miss – and it's open to both Prime and non-Prime members.

Amazon has bundled this powerful (i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) machine with a set of high-value accessories including a lifetime subscription to Microsoft Office Pro, a USB drive, a mouse, and a 7-in-1 USB hub. The regular retail price is $2,599 but with this limited-time offer, you can have the laptop for just $879. That's already a massive $1,720 savings but here is the best part: with the free accessories tossed in, the effective price is even lower. Subtract the value of the included items ($299), and you're essentially paying $580 for the laptop itself.

This is probably the most impressive part of this laptop: It comes with an Intel 10-core i7-1355U processor which features a clock speed of up to 5.00 GHz, 12 threads, and 12 MB cache. This powerhouse (never seen at such a price) provides effortless multitasking and lag-free performance for even the most demanding business applications.

The 15.6-inch FHD anti-glare touchscreen display offers sharp visuals at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 which is perfect for presentations, design work, and video playback. The anti-glare coating reduces eye strain during long working hours. It's definitely the most beautiful screen you can expect for such a price.

This Dell laptop is also equipped with 32 GB of DDR4 RAM and a spacious 1 TB SSD. This combination gives you ample storage for all your valuable files without needing to worry about falling short of storage. The high-speed SSD gives you faster booting and improved overall system performance. It also comes with a variety of ports including USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A and Type-C, USB 2.0, an SD card reader, HDMI 1.4, and a headset jack.

On the software side, the laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro. The incentive of a lifetime license of Microsoft Office Pro is a huge bonus and provides you with the essential productivity apps (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and more) right out of the box.

This deal is an opportunity to pick up a Dell at a price that makes last year's Prime Day offers pale in comparison.

Dual-tower, quad-fan performance on a budget.

Chinese PC cooling solutions manufacturer Jiushark has come up with one of the beefiest CPU air coolers that we have seen in a long time. The latest JF15K Diamond incorporates a wide dual-tower heatsink design that can accommodate four cooling fans, six heat-pipes, and a cooling capability of up to 280W.

In case you haven't heard of the brand, we don't blame you. Jiushark is predominantly active in Asian countries and doesn't have a strong presence in the U.S. However, you may remember that the company launched the JF13K Diamond air cooler, which we tested a couple of years ago, featuring a one of a kind top-down airflow design with a 240mm heatsink and dual 120mm slims fans at just $40. This was soon followed by the JF13K Diamond Mini, a smaller version offering a similar design but with smaller 100mm fans with standard thickness.

The new JF15K Diamond turns the dial up a notch with a familiar tower cooler design but with a twist. The heatsinks are so wide that the cooler nearly spans the entire width of a standard motherboard. Think of it as two dual-tower air coolers fused into one massive unit. Notably, the cooler has a height of 153 mm, which means it should fit in most mid-tower and large sized cases without any issues. Additionally, the cooler offers up to 53mm of clearance for memory modules.

As mentioned, the cooler comes with four 100mm PWM fans that are said to operate at speeds ranging from 1,000 to 2,700 RPM ± 10% and 19.49 to 55.46CFM. The fans are also fairly quiet, as the company notes noise values of 19.3 to 30.4dBA. The cooler supports modern Intel and AMD sockets, and is being offered in white and black color variants. Additionally, the JF15K Diamond comes with two ARGB light bars integrated at the top, sitting right above the heatsinks. A standard variant in black will also be available for those who don't fancy ARGB lighting.

The Jiushark JF15K Diamond is currently available via various ecommerce platforms with the black ARGB and white ARGB versions having an MSRP of 280 Yuan ($39), with certain discounts bringing the price down to 260 Yuan ($36.25).

When you think of space exploration and watches, one name immediately comes to mind: Omega. Since its Speedmaster chronograph was selected by NASA half a century ago it has become synonymous with space travel. The timing of a 13-second engine burn to save Apollo 13 cemented its role in space history, and Omega has not missed a single opportunity to deepen the partnership, from officially naming it the Moonwatch to creating endless commemorative limited editions (even if it is by no means the only watch that's left our planet.)

Now, with private spaceflight proliferating and manned missions to the Moon back on NASA's agenda, a Californian start-up wants to establish a new standard for space watches. Barrelhand, whose watches draw on expertise in 3D printing and materials science, says that its Monolith will be the only watch purpose-built for space exploration.

“Space is the harshest environment we've ever gone to,” says founder Karel Bachand. “When we first did it 50 years ago, there were no tools for it. NASA just tried to find off-the-shelf watches that were the best available. When the Speedmaster was selected it was never designed with space in mind, it just happened to pass the tests better than others. There was still plenty of room for improvement.”

Bachand says that even during testing, NASA's engineers flagged that the Speedmaster's accuracy suffered under extreme temperatures or acceleration, and there were other known issues, too. “Lume was flaking off,” says Bachand, “or the strap was getting caked up with moon dust, because it's Velcro. There are tons of opportunities for improvements, but in the last 50 years, there's been no innovation, especially for such a key tool that's life or death in space exploration.”

Omega would say that its Speedmaster Skywalker X-33 model, which has been tested and qualified for use in space by the European Space Agency, is the modern answer to the Speedmaster. But it has some shortcomings—for instance, it is not certified for EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity).

“The X-33 was a great step forward”, says Bachand, “But is only rated for Intra-Vehicular Activity use due to the electronics on board. The liquid crystal display would essentially freeze up on a spacewalk. You need mechanical performance; something that can keep track of time when all other systems fail.”

Quartz watches such as the X-33 would also be vulnerable to the higher levels of radiation in outer space, which can damage various electronic components. A mechanical watch has no such trouble, but needs to be able to function in a more extreme range of temperatures than it would ever face on earth.

The Monolith case is 3D printed from an alloy of scandium, aluminum and magnesium usually used in aerospace components.

The Monolith, which is still in its prototype stage, uses a modified Sellita SW300-1b movement. Chosen for its rugged nature and ease of service, the movement has been upgraded by Barrelhand for improved magnetic resistance, shock resistance and daily accuracy of +/- four seconds.

Bachand, who has a degree in mechanical engineering as well as experience designing clinostat machinery (devices used to study the effects of microgravity on lifeforms) for NASA, founded Barrelhand in 2014. The company produced its first watch, the Project One, in 2020; listed as one of 20 semifinalists for the LVMH Watch Prize, it was a showcase for the 3D-printed construction that is at the heart of the Monolith design.

Bachand, who says that engineering for extreme temperature is the single hardest challenge to overcome, is evangelical about the potential for additive manufacturing to solve this, and other problems. By designing a case with an air pocket within its walls, Bachand was able to construct an insulating layer that allows the Monolith to work between the staggeringly inhospitable temperature range between -120°C (-184°F) and +120°C (248°F).

It has also allowed Barrelhand to work with high-performance materials: the Monolith case is printed from something called “scalmalloy”, an alloy of scandium, aluminum and magnesium that's usually used in small-scale aerospace components.

“We get the same strength specs as titanium for half the weight, which is insane” says Bachand, “The watch weighs around one ounce—about 32 to 33 grams. We're not designing it to be an ultralight watch, but for space exploration, every gram counts. To send one kilogram to the moon right now costs about $1.4m—so if you can shave a couple of grams off, it makes a difference.”

Barrelhand's first watch was the Project One, released in 2020

While EVA use might be the most extreme scenario, Bachand says there is also an enormous amount of innovation required to make a watch that's genuinely suited for use within the ISS or other spacecraft. He has given the Monolith a shatter-proof crystal that dents under impact, for example, to avoid “floating shrapnel.” The movement screws have been redesigned to make the watch serviceable with standard tools already found on the space station.

Bachand even threw out the industry-standard rubber gaskets used to seal a watch case against water. “That will start to degrade below -40°C,” he says. “We looked at the airlocks for the ISS and found a partner that can make an O-ring seal with a similar chemical makeup—an aerospace grade fluorosilicone that won't get brittle when it freezes.”

Every single component has been considered for properties that wouldn't even be considered on Earth—such as the phenomenon of “outgassing”, the emission of absorbed gases into the surrounding atmosphere. “If you've ever opened up a plastic product off Amazon you'll remember being greeted by a harsh chemical smell, commonly known as VOCs [volatile organic compounds]. On Earth, we can just crack open a window and air it out, but the ISS does not have that luxury,” says Bachand, explaining why the Monolith uses only materials that don't emit VOCs.

As well as reimagining the idea of a space-going watch, Barrelhand says that in the process (more or less by default) it will create a tool watch that can cope with anything on Earth. For instance, the Monolith is pressure-tested to depths of 580 meters. Bachand says that here, too, the use of 3D printing is key, and that, slowly, they are changing perceptions of a technology generally only associated with design prototyping.

“We used Project One as a research platform to test new metal 3D printing. For watches, it's kind of the holy grail of engineering: It's super small and super precise,” says Bachand. “If you can make a movement bridge, you've really shown the maturity of the technology. When I show that [to watchmakers], it's exciting for them.”

Nevertheless, the end goal is to see the Monolith used in space—and that may prove to be a challenge that goes beyond pure engineering ability. Bachand says that submitting equipment to NASA is a bureaucratic, timely process, and that Omega's half-century of investment will present its own obstacles. While he follows the official route, Barrelhand is simultaneously taking a “grass roots” approach, courting individual astronauts and scientists who can potentially be more easily convinced of its merits.

“Everyone that we've spoken to really understands the mission and sees the need for it, the need for innovation and to continue improving on any tool,” says Bachand. “A lot of astronauts are watch collectors, but they're also just interested in tools and innovation. They don't always care about history or the status quo; they just want whatever's the best. When people get it in their hands and understand the specs, and the thought behind it all, I think it's going to be a no-brainer.”

What would take 38GB of VRAM to hold now takes just a measly 52KB.

Measuring the VRAM impact of trees isn't something most people think about while gaming, but AMD researchers have figured out a way to reduce the VRAM footprint of 3D tree rendering by a whopping 666,352x. AMD researchers recently developed procedural tree generation with work graphs and mesh nodes to optimize tree rendering on video memory.

To demonstrate this, the AMD researchers showcased a 3D-rendered scene that requires only 51 KiB of data to generate. If the scene were rendered with conventional geometry, it would require 34.8 GiB to hold in video memory.

AMD researcher's real-time GPU tree generation system uses work graphs (w/ mesh nodes) for procedural tree generation. Without work graphs, the trees in the scene would have required 34.8 GiB of VRAM. With work graphs, only 51 KiBhttps://t.co/2YcWdOj5Lehttps://t.co/aDkZB08tksJune 23, 2025

This new VRAM-saving technique leverages a procedural generation technique that eliminates the need for a 3D geometry format altogether. The GPU utilizes work graphs and mesh nodes to produce 3D-rendered trees on the fly in the LOD (Level of Detail) required for the current frame.

With traditional techniques, video memory would be responsible for holding the geometry or polygon format of the trees themselves, which requires gigabytes of memory to store. By procedurally generating trees on the fly on the GPU, the only important data that needs to be held in VRAM is the generation code that tells the GPU how to generate trees in a scene. This code is only kilobytes in size by comparison.

This radically new rendering technique is yet another demonstration of the capabilities of work graphs. Work graphs enable the GPU to assign work to itself, significantly improving rendering efficiency in areas that previously relied on the CPU to do the heavy lifting. Work graphs are so flexible that 3D engines can run almost entirely on the GPU when used appropriately. Mesh nodes are an extension of work graphs that allow the GPU to issue draw calls to itself. Again, this shifts work from the CPU to the GPU.

Trees aren't the only objects that can be rendered with this paradigm. We can expect other objects, and possibly even textures, to be rendered this way in the future. Nvidia is already working on neural texture compression to reduce texture demands on video memory, but work graphs and mesh nodes provide another method of achieving the same goal (and will not be limited to Nvidia GPUs).

I have been to the undying convention.

I have been pressurized in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber and bathed in flickering gamma-wave light. I have had my electromagnetic field manipulated. I have taken an IV drip of green liquid that looked nearly radioactive. I have been frozen in a cryochamber (and felt amazing afterward) and baked in a one-man, zippable sauna (I didn't). I have eaten more consecutive meals of beef than ever in my life, grinding unrefined Kalahari desert salt over the slabs of fat and protein. I have been told, after a scan, that I have the liver of a newborn baby (this is a good thing). I have caused a woman's jaw to drop by telling her I once took antibiotics. I have pumped my vaccinated fist alongside RFK Jr. fans and stem cell enthusiasts and piss-injectors to the pounding beats of Steve Aoki.

Welcome to Dave Asprey's 2025 Biohacking Conference: a symposium of tech bros, wellness influencers, psychonauts, and scientists, all hoping to thwart the ravages of time with unorthodox—and often unproven—medical treatments. The conference was held over three days in late May at the Fairmont hotel in downtown Austin, Texas. It was a vast bazaar of speakers, ideologies, practices, and gadgets, all with the express goal to help attendees “Live Beyond 180,” as goes the conference slogan, without the pesky red tape of the Western medical industry. And, while biohacking isn't new, the rise of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, which champions alternative medicine and freedom of choice over proven interventions like vaccines, has given the concept renewed zeal.

“We're tired of people saying we need permission,” Asprey, conference organizer and self-proclaimed father of biohacking, tells me on the first day of the gathering. Instead of blindly accepting pharmaceuticals, he says, this community marches to its own holistic drum.

“We take supplements that do the same thing. We figure out we don't need that drug because we got sunshine. Or maybe we just buy our pharmaceuticals from overseas without a permission slip, and we pay a tiny fraction of the outrageous things in the US.”

He claims that biohackers are at the forefront of MAHA—but that it's not about partisanship.

“We're leading the charge on making America healthy again and most biohackers are pretty much apolitical. Because having incredible energy in a sense of peace, in a sense of control of your own destiny, I don't think that's partisan.”

Biohacking is a big tent, combining Silicon Valley technology, Burning Man spirituality, and health libertarianism. If anything unites this crowd, it is a distrust of the medical status quo—particularly the pharmaceutical industry—and an appetite for tech-heavy alternatives. Think folk medicine powered by AI. The movement started gaining major traction around 13 years ago, when Asprey began organizing a loose-knit band of health fanatics at his annual conferences. But its roots arguably go back much further. “Where [biohacking] started 150 years ago,” says investor and so-called ambassador of biohacking Nick Zaldastani, “was the snake oil salespeople.” In the mid-1800s, Chinese laborers on the Transcontinental Railroad first introduced their white counterparts to the anti-inflammatory oils of the Chinese water snake. It was the inert tinctures sold by white copycats that gave rise to the pejorative “snake oil.” These charlatans, Zaldastani says, “would go around and move from city to city, because the minute people found out it did shit—sorry about the French—they were chasing after them.” The resultant struggle with medical authority, the sense of persecution, and doubts about legitimacy plague the biohackers to this day.

In these circles, autonomy is gospel. But if there is a preacher to this sermon, it is Asprey. Grinning cutouts of him greet you at the tops of escalators; his products stock the ad space in conference pamphlets. Patrons roam the halls in his signature anti-blue-light glasses, the auburn lenses making their eyes look like flies, trapped timelessly in amber. Asprey's personal goal is to live to 180 years old—“50 percent better than our current best,” he clarifies, referring to the oldest person ever recorded at 122. And he is working on it, hard. He claims to have spent $2.5 million of his multimillion dollar empire—generated largely by his Bulletproof coffee brand and diet plan—on reversing his age via a specialized diet, rigorous exercise, a torrent of supplements, countless stem cell treatments, baths in frigid ice water and shimmering red light, and injections of his own filtered urine as allergy therapy.

Whatever myriad of elixirs Asprey is using, it does, on a superficial level at least, appear to be working. At 52, he looks great, standing out in a conference awash with obvious botox and plastic surgery. In his slicked-back hair, punk leather outfits, and signature glasses, it's hard to believe the picture he paints of his former self, resembling “the 300-pound computer hacker from Jurassic Park.” He seems to have even achieved a younger man's temperament: rapping “I'm a Little Teapot” onstage; dancing shirtless and gawky before the masses during Aoki's set, surrounded by a coterie of women, one of whom attempted to flash him, unhooking her bra before being whisked offstage.

For a man desperately trying for timelessness, Asprey is certainly a man of the times—a wealthy entrepreneur at the head of a populist movement that vehemently opposes government regulation. He shares his de facto leadership of the biohacking sphere with a few other rich renegades, most notably Bryan Johnson, the venture capitalist whose Blueprint Protocol makes Asprey's centenarian goals look quaint. Johnson aims for immortality outright—“DON'T DIE” screams his own movement's slogan—and has even vampirically infused himself with his own son's blood in the quest for the fountain of youth.

Not everyone at the conference strives for Asprey-Johnsonian extremes. Then again, not everyone at the conference is in their tax bracket. Some simply want to age with grace and vim, not blunted by medication or hobbling through hospice. In a true embodiment of the conference's “Beyond” theme, some even have plans grander than this carnal plane. Attendee Joni Winston, who runs a wellness center in Costa Rica, tells me she is either 68 or 52, “depending on which calendar you use.” At age 60, she started counting backward, so that when she reaches her intended 120, she can claim the nirvanic age of 0. “I want to make as much progress in this life as I can,” Winston says, “so that when I die I can go to a different dimension and not have to deal with this 3D Matrix shit.” In the meantime, though, she'd still like to look good. “I'm not devoid of vanity. Spiritual evolution is my primary goal, but I'm still human, you know?” Others are simply afraid of the slow, painful crawl through old age and, of course, death itself. Melanie Avalon, 34, host of a biohacking podcast, tells me: “I've been haunted by the concept of aging since I was 12 ... And ever since then I've been searching for ways to stall the aging timeline ... I don't know if immortality is possible, but if there is a way to practically move toward that, it's biohacking.”

If the practice sounds inherently self-interested, that's because it is. By definition, biohacking requires profound interest—often supplemented by large investments of time, energy, and capital—in the self. A certain Ayn Randian individualism rang through the halls of the Fairmont. But there was also a highly communal, near-revolutionary air here: a fervor to spread the good word, to empower the masses, to enact a grand subversion.

“The biggest blessing of Covid might be an erosion of trust in corrupt authority,” Asprey tells me. “We have the highest health care costs in the world and one of the worst outcomes for any developed nation. So the only logical conclusion is that someone's stealing ... and we know who it is, right? It's the pharmaceutical companies.”

Since November, then, the biohackers have seen a bright new dawn. With President Donald Trump's re-election, RFK Jr.'s subsequent appointment as secretary of Health and Human Services—people here refer to him as “Bobby,” affectionately, like an old friend—and the initiation of MAHA, years of work have come to fruition. MAHA's agenda legitimizes the biohacking ethos: that we must curb the pharmaceutical industry's influence on public health policy and research, that we are all overmedicated as a result, that self-governance over health is paramount. RFK's antivax crusade has set off alarm bells across the scientific community—most recently, he gutted the Center for Disease Control's vaccine advisory committee and appointed several new vaccine skeptics, just as the US is seeing a resurgence of measles outbreaks. But for the biohackers, it is an almost mythical underdog moment. David, at last, has been armed with his sling across the pit from Goliath.

Despite the MAHA fandom, every biohacker I speak to, like Asprey, says they are apolitical. MAHA itself, they insist, is apolitical. What could possibly be partisan about wanting healthy kids? Having energy and vitality and a high quality of life? My only heated exchange over the conference's three days is with Siggi Clavien, founder of Equilibrium Labs, the company that scanned my newborn baby liver. “Preserving, progressing, and saving the health of the children of this nation—that's what MAHA is. And if you take a side on that either way politically, you don't understand what we're doing. And how dare you take that aspect, and challenge us trying to help children's health?” (Clavien asks me “how dare you” three times over the course of our short interview.)

For the biohackers, decentralization is a feature, not a bug. It's a safeguard against corruption. “The biohacking community,” Fabrizio “Fab” Mancini, a chiropractor and frequent flier of the daytime TV medical circuit, tells me, “is not owned by any one entity. It's actual individuals.” In a community for whom deregulation is entirely the point, though, how do you screen for bullshit?

I ask Asprey about the vetting process for the slew of vendors and speakers hawking treatments on his trade show floor, many of them expensive, few FDA-approved. “I don't look at anything as being fringe,” he tells me. “It's either known or unknown, and it has evidence or it doesn't.”

On the last day of the conference, I attend a talk on snake venom. A man named Sincere Seven is extolling the medicinal virtues of microdosing viper, cobra, and rattlesnake venoms directly into his patients' bloodstream.

Flowpresso lymphatic drainage technology.

“The snake heals its prey before it kills its prey,” he claims, before personifying the serpent. “I inject venom into you that will induce a rapid healing. Flood the body with white blood cells, kill off viruses, kill off bacteria, kill off tumors, kill off cancers—cause I don't wanna eat that.” (Trace amounts of venoms are currently used in FDA-approved drugs and have been found to be effective in stroke treatment.) Seven is asked by an audience member if snake venom could be used to treat autism. While he hadn't personally tested it yet, Seven stresses, “I'm willing to work with anybody ... Me and my colleagues, we are the clinical trials.”

“Oh, my gosh,” a woman breathes in the audience. Whether she is moved or horrified, I can't tell.

At the end of the day, I get it. It's not fair to say that I hate my body, exactly—the thing certainly has its merits, and what's more, biohackers talk constantly of the power of positive language in manifesting your reality—but we've never really hit it off. One of my earliest memories involves my parents calling 911 when I had breathing trouble, the paramedics looming over me so tall I swear they scraped the ceiling. In college I was walloped with Lyme disease, my wrists frozen stiff one morning to the point that I couldn't open my dorm room door. I've broken several bones, had a (non-cancerous) lesion removed from my scalp, passed a kidney stone. I have insomnia and depression and a perpetually swollen ankle. I've had Covid at least five times. As of this writing, I'm days away from an appointment with my dermatologist, who'll carve a portion from my back to determine whether or not I have skin cancer.

Part of me really wants to endorse a grand arsenal of magic bullets. I am sick, and I am tired, and I want answers. I, too, long to throw up my hands and write off Western medicine in all its byzantine expense, to embrace something different and eccentric and even expensive, as long as it means getting healed at last.

There are other, better ways to transform health care, of course—ways that could lastingly help the millions who can afford neither chemotherapy nor a cryochamber—like universal health care, stronger regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, and a system more focused on preventative medicine. But these reforms will take political courage and considerable time. Instead we find ourselves entrenched ever further in a culture war, with politicians placing science in its crosshairs.

This, at its core, is the biohackers' dilemma. Over and over at the Fairmont, I hear of the need for evidence-based science in medicine: for clinical trials and citations in the JAMA and double-blind placebo tests. In practically the same breath, I hear the vehement dismissal of evidence using those very safeguards—such as those used to develop vaccines—when it doesn't square with the biohackers' ideals. Though “Live Beyond 180” is a sleek-enough slogan for this crowd, another strikes me as equally fitting: “Science is dead, long live science.”

“The bottom line,” Dr. Fab says, “is that anybody can actually put up a booth and actually sell whatever they feel. That's where an informed consumer is the key.”

But that's a hell of an ask. Information, as we know all too well by now, ain't what it used to be.

    Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or
    sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting
    new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or
    cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news,
    it's probably off-topic.

    On-Topic: ... anything that gratifies one's
                  intellectual curiosity.

I can't see how this is on-topic.  If someone would care to make a case defending it I'd be interested to learn.

As a general rule, if you can slip "yes but does he weigh more than... a duck?!" into the comments and have it fit, it probably doesn't belong on HN.Edit: I just noticed several "burn him/them!" in the comments. There may actually be merit to this hypothesis.

The level of secrecy on Disney's prized franchises is known to be on another level. Between Marvel and Star Wars, script and set leaks are something the studio wants to keep the spigot closed on. But it turns out that sometimes tight security makes the work challenging for its stars, including certain cast members of the hit Disney+ show Andor.

The nugget of behind the scenes lore was revealed while Andor star Diego Luna, who is currently doing a stint hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live, had own his Star Wars universe co-star Adria Arjona on to reminisce about shooting the Disney+ series. He brought up that production resorted to high-tech alternatives for its actors to learn their lines.

“They wouldn't print a script for you because you would lose it. So we would have iPads to work,” Luna explained of the protocol before asking Arjona how she fared under that decree.

“I didn't use it,” she admitted, “I took pictures of it and I printed the whole script.”

As in pictures of the screen, which Luna cracked was very much in line with the spies they played on the Tony Gilroy show. “You were so mad at me the first time in rehearsal. You looked at me like, ‘Adria, they're gonna find out!' You were so paranoid.” Arjona revealed, “And my answer was like, ‘Stellan [Skarsgård] did it too.' I just completely threw Stellan under the bus.”

“I remember that. Stellan didn't give an [expletive],” Luna said. “He was like, ‘Yes, I've been doing it.'”

Arjona continued, “I just kept doing it. Season two, I did it too.”

She explained, “I just need the paper. I need to write things down. [The iPad script] also has so many passwords and then I would have ADD and then do something else and then it would lock me out … it was so complicated. So I printed it.”

Since the ending of Andor featured Arjona's character holding a real hell of a twist in her arms, we'd say she was successful.

The increasing prevalence of myopia is a global health concern, with high myopia increasing the risk of vision damage. This necessitates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for early diagnosis, prevention, and management of myopia. Now, a Pediatric Investigation review sheds light on potential applications of AI in the early identification, risk assessment, and prevention of myopia. It further highlights the challenges and current development status of AI technology in the field of myopia.

Myopia, or nearsightedness, affects two billion people worldwide. Uncorrected myopia can impair vision, disrupting education, career prospects, and quality of life. By 2050, nearly half of the global population is estimated to become myopic. High myopia is often associated with complications that can lead to visual impairment, affecting patients' quality of life and increasing the global medical and economic burden. Therefore, early diagnosis of myopia is important for the prevention of vision damage in patients with myopia.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has opened up new frontiers in the medical field and may be a solution to this global health concern. The subsets of AI, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can help analyze data to diagnose diseases and predict risk factors, biomarkers, and outcomes.

In a new literature review, Dr. Li Li, Dr. Jifeng Yu, and Dr. Nan Liu, all from the Department of Ophthalmology, Capital Medical University, China, have summarized the applications and challenges of AI in myopia, including detection, risk factor assessment, and prediction models. This study was published in the journal of Pediatric Investigation on 18 March 2025.

Interestingly, AI models can be trained using ML/DL to detect myopia from fundus photos and optical coherence tomography images. By feeding a model with a large quantity of fundus images from myopic patients, the AI can be taught to discern minute changes in color and pattern in the retina that are associated with myopia. This allows the model to diagnose future patients from their fundus photos.

In addition, self-monitoring equipment such as SVOne, a handheld device that uses a wavefront sensor to measure eye defects, can use AI algorithms to detect refractive errors in the eyes. The device could access an online database of images, which the AI can use as a reference to diagnose myopia. Moreover, AI can be trained to detect behavioral changes associated with the onset of myopia. Such detection is especially useful for the early detection of myopia in children, which is often ignored otherwise. For example, the Vivior monitor uses ML algorithms to note changes in visual behaviors, such as time spent on near vision activities, in children aged 6-16 years.

Furthermore, ML methods like support vector machine, logistic regression, and XGBoost can be employed to identify risk factors of myopia. "An XGBoost-based model can be fed large quantities of longitudinal data, allowing it to learn the outcomes and associated risk factors of myopia in numerous patients. This, in turn, allows the model to assess the risk factors of new patients based on their genetics, family history, environment, and physiological parameters," explains Dr. Li Li.

Predicting the progression and outcome of myopia can help doctors adjust their clinical approach. Taken on a large scale, it can shape clinical practice and policymaking that help in myopia control. By feeding an AI model large quantities of biometric data, refractive data, treatment responses, and ocular images from numerous myopia patients, the AI can be taught to predict outcomes of myopia in new patients.

Despite the great potential of AI in myopia, several challenges need to be overcome. Firstly, it is important to ensure that the dataset used to train an AI model is correct and of high quality. Bias, false negatives/positives, and poor data quality can negatively impact the diagnostic and prediction accuracy of the model. Secondly, most AI models are trained using data from large hospitals, which may not be representative of patients going to smaller clinics. This creates a discrepancy between real-world and training populations. Thirdly, an AI model is not a trained doctor and may not be able to provide a clinical basis for its diagnosis, which can cause the diagnosis to be rejected by medical professionals. Finally, with such vast quantities of patient data used to train AI models, it is important to ensure the privacy of patients' medical records.

"While our study highlights the remarkable progress made in the clinical application of AI in myopia, further studies are needed to overcome the technological challenges. By building high-quality datasets, improving the model's capacity to process multimodal image data, and improving human-computer interaction capability, the AI models can be further improved for widespread clinical application," concludes Dr. Jifeng Yu.

DISCLOSURES |  June 25, 2025  

As US health insurers promote a new joint plan to overhaul prior authorization (PA) as a major advance, clinician and patient advocates say insurers have provided few specifics about what will change and how they'll be held accountable.

For example, the voluntary plan unveiled on Monday promises that insurers will reduce the PA burden on providers and patients, but no numbers are provided. And insurers only pledged to “work” toward overhauling the electronic PA system with a goal of implementation by 2027.

“There are some incremental things that go above and beyond what they're required to do, but there are few concrete commitments,” California-based consultant and former healthcare executive Seth Glickman, MD, MBA, told Medscape Medical News. “There's not a lot here to ensure their actions are going to match their words.”

Glickman also highlighted what he called a “one-sided” accompanying report by the America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) trade association that defends PA as a “critical safeguard in patient care,” says it “is only selectively used,” and blames “a number of physicians” who don't follow evidence-based medicine.

The growing use of PA to reflexively deny healthcare has sparked outrage from clinicians and patients, leading to action from state and federal lawmakers.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology has tracked more than 110 PA bills in 40 states. The 2024 assassination of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson spotlighted the burdens insurers have placed on patients and providers.

“There's violence in the streets over these issues," said Mehmet Oz, MD, MBA, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), at a press conference announcing the new PA reform plan. “This is not something that is a passively accepted reality anymore — Americans are upset about it.”

Here's a closer look at the PA reform plan and the reaction from the medical community.

AHIP announced on Monday that leading commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid managed care coverage insurers covering 257 million Americans will voluntarily “simplify” PA.

“For patients, these commitments will result in faster, more direct access to appropriate treatments and medical services with fewer challenges navigating the health system,” an AHIP press release said. “For providers, these commitments will streamline prior authorization workflows, allowing for a more efficient and transparent process overall, while ensuring evidence-based care for their patients.”

Specifically, insurers agreed to:

There's no specific goal for reduction of PA requirements.

According to an AHIP survey, 96% of prescription drug claims and 93% of medical claims are not subject to PA. However, a 2025 KFF report found that “virtually all enrollees in Medicare Advantage (99%) are required to obtain prior authorization for some services.”

The plans also agreed to:

According to the AHIP survey, commercial plans have PA denial rates of 3% for medical services and 10% for prescription medicines.

The KFF report about Medicare Advantage plans found that insurers fully or partially denied 6.4% of PA requests in 2023, and 11.7% of those requests were appealed. While appeals were rare, 81.7% were partially or fully overturned.

According to the AHIP survey, about 20% of current PA requests for medical services are approved in real time; the data for prescription medications were not provided.

The AHIP survey says all responding health plans said, “AI or algorithms without clinician or practitioner review are not used to deny prior authorization requests that involve medical necessity or clinical considerations.”

Glickman, the consultant, said efforts to “put a face and a name to the people who are impacted by prior authorization requirements and denials of care” have made a difference.

He added that the Biden Administration helped pave the way for changes at the federal level. “It would be disingenuous,” he said, for the Trump Administration “to say they're the ones setting the priorities.”

However, the Trump Administration now has the power to force changes in PA requirements.

“We're throwing money away on administrative costs financially. We're also wasting people's time,” Oz said, according to NBC Chicago. “The most important reality is the administration has made it clear we're not going to tolerate it anymore. Either you fix it, or we're going to fix it. They wisely decided they should fix it.”

Medical organizations support the announced reforms — but also called for more than promises.

“Patients and physicians will need specifics demonstrating that the latest insurer pledge will yield substantive actions to bring immediate and meaningful changes, break down unnecessary roadblocks, and keep medical decisions between patients and physicians,” said Bobby Mukkamala, MD, president, American Medical Association, in a statement.

Chet Speed, JD, chief policy officer of the American Medical Group Association, told Medscape Medical News that “the vast majority of PA denials are an inefficient, bureaucratic exercise.”

As he noted, researchers have found that high rates of denials are overturned on appeal. And a 2022 federal analysis of a small group of Medicare Advantage PA denials found that 13% would have been cleared under traditional Medicare.

Speed also highlighted a 2022 American Medical Association survey of 1000 physicians that found 94% of physicians said PA at least sometimes leads to delays in care, and 7% said it “resulted in a serious adverse event leading to a patient's disability, permanent bodily damage, congenital anomaly, birth defect, or death.”

“Anecdotally, we have heard from medical groups and systems that this delay is especially problematic on Fridays when PA offices close for the weekend,” Speed said, “meaning patients stay in the hospital when a transfer to a post-acute setting would have been more clinically appropriate.”

As for the new reform plan, Speed said “the big deal” is that the White House, Department of Health and Human Services, and CMS support it. “We believe the plan is a good first step,” he said, although he acknowledged that its details about reducing PA burden are “vague.”

Kaye Pestaina, JD, director of the Program on Patient and Consumer Protections at KFF, told KFF Health News that she's not sure how the reform plan changes the fact that many patients don't realize they need PA until it's denied.

“So much of the prior authorization process is behind the black box,” she said.

Adam Gaffney, MD, MPH, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, Boston, was skeptical too. He told NBC News that the plan is “going to streamline it [PA] in some incremental ways only.”

Sabin Dang, MD, a retinal specialist in St. Louis, told Medscape Medical News that the plan won't solve all PA problems.

However, “one of the things I'm most excited about is real-time answers, using technology to get answers while patient is sitting in the chair and then start the treatment process,” he said. This is much better than forcing patients to wait a week “while they're suffering with decreased vision,” he added.

Last year, Dang led a study that found 96.2% of PA requests for 2225 anti-VEGF drugs were approved, but most — 59.6% — remained unresolved after 24 hours. Most requests resulted in a delay of care, and an analysis showed that staff members needed to spend a median of 100 minutes on each request.

The standardizing of PA technology will also be helpful, Dang said. “We have many digital tools and websites to visit,” he said, although he added that fixing the system will be a “huge logistical hurdle.”

For his part, consultant Glickman said instant approvals raise questions about the true purpose of PA. “If they're going to be auto-authorized, why are we requiring providers to jump through all these hoops to get authorization in the first place?”

Glickman and Dang reported having no disclosures.

A pretreatment step could help transplanted pancreatic islets survive longer in patients with type 1 diabetes, according to a new preclinical study from Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. One combination of small molecules extended the cells' lives in female mice, and adding two molecules to the mixture boosted cell survival in male mice.

The findings, published on June 24 in Cell Stem Cell, could allow physicians to treat more patients with fewer cells.

In type 1 diabetes, autoimmune cells attack the pancreatic islets, destroying the insulin-producing beta cells and leaving patients dependent on insulin injections. The current FDA-approved transplant procedure replaces these cells with pancreatic islet cells from one or more deceased organ donors. It typically takes up to 48 hours to isolate islets from the donor for injection into a vein that carries them to the recipient's liver. Once in the liver, the islet cells begin producing insulin, just as they would in a healthy pancreas.

However, many transplanted cells die soon after the procedure, and complications can arise from targeting the liver. Transplanting the cells under the skin, an option with some potential advantages, also has challenges with dying cells. Dr. Shuibing Chen, the Kilts Family Professor of Surgery and director of the Center for Genomic Health at Weill Cornell Medicine, noted research by others showing that pretreating a type of cell used to replenish blood cell populations during a six-hour period improves their survival after a transplant, so she explored a similar approach for islet cells.

"With our new strategy, we should only need one donor per patient, or maybe one donor could contribute cells to two patients, lessening the waiting time for patients to receive the therapy," said Dr. Chen, who is also a member of the Hartman Institute for Therapeutic Organ Regeneration at Weill Cornell Medicine.

Determining the best pretreatment approach typically requires several expensive and labor-intensive drug screens, but J. Jeya Vandana, graduate student in the Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology and first author of the paper, had an idea. "Jeya combined chemical screens with single cell RNA-sequencing technology so that we could check multiple readouts in one experiment," said Dr. Chen.

With their system, which they call ChemPerturb-Seq, each cell in an experiment receives a unique barcode and is treated for 48 hours with a unique small molecule drug. After the treatment, the team pools the cells and sequences the RNA. The barcode tells the researchers which cells responded well to a certain molecule. All the data are made publicly available through a website called ChemPerturbDB, which is powered by an artificial intelligence assistant that is similar to ChatGPT.

Performing ChemPerturb-Seq with a human beta cell line led to discovery of a pretreatment they called LIP. This combination of beta-lipotropin, insulin growth factor-1 and prostaglandin E2 boosted the survival of beta cells and human islets from donors when transplanted subcutaneously in a type-1 diabetes mouse model compared to controls. But there was a catch.

Jeya first transplanted everything into female mice, and the approach worked very well, but when she transplanted the pretreated cells into male mice, it failed."

Dr. Shuibing Chen, the Kilts Family Professor of Surgery and director of the Center for Genomic Health at Weill Cornell Medicine

Going back to the drawing board, the team used ChemPerturb-Seq to predict other small molecules that could help the cells live longer in males. The result was a cocktail called LIPHS, which included the three LIP molecules plus histamine and serotonin, that was successful in males.

Armed with their new technique, Dr. Chen's group will conduct more studies to see whether the results hold for additional preclinical models. The team is also adding even more small-molecule data to the website.

As we age, extreme heat causes many heat-related illnesses that can lead to serious health issues. A new study from the University of California, Irvine's Joe C. Wen School of Population & Public Health adds to that list.

The UC Irvine researchers have discovered that the combined effects of aging and heat waves are putting people's health at greater risk by weakening gut and immune system function, which heightens our risk of infection from a deadly, waterborne bacterium called Vibrio vulnificus that is increasingly found in warmer ocean waters.

With more frequent and intense heat waves and the population continuing to age, this research, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, offers insight into how these two factors work together to weaken the immune system, damage the gut, and elevate the risk of severe infection. The work was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

As many around the world experience record-breaking June heat waves, the study arrives at a crucial moment in the ongoing effort to understand how rising temperatures affect human health.

While Vibrio vulnificus infections are already a growing concern in warming coastal regions, our findings show that extreme heat, especially with older individuals, may further compromise the immune system and gut microbiome in ways that make people more susceptible. It's a double hit: Aging weakens immune defenses, and heat stress accelerates that decline."

Saurabh Chatterjee, corresponding author, professor of environmental & occupational health, and medicine

As V. vulnificus infections and extreme heat events increase, key scientific gaps have made it difficult to assess infection risk. Until now, researchers have lacked a clear understanding of how prolonged heat affects the gut microbiome, immune response and infection vulnerability in older people.

To address this, the UC Irvine team exposed both young and aged mice to climate-relevant heat and conducted microbiome sequencing along with tests for gut integrity and immune function. The aged mice showed significantly more damage to the intestinal barrier, systemic inflammation, immune dysfunction and antibiotic-resistant genes in the gut microbiome than their younger counterparts.

This work is the first to connect climate-driven heat stress with gut and immune disruption that raises susceptibility to V. vulnificus. It also identifies a potential avenue for treatment: Aged mice treated with a beneficial gut microbe (Roseburia intestinalis) demonstrated restored immune cell function and reduced signs of infection. Reintroducing key probiotics helped improve intestinal health and regulate the immune system. The results suggest that supporting gut health may be key to boosting immune resilience during heat exposure.

Enhanced Genomics ('Enhanced'), the biotechnology company pioneering 3D multi-omics to rapidly identify high-confidence, genetically validated drug targets for common diseases, today announced a strategic partnership with The ALBORADA Drug Discovery Institute at the University of Cambridge. Funded by Alzheimer's Research UK, The ALBORADA Drug Discovery Institute is developing the next generation of treatments for the diseases that cause dementia. The partnership has already yielded novel drug targets for Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating the potential of 3D multi-omics to vastly reduce drug-discovery timelines and increase success rates across various disease areas.

Under the partnership agreement, Enhanced utilized its proprietary Promoter Capture Hi-C technology, multi-omic data, and expert knowledge to map long-range chromatin interactions, revealing crucial gene regulatory-mechanisms involved in driving Alzheimer's disease. This approach identified several novel targets, as well as corroborating targets already reported in the literature, opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

"Our partnership with The ALBORADA Drug Discovery Institute showcases the transformative power of 3D multi-omics in drug discovery," said Dr. Dan Turner, CSO of Enhanced Genomics. "By harnessing our unique platform, we have not only accelerated the target discovery process but also unveiled new therapeutic possibilities by harnessing the full potential of the non-coding genome. We're confident that we can improve both timescales and success rates of target ID and drug development using 3D multi-omics."

Using the insights provided by Enhanced's technology, we have gained new actionable targets operating by a range of mechanisms. This could significantly advance our ability to develop effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease."

Dr. John Skidmore, CSO, The ALBORADA Drug Discovery Institute

Dr. Julia Dudley, Head of Strategic Programmes at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "There has been unprecedented progress in dementia drug development, but we must keep up the momentum to help find new treatments and, in time, a cure. We are delighted that The ALBORADA Drug Discovery Institute and Enhanced Genomics have joined forces to accelerate the dementia drug discovery process. Partnerships like these are bringing the worlds of academia and industry closer together, helping to speed up the discovery of potential new treatments that people with dementia so desperately need."

Enhanced Genomics and The ALBORADA Drug Discovery Institute are now exploring opportunities to expand their partnership to other neurodegenerative diseases. The company is also open to partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotech firms interested in utilizing its 3D multi-omics platform in their own drug discovery programs.

A sweeping analysis of over 100 studies reveals aspartame is unlikely to alter glucose or hormone levels, challenging claims about its metabolic risks.

Review:  The Effects of Aspartame on Glucose, Insulin, and Appetite-Regulating Hormone Responses in Humans: Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses. Image Credit: Monika Wisniewska / Shutterstock

A recent study published in the journal Advances in Nutrition investigated the effects of aspartame on insulin, glucose, and appetite-related hormone responses. High free sugar consumption is associated with elevated energy intake, increasing the risk for obesity, overweight, and chronic conditions. Therefore, the World Health Organization recommends limiting free sugar intake to 10% of total energy intake. One strategy to curb free sugar intake is to reformulate foods and drinks by reducing their sugar content. Many manufacturers achieve this using low-calorie sweeteners (LCSs).

LCSs are considered safe, with studies suggesting benefits for decreasing body weight and energy intake compared to sugar intake. However, the benefits of LCSs are less clear for chronic conditions and over the long term. For instance, LCS intake has been associated with a higher risk of obesity and various metabolic conditions, albeit the evidence remains limited. Aspartame is among the most common LCSs that are completely metabolized by the human digestive system.

Aspartame is recognized as safe for use in foods and beverages. Aspartame is converted into aspartic acid, methanol, and phenylalanine. Given this breakdown of metabolites found in dietary sources, the metabolic effects of aspartame may appear unlikely. However, some studies suggest differing effects for diverse health outcomes from aspartame intake. Controversy over aspartame's health effects continues, in part because some studies have suggested different outcomes when compared to other LCSs.

In the present study, researchers investigated the effects of aspartame on insulin, glucose, and appetite-regulating hormone responses. PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases, as well as four trial registries, were searched for studies examining the effects of aspartame on insulin, appetite-regulating hormones, and glucose responses.

Any controlled intervention study design was eligible for inclusion, regardless of location and setting. Observational, animal, and in vitro studies were excluded from the analysis. Data on methodological aspects and risk of bias (RoB) were extracted from each study. The Cochrane Collaboration RoB-2 tool was used for RoB assessment.

A narrative synthesis of suitable experiments was performed based on the study design type, aspartame exposure, study duration, comparator, and outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed where at least 10 studies of the same design, exposure pattern, and outcome were available. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The GRADE approach rated certainty as “very low” due to limitations in study design, inconsistency and heterogeneity among studies, indirectness, and possible publication bias.

The review included studies in a range of populations, such as healthy adults, individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, phenylketonuria (PKU), and those with self-reported aspartame sensitivity.

Database search identified 11,796 records. After de-duplication and title/abstract screening, full texts of 417 articles were screened. Overall, 101 articles were included, which reported on the effects of aspartame alone or in combination with other substances. Furthermore, 73 studies reported on 77 crossover experiments, while 28 studies reported on 23 parallel-group experiments. Thirty-four studies examined the effects of aspartame alone on glucose responses with different comparators.

Aspartame had no effects on blood glucose compared to vehicle or other LCSs. However, blood glucose levels were significantly lower following aspartame intake compared to sweet sugars, non-sweet-tasting carbohydrates, or other nutritive components. Notably, these reductions were most evident in acute, short-term studies. Further, 19 studies provided aspartame with a nutritive component, and no effects of aspartame were noted. For insulin responses, 31 studies examined the effects of aspartame individually.

Aspartame had no effect on blood insulin levels compared to the vehicle; however, blood insulin levels were significantly lower after aspartame intake compared to non-sweet-tasting carbohydrates, sweet sugars, or other nutritive components. Further, blood insulin was significantly elevated with aspartame compared to other LCSs. Again, these significant differences were observed primarily in short-term experimental settings, not in medium- or long-term studies. Few effects were found with appetite-regulating hormones.

When appetite and energy intake were evaluated, the effects mimicked those of blood insulin and glucose. Few adverse events were reported across studies. Four crossover studies, which lasted up to 30 days (medium-term), found that high or low doses of aspartame did not affect blood glucose or insulin levels compared to sucrose or a placebo. Three crossover studies, which lasted more than 30 days (long-term), yielded results similar to those of medium-term studies.

In parallel-group acute studies, aspartame was found to reduce blood glucose levels compared to sucrose or glucose, when provided alone or in combination with nutritive components or LCSs. Four parallel-group, medium-term studies yielded results that mirrored those in short-term studies to some degree, with aspartame reducing blood insulin and glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity compared to sugars. Ten parallel-group studies were performed over the long term.

No differences were found between aspartame and the comparator(s) in any biochemical measure. Nine studies provided data on energy intake and reported no differences or lower energy intake and density with aspartame compared to sucrose. Likewise, nine studies examined appetite and found no differences between groups. The RoB assessment raised concerns for most studies. The certainty of evidence was “very low” for all primary outcomes. The review also emphasized substantial heterogeneity in methodologies and outcomes across the included studies, further limiting interpretability. The diversity of included populations (such as individuals with diabetes, PKU, or aspartame sensitivity) likely contributed to this heterogeneity.

In sum, most studies investigated blood insulin and glucose levels over the short term, and the meta-analyses revealed no effects of aspartame compared to vehicle or other LCSs. However, lower blood insulin and glucose levels were found with aspartame compared to sugars and other nutritive components, mainly in acute interventions. Long- and medium-term studies had few effects of aspartame intake.

Few studies have assessed appetite-regulating hormones other than insulin, and few effects have been found in these studies. There was high heterogeneity across studies and populations. The inclusion of varied participant groups (e.g., those with metabolic diseases or sensitivities) was an additional factor influencing the overall certainty and generalizability of findings. Together, the findings reveal little to no impact of aspartame intake on glucose metabolism, either in the short term or the long term. Further long-term studies are needed to compare aspartame with other LCSs and assess various appetite-regulating hormones. The certainty of these findings is limited by study quality, heterogeneity, and the risk of bias.

Despite environmental promise, insect-based foods remain a niche as taste, price, and tradition keep meat and plant-based options on top. Can bugs ever break through to the mainstream?

Review: Beyond the buzz: insect-based foods are unlikely to significantly reduce meat consumption. Image Credit: Charoen Krung Photography / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the journal npj Sustainable Agriculture, a group of authors determined whether insect-derived protein products can realistically replace conventional meat in everyday Western diets.

Would you swap your burger for bugs? As the environmental impact of livestock farming grows, with meat consumption predicted to be responsible for 37% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions permissible under a 2°C climate target by 2030, pressure to curb meat intake is rising. Insects promise high protein with a lighter environmental footprint, attracting startup funding and policy enthusiasm. Y

et acceptance across Europe and North America rarely exceeds 30% of consumers, and most would pay less, not more, for insect products. Environmental campaigns alone have not changed taste-driven habits grounded in culture, price, and convenience.

Further research is needed to clarify whether insects can overcome these still truly complex social and market obstacles.

Taste, tradition, and perceived health status keep steak at the center of many plates. Mouth-coating fats deliver a savory punch that insect flours struggle to mimic. Meat also signals prosperity and family identity at barbecues, holiday feasts, and business dinners. Price drives choices as well; powerful lobbying and scale efficiencies keep beef and poultry inexpensive relative to novel proteins.

In the EU, for instance, livestock farmers have received 1200 times more public funding than alternative protein groups, and lobbying from the meat industry has even influenced reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Convenience matters, too: supermarkets, fast-food chains, and meal-kit apps place animal products within easy reach, while insects remain online novelties or limited-edition snacks. Any alternative must satisfy this sensory, cultural, and economic bundle to win repeat purchases.

Online delivery widens the gap: a single tap summons chicken wings, while insect products often require specialty websites and week-long shipping, eroding instant-gratification expectations.

Surveys conducted across the United States (US), Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), and Italy reveal that fewer than 30% of adults would consider trying insect dishes, and even fewer would serve them at home. Disgust (a protective emotion linked to disease avoidance) surfaces when people picture antennae or feel the sensation of crunchy legs.

In Western cultures, insects are often associated with disease, dirt, and decay, and their consumption is sometimes perceived as a marker of a “primitive” lifestyle. This is compounded by the potential use of food scraps as insect feed, a practice that Western consumers may not be receptive to.

Food neophobia, the reluctance to taste unfamiliar items, amplifies this reaction, especially in older consumers. Social cues deepen the gap: Western media frame insect eating as a reality-show stunt, and dinner companions signal hesitancy with a single eyebrow raise.

These intangible forces create a wall higher than any nutritional chart can climb. Children form taste memories early, and schools rarely feature insect dishes, so generational turnover alone cannot guarantee acceptance within crucial climate timelines.

Overview of factors required to switch from conventional meat to insect-based meat substitutes.

Entrepreneurs grind crickets into powders and bake them into protein bars, hoping invisibility will bypass disgust. While the tactic lifts willingness to sample, it rarely sustains weekly demand. Crucially, approximately 90% of the current insect-based food market consists of products, such as snacks, pasta, or bars, that do not directly compete with meat.

Shoppers still compare the bar to a plant-based counterpart that is cheaper, sweeter, and free of crunch memories. Since insects generally have a higher environmental impact than plants, incorporating them into these items is likely detrimental from a sustainability perspective.

Eco-labels touting lower GHG emissions add marginal appeal, but everyday eaters prioritize taste and habit over distant climate metrics.

Educational tastings at museums generate social-media buzz yet falter at the checkout line; repeated exposure helps some adventurous groups, but scaling that immersive experience to millions would drain marketing budgets faster than venture capital arrives.

Scarce shelf space compounds the mindset problem. Few large grocers allocate chilled sections to insect analogues, so interested consumers cannot build a reliable routine.

Production costs remain high because farms must maintain strict daily temperature and humidity controls, as well as feed controls, to prevent pathogens, which contrasts with soybeans that grow in open fields.

Investment patterns reinforce these challenges: in 2022, the vast majority of funding for insect farming, approximately 95%, or 1.2 billion USD, was directed toward animal feed and pet food, with less than 1% supporting insect-based products for human consumption.

Regulators add another layer, as the European Union (EU) now allows specific species in baked goods and pasta, but novel food approvals remain slow, and labeling disputes over words like "burger" or "sausage" mirror earlier battles faced by oat and almond beverages.

Plant-based meat alternatives such as soy or pea burgers already occupy mainstream menus, from Burger King to grocery freezer aisles, and taste tests show steady improvements in juiciness and grill marks. Their environmental profiles surpass those of poultry and rival insect protein, while avoiding perceived health risks such as allergy concerns and visual stigma.

Crucially, supply chains for legumes have enjoyed decades of agronomic optimization, allowing unit costs to decrease. As a result, shoppers seeking lower-impact proteins can satisfy ethical goals without confronting bug-related unease.

If insects cannot deliver a clear sensory or price advantage, they risk fragmenting attention and investment that could accelerate broader dietary shifts toward plants.

Existing studies focus heavily on hypothetical willingness to try insects rather than real cash transactions. Few studies track long-term consumption patterns or examine how community identity shapes food loyalty.

Sensory science must still decode how to replicate the Maillard-rich (the chemical reaction responsible for browning and flavor) aroma of seared meat using insect oils or pastes, and economists need transparent cost curves from pilot to industrial scale.

Comparative life-cycle assessments should include realistic scenarios where insects replace plant snacks, not beef steaks, to gauge net climate outcomes.

Finally, sociologists could explore whether targeted niches such as high-protein sports powders or emergency rations offer footholds that do not compete head-on with beloved comfort foods.

Current evidence shows that insect-based foods must overcome significant barriers before they can reduce meat consumption. They currently fall short in terms of taste familiarity, price, availability, and social acceptance, while competing directly with increasingly popular plant-derived substitutes.

Investment patterns, regulatory caution, and consumer psychology all reinforce a cycle of limited scale. Because plant-based alternatives are more advanced and accepted, insects risk diverting resources away from more effective climate solutions. Unless future research uncovers niche uses that deliver clear sensory or economic gains, insects may remain peripheral in Western diets.

Policymakers and entrepreneurs may therefore achieve faster climate and health benefits by prioritizing plant-based innovation and addressing the cultural roots of meat attachment, while longitudinal trials could test targeted interventions.

New research reveals how junk food during adolescence rewires critical brain regions, increasing the risk for poor decision-making and obesity well into adulthood.

Study: Adolescent nutritional influences on the brain: implications for eating behaviors. Image Credit: Yuriy Golub / Shutterstock

Researchers have recently reviewed the existing literature to understand how an adolescent's eating behavior affects the development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC), as well as overall health. This narrative review synthesizes both animal and human studies to clarify these relationships and current knowledge gaps. The research is published in the journal Neuropharmacology.

The transition from childhood to adolescence also involves a shift from dependence on direct control mechanisms linked to food and sensory receptors to an increasing reliance on indirect control mechanisms that facilitate adjustments in one's eating behavior.

In contrast to children whose eating behavior is primarily determined by hunger and fullness cues, adolescents' eating behavior is significantly influenced by multiple external factors, including personal beliefs, media, food preferences, and peer pressure. The modern food environment features easy-to-access, highly palatable foods with high levels of fat, sugar, and salt, often directly marketed to adolescents. These ingredients typically increase food cravings by bypassing the normal regulatory controls.

Multiple studies have shown that compared to children, adolescents are more commonly inclined towards consuming hyper-palatable and ultra-processed foods (UPF), which are widely available in Western countries. These studies have also pointed out that adolescents are the highest consumers of high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) foods, which cause obesity and metabolic disease. According to U.S. data, ultra-processed foods account for approximately 65% of total energy intake among adolescents, who also have the highest intake of added sugars. In the last three decades, a rapid increase in the prevalence of adolescent obesity has been recorded, with rates having quadrupled during this period.

The PFC region of the brain is involved in executive functions, including sustained attention, higher-order cognition, planning, decision-making, and inhibitory control. This part of the brain is not fully developed in humans until around the age of twenty-four. The PFC involves the integration of sensory signals to discriminate food palatability, responses to food cues, and discriminate food palatability. It also weighs the rewarding aspects of hyperpalatable foods against potential consequences as part of the brain's reward system.

The HPC is another region of the developing adolescent brain linked to feeding behavior. It regulates the episodic meal-related memories and conditional learned associations between food-related stimuli and post-ingestive signals. Impaired hippocampal activity leads to decreased memory of meals and increased response to food cues, resulting in elevated meal frequency, total energy intake, and weight gain. Animal studies suggest that the hippocampus' structural and functional development during adolescence is especially sensitive to diet quality, with human research showing correlations between poor dietary habits and memory impairments.

Excessive consumption of calorically dense yet nutrient-poor foods throughout adolescence impacts the neurocognitive development of the PFC. Much of the mechanistic evidence for this comes from animal studies, with human evidence being largely correlational (e.g., brain imaging studies linking diet, PFC volume, and cognitive performance). This impaired development has a long-lasting impact on eating behavior, contributing to diet-induced obesity in adulthood.

Adolescent rats fed an HFHS diet for just a month exhibited a reduced number of fast-acting parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which disrupts neuroplasticity. Notably, adolescent rodents exposed to a Western diet for as little as one week exhibited rapid onset of anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, a vulnerability not observed in adults.

HFHS foods were found to promote impulsivity, especially during adolescence. For example, animal studies have shown that adolescent rodents exposed to these diets exhibit increased impulsivity and reduced inhibitory control, and that baseline sex differences in these effects may exist, although further research is needed to confirm this in humans. The review highlights that males may experience greater and more persistent impulsivity, while females show a gradual emergence of these behaviors. Many animal-based studies have shown that GABAergic communication in the PFC is influenced by diet. For instance, adolescent rodents fed a high-fat and sucrose diet independently for two months showed a decreased GABA concentration and a reduced number of iGABAergic PV+ interneurons in the PFC and hippocampus. These changes in the brain regions are associated with impaired cognition and behavioral control.

Hyperpalatable foods activate the mesocorticolimbic pathway, encouraging further reward-seeking behavior. Experimental studies have shown that in comparison to control-fed rodents, those under a high-fat diet exhibited upregulation in D1 dopamine receptors and increased neuronal activation in the PFC, which increases reward-seeking behavior. In humans, elevated reward responsivity to food has been associated with increased body mass index. The review notes that over-engagement with such foods during adolescence may cause lasting changes in reward signaling, with some animal studies showing epigenetic changes that persist into adulthood.

Rodents fed with high-fat food demonstrated increased oxidative stress in the hippocampus, higher memory impairments, anxiety, and decreased social interaction. Similarly, rodents fed high-fructose corn syrup, a key ingredient in most soda drinks, exhibited impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory in both male and female rats.

A previous study has also shown that the size and volume of the hippocampus are impacted by HFHS food consumption. Specifically, fat intake is associated with reductions in left hippocampal volume (linked to verbal memory), whereas increased dietary fructose is linked to increases in the right hippocampus (associated with spatial memory), reflecting possible lateralized hippocampal functions. Besides fat, higher dietary intake of fructose is associated with an increase in the volume of the right hippocampus, which could be due to delayed synaptic pruning or inflammation. However, the review cautions that the significance and consequences of such volume changes are not fully understood, and findings are sometimes contradictory (e.g., some studies find reduced hippocampal volume with fat intake, others see increases with fructose).

Many studies have confirmed that early life HFHS diet impairs the structural and functional signaling of the hippocampus, which negatively impacts hippocampal-dependent memory and learning. In comparison to control-fed rats, the HFHS diet increases hippocampal lesions, which in turn elevate meal frequency and appetitive responding, ultimately leading to obesity. Additionally, animal research indicates that a Western diet during adolescence can increase blood-brain barrier permeability in the hippocampus, thereby further impairing cognitive function.

Importantly, some of these diet-induced effects may not be fully reversible even after a healthy dietary intervention in adulthood, particularly when exposure occurs during critical periods of brain development in adolescence.

Taken together, the habitual feeding behaviors developed during adolescence may trigger long-lasting alterations in brain circuitry that could influence health throughout the lifespan. While much of the mechanistic evidence is derived from animal studies, human epidemiological and neuroimaging data are generally consistent with these findings; however, direct causal pathways require further investigation.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino was also spotted in attendance at Wednesday's match. 

Tuesday night, the Middletown native spoke in Lima, Ohio, for an event hosted by the Ohio Republican Party. Headlining the fundraiser, he spoke on growing tensions in the Middle East and praised President Donald Trump for his handling of the Iran-Israel conflict, the economy and immigration. 

Wednesday morning, Vance was back in the Greater Cincinnati area, loading up on groceries at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield.

The store provided WLWT with photos of Vance in the building Wednesday.

Not only was he shopping local, he was also representing his hometown with a Skyline Chili shirt.

This is, at least, the second time Vance has been spotted at Jungle Jim's in the last year. Fresh off being named the then-Republican VP Candidate at the Republican National Convention, Vance stopped in to shop with his family, accompanied by secret service.

The often brutal North American climate has come under the microscope in recent weeks, with clubs from around the world having descended upon the U.S. for the FIFA Club World Cup.

However, U.S. Men's National Team legend Brad Friedel believes the new-look competition could prove beneficial in the long run for some.

A searing summer has taken its toll on many involved, with players visibly struggling during outdoor games with the nationwide heatwave. Hydration breaks have been implemented to help players cope with the humid conditions, while both Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund have recently sent their substitutes to the locker room during games to stay cool.

Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca even admitted that it has been “almost impossible to train,” with the Blues cutting their session ahead of their recent 3-0 win against ES Tunis short with temperatures hitting 99 degrees Fahrenheit, with humidity making it feel like 110 degrees.

These conditions, combined with the fact that the World Cup will be held at almost the same time in the summer of 2026 in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, have proved cause for serious concern regarding the welfare of players from the 48 nations set to participate.

However, according to longtime Premier League shot stopper Friedel, lessons learned during the Club World Cup could prove invaluable in 12 months' time.

“I've spoken to a couple of national teams that are preparing for the World Cup, and they've asked where would be best to set up camp if they have games here or there,” Friedel told Mirror U.S. Sports in May. “That is something that they're going to have to come to terms with. If you play outdoors, for instance, in Dallas in the middle of the summer, you could have a tornado and wind and rain, or you could have what feels like 120 degrees Fahrenheit on the pitch.

“You can get some crazy differences. That's something the teams and the individual players will have to get used to. What I would say, if you're a player and you're playing for the first time in the States in the summer and you know you're going to be involved with your national team in the World Cup, that'll be very good for them because they'll understand the different weather conditions and climate conditions in areas of the country.”

Friedel, who played for the likes of Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa, recalled having played in the historic Cotton Bowl in Dallas, which, like 11 of the 16 venues set to be used in 2026, does not have a roof over the field.

He noted how midday kickoffs would feel like walking into a steam room, going on to note that outdoor games in places like Atlanta, Miami, and Orlando can be “brutal in the summer.”

In fact, just three of the venues set to host games in 2026 (Arlington's AT&T Stadium, Houston's NRG Stadium, and Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium) are air conditioned, while L.A.'s SoFi Stadium and Vancouver's BC Place are fully covered. However, neither the third-place playoff game nor the final will be played in covered stadiums, with Miami's Hard Rock Stadium and East Rutherford's MetLife Stadium scheduled to host the respective games.

As for the Club World Cup, with the group stage nearly complete, the remaining 16 teams will soon embark on the knockout rounds. All but three of the knockout stage games will be held outdoors.

The European transfer window will soon open and several key players in the United States men's national team player pool are expected to seek transfers with the hope of starring for the U.S. at the 2026 FIFA World Cup next summer.

Here is the latest reporting surrounding the stars of the U.S. men's national team in the summer transfer window:

Johnny Cardoso

From: Real BetisTo: Atlético Madrid

Coming off of a strong season with Real Betis, defensive midfielder Johnny Cardoso is nearing a €30 million ($34.8 million) move to Atlético Madrid on a five-year contract, according to Marca. Cardoso's transfer, if completed, will be the third-highest transfer fee paid for an American player behind Christian Pulisic ($65 million) and Folarin Balogun ($43 million).

Patrick Agyemang

From: Charlotte FCTo: Derby County

EFL Championship side Derby County are "closing in" on a deal to sign 24-year-old striker Patrick Agyemang from Charlotte FC, according to Fabrizio Romano. Derby County finished 19th in the Englsih second division while scoring just 48 goals. Agyemang has scored eight goals in 18 appearances for Charlotte this season.

Matt Turner

From: Nottingham ForestTo: Lyon

FA Cup winners Crystal Palace agreed to transfer goalkeeper Matt Turner to French side Lyon for a fee of €8 million ($9.2 million) earlier this month, and despite Lyon's recent relegation to Ligue 2 due to financial issues, the move isn't in jeopardy, according to GiveMeSport.

Ricardo Pepi

From: PSV EidenhovenTo: Fulham

Ricardo Pepi's breakout season in the Dutch Eredivisie was cut short due to a season-ending meniscus injury, but there are Italian and Spanish clubs interested in making a move for the 22-year-old striker, including Premier League club Fulham, according to Fabrizio Romano. Pepi scored 18 goals in all club competitions last season.

Yunus Musah

From: AC MilanTo: Napoli

Following a forgettable season at AC Milan, which ended in a managerial change, Yunus Musah is expected to move clubs this summer, and Napoli is keen on the 22-year-old midfielder, according to multiple reports.

Tim Weah

From: JuventusTo: Nottingham Forest

 Nottingham Forest, who finished seventh in the Premier League last season, are in talks over a package deal that would land them Belgian winger Samuel Mbangula and American winger Tim Weah for a combined fee of €23 million ($26.7 million). Weah had six goals and five assists in all competitions for Juventus last season.

Malik Tillman 

To: Bayer LeverkusenFrom: PSV Eindhoven

Could Malik Tillman's breakout summer end with a high-profile move to Bayer Leverkusen? That's the latest reporting out of Germany from Sky Sport. Leverkusen are looking to fill the attacking void left after selling Florian Wirtz to Liverpool for a record fee, and Tillman — a native of Germany and product of Bayern Munich — could help fill that void.

The Bees expect to finalise the details of the transfer soon.

Former Chelsea and Atletico Madrid star Alvaro Morata is all set to leave AC Milan after just one season, as Como sent a proposal to sign the forward. Morata moved to Milan last July but played for just six months at the club before being sent out on a loan deal with an option to buy to Turkish giants Galatasaray, where he won the Super Lig title.

U.S. Women's National Team icon Carli Lloyd's no-nonsense takes will soon be returning to FOX and FS1 airwaves, after it was announced that she would form part of the network's studio team covering the upcoming UEFA Women's Euros and CONCACAF Gold Cups.

Lloyd's third straight summer working in-house with the network, having previously covered the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in 2023, and the CONMEBOL Copa America in 2024, the National Soccer Hall of Famer said she was “thrilled” to be returning for another summer.

“With the UEFA Women's Euro starting up and the U.S. off to a good start in the Gold Cup, I'm thrilled to be back with FOX Sports for what promises to be an incredible next few months of soccer,” said the USWNT legend, who apologized to her former teammates earlier this year for how she treated them, in a statement.

“I can't wait to cover all the storylines across both tournaments and especially with the UEFA Women's Euro, continuing to be a part of growing the women's game on FOX with a really impressive schedule that puts the tournament and players center stage.”

Lloyd's return to action with FOX could ruffle some feathers, however, with the 42-year-old having previously caused controversy with her occasionally blunt and unfiltered takes.

Most notably, during the 2023 Women's World Cup, the two-time champion tore into the state of the USWNT during what was the team's worst-ever performance in the competition.

Having entered the competition as the reigning back-to-back champions, then head coach Vlatko Andonovski led his side to a second-place finish in the group stage before unceremoniously exiting in the Round of 16 at the hands of Sweden.

Critical of the players' attitude during the competition, Lloyd also went viral for her criticism of Andonovski, believing that the team was “spiralling out of control” under the head coach.

“This isn't a surprise to me,” Lloyd admitted, as per Awful Announcing. “I voiced my concern several years ago, I voiced my concerns when I left the team, I voiced my concern to the team when I was at the Olympics, when we were competing for that Bronze Medal game. And I haven't seen much that has changed.

“From a tactical perspective, it's been the same. It's been very predictable. Players don't seem to be cohesive on the field, don't seem to be playing in synchronicity."

Lloyd went on to claim that “There's something not right,” adding: “And it's not one thing, there's multiple things that have just been spiraling out of control, and now it's being revealed on the world's biggest stage. You can't get away with doing all of these things for so many years.”

Lloyd's comments drew plenty of criticism, including from Andonovski, who called her comments “insane.”

However, the likes of USMNT legend Alexi Lalas, who works with Lloyd at FOX, backed her amid a barrage of criticism, describing her as “wonderful” following her viral rant.

"While we're not all wired the same, I think we do share that when we are talking about our national teams, because we're talking about our country and we want this to go well. We also want to have pride in terms of what is going on on the field," Lalas said.

“And yes, it's a whole new day here in terms of getting out of the group. They've got to fix some things going forward, the criticism they got I think is warranted, and fair. But there also is a belief that maybe there is another team hiding behind this one, maybe, big maybe, that can do better. Because if not, they're going to go home quick.”

Now two years removed from the USWNT's disastrous World Cup defense, Lloyd will return to the FOX studio starting with the Euros, which kicks off on July 2.

Mario Canseco, president of Research Co., says the costs of hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup may be impacted by world events and conflicts, such as potential security costs related to Iran's soccer team qualifying for the tournament. He broke things down for BC Today host Michelle Eliot.

We are learning how much more B.C. taxpayers will pay to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The international soccer tournament runs next summer with Vancouver hosting 7 games. The province says the cost has climbed to more than $600 million. Richard Zussman has more.

All my Criterion Collection baddies, this one's for you.

The province says it will cost more than previously expected to host seven matches in Vancouver for the 2026 FIFA World Cup games. It now estimates the price tag will be between $532 million and $642 million. Higher security costs are one factor, but the tourism minister insists it will be worth it.

The US dollar is weakening against other currencies. It's the opposite of what many on Wall Street had expected this year, and a sign of just how unusual markets have behaved in President Donald Trump's second term.

The Boston Bruins are entering this off-season with plenty of cap space and are in a position to do some spending because of it. When looking at their current roster, one of their biggest needs right now is another top-six winger.

The one big thing experts agree on when it comes to the goalie situation of the Edmonton Oilers is that it's time for change, even if that is for change itself.

Let's break down the top point guards in this year's free-agent market.

On Monday, TSN's Bob McKenzie released his final draft ranking. Unsurprisingly, Matthew Schaefer from the Erie Oters leads the way just ahead of Michael Misa and Porter Martone. Anton Frondell and Caleb Desnoyers complete the top five. But unless there is a significant coup by Kent Hughes before the first round kicks off on Friday night, all these players will be long gone from the board when the Montreal Canadiens make their first selection at 16th overall.

Patrick Reed, known as Captain America for his Ryder Cup excellence, chimed in on whether Keegan Bradley should be a playing captain at Bethpage.

Imagine you grew up in Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro or Mexico City and you love soccer.

But because your domestic league isn't the best in the world, and because your nation's best players eventually move on to clubs in Europe, you don't follow it. Instead, you stay at home and watch games from across the ocean. And you insist your friends who regularly frequent the Azteca or the Bombonera aren't authentic fans, because they root for an inferior product.

It's the kind of chatter that would guarantee a bar fight most places. Yet in too many corners of American soccer fandom, it's become accepted that your Peacock Premium subscription offers a better value than a ticket in an MLS or USL supporters section.

Perhaps the FIFA Club World Cup will change that.

Yes, the play of Brazilian clubs in particular has impressed so far. But the tournament's more lasting legacy in America may be the tens of thousands of passionate supporters from South and Central America, North Africa and even East Asia who have literally taken over stadiums, mass transit systems and public plazas throughout the group stage.

In the process, they've shown at least a few Yanks that your street cred isn't less simply because you don't pay your season ticket bill in euros or pound sterling.

From the Xeneizes in South Florida to the Red Devils in Seattle, fans from all corners of the globe have brought an energy rarely seen at American NFL stadiums, even if their numbers weren't always enough to completely fill such cavernous venues.

Those supporters, whose countries have produced Messi, Neymar, Achraf Hakimi and Mo Salah, are well aware their teams and their leagues aren't the best on Earth.

They've watched as the European scouts come and cherry-pick the best talent to take across the Atlantic or Mediterranean, before that talent has even completed the transition from adolescence to manhood.

And yet they live and breathe every single moment with their clubs because what they see in them is their identity: themselves, their families, their cities and their nationalities.

Critics may argue American fans are handicapped from making similar investments in a sporting product unless they believe it to be an elite product. It's a nonsensical take once you realize our second-most popular sport literally involves watching college students beat the bejesus out of each other for three-and-a-half hours, 12 fall Saturdays a year.

It's a fairer critique that MLS clubs haven't built the same cultural collateral as a big-time college football program or a storied South American soccer club. The only ones that come close typically benefit from histories that precede MLS, either in the original NASL or, more recently, the A-League or the USL Championship. And MLS hasn't helped itself in recent years by (poorly) mimicking European soccer culture and (greedily) charging English soccer prices.

Even so, in the end there's only one fundamental difference between a Botafogo fan in Rio and a Fire fan in Chicago: When the Botafogo fan goes to work on Monday, there's no jerk in the break room who tells him he's never seen an MLS game because he only watches Chelsea.

If anything, that makes American fans of MLS and USL even more impressive, exactly because their versions of the sport are less popular than they should be.

Don't get it wrong. Plenty of Americans watch all the soccer they can get — local and foreign, men's and women's, all of it. And there's nothing wrong with following the Premier League or the Champions League. They're both fabulously entertaining.

But supporting the local game makes you more of a true fan, not less. Hopefully that's become a little clearer amid the wonderful true supporters who have flocked all over the globe to see their local sides at the Club World Cup.

Luis Rubiales, the former president of Spain's football federation, has lost an appeal against his sexual assault conviction.  

Rubiales was fined €10,800 (£9,206) in February for kissing captain Jenni Hermoso without her consent after Spain's women's team won the 2023 World Cup.

A Spanish appeals court upheld the fine, and also dismissed a separate appeal from prosecutors, who had sought a retrial and pushed for a jail sentence.

The incident - in which Rubiales grabbed Hermoso's head and kissed her on the lips - triggered protests and calls for his resignation. 

He denied the sexual assault charge, describing the kiss as an "act of affection" and "completely spontaneous". 

On Wednesday, the Audencia Nacional said it did not consider the kiss consensual, and said Hermoso had objected to it from the outset.

It found that Rubiales "restrained himself" when interacting with other players and "could also have done so, without too much effort, with the captain".

At the original trial, Hermoso said she had not given permission for the kiss, which she felt "disrespected" her and "stained one of the happiest days" of her life.

The court upheld the sentence handed down in February, which included a ban on Rubiales going within a 200m radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year.

The court also upheld the decision not to convict Rubiales of coercion. 

Prosecutors had alleged he pressured Hermoso into publicly saying the kiss was consensual, which Rubiales denied.

Three other former Spanish football federation employees - coach Jorge Vila, marketing executive Rubén Rivera and sporting director Albert Luque - were previously cleared of coercion, a decision which was upheld on Wednesday.

The Athletic has live coverage of Dortmund vs Ulsan from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

FIFA is throwing a gala to “celebrate” the Club World Cup at a venue on Wall Street in New York City – and attendees are being charged thousands of dollars to party with its President Gianni Infantino and, according to the co-organizers, FIFA World Cup stars.

The co-organizers Big Art (an international event management company) promoted the event on Instagram with an attached link to book tickets via a WhatsApp sales representative.

The representative described the event as “the official celebration of the FIFA Club World Cup finals.” The event promised a headline performance by the British popstar Rita Ora and “world class entertainment curated throughout the night.”

Ticket prices start at $1,000 per person for a silver category entry, rising to $2,000 for platinum entry and $3,000 for a black category entry. Promotion on Big Art's Facebook page said the “VIP event will gather Legends of the game, FIFA's top leadership and a handpicked guest list of international figures from business, fashion and culture.”

A sales representative said in their opening message on WhatsApp that Infantino will attend, before adding that Kaka, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Roberto Baggio will also be there. All four players have either been involved in sponsorship activations, or spoken positively about the tournament or attended games with FIFA during the Club World Cup.

The event is scheduled to take place on July 10, a day after the second semi-final and three days before the final.

A spokesperson for FIFA confirmed FIFA and Big Art are working together on a gala dinner and that FIFA is both attending and co-branding. It added that FIFA attendees are still to be confirmed.

The Big Art sales representative also said that this paid-for entry represented a “rare opportunity to align your brand with FIFA and engage directly with global decision-makers, influencers and icons from across the world.”

FIFA did not comment when asked by The Athletic what role it had in the pricing of the event, or whether it is appropriate for individuals or brands to spend thousands of dollars to engage directly with FIFA leadership.

FIFA said it would not receive any revenue from the event but had not replied by the point of publication about who the revenue will go to.

FIFA subsequently promoted the event on its website, without mentioning the prices, but said that the night “will begin with a cocktail reception, followed by a gala dinner featuring world-class cuisine, fine wines and high-end production befitting the truly historic and game changing tournament.”

Big Art have been contacted for comment.

Last month, the first ticketing packages for next summer's men's World Cup went on sale with the release of a collection of high-end hospitality options.

The initial release was limited to certain hospitality offerings involving several games packaged together, starting at $3,500 (£2,625) per person and climbing to an eye-popping $73,200 (£54,750).

Switzerland's women's national team faced Luzern's U15 boys' team in a friendly.

While the radical left would like everyone to believe that men possess no inherent physical advantage when it comes to sports, that defies all reality, biology and common sense. If you need proof of that – although you shouldn't – take a look at what happened to the Switzerland Women's National Team on Wednesday. 

As part of their preparation for the upcoming Euro 2025 tournament, they faced Luzern's U15 boys' team in a friendly match. Yes, U15 stands for "under 15 years old," which means the boys' team comprises players 14 and younger. One might think that adult females – especially the best of the bunch in an entire country – might have a chance against male teenagers who have barely reached puberty. 

As part of their preparation for the upcoming Women's Euro 2025 tournament, Switzerland's National Team lost to the Luzern's U15 boys' team in a friendly match, 7-1.

However, the physical advantage that boys possess over girls was on full display in Wednesday's match. Not only did Luzern beat Switzerland, they demolished them in a 7-1 result. If you're not familiar with soccer, giving up seven goals in a match is … a lot. 

This isn't the first time we've seen a professional women's soccer team lose to boys. The U.S. Women's National Team, which was the best women's soccer team in the world at the time, lost to a U15 boys' team from Dallas, Texas back in 2015. Carli Lloyd, a player on that USWNT squad, admitted that the mid-pubescent teenage boys were "bigger, stronger and faster" than the adult professional-soccer-playing women. 

Yes, the best female soccer players in all of America lost 5-2 to a team of boys from the Dallas, Texas area. But, hey, there's no advantage for men over women in sports, right?

Well, not good...

Bayern Munich's 1-0 loss to Benfica in Charlotte, North Carolina was costly in a few ways. Winning the group would have had several key benefits for Bayern Munich, which are now off the table (per Kicker via @iMiaSanMia): 

• Financially, a win is rewarded with €2m, a draw with €1m

• Bayern would avoid the tougher path to the final (as things stand) with PSG, Inter, Real Madrid, Man City 

• The quarterfinal would be played at night time (9 p.m. local time) instead of a physically demanding midday match with the heat 

The strategy for Bayern Munich in this tourney was peculiar to say the least. Willing to play Jamal Musiala against Auckland City FC and Boca Juniors when he was not needed was odd, but to heavily rotate in the Benfica match when the team needed a win was the real head scratcher. 

Bayern Munich must rotate more effectively than it did last season, but there is a time and place for everything. In such a key match vs. Benfica — with so much at stake, it could have been assumed that head coach Vincent Kompany would have played this match a little more close to a real knockout game.

World Cup

Just under one year out from the first men's World Cup to be held in the United States since 1994, there is no shortage of challenges for the organizers of the competition and the U.S. government as they prepare to share the tournament with Canada and Mexico next summer.

The build-up to the world's most popular sporting event has already been overshadowed, at times, by trade wars between the U.S. and other countries, tensions over President Donald Trump administration's policies towards immigration and lengthy visa wait times for foreign visitors who may wish to attend the tournament. There have also been tensions with co-hosts Canada and Mexico, with the start of Trump's second term dominated by tariffs and his suggestions that Canada should become part of the U.S. He also renamed the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.

U.S. Congressman Darin LaHood, a Republican who serves the constituents of the 16th District of Illinois, is one of the keenest advocates of soccer within U.S. politics, co-chairing the bipartisan congressional soccer caucus. He has also been present at events organized by the White House Task Force on the FIFA World Cup 2026, which is dedicated to leading and coordinating federal efforts in support of the event.

He has recently called for Trump to enact an executive order to protect the American skies from the threat of drones during the World Cup, and he spoke to The Athletic about:

Below are his answers, lightly edited for length and clarity. This interview took place prior to the U.S. airstrikes on Iran – a nation that has already qualified for the World Cup.

The Athletic: One year out from the World Cup, what are the political priorities for you between now and the tournament?

Rep. LaHood: From a practical standpoint, I view this through the lens of what the government needs to do and what we need to do to make this a successful World Cup. To create the (White House World Cup) task force was a monumental step. This put staff in place that understand the ramifications of what needs to get done; people who are attentive at the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, Department of Justice and at the FBI. We now have people engaged. They know there are asks that need to be fulfilled.

A lot of work still needs to be done on the processing of visas, as well as on the security apparatus, and particularly on drones. Then we have the logistics of getting people here and coordinating with Mexico, Canada and the 11 U.S. host cities.

World Cup organizer FIFA claims the combined impact of the Club World Cup and World Cup will be $47 billion to the U.S. economy, but this is surely very dependent on foreign travel. Are you at all concerned that perceptions of the United States at the moment may dissuade people from coming to the country?

Of course, I'm concerned. I just saw some data that showed tourism from Canada to the United States is down 40 percent. We've seen in a number of tourist destinations in the United States this year that tourism is down: in Las Vegas, New York and Florida.

We're aware of where some of that comes from because of some of the immigration policies and other things. However, I wouldn't rush to judgment that it is going to affect the World Cup. Soccer and sport transcend in many ways politics and geopolitics. There's plenty of opportunity to roll out a good PR welcoming message from the United States, and there will be people in the administration who will be engaged.

There are a number of people that FIFA and the White House want to engage with: partnering with footballers from Europe, Africa or South America. There is a plan in place to make sure that we are welcoming and that we attract people from all over the world, so we are sending the right message, particularly for the World Cup.

The White House recognizes that we have to get it right with the World Cup in 2026, because there's a legacy of events that are going to occur in the United States: the Olympics in 2028, the Women's World Cup in 2031, the Winter Olympics in 2034, the Rugby World Cups in 2031 and 2033. It's important to set the precedent here by getting it right.

The president has said this will have a $40 billion economic impact on the U.S. But that is contingent on having visitors who want to come here, enjoy the United States, spend their money and watch a world-class sporting event.

Andrew Giuliani, son of Trump's former lawyer and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, is leading the White House's Task Force. Do you think he was the best person for that job? 

Andrew Giuliani is the executive director but he's also co-equals with Carlos Cordeiro, who is with FIFA (Cordeiro is a senior advisor to FIFA president Gianni Infantino and a former U.S. Soccer president). That combination is positive moving forward.

Andrew has enthusiastically embraced the job. He's brought a lot of energy. He's been very attentive to the issues that have been raised. He's put together a good team around him. He asks all the important questions. He understands the enormity of the job and what it entails. So far, he's doing everything that he's been asked to do. He has the ear of the president. He understands the whole of government approach that this is going to take to get implemented. There are learning aspects of this job, but so far he's tackling those head-on.

FIFA has adopted a dynamic pricing model for the Club World Cup. From a Congressional Soccer Caucus perspective, as someone trying to grow this sport, are you at all worried that ordinary people might be priced out of the World Cup? 

Well, I hope not. We'll see what happens next year when the pricing comes out for the World Cup.

Do you think FIFA should give something back to local communities by ringfencing some ticketing to make it accessible? 

There's a lot of discretion there and a lot of flexibility with how they want to handle that. There's going to be a real emphasis on youth soccer, young people and getting them engaged with the fan zones.

Does that mean everybody's going to get into a stadium to watch a game? Maybe not, but my own experience from being at the World Cup or Euros (European Championships) is that these fan zones with big TVs outside of the stadium are very enjoyable for fans to partake in. If we do it the right way, we are going to enhance the game tremendously and continue to grow the game here. We can't lose sight of that from a congressional soccer standpoint. We're keenly aware of that. If and when we need to push FIFA in a particular direction, we're prepared to do that.

Before the Club World Cup, the CBP in Florida was posting on Facebook about how it was going to be “suited and booted” to support FIFA during the first round of games. United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) subsequently confirmed they may attend games. Are you concerned about the message that sends?

I'm not concerned about that, I've been in touch with FIFA people. Some of that is more of a reflection on some of the protests we've seen in Los Angeles and related to that spillover. I don't think it has anything to do with people wanting to check the immigration status of people coming in. That's not something that's been on my radar screen.

Visa wait times have improved considerably over the past year. But there have now been cuts made to the State Department, so is there a concern they may lengthen again?

Colombia was at 700 days and they've been reduced to 400 days. It's coming down. I think seeing the progress being made there, that's going to be replicated in other areas where it needs to get done. I'm not concerned about cuts in the State Department… There's not going to be cuts on the folks that are going to make the World Cup a success.

We have to have people who feel comfortable and can come here under the visa regime that we have in place and have proper security protocols in place. So my sense is there's going to be adequate and appropriate funding through the State Department to effectuate that.

Focusing on the soccer, is the USMNT going to hit form? And what have you made of some players electing not to go to the Gold Cup this summer, as well as Mauricio Pochettino's first few months in charge?

Well, to be honest with you, I almost wish we had to qualify for the World Cup because that level of competition would have been better. On paper, I like our new coach. He brings a lot to the table, but there seems to be a lackadaisical approach with our players.

These were two friendlies and I shouldn't put much stock into friendlies, but people are getting worried. There's a nervousness about the current team and the level of commitment. But right now, it's not there.

Jeff Kassouf and Cristina Alexander discuss Emma Hayes' squad for the upcoming friendlies against Ireland and Canada. (0:53)

Since last year's Olympic gold medal triumph, U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes has been handing out international debuts like Oprah Winfrey's Ultimate Car Giveaway: "You get a cap! You get a cap!"

Four players joined their first senior USWNT training camp this week, bringing Hayes' tally to 27 first-time call-ups since arriving on the sidelines just over a year ago. Nineteen players to date have earned their first USWNT caps under Hayes.

All of which has amounted to the most drastic overhaul in the 40-year history of the world's most successful international women's soccer team. Recent USWNT lineups have been the youngest and least experienced in over two decades.

However, this phase of drastic experimentation is ending soon.

Hayes recently told ESPN that, after this window, which includes a pair of games against Ireland and a friendly against Canada over the next seven days, she expects to have narrowed down her roster to the core of players she will lean on at World Cup qualifying next year, and at the 2027 Women's World Cup.

Effectively, that makes this week a final in-person audition for some hopefuls trying to break through and climb the U.S. depth chart. There will be no more chances for players to prove they belong before FIFA's international calendar keeps the team apart until October.

This is an inflection point for the USWNT pool, which expanded over the past year but will soon become focused on a core group of players again soon. As Hayes raved about some of the newcomers to the USWNT roster last week, she said she made those personnel decisions "knowing that this is probably the last moment we will be considering players from outside that net with the volume that we are."

Hayes has assembled a roster of almost entirely NWSL-based players as she analyzes who can make an impact internationally and who is just an exceptional league player -- an important distinction that the coach recently highlighted. The coach's task will be to evaluate how players do in this ongoing camp in addition to the previous four training camps this year.

As such, there is undoubtedly an urgency for some players to impress the USWNT coach right now. This week is their last shot to make their case to Hayes while she's standing a few feet away on the training field or in the meeting room -- integral parts of team selection that are almost entirely shielded from the public eye.

USWNT manager Emma Hayes joins "Futbol W" to reveal why certain players have been left out of the roster for their upcoming international fixtures.

Goalkeeper is the position where the most urgency is needed. Angelina Anderson, Claudia Dickey and Mandy McGlynn have a combined three caps (all for McGlynn, and all from the past seven months). They've all had strong moments (and some low points) in NWSL play, but they haven't had much face time with Hayes.

All three goalkeepers will be under increased scrutiny at this camp with more experienced players missing -- and they might be fighting to join Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who looks like the favored No. 1 based on recent lineups.

A large group of mostly inexperienced defenders, along with the three goalkeepers in camp, will have another chance to build rapport with all-world defender Naomi Girma, the only European-based player on the most recent USWNT roster. Remove the experience of Girma and Emily Sonnett, and the other eight defenders combined have 18 caps.

Tara McKeown and Emily Sams appear to have established themselves as the next center backs in line on the depth chart. They've each been solid in the NWSL and Sams already has an Olympic gold medal (earned before her first cap, uniquely) after surfacing on Hayes' radar last year.

But the fullback position outside of Emily Fox (who got the camp off to rest) is still anyone's guess. Hayes is still looking for answers -- and she's using this final experimentation window to widen her search. Kerry Abello just earned her first cap there earlier this month, Avery Patterson debuted earlier this year, and Izzy Rodriguez and Lilly Reale (whom Hayes called "outstanding" and "top class" for NJ/NY Gotham FC this season) are two of the first-time call-ups on this roster.

All four players have been standouts in the NWSL, and this is their last chance for a while to earn an in-person evaluation by Hayes and her staff. It is also the chance to leave a strong in-person impression for some of the newer regulars (relatively speaking) like forwards Michelle Cooper, Yazmeen Ryan and Emma Sears, to make a breakthrough.

There are wrinkles to this squad selection process, however, and Hayes was quick to point out that what's best for each player will not look like linear progress to the public. The absence of a player from the team in the future doesn't rule her out of Hayes' plans entirely.

Eighteen-year-old Jordyn Bugg, for example, joined the USWNT for the first time this week, but Hayes said she expects to have Bugg play for the U-23s and in the U-20 World Cup in the future "because that's in the best interest of her long-term development strategy." Hayes used Bugg as an example of how the team also needs to prepare for the 2028 Olympics and 2031 World Cup, which will each be played on home soil.

Attacking midfielder Jaedyn Shaw is the present-day example of this fluidity. Shaw has struggled to fit in with the North Carolina Courage after an offseason trade, and she has spent the most recent two international windows with the U-23s. Hayes has repeatedly lauded Shaw and said that the talented playmaker will be a big part of the USWNT going forward. If she can find her feet in the league -- she just scored her first goal for the Courage in a crucial win on Saturday -- she should be in Hayes' mix come October.

Hayes is a studious coach who says she watches everything, whether in person or on late-night streams from her home in England. Recent history supports the notion that she will call up players based on their league form, but Hayes keeps reminding everyone that she "can only pick the players that are available" rather than "the very best 23, 26 players."

Except for one game, Hayes has not had her entire starting forward line of Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson or Sophia Wilson available since the Olympics last August.

"I think anybody that's called up at any given time -- I want everybody to know that we'll watch every game, and if there is a drop in form or there is a drop in consistency, it doesn't necessarily mean that players leave that pool," Hayes told ESPN. "But we expect you to keep pushing all the time because we know what the quality is like worldwide."

Come October, Hayes will assemble a roster that will largely consist of the players tasked with qualifying for and winning the 2027 World Cup. There will be plenty of personnel and lineup changes over the next two years along that journey to Brazil, but this week is the last opportunity for many players to insert themselves directly into Hayes' vision for success at the 2027 World Cup.

Failure to do so won't necessarily mark the end of the USWNT dream for players, but it will make it more difficult to get back into the mix. Hayes wants to have a core group set ahead of the USWNT's games in October, and Hayes has already accrued a decent sample size of evidence over the past six to eight months of extended auditions.

Against Ireland and Canada -- and in the trainings in between -- players will have one more golden chance to show they can contribute on the big stage.

Eight countries are unable to compete in qualification for the World Cup as FIFA does not recognise them as official nations.

A total of 210 nations were permitted to enter the qualifying stages for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Out of those nations, Congo withdrew from their remaining fixtures earlier this year after their football association, FECAFOOT, was briefly suspended by FIFA.

And Eritrea - who haven't played a competitive match in five years - pulled out of qualification before it began, with The Guardian claiming its governing body are concerned that players will seek political asylum in opposing nations due to the conditions in the country.

The African nation are still recognised by FIFA so can return to competitive international football at any point.

But there are eight countries who are still not recognised by football's governing body:

Football has been played in the Vatican City since the 16th century, but the papal residence is still not an official part of UEFA.

Advert

Men's and women's sides often play friendlies against Italian clubs, and football has been popular among several popes.

Pope Francis supported Argentine giants San Lorenzo and reportedly held talks with UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin about potential Vatican City membership ahead of the Euro 2020 final.

The current pope, Pope Leo, is also connected to sport. He is a big fan of baseball, has been described as 'quite the amateur tennis player', and appeared to indicate his support for Serie A side Roma last month. 

Micronesia's football association, along with the British writer Paul Watson, administered a futsal competition in 2023 in an attempt to push them closer to FIFA membership or recognition. 

Advert

Their uphill battle, though, is highlighted by a pure lack of resources.

In 2015, their under-23 team was entered into the Pacific Games, being drawn against Tahiti, Fiji and Vanuatu.

They subsequently conceded 114 goals across their three games without scoring, with their biggest defeat being 46-0 to Vanuatu. One opposition player scored 16 goals.

Nauru are perhaps the closest team on this list to gaining membership of a continental governing body.

Advert

Plans are in place to rebuild the nation's grassroots schemes, and they would have players with Nauru heritage living in Australia to call upon if they were admitted to the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC).

Backed by Reading icon Dave Kitson, the nation invited a Royals XI team to face them in a one-off match, though the fixture has not yet taken place.

The principality is the jewel of the crown in several sports, such as Formula 1, while AS Monaco are one of France's top football clubs.

Advert

At international level, however, the Monegasque Football Federation is not a member of UEFA or FIFA and therefore Monaco cannot play in World Cups.

Most of the men's team is made up of local workers, with a minority of those having professional experience.

Were Monaco ever to be admitted to UEFA, the likes of PSV star Olivier Boscagli - who was born in the principality state - could play for them.

Palau are the 16th smallest country in the world, with the ELO Ratings ranking them as the second-worst football nation at present.

The Palau Soccer League - the nation's only football division - was due to be relaunched in October 2024 on their only football-specific pitch.

There are records of Kiribati playing football as far back as 1979, while they were formerly regulars at the Pacific Games.

But there is no record of any competitive match since 2011 for the men's team, and 2003 for the women's team.

They were due to enter the Confederation of Island Football Associations (CONIFA) World Football Cup in 2018, but withdrew due to financial reasons. 

Tuvalu are in a different position to some nations on this list as they have a men's and women's domestic structure.

They are already part of CONIFA and are regular competitors at the Pacific Games.

Some of their players have competed for Australian A-League sides, while their top scorer, Alopou Petoa, formerly played in the top amateur division in New Zealand.

Just under a year from now, Kansas City plans to welcome hundreds of thousands of soccer fans from all over the world for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The most televised sporting event on the planet, the World Cup will put Kansas City on the international mainstage like never before, showcasing a vibrant soccer city on the level of Mexico City, Los Angeles, Toronto and New York.

"We're really excited about the opportunity that gives us to really rise on the world stage, and demonstrate why Kansas City is a great place to live and come to visit for these kinds of events," says Lindsey Douglas who is the COO of KC2026 — the nonprofit responsible for event preparation.

Kansas City is the smallest host city in North America to participate, and it's been building up to this moment for decades.

The metro is home to professional teams like Sporting KC and the Current, which is the first professional women's team in the world to get their own stadium. Fans can join epic watch parties in the Power & Light District, and find games of all experience levels around the region.

But Kansas City may not have embraced this sport at all, if it hadn't been for the immigrants who first advocated for and educated people about the beautiful game — back before the city even had soccer fields to play on.

“Soccer is still what you would call an underdog sport,” says G.E. White, author of the book, “Soccer in American Culture: The Beautiful Game's Struggle For Status.”

By most accounts, the game we've come to know today as soccer came from the United Kingdom in the 1800s. Schools across the country played their own versions of the sport, but the rules could differ widely: Can you touch the ball with your hands, or tackle other players?

According to White, a group of players in 1863 established “association football” with its own set of regulations separate from sports like rugby. “They decided to have a completely foot-oriented game,” White says.

Now with its own governing body, association football spread to British colonies, throughout the rest of Europe, and into the New World.

(As for why the United States mostly calls the sport “soccer,” White says that's actually a British nickname, a contraction of the word “association.”)

During the late 19th century, the United States underwent an industrial boom, as a large number of immigrants from Great Britain, Ireland, Portugal and other European countries moved here to work manufacturing jobs. Those workers brought soccer with them to cities on the East Coast and Midwest.

It's actually St. Louis, on the other side of Missouri, that's considered the first soccer capitol in the U.S. Between hosting the 1904 Olympics and World's Fair, this multinational manufacturing hub did a lot to establish some of the early national soccer infrastructure.

“It was always these immigrant enclaves within these cities that you'd find the soccer teams,” says Cris Medina, who is a descendant of one of these early trailblazers in Kansas City.

Teams formed out of businesses, athletic clubs and churches, since the sport offered a way to decompress and socialize. But both soccer and the immigrants who played it got labeled as outsiders.

“There's a certain amount of stereotyping, negative stereotyping of immigrant groups, and all of this results in soccer being identified as an immigrant sport,” White says.



It's hard to paint a full picture of how soccer first started in Kansas City, because there was so little being written about immigrant communities, in addition to the significant language barrier.

But old newspapers clippings, from The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times, offer glimpses at different pieces of the puzzle.

One of the first people to start a soccer team in Kansas City was J.T. Gallagher in December 1906. A former St. Louis player, Gallagher had moved to Kansas City and was “looking for more recruits” to meet him at Association Park (once located at 20th Street and Prospect Avenue) to try out. His team would later be dubbed “J.T. Gallagher's Regulars.”

Into the 1920s through the 40s, other makeshift teams get mentioned as playing matches around the city: The Thistles, Shmelzers, Tigers, St. George, the Shamrocks, Hutchison Electric, German Turners, Hibernians, Victorians, McFarland Upholsterers, Heine's Kickers.

The Kansas City Athletic Club had a team, as did the Young Men's Hebrew Association. There was a Catholic Youth Council team and members of a group called the Kansas City Soccer Club. They carved out makeshift places to play at 39th and Gillham, Westport high school, Swope Park and Parade Park.

But soccer remained, for the most part, out of the mainstream.

In schools, kids were mostly taught American-made sports. And when soccer did get played, as in Kansas City, its season fell typically in the worst slot of the year — the winter — between the football and baseball schedules.

“You can't really play soccer in the Midwest or northeast in the winter unless you want to play on a field that's covered with snow or ice and that's difficult,” White says.

Even those conditions, however, couldn't stop Kansas City's soccer lovers — such as José Portuguez, a Costa Rican immigrant, and my grandfather.

For my senior project in college — two decades ago now — my family and I traveled to Costa Rica with my grandpa. I documented our journey, and the stories my family told.

My grandpa José was funny. He loved to dance and laugh, and he adored soccer.

“He said he was born with a soccer ball,” said my mom, Vallie Portuguez Hogan.

José Portuguez died back in 2021, when he was 97 years old. And I always knew vaguely that he was also a part of the reason Kansas City became a soccer town.

He arrived in Lawrence, Kansas, in the 1940s to study engineering at the University of Kansas. There, José helped organize an intramural soccer league of international students, and even coordinated tournaments with nearby schools — driving hours to games around Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.

“They'd have a barbecue, they'd cook out,” describes Jim Portuguez, my uncle and José Portuguez's son. “Drink beer, eat steak, talk about their homes, talk about how well they played.”

Soccer players were hungry for community, because it could be lonely outside of that world. They faced cultural and language barriers, as well as outright discrimination, and often struggled to fit in.

Jim says players were constantly fighting for respect, and field space.

“They would tease them and say, ‘Oh, that's an easy game, anybody can play that. It's not like a real game, you know, a hardy game like American football,'” Jim Portuguez recounts. Even though that attitude would irritate him, José would stay cool, and use the opportunity to teach them more about the game.

After José graduated from KU, he married his college girlfriend — my grandmother — and in the 1950s moved to Kansas City. They started a family while José worked as an engineer, but my grandpa looked for any chance he could to play soccer.

My family says he found remnants of those early immigrant teams around the city and region, in Parkville, Leavenworth and St. Joseph.

But to get soccer taken seriously in Kansas City, he would need a friend. And he found one in Augustin “Chino” Medina.

“Chino” Medina was a professional soccer player in Mexico, and he was a star. As a player for Atlas and other bigtime teams, Medina was twice the national scoring champion. (“Pelo chino,” means curly hair in Spanish.)

Towards the end of his career, Chino met his wife: a woman from Kansas City's Westside, who would come to Mexico to see her family.

When his wife got too homesick, in the 1950s Chino followed her to the Westside. But the transition was hard for him. He had never lived in the United States, and didn't speak English.

“He would cry, he would tell me he'd pick radishes and nopales and work in the fields just to have some work, because he didn't have skills at the time that were applicable where he could find a job to maintain his family,” Cris Medina says of his father.

It was at church that Chino Medina found support. Specifically, at Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish, and the Guadalupe Center — of which Cris Medina is the former director.

The Guadalupe Center was formed in the 1910s, a time when the construction of the railroad and the Mexican Revolution brought a large wave of Mexican immigrants to the Westside, and around the tracks in Kansas City, Kansas.

Its mission today is to help improve the lives of Latinos in Kansas City, but the center was originally created to offer services and help “Americanize” these new arrivals. The organization provided health care and educational opportunities like English lessons, and it promoted American activities.

“They wanted the immigrants to play American sports,” Cris Medina explains. “So baseball, basketball… and they had football, six man tackle and stuff like that.”

By the time Chino Medina had arrived, though, the Guadalupe Center had been taken over by Mexicans, who instead focused on Mexican pride rather than assimilation to white culture.

An associate priest from Spain named Ignacio Orozco, who worked at the church, formed a recreational soccer team called Guadalupe. And they were more than happy to welcome Chino Medina to play with them.

“They were just like, ‘Man, this can't be true. This guy's a star soccer player in Mexico and he's going to come play with us?'” Cris Medina recalls.



Kansas City's soccer players eventually grew tired of holding games and practices on baseball or football fields. They had outgrown park fields with DIY goals.

So according to Jim Portuguez Chino Medina and my grandpa arranged a meeting with the mayor of Kansas City, Harold Roe Bartle. 

Known by his nickname “The Chief,” Bartle loved sports and eventually played a big role in convincing the Dallas Texans football team to move to Kansas City.

Medina and Portuguez made the case to Bartle: Their sport was growing, it didn't need a lot of equipment, but they did need soccer fields of their own. No more competing with other sports for space.

Plus, soccer was a healthy activity, and good for the kids. “I think that's what got the mayor's interest,” says Jim Portuguez.

They got the greenlight to install official soccer fields at city parks like Gilham and Swope with goals and bleachers. To guys like my grandpa, this was a big deal, because it showed these players that they had buy-in from the city.

Armando Diaz and Salvador Gomez remember playing on those fields with Chino and José. Both men are from Mexico, and joined the team “Los Latinos,” which evolved out of that earlier Guadalupe team.

According to Diaz, securing the fields at Swope helped Los Latinos become a more formalized team in the late 1950s. Of course, it was still hard to find some of the other basics like balls and uniforms, so team members like Diaz went down to Mexico to retrieve some.

“There was nothing here, nothing,” Diaz recalled in a 2018 interview.

Diaz said that other teams formed in time. One of Los Latinos' friendly rivals was “Los Internationales,” a group of immigrants from Hungary, Croatia, France, Germany and other parts of Europe.

Despite their language and cultural differences, these soccer-playing immigrants formed deep connections.

“And the Europeans didn't speak English either,” Diaz told me with a laugh. “And we didn't speak English. So the only thing that keep us together was the little ball right there… because that's the only language that we knew.”

Cris Medina and his siblings remember attending some of those games when they were little. It was a central part of their social lives.

“Making sandwiches and food … tortas to go to the game. That was an all day deal,” Medina recalls.

It seems fitting how much of this soccer scene revolved around feeding people, since feeding the greater soccer family was also part of their mission. Their dad Chino Medina later opened the restaurant La Fonda El Taquito, which has become a staple soccer watching joint on Kansas City's Westside.

These soccer families hosted out of town teams, had parties afterwards, and went to exhibition matches outside of the city. Cris Medina recalls a Polish team in Des Moines, a German team in Omaha, Italians in St. Louis, other Mexicans in Wichita.

This was all being organized by working people, some with kids, in their spare time, all for the love of the game.

Kansas City has come a long way since then. If you go to Swope Park these days, you'll find a hive of soccer activity. The Swope Park Soccer Village, managed by Sporting KC, now boasts six full sized fields, constantly bustling with practices and matches.

An even larger soccer complex now exists in Overland Park, and more pitches have been built in parks and schools across the metro.

Without those critical first pioneers, though, soccer might still have been mostly relegated to backyards or DIY pitches.

Building a home for soccer in Kansas City was a team effort, just like the game itself.

This episode of A People's History of Kansas City was reported, produced, and mixed by Suzanne Hogan with editing by Mackenzie Martin and Gabe Rosenberg.

This is the first installment of a series leading up to the 2026 World Cup in collaboration with the Great Game Lab at Arizona State University, which explores how sport connects U.S. to the rest of the world.

Over the next year, we'll hear about the time Kansas City attracted the biggest soccer star in the world, and the founding of our very first professional team. We'll learn about the sport's ongoing fight for recognition, how women's soccer emerged and then dominated. And we'll find out how Kansas City grew into an international hot bed for both athletes and fans.

Tennis fans will never forget the epic Wimbledon clash between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut, which is still commemorated to this day.

Wimbledon has returned to the tennis calendar, with qualifying now underway for the ATP and WTA main draws at SW19.

The Grand Slam is certain to produce many twists and turns before crowning its champions, but there is one record that simply will never be broken.

Isner and Mahut played out the longest tennis match in history at the tournament in 2010, having been drawn to face each other in round one.

After three days of tennis, the American finally defeated the Frenchman 6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7–9), 7–6(7–3), 70–68.

The pair battled it out on Court 18 at Wimbledon for 11 hours and five minutes, with 23rd seed Isner eventually getting the better of qualifier Mahut.

Isner thinks he and Mahut served really well in the epic encounter, which saw both players hit over 100 aces each.

The former finished the match with a tally of 113, with the latter losing despite hitting 103 aces throughout the intense battle.

However, ace machine Isner failed to repeat such heroics in round two that year, where he fell to Thiemo de Bakker.

Understandably exhausted both physically and mentally, the American lost 6-0, 6-3, 6-2 to the Dutchman.

The loser failed to serve a single ace in the entire match, which fittingly represents the only ever match where he served zero aces.

At 6'10”, Isner has unsurprisingly gone down as one of the best servers in the history of both men's and women's tennis.

He won 16 ATP Tour titles throughout his career, with his stunning ace ability often crucial to those victories.

Mahut's fellow Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard is the current star in that area, leading the way for average aces per match on the ATP Tour.

His figure of 17.0 places him at the very top of the pile, with Isner's fellow American Reilly Opelka second on 16.0.

Jakub Mensik (12.9) and Quentin Halys (12.7) occupy spots three and four respectively, with Halle champion Alexander Bublik (12.2) completing the current top five.

But in terms of the all-time list, star server Ivo Karlovic leads the way with 19.8 average aces per match, with Isner following in second place with 18.7.

The situation does, however, change slightly when it comes to the most aces hit on the ATP Tour, with Isner topping the pile.

The American fired down a phenomenal 14,470 aces from his 772 matches, with Karlovic in second this time with a tally of 13,728 from 694 matches.

Reigning French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz is set to compete in the US Open mixed doubles for the first time after the tournament moved it from overlapping with singles to mid-August.

The Spanish 22-year-old will compete alongside former US Open winner Emma Raducanu. He called the new format "fun," leading former No. 1-ranked doubles player Kristina Mladenovic to pan him and other singles stars set to feature in the competition.

"When you hear Alcaraz or others say they're going to have fun while preparing for the US Open, it's embarrassing," she told Eurosport France. "A Grand Slam is neither preparation nor fun. It's years of sacrifice. When you're little, you dream of winning one—even in doubles."

“In terms of business strategy, it's a brilliant idea. But from a sporting perspective, it's problematic because it touches on the very essence of tennis. There's no issue with holding such an event, but above all, don't call it a Grand Slam."

Alcaraz and Raducanu are not the only stars set to compete. Men's No. 1 Jannik Sinner will partner with Emma Navarro, while four-time US Open winner Novak Djokovic is set to play with Olga Danilovi.

“I'm super excited about it,” Alcaraz explained at Queen's. “I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament.“I will try to bring my doubles skills. We will try to win, but obviously it's going to be really, really fun.”

Alacaraz competed with fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the 2024 Paris Olympics, though they fell to the American duo Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram in the quarterfinals.

Mladenovic is also an accomplished singles player: the two-time Grand Slam quarterfinalist was once ranked as high as tenth in the world.

She earned her bones in doubles. She's a three-time mixed doubles winner and a seven-time standard doubles winner.

Mladenovic was a 2023 US Open finalist but has not won the competition. Mladenovic is not set to compete in mixed doubles at the 2025 US Open against the likes of Djokovic and Raducanu.

A Grand Slam is a competition steeped in history, in singles and doubles. And now, all of a sudden, the doubles become a super exhibition without anyone or anything having a say. "There's no problem putting on such an event, but above all, don't call it a Grand Slam!"

While winning any Grand Slam is a monumental accomplishment in tennis, winning Wimbledon remains the peak of the sport. Since the tournament started in 1877, it's remained tennis' most prestigious event. When you think of tennis, Wimbledon immediately comes to mind.

The 2025 tournament is set to kick off soon, and plenty of the big names will be looking to win it all. On the men's side, Carlos Alcaraz will look to carry his French Open momentum forward. Alcaraz will head into Wimbledon as the No. 2 ranked men's player, behind Jannik Sinner, who Alcaraz defeated to win the French Open. Alcarez has won Wimbledon the last two years, so he's no stranger to success at the event.

On the women's side, Barbora Krejcikova will look to defend her crown after taking down some tough competition last year. But a number of higher-ranked women will look to prove themselves after disappointing performances at Wimbledon in 2024. Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek both suffered early losses at the tournament. Women's No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka had to withdraw from the event due to a shoulder injury. That should give Krejcikova plenty of competition as she looks to repeat.

With Wimbledon 2025 just around the corner, here's everything you need to know about the prestigious event, including the dates, schedule and draw for the tournament.

Wimbledon 2025 will begin Monday, June 30. The event will progress until the middle of July, with the women's final being held Saturday, July 12. The men's final will occur the following day.

That's fairly standard for the event, which normally begins at the end of June and ends in mid-July.

Below is a full schedule for Wimbledon 2025:

Monday, June 30: First round singles play begins

Tuesday, July 1: First round singles play continues

Wednesday, July 2: Second round singles play begins

Thursday, July 3: Second round singles play continues

Friday, July 4: Third round singles play begins

Saturday, July 5: Third round singles play continues

Sunday, July 6: Fourth round singles play begins

Monday, July 7: Fourth round singles play continues

Tuesday, July 8: Singles quarterfinals play begins

Wednesday, July 9: Singles quarterfinals play continues

Thursday, July 10: Women's singles semifinals

Friday, July 11: Men's singles semifinals

Saturday, July 12: Women's singles final

Sunday, July 13: Men's singles final

Draws have not been completed for Wimbledon 2025 at this time. Both the men's and women's draw will occur Friday, June 27. This section will be updated once draws are completed.

Wimbledon seeds will mostly follow the ATP and WTA rankings. Wimbledon already released a seeding announcement for the 2025 tournament ahead of its draw.

Much like the ATP rankings, Jannik Sinner is the top-seeded male competitor at the tournament. He'll be followed by Carlos Alcaraz.

Here's how the rest of the top 10 shake out on the men's side:

Jannik Sinner (ITA)

Carlos Alcaraz (ESP)

Alexander Zverev (GER)

Jack Draper (GBR)

Taylor Fritz (USA)

Novak Djokovic (SRB)

Lorenzo Musetti (ITA)

Holger Rune (DEN)

Daniil Medvedev (RUS)

Ben Shelton (USA)

And here's how the top 10 looks on the women's side:

Aryna Sabalenka (BYS)

Coco Gauff (USA)

Jessica Pegula (USA)

Jasmine Paolini (ITA)

Qinwen Zheng (CHN)

Madison Keys (USA)

Mirra Andreeva (RUS)

Iga Swiatek (POL)

Paula Badosa (ESP)

Emma Navarro (USA)

The winners of Wimbledon in 2025 will receive £3,000,000. That's an increase of 11.1 percent compared to last year's prize pool. That converts to $4,092,600.

Every participant in the event receives money for making it in. The total prize pool for 2025 Wimbledon singles players is £38,828,000. That's an 8.2 percent increase compared to 2024.

Wimbledon 2025 will air on ESPN in the United States. The network has broadcast Wimbledon since 2003, and has held exclusive rights in the U.S. since 2013. Coverage will be shown on ESPN, ABC, ESPN2 and ESPN Deportes. Every match is available to be streamed with ESPN+.

Disney+ subscribers will be able to watch the first day of the tournament on the Disney+ app. Individuals who have the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle will be able to stream the entire tournament.

Wimbledon's grass-court surface is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful on the ATP Tour.

However, playing on the surface does not come naturally to many, as many players are not afforded the opportunity to play on these courts – which are often difficult to maintain.

Managing surface upkeep throughout wet and windy winter months and baking hot summer months is a difficult process, resulting in many clubs opting for hard courts, which are easier to manage.

Ahead of Wimbledon, one notable ATP player has admitted his time on grass was extremely limited during his younger years.

World number 17 Jakub Mensik revealed his almost non-existent childhood grass court experience after victory at the Eastbourne Open over Reilly Opelka.

Speaking to Tennis TV on Wednesday afternoon, the Czech star was asked how much time he spent playing on grass as a youngster.

Mensik replied: “Never.”

The interviewer responded: “Never?”

Mensik went on to explain, saying he used to feel like ‘an elephant on the skates' when playing on grass.

He said: “Never, I mean of course right now it's my second season so you know so it's my ninth or tenth match of my career on the grass court so I mean if I'm not counting Juniors' Wimbledon then last year and this year is my first time on the grass.

“Like I'm saying last year[‘s] first matches I was feeling on the grass like an elephant on skates.

“I'm glad [that during my] second year I am already feeling much better, and every match I'm getting better and better and that's the most important thing.”

The Czech sensation will face either Australia's James Duckworth or Spanish sixth seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the next round.

The 19-year-old has shot up the ATP Tour rankings in 2025, helped by his stunning Miami Open victory in March.

Reilly Opelka is well regarded as one of the biggest and best servers on the ATP Tour. However, his serve was second-best against the Czech star.

The 19-year-old served 12 aces to Opelka's 10, while also winning 73 per cent of his first-serve points and 81 per cent of his second-serve points.

Aside from his serving performance, Mensik won two of his three break-point opportunities and did not give Opelka a single break-point opportunity during the entire match.

It was a performance that put Mensik in good standing, then, ahead of Wimbledon beginning on 30th June.

The fast-rising Brit aims for a career best result at his home Grand Slam.ByPete BodoPublished Jun 25, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 25, 2025

After Jiri Lehecka secured the decisive break point in his bitterly contested semifinal win over Jack Draper last week at Queen's Club, Draper angrily whacked his racquet on a courtside LED advertising screen, disabling a portion of it.This was an uncharacteristic but telling outburst by the 23-year old British star, who later told reporters, “When you try your best and things don't go your way, it's easy to spill over. . .I don't want to behave like that, but that's just the way I am as a competitor. Sometimes I just play on a bit of a tightrope.”Draper's action underscored that with Wimbledon imminent, that tightrope is stretched thin and high. It always is for British players.Winning Wimbledon is tennis's equivalent of summiting Mt. Everest. For Brits, it's like accomplishing that without using supplemental oxygen. As Andy Murray, the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years, said after breaking through: “It's hard. It's really hard. You know, for the last four or five years, it's been very, very tough, very stressful… It's so hard to avoid everything because of how big this event is.”

I live and breathe the sport. I'm obsessed with progressing and obsessed with becoming the player that I want to become all the time and achieve the things I want to. Jack Draper

Don't be fooled, that stress and pressure that Scotland's Murray cited only diminishes in quality, not kind, for Draper. The 6-foot-4 lefthander is from Sutton, England—a detail that will matter to some who want to play up the annual narrative that Murray put the kibosh on in 2013. Since then, Cameron Norrie has been the only British player to make a semifinal (2022).“That spotlight is [always] going to be burning pretty brightly,” Tim Henman, the four-time Wimbledon semifinalist and broadcast analyst from Oxford England, told the BBC in a prescient moment in 2023. “But I definitely think Jack has the capacity mentally, physically and technically to deal with it.”It was an accurate assessment, for Jack Draper's coming of age this year—a process deferred by multiple injuries earlier in his career—has been a pleasure to behold. He has ticked off all the boxes required to be a legitimate Grand Slam contender, something he was not a year ago at this time when he was ranked No. 28.

Since then, Draper has been to a Grand Slam semifinal at the US Open. He's won a Masters 1000 in Indian Wells, defeating in succession Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Carlos Alaraz and Holger Rune. Draper also made a Masters 1000 final on clay in Madrid, and wrapped up a breakthrough season on red dirt with a fourth-round performance at Roland Garros.To top things off, his trip to the semifinals at Queen's earned him the No. 4 ranking and seeding—the last British man placed so high was Murray—a critical achievement that means Draper won't have to play either of the top seeds, Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz, until the semifinal. Draper's table has been impressively set. But there is still this little thing about being British at Wimbledon.Draper has found ways to protect himself from the burden of expectations. He doesn't really pay lip service to the British tabloids, with their desire to whip their readers into a patriotic frenzy. Draper has rarely spoken this year about Wimbledon, let alone conquering it. Earlier in the year he denied having specific goals: “I just feel like I'm living my dream by playing on these stages.”Draper's caution is understandable. He battled significant injuries for roughly two years until about 18 months ago. During the down times, those childhood fantasies about being a big star and winning Wimbledon faded. “A lot of the stuff for me [when I was struggling] was kind of getting my head around the fact that it wasn't going to be I'm going to rock it at Wimbledon and win.”

In a discreet moment before the Madrid final, Draper did allow—without mentioning Wimbledon—that the dividend of playing well on clay would give him a lot of confidence going to the faster surfaces that he enjoys more. He said, “I think ‘Wow like, I'm doing this on the clay, what can I take out onto the other surfaces as well?'”Draper's most obvious skills peg him as a potential force on grass. There's that ideal height that enhances a punishing serve that has all the familiar lefty juju. He's good at the net. His forehand is king-sized but the secret sauce in his game is his backhand. Draper, like Rafael Nadal, is a natural right-hander who plays left-handed.“It's always been my backhand which has been the shot,” Draper said at Indian Wells. “I can hit with my eyes closed, you know. I really have no problem against any player with their forehand into my backhand.”But for all the benefits derived from a lethal backhand, big serve and wingspan, the main asset of the great Wimbledon champions has been their athleticism. No other surface pulls and pushes and stretches you like grass. As Draper's clay results attest, his overall movement has improved markedly since his rebound from the string of injuries that blunted his athleticism.

In Madrid, Draper explained that he was small for his age, so he was “always just scraping around the court” without any big weapon. As he grew up, he needed to figure out how to rely on his defense but also to attack when the time was right. “The blueprint was, I'm a big guy, but I'm not just a guy who hits big serves and can hit a big winner. I can do everything on the court, and that's what I think all the top players are able to do.”The pressure on Draper in the coming days will be intense, but his self-awareness and measured approach to Wimbledon should be helpful. When he spoke at Queen's about his attitude toward tennis and his new status as the No. 4 seed at Wimbledon, he made it sound as if the best was yet to come.“I live and breathe the sport,” he said. “I'm obsessed with progressing and obsessed with becoming the player that I want to become all the time and achieve the things I want to. It's another step in the right direction.”We'll soon see if Draper can scale Mt. Wimbledon—with or without supplemental oxygen.

The stars of the WTA Tour are ramping up their Wimbledon preparations as they get ready for the third Grand Slam of the year.

There are few events more difficult to predict than Wimbledon, as the last eight tournaments have yielded different winners.

In 2024, Barbora Krejcikova won Wimbledon as the number 31 seed, one year after her countrywoman Marketa Vondrousova became the first unseeded player to win at the All England Club.

This time around, many are predicting Grand Slam winners Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff, and Madison Keys to make deep runs at SW19.

One former Grand Slam winner won't be joining the field, however, following her shock defeat in the second round of Wimbledon qualifying.

Returning to the WTA Tour at the beginning of the 2025 clay-court season, 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu quickly found her footing, embarking on an impressive run to the last 16 in Rome.

Failing to make the cut for Roland Garros, Andreescu entered Grand Slam qualifying for the first time in seven years.

After winning her opening match in straight sets 6-0, 6-0, Andreescu lost in the second round of French Open qualifying, 6-2, 6-7, 4-6.

Missing out on an appearance in the main draw of the French Open, the 25-year-old was no doubt determined to make amends on grass.

Just as she did in Paris, Andreescu started strongly, winning her opening match in Wimbledon qualifying against Brazil's Laura Pigossi, 6-2, 6-1.

Next up was a tough test against her fellow Canadian, Carson Branstine, who beat two seeded players at the Libema Open earlier this month.

Losing out in three sets, Andreescu fell to Branstine 6-7, 6-4, 1-6, as she missed out on the main draw of a Grand Slam for the second time this year.

The world number 147 will now have to reset, as she looks to find some form before the US Open, an event for which she will likely be given a Wild Card.

Andreescu shocked the world at the 2019 US Open, winning the title on her Flushing Meadows debut.

Finishing the year ranked fourth in the world, the sky was the limit for Andreescu, as many predicted she would win more Grand Slams in the future.

Unfortunately for the youngster, a knee injury, combined with the global pandemic, all but wrote off her 2020 season, as she made her return ahead of the 2021 Australian Open.

It didn't take her long to return to the top, qualifying for the final of the 2021 Miami Open, where she came up short against Ashleigh Barty, retiring due to injury in the second set.

Failing to build any momentum from her run in Miami, Andreescu finished the year as the world number 46.

Things got worse in 2022, as she struggled for form, except for a run to the final in Bad Homburg and a WTA 1000 quarterfinal appearance in Madrid.

Andreescu chose to take a hiatus from tennis mid-way through 2023 as results continued to disappoint, returning to the WTA Tour in June 2024. 

The return was largely unsuccessful, reaching just one semi-final at the Libema Open, taking down Naomi Osaka en route to the last four.

One year on, Andreescu finds herself at a career crossroads, as her ranking continues to fall year after year, and her Grand Slam victory now seems a distant memory.

Only time will tell if Andreescu can rediscover the form that saw her beat Serena Williams in a Grand Slam final, but it will certainly be something to look out for as the season progresses.

Andreescu is not currently scheduled to appear at any WTA Tour events over the next few weeks, as fans will have to wait and see where she returns to action.

Jack Draper has been labelled as Great Britain's next hope on the men's side after the departure of tennis legend Andy Murray.

The 23-year-old, who has skyrocketed to a career-high of number four in the world, has demonstrated excellent capabilities on the grass surface and is still the only man to beat Carlos Alcaraz at the Queen's Club Championships.

Draper is a Wimbledon contender and has been a high-flyer on the ATP Tour over the past year, winning the Stuttgart Open and Vienna Open in 2024 and Indian Wells in March 2025.

However, there is another British player who has gone under the radar ahead of Wimbledon and could cause some big shocks when the tournament comes around.

Ranked at 60 in the world, Jacob Fearnley has proved he can mix it with the best on the ATP Tour.

The 23-year-old's most recent performance only serves to demonstrate that he is headed for the very top, and Wimbledon could be the tournament Fearnley cements his place among the elite.

After ruling himself out of Wimbledon doubles, Fearnley's full focus will be on the singles tournament.

In the Eastbourne Open first round, Fearnley easily dismantled young Italian star Flavio Cobolli, who has also been tipped for a big future.

Fearnley landed 80 per cent of his first serves and won 75 per cent of his second serve points, waltzing to a comfortable 6-2 6-2 win over the Italian. The Brit also hit 21 winners and broke Cobolli four times on his way to victory.

The Brit has recorded various important wins during the 2025 season, including against three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka and big-hitting Czech player Tomas Machac. He also reached the Queen's Club quarter-finals on his first appearance at the tournament.

On Wednesday afternoon, Fearnley faces American Marcos Giron in the next round of the Eastbourne Open.

Wimbledon can be an over-stimulating place for British players. There is constant hustle and bustle across the grounds, and there is always a heightened level of expectation placed on the shoulders of British players when the tournament comes around on the calendar.

However, Fearnley's appearance at last year's Wimbledon will give him valuable experience heading into this year's championships.

Fearnley impressed the Centre Court crowd during a battling display, striking 13 aces during a 3-6 4-6 7-5 5-7 loss.

This experience will have prepared Fearnley for the Wimbledon pressure and give him extra confidence heading into this year's championships.

Despite its modest surroundings, the Roma Garden Open has produced an impressive list of past champions over the years. Players such as Argentina's Federico Delbonis, Poland's Jerzy Janowicz, Britain's Kyle Edmund, and Italy's Marco Cecchinato all laid the groundwork for later success here. This year, it was home favorite Matteo Gigante who lifted the trophy.“For me, the tournament at the Tennis Club Garden was always special because it took place one week before the ATP Masters 1000 event at the Foro Italico,” Challenger legend Paolo Lorenzi is quoted as saying in the tournament magazine. “I used it to prepare for the most important tennis event in Italy.” Over the course of his career, the Roman claimed 21 titles on the Challenger Tour. While the Roma Garden Open wasn't among them, Lorenzi always relished competing there.“Being supported by the passionate crowd gave me strength in both singles and doubles. It's a date not to be missed—also because of Pancho, whose experience and kindness always made you feel right at home.”

Roger Federer won 1,251 tour-level matches across his iconic career, but which matches were his favourite?

The tennis icon is one of the most successful players in the history of the sport, with a staggering 20 Grand Slam singles titles to his name – so he has plenty of matches to choose from.

However, in an interview with Eurosport Spain, the Swiss star has now revealed the three favourite wins of his two-decade-long career.

The 43-year-old selected his 2001 Wimbledon win over Pete Sampras, his 2009 French Open final win over Robin Soderling, and his classic 2017 Australian Open final triumph over Rafael Nadal.

“The first one I would like to remember is clear: Wimbledon 2001 and my match against Pete Sampras,” said Federer.

“That match was facing the hero of a whole generation, my first time on Wimbledon's centre court, without knowing everything that tournament would bring me in my career.

“Second, I would choose the 2009 Roland Garros final. I chased that tournament for a long time, until this season when the floodgates opened with Rafa's elimination.

“I felt like everyone was behind me; they really wanted me to win; it made me feel very special.

“Finally, I will stick to the 2017 Australian Open final, right after my knee problems. It was a complete match, it had everything. I would like to relive all those emotions.”

Federer's fourth-round victory over Sampras proved to be his breakthrough match, with a then 19-year-old Federer handing his idol a first defeat at Wimbledon since 1996.

Though the Swiss did not win the title that year, he did go on to win a record eight men's singles titles at the All England Club, eclipsing Sampras' previous milestone of seven.

The 2009 French Open final victory over Soderling not only saw Federer tie Sampras' then-Open Era record of 14 Grand Slam men's singles titles, but also complete the Career Grand Slam.

Roland Garros success had eluded the Swiss up until that point, with Rafael Nadal beating him in three straight finals from 2006 to 2008.

Victory over Soderling, who had beaten Nadal earlier in the event, sealed what proved to be the only French Open title of Federer's career.

Federer's 2017 Australian Open final over Nadal remains one of the most celebrated Grand Slam finals of recent times, and a key match in his iconic rivalry with the Spaniard.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion was the 17th seed in Melbourne, having struggled with injury throughout 2016, and had not won a major title in four-and-a-half years.

Nadal had also not won a major for over two years and held a 3-1 lead in the deciding set, before Federer stormed back to win his 18th Grand Slam title, and fifth Australian Open title.

Emma Raducanu fought through the challenging winds and lingering back pain to secure a resilient comeback victory over Ann Li at Eastbourne on Tuesday.

The British tennis player is now anxiously waiting to assess her physical condition ahead of her next match, scheduled for Wednesday. Raducanu, ranked 38 globally, had been forced to skip the previous week's Berlin Open due to persistent back spasms.

Raducanu shot to fame in 2021 by winning the U.S. Open as a qualifier. The 22-year-old, who has been targeted by a stalker in recent months, will return to Flushing Meadows later this year to partner Carlos Alcaraz in the mixed doubles.

Raducanu's lingering back issue was evident at various points during her match against Li. Nonetheless, she rebounded admirably after conceding a closely contested first set and was visibly emotional upon wrapping up a 6-7, 6-3, 6-1 win, celebrated in the presence of her coach Mark Petchey, and an honored guest in her corner, British No. 5 Fran Jones.

Post-match, Raducanu reflected: "It was a physically demanding match. I think it was pretty difficult and in the wind, you're constantly trying to adjust. We had some long rallies, you're running a lot. So I feel okay, I mean, a little bit of fatigue and a bit of stiffness, but I need to just see how I pull up tomorrow."

The British No. 1's emotional display on court, as she clinched her second-round spot, was accompanied by gratitude for the crowd's support. She further elaborated: "I received some pretty bad news, so I would like to keep it personal if that's okay, but it was difficult and very emotional at the end and probably just a release of different emotions."

Raducanu also found solace in having fellow tennis player Jones lending support from her corner. Currently ranked 125 globally, Jones is also participating in Eastbourne this week and is set for her second-round match on Wednesday. On her day off, she slipped into the role of coach, joining Raducanu's support box with Mark Petchey and rooting for her loud and clear.

"I was at her match in Madrid, and it's nice whenever the schedule works, you know, we like to be there for each other. And today, obviously she's a close friend of mine, so she kind of knew what was going on behind the scenes and to have her support there on a day like today meant so much to me," Raducanu expressed about Jones' presence.

"She's someone who is so intelligent about tennis and about life as well, but, you know, she did so good and the best aim of the coach is, you know, to coach yourself out of a job. And when she left in the third set, I seemed to win through 6-1.

"So, yeah, I give her a lot of credit for that, and it's nice to just see her on the side of the court, giving me a lot of support. But honestly, speaking about tennis, she's someone I could also speak to for hours about picking apart tactics and technique and players and everything. It's a really great sounding board."

Amidst the blustery conditions in Eastbourne which posed challenges for all players, Raducanu found value in overcoming the obstacles. She further explained: "It's not easy to drop the first in a tiebreak and you to come back and regroup and also breakdown in the second set, I'm really, really proud of myself, how I kind of fought back.

"Then in the third set, really found an extra level and also got over the conditions today, which were really windy, and it's not something I've necessarily been good at in the past. So yeah, adding to that bank of experience too."

Raducanu is set to go head-to-head with Australian teen Maya Joint once again, following their intense match at the Italian Open in May, where the British star emerged victorious with scores of 7-5, 6-7, 6-3. Reflecting on their upcoming rematch, Raducanu remarked: "I remember our match in Rome, I came off and I was like 'Wow, I had to play really, really well to win that match.'

"I think I played some really great tennis that day in Rome and she's obviously since has won her first WTA title and has really kind of taken off and it's kind of in a way good to see that when you come off playing someone, you're like, 'Wow, they played like really well' and then they actually like win it's good to see.

"But I know I'm expecting a really tough match, and she obviously beat Ons in the first round, which is really, really difficult. She's had a lot of success on grass. So, yeah, I'm expecting a battle."

With nine Wimbledon titles to her name, Martina Navratilova knows a thing or two about grass-court tennis. Here are the eight players she believes are best positioned to make a deep run this year.

No one in tennis history had a better track record at the All England Club than Martina Navratilova. The synergy between athlete and that living, breathing surface was something to behold.

Navratilova won nine Wimbledon singles titles -- one more than Roger Federer -- and 120 matches there, the most of any player at a Grand Slam in the Open Era and eight more than Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros. From 1982 to 1988, she rattled off a sublime 47-match winning streak on those hallowed lawns.

With that resume in mind, we asked Navratilova to weigh in on the current field. Who stands out to her? Who does she think is built for a deep run on grass this year?

Here are the eight players she'll be watching most closely (players with at least five career Wimbledon match-wins) and what she sees as their best path to going deep next week:

Wimbledon W-L: 11-5

Notable performances: Semifinalist 2021, 2023, did not play 2022, 2024

2025 on grass: Defeated Elena Rybakina in the Berlin quarterfinals before losing to eventual champion Marketa Vondrousova in the semifinals.

Navratilova: Looking at her record, it's hard to think she's not the favorite this year. She's a complete player and has a good game for grass. It's hard to find a weakness or an opening against her. I'm wondering if losing the French Open final will actually help motivate her. I think she finds herself in a good spot.

Wimbledon W-L: 11-5

Notable performances: Round of 16 2019, 2021, 2024

2025 on grass: Lost her first (and only) match on grass in Berlin 6-3, 6-3 to eventual finalist Wang Xinyu.

Navratilova: I think I'd put Coco as the second favorite. The great athletes always shine on grass. She's the best athlete in the women's game. That should pay off for her, and she's flying high after winning the French Open. It's just about managing her game, managing her body, her emotions. She's found the happy medium, the equilibrium between being focused and fired up.

Wimbledon W-L: 8-5

Notable performances: Quarterfinalist 2023

2025 on grass: Lost her first match in Berlin to Liudmila Samsonova 7-6 (8), 7-5, 7-6 (5). Playing Bad Homburg.

Navratilova: I think her weapon is consistency -- and a good volley because she's played a lot of doubles. I would love to see her come forward more often and finish points at net. If the draw is even slightly friendly, she could get to the semis and then she's going to be confident, maybe more aggressive. 

Wimbledon W-L: 6-4

Notable performances: Finalist 2024

2025 on grass: Lost her first match in Berlin to two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur. Playing Bad Homburg.

Navratilova: It was fun to see her run last year, beating Madison Keys and Emma Navarro back-to-back and taking Barbora Krejcikova to three sets in the final. She won Rome and is still a force to be reckoned with. I definitely see her living up to the seeding.

Wimbledon W-L: 25-10

Notable performances: Quarterfinalist 2015, 2023

2025 on grass: Reached the semifinals at Queen's Club, losing to eventual champion Tatjana Maria; fell 7-5, 7-6 (6) to Marketa Vondrousova in Berlin.

Navratilova: After winning Australia, there's a huge weight off her shoulders. Weapons are what win on grass and she's got them. I think she's the third favorite to win the tournament, after Sabalenka and not far behind Gauff.

Wimbledon W-L: 11-5

Notable performances: Quarterfinalist 2023

2025 on grass: Playing Bad Homburg.

Navratilova: Just the fact that she hits the ball so well gives her a chance. Backhand, solid as a rock. Forehand is good enough, even though it doesn't pay off as much on the grass as it does on clay. We haven't seen the draw, but hopefully, she won't be in Sabalenka's quarter.

Wimbledon W-L: 10-5

Notable performances: Round of 16 2021, 2022, 2024

2025 on grass: Won first two matches Berlin, over wild card Eva Lys and Emma Navarro, before retiring (right hip injury) against Wang.

Navratilova: It was tough to watch her struggle with the back injury. It's good to see her relatively healthy again, playing well in Berlin. Three Round of 16s … she's got a game that plays well on grass.  If I were a betting person -- which I am not -- I would be putting money on Keys and Badosa to go deep.

Wimbledon W-L: 19-3

Notable performances: Winner 2022, semifinalist 2024, quarterfinalist 2023

2025 on grass: Lost to Tatjana Maria in the Queen's Club and Aryna Sabalenka in Berlin, both in the quarterfinals.

Navratilova: No weaknesses, good athlete. Not afraid to go forward and knock off the volley. She's got soft enough hands to hit drop shots and plays really smart, high-percentage tennis. She reminds me of Lindsay Davenport, the effortless way she hits the ball. She's not swinging hard, but it's a heavy ball.

                Can the American capture his first Eastbourne crown?            

No. 2 seed Tommy Paul features in his first tournament since Roland Garros, as he battles home favourite Dan Evans at the 2025 ATP Lexus Eastbourne Open on Wednesday. This Round of 16 tie will be the third meeting between these two stars. Paul will be looking to capture his first title at the British town, having finished as the runner-up here in 2023.

World No. 13 Tommy Paul was beaten by Argentine Francisco Cerundolo in the Eastbourne International final two years ago. The American is enjoying a high moment in his career of late. However, he is yet to pick up a title in 2025 – and turns to Eastbourne for a change in fortune. The 28-year-old comes into this match with a 25-9 record this year – including semifinal runs in Adelaide, Dallas, Houston and Rome.

A former Top-25 player and a proven match winner, Dan Evans has dropped to No. 170 in the ATP Rankings. The British veteran is one of the ‘last of the Mohicans' and continues to dazzle at the age of 35. Mostly taking part in ATP Challengers, he has struggled to get past the qualifiers in most events. Evans produced a phenomenal display against Kecmanovic in the Round of 32 to improve his 2025 record to 3-3 and book his place in Wednesday's marquee clash.

The head-to-head between Tommy Paul and Dan Evans currently stands at 1-1. This will be their first meeting since 2022, when both matches took place.

Paul and Evans have faced each other twice on hard courts. The first of these was at the Canada Masters in Toronto, where the Brit made a comeback after getting dragged through the mud in the opening set. However, Paul drew level in this duel when he helped Team USA earn a point in the Davis Cup by beating his lower ranked opponent. Interestingly, there has never been a straight sets finish when these two stars have faced one another.

Over time, the American has crafted a potent grass court game for himself. He has reached two finals on this surface, including a title charge at Queen's Club last year. Paul will make full use of the tired legs of Evans that had to endure a three set battle on Monday. With an 85% service game win percentage and 50% break point conversion rate on grass, Tommy Paul is the firm favourite.

Prediction: Tommy Paul in straight sets.

Boisson stunned the tennis world as a 361st-ranked wildcard to reach a home semi-final at Roland Garros

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Roland Garros surprise package Lois Boisson will not get the chance to emulate her heroics at Wimbledon after seeing her hopes of a first main-draw appearance end abruptly in qualifying.

Boisson, 22, stunned the world in a storybook run to the French Open semi-finals, doing so as a 361st-ranked wildcard.

Her journey in Paris ended at the hands of eventual champion Coco Gauff in the last four, but her sensational campaign nevertheless shot her up the rankings to 65 in the world.

However, Boisson's shock rise to prominence came past the cut-off to enter the Wimbledon main draw, having been ranked outside the top 400 when that deadline rolled around five or so weeks ago.

That forced her to go through qualifying, a campaign which ended on Tuesday as she lost 6-2, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4 to Canada's Carlson Branstine.

Branstine will face former US champion and compatriot Bianca Andreescu next with two more rounds of qualifying to go.

Boisson also gained notoriety in the tennis world this year following comments from Harriet Dart in April, which saw the Brit complain about her smell and say she needs to “wear deodorant” mid-match. 

Wimbledon begins on June 30, kicking off the third grand slam of the year.

Roger Federer hinted that he could be reunited with Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray at Wimbledon, but was left in the dark over whether his rival-turned-friend Rafael Nadal would make the trip to SW19. Federer is considered royalty in south-west London and is given the red-carpet treatment when he returns to the site of his eight Grand Slam titles.

Federer sat in the royal box next to Princess Kate in 2023 as he was honoured on Centre Court, before returning the very next year to watch Murray play before his farewell at the All England Club. The Swiss legend's trips to England for Wimbledon have become annual and he hinted that he will likely make the same journey again for the 2025 edition.

"I probably will go to Wimbledon, but I don't know if Rafa will be there during the tournament,” he told TNT Sports.

Federer also shared that he would likely catch up with Djokovic, as he is scheduled to play at the tournament, while Murray is expected to be in the vicinity also.

"We will see Novak in the draw, while Andy will probably be at the facilities,” Federer added.

He also revealed that he is trying to tempt the ‘Big Four' to reunite once again at the Laver Cup, which this year takes place in San Francisco.

Federer continued: "Then there is the Laver Cup, another very special week, I will try to recruit them for the occasion. I don't know what other dates we have ahead of us, I'm sure we'll be in touch, although it might be easier for us to coincide on the golf course than on the tennis court."

The 43-year-old had been discussing Nadal's goodbye ceremony at the French Open, when the four tennis icons all joined together on the Roland Garros clay to pay tribute to the 14-time winner in Paris.

"It was amazing," Federer said about the tribute, when Nadal was surprised with a permanent plaque on Court Philippe-Chatrier with his footprint etched.

"I think everyone loved the tribute, especially Rafa, who is the one who had to love it. I have heard him in several interviews talking about how he felt, that makes me very happy.

"They were moments of great emotion, gratitude, it was incredible to see his reaction when they showed the plaque with his name on it.

"For me it was the most exciting thing, that plaque will be there forever, all the players who step on the court will see it, they will surely be inspired and motivated thanks to him.

"Sincerely, he had the farewell and the tribute he deserved. I am happy for him, grateful for allowing me to live it from there with them. It had been many months since I had seen them.

"It is always a pleasure to meet all Rafa's family and friends, I am lucky to know them and I was delighted to see them all smiling.”

Ahead of Carson Branstine's qualifier clash against former Grand Slam champion and longtime friend Bianca Andreescu, the former revealed that she's not only one of the strongest athletes on the tour but also a signed professional model funding her tennis career on her own terms.

Branstine, currently ranked No. 197 on the WTA Tour, pulled off one of the biggest surprises in the opening round of the 2025 Wimbledon qualifiers by defeating Roland Garros semifinalist Lois Boisson in three hard-fought sets. After battling a string of injuries for much of her young career, Branstine is now building momentum as a top-tier athlete and as a professional signed with two modeling agencies.

 

 

A post shared by Carson Branstine (@carsonbranstine)



Speaking to media at Wimbledon, Branstine opened up about balancing the demands of elite-level tennis with the fashion world. “I love being in front of the camera during a shoot,” she said, as reported by CLAY. “It's fun, I love fashion. It's been one of the reasons I've been able to pay some of my trips…I wasn't signed by these agencies because of my tennis, it was for my look.”

Now 24, Branstine has faced more physical setbacks than many of her peers. “I've spent in total over five years injured. The last time I played a full season was when I was 15!” she admitted.

But instead of letting those roadblocks define her, she redefined herself. “I did my own research, stopped listening to people, and figured out what works for my body. I've found the secret formula, because I'd say I'm one of the best athletes on tour. I believe in that, I'm fast, I lift a lot of weight, and I'm pretty agile for someone my height.”

Branstine's resurgence has seen her rise steadily this season, with a career-high singles ranking of No. 190 in March. She made waves earlier in the year by reaching her first WTA 125 final in Cancún and later stunned top seed Liudmila Samsonova in her main-draw debut at the Libéma Open in the Netherlands.

That same tournament also reunited her with Andreescu in doubles, where the pair reached the quarterfinals, rekindling a partnership that once won them junior Grand Slam titles at the 2017 Australian and French Opens.

Roger Federer believes there was one particular moment that stood out from Rafael Nadal's farewell ceremony at the French Open as he feels his long-term rival's reaction said it all.

Roland Garros waved goodbye to their favourite son at the start of this year's tournament as the King of Clay was honoured during an emotional ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Nadal bowed out from tennis last November and he finished his career with 22 Grand Slams titles with 14 coming at his beloved French Open.

The Spaniard won his maiden trophy in Paris as a 19-year-old on his debut at the tournament in 2005 and he went on to dominate the event with his last title coming in 2022.

He finished an astonishing 112–4 win-loss record and it was only right that his four biggest rivals during his playing career attended his farewell.

Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray joined Nadal on Philippe-Chatrier during the tribute ceremony.

In an interview with TNT Sports, 20-time Grand Slam winner Federer said: “It was amazing. I think everyone loved the tribute, especially Rafa, who is the one who had to love it. I have heard him in several interviews talking about how he felt, that makes me very happy.

“They were moments of great emotion, gratitude, it was incredible to see his reaction when they showed the plaque with his name on it.”

And it was the unveiling of the plaque that really captured the imagination not just on the day, but in the days after the ceremony as several players took selfies after their matches during this year's French Open.

Federer added: “For me it was the most exciting thing, that plaque will be there forever, all the players who step on the court will see it, they will surely be inspired and motivated thanks to him.

“Sincerely, he had the farewell and the tribute he deserved. I am happy for him, grateful for allowing me to live it from there with them. It had been many months since I had seen them.

“It is always a pleasure to meet all Rafa's family and friends, I am lucky to know them and I was delighted to see them all smiling.

“It was the first time I returned to Roland-Garros since I retired, the last time was in 2021 in that edition with no crowd in the stands. It was a joy to return to Philippe-Chatrier, only this time with the stands full of fans.

Tennis

The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) has submitted an updated complaint in its antitrust lawsuit against tennis' governing bodies.

The organization, which was co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2020, has taken out critiques of the tour schedule from players who are not named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, including French Open champions Coco Gauff and Carlos Alcaraz.

It has also removed two defendants from a group it characterized as a “cartel” in its initial action, which was filed in London, New York City and Brussels. The International Tennis Federation is off the suit filed in New York City, as is the tennis anti-doping and anti-corruption body, the International Tennis Integrity Agency.

A source briefed on the PTPA's legal proceedings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships in tennis, said that the ITF and the ITIA had been removed to focus on the alleged antitrust violations by the men's (ATP) and women's (WTA) tennis tours.

The PTPA filed its initial lawsuit in March. That filing described the biggest governing bodies in tennis as a “cartel,” which suppresses wages, player opportunity and rival tournaments “to the harm of players and fans alike.” The PTPA alleged numerous antitrust violations, all of which have been denied by the accused governing bodies, who last month filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.

The men's and women's tours argue that their bylaws require players to settle disputes through arbitration, rather than in court. In May, they and the ITF and ITIA filed a joint motion to dismiss the PTPA as a plaintiff, on the grounds that it cannot orchestrate such an action because it does not have a formal membership. A judge has yet to rule on that motion.

The original lawsuit listed 12 player plaintiffs, including co-founder Vasek Pospisil, and Reilly Opelka and Sorana Cirstea, who are active players. Djokovic was not a named plaintiff. There are now 14, with the addition of Sachia Vickery and Nicolas Zanellato, though there are still no top-tier stars among the named complainants, giving the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the PTPA's lawsuit does not have the support of most of the most powerful voices in the game.

A spokesperson for the PTPA said at the time that more than 250 professional players across all tiers of the sport, as well as the organization's executive committee, which includes Djokovic, supported the action.

Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Djokovic said in a news conference at the Miami Open: “To be quite frank with you, there are things that I agree with in the lawsuit and there are also things that I don't agree with.

“I found that maybe some wording was quite strong in there.”

The updated complaint, filed in New York Tuesday evening, has changed some wording. The original was written with the kind of confrontational language that is typical of U.S. lawsuits, with the four Grand Slams — Wimbledon and the Australian, French and U.S. Opens — described as “co-conspirators” alongside the defendants' alleged “cartel”.

Some of that language is still there, including in the opening salvo:

“Professional tennis players are stuck in a rigged game. Not on the court, where fierce competition between players delights millions of fans worldwide, but off of it, where players are forced to endure grueling schedules, capped earnings, abusive and invasive investigations and discipline, and have limited control over their own careers and brands. This is because a cartel of professional tennis tour organizers and tournament operators have conspired to avoid competition amongst themselves and to shut out outside tournaments, affording them complete control over the players' pay and working conditions.”

The four Grand Slams will not be named as defendants for at least another 90 days, amid settlement discussions between them and the PTPA, according to a filing lodged this week.

The updated complaint focuses more closely on alleged violations of antitrust law by the two tours, while countering the arguments that they have made to convince the court to dismiss the case.  It also focuses more heavily on the governance structures of the tours, outlining how the players are not equal partners in the operations, as the tours' leaders have claimed.  The original, which included reference to complaints by Alcaraz, Gauff and five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Świątek, has omitted those complaints. It had used quotes from those players in news conferences and interviews in which they criticized how tennis is scheduled. Since the initial complaint was filed, a group of top-10 ranked male and female players has held meetings with the four Grand Slams to discuss an increased proportion of their revenues being shared with players as prize money.

This is one of the goals of the PTPA lawsuit, and the PTPA has also held meetings with leaders of the Grand Slams. In the past, those leaders have expressed a desire to restructure tennis, creating a streamlined event calendar that revolves around their events and the 1,000-level ATP and WTA events, which are one rung below their tournaments.

The discussions between the Grand Slams and PTPA aim to develop a framework for a new structure for professional tennis. That structure would then be circulated to the ATP, WTA, and ITF for their input.

The Grand Slams and other governing bodies, however, have been doing this dance since last year, when the Grand Slams presented the tours with a plan for a so-called “premium tour,” with fewer events and a pooling of their lucrative media rights.

That plan never went beyond discussions, and earlier this year, the ATP and WTA presented the Grand Slams with their own plan to reform tennis, which the Grand Slams rejected out of hand. The PTPA believes that the spectre of lengthy and expensive antitrust litigation will create more urgency for change. Thus far, this has not been the case.

While their complaints have been eliminated from the formal PTPA complaint, top players on the ATP and WTA Tours remain in discussions about the schedule and revenue sharing in their sport.

To achieve a high ranking, players typically need to participate in around 20 tournaments each year worldwide. The top players, who regularly go deep in those tournaments, have said that they don't receive necessary rest and that the sport's roughly four-week off-season is far too short.

They are also subject to financial penalties and other punishments if they skip mandatory tournaments.

The players — and the PTPA — also want the Grand Slams and ATP and WTA tournaments to share a higher proportion of revenue with players. They could offer to share more than the roughly 20 percent of their revenues with players by significantly increasing prize money.

Major American sports leagues, such as the NBA and NFL, share approximately 50 percent of their revenues with players. Grand Slam prize money typically amounts to between 13 and 18 percent of each tournament's annual revenue, while for ATP and WTA events, that figure rises closer to 25 or 30 percent.

The courts will next address the defendants' motions to dismiss the case or to move it to arbitration.

Emma Raducanu's "coy smile" and "hair-preen gestures" while talking about about her new doubles partner Carlos Alcaraz indicate a romance is brewing courtside, a body language expert says.

Raducanu, 22, was spotted cheering for the Spaniard at the Queen's Club Championship in West Kensington, London, on Thursday and Saturday - the day before he won the competition after beating Jiri Lehecka. The victory came after it was announced Alcaraz, also 22, and Raducanu will team up for the revamped US Open mixed doubles event in August.

Speaking about her "genuine connection" with the two-time Wimbledon champ did little to quash speculation "there is something going on between them," according to body language expert Judi James. She noted Raducanu's "coy smile" and "hair-preen gestures" during this interview, signs Ms James believes suggest a new tennis love match is on the cards.

The expert said: "The fans love a whiff of a romance and it has to be said that her body language might be a bit of a thirst-trap for audiences starved of a love-all relationship since Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert hooked up back in the Seventies." The American former tennis players' "fairytale romance" also began at the Queen's Club.

Speaking to Mail Online, Ms James added Emma appeared to "stall for time" by repeating the interviewer's question about Alcaraz but "the way the coy smile spread across her face as she rattled off their history together" - coupled with the way she played with her hair - was akin to a "fan-girl reaction".

Raducanu and Alcaraz's chemistry led to fans chattering about a potential romance. Raducanu gushed in the TV interview at Eastbourne, ahead of her first-round match against Ann Li on Sunday, adding fuel to the fire.

And Raducanu's features "softened" and "gaze became evasive" as she reflected on her friendship with the Spanish ace, Ms James continued, also pointing out the Londoner's "pouting and posing" in the interview.

But Raducanu has remained coy in the conversations themselves about Alcaraz, firm favourite to win Wimbledon, explaining they became friends at Wimbledon 2021. She said: "He's so nice, very happy, amazing values and just a really positive light to be around.

"I've known him for years. Wimbledon 2021 was the first time I started getting to know him. He was always playing the day before me, I would see him win and then I would have motivation to win and get myself into that position too. It was really cool to go through that tournament together and then I kept going through the US Open, we were staying in touch for the whole time and, yeah, it's nice."

F1 The Movie London premiere interview highlights

Brad Pitt has described his involvement in F1 The Movie as “one of the most extraordinary experiences” of his illustrious career.

Brad Pitt has described being involved in Apple Original Films' new movie about F1 as “one of the most extraordinary experiences” of his illustrious career, while paying tribute to the entire paddock for their help and support.

Titled F1, the movie is being directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun: Maverick), Oscar-winning actor Pitt and seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, among other respected names.

Pitt stars as former F1 driver Sonny Hayes, who returns to the sport to partner rookie team mate Joshua Pearce, played by Damson Idris, at the fictional APXGP team – who slot alongside the existing 10 outfits up and down the pit lane.

Filming of F1 has taken place at real events, including at 2024's season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with attention now turning toward its international release on June 25, 2025, and North America debut on June 27, 2025.

Taking some time to discuss the project at the Yas Marina Circuit during filming in Abu Dhabi, Pitt told F1 TV's Will Buxton where his passion for the sport came from, how the movie came about and what viewers can expect when it hits cinemas.

“I've always loved racing,” Pitt begins. “I grew up with Jackie Stewart [racing in F1 as] some of my earliest memories. In the '90s I really got heavily into MotoGP. Then I started veering into F1, and here we are.”

He continues: “I've been trying to get a racing movie done for 20 years. I've tried bikes, I've tried cars, I've tried different disciplines, and for whatever reason they never came to fruition.

“We got a great push behind us [for this film], people were more and more interested [in F1], so we could get [a company] like Apple to come in and really support us.

“It was Joe Kosinski and Jerry Bruckheimer, just coming off [filming] Maverick, who said, ‘[We] want to make the most realistic racing movie we've seen to date', and I think that's what we've done.”

Central to that goal is Pitt and co-star Idris getting behind the wheel of racing cars themselves, with the pair taking to the track at circuits across the F1 calendar alongside experienced, professional drivers.

“I think by the time we get to the movie, it's undeniable [that we are driving the cars],” smiles Pitt, with his actions captured by cutting-edge camera technology. “We're not sitting on a sound stage with wind machines…

“I don't know where I go from here. You can't compete with this experience. It's almost like when we get to the acting scenes, you kind of go, ‘Oh, okay, no driving today!' It's really been amazing.”

Hamilton offered a valuable, helping hand in this area, while also keeping track of the entire filming process to ensure that events and scenes were captured as accurately as possible.

“Everyone has had a hand honing this thing, then Lewis coming in for the ultimate ‘smell test',” says Pitt. “I think we've got something. It's really fun, it's exciting, it's adventurous, and you feel it. I do. I hope others do too.

“Lewis' knowledge has been so immensely helpful. He's been keeping us straight, going, ‘No, that doesn't fly,' right down to the sound. He can actually pick it out and go, ‘No, that's Turn 12, not Turn 16. You need more reverb on the straight' – he's that specific.”

Finally, Pitt paid tribute to the drivers, teams and wider staff members involved in F1 who all embraced the movie and accommodated the “imaginary 11th team” from race weekend to race weekend.

“I've got to thank them all [in F1],” he comments. “The teams have been so generous with us, so welcoming, and they play a part in this film. The drivers, F1 has opened all doors for us…

“It's unbelievable the way they've let us embed into their season. We've tried not to get in the way and they've been really cool with us – I can't thank them enough.”

Pitt signs off: “It's been one of the most extraordinary experiences I've had. I think it shows. At the end of the day, if the guys down pit lane say, ‘Job well done', then we've done it.”

Watch the full video interview with Pitt at the top of this article as he shares more about the thrill of filming, the cars and tracks involved and what it felt like to jump into the cockpit.

F1 The Movie stars Damson Idris and Kerry Condon have explained how they prepared for their “radical” roles on and off track, with the film – also featuring Brad Pitt – released internationally on June 25.

F1 The Movie stars Damson Idris and Kerry Condon have shared insight into how they prepared for their "radical" roles in the upcoming film, with the blockbuster released internationally on June 25.

Directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun: Maverick), F1 features Oscar-winning actor Brad Pitt in the role of former F1 driver Sonny Hayes, who returns to the sport to partner rookie team mate Joshua Pearce, played by Idris, at the fictional APXGP team.

Filming of F1 took place at real Grand Prix events, with Pitt and Idris even getting behind the wheel of the modified F2 cars that feature as the APXGP machines in the motion picture.

As a result Idris underwent extensive training for his role as Pearce, going as far as to take Silverstone's Copse Corner “flat out” in front of the seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton, who serves as a producer on the movie.

The young British actor also went on to explain more to the F1 Nation podcast about the preparation that went into his role, including the similarities he saw between the character and one of the world's most promising football talents – Spain's Lamine Yamal.

“Every single rookie goes through the same feeling and not even just in Formula 1," Idris said. "They're always trying to prove themselves, even a young actor. I really related to that.

“Funnily enough, Lamine Yamal, who plays football [for Barcelona and Spain], was kind of a big deal. Looking at him, I saw similarities between him and Joshua Pearce. They're both kind of cocky, but they've got the talent to match.”

The Snowfall actor also went on to praise his “insane” experience on track whilst filming F1, after being given the chance to drive on during F1 weekends, with much of the film shot during actual Grands Prix.

“Before I even had the part, I drove up somewhere in California and I jumped right in a sim and I was like, okay, let me see what this is," he added. "Did that. I downloaded the F1 video game, created a fake Joshua Pearce, and won a championship.

“When I finally came to England, I went to Bedford, Palmer Sports. They shoved me in the F3000, and I drove around there – in the wet, by the way. That was the test to get the part.

“It was insane for me because I got to drive on the track. We'd have these 10-minute slots to get these scenes during actual Grands Prix, to have the ability to watch the drivers up close and see how they interact and live in that world. When you watch the movie, you could see that all that authenticity was put on the screen.”

Additionally, Idris also confirmed that he took Copse corner flat-out during one of his preparation sessions for the role, showing his skills around Silverstone in front of Ferrari's Hamilton whilst driving the specially-modified F2 car featured in the movie.

“I can confirm I was flat through Copse and I did it in front of Lewis Hamilton, too!" the British actor explained. "That was a big one for me. I just really wanted to push myself.

“And I remember when I did it, I mean, I was screaming!  The reason why I had the confidence to do it was, you know, we would do F4 and F3, and I was flat in those.

“So it was actually a lack of experience that made me go flat in the F2 [car]. I didn't know that there was any other way you were supposed to go through Copse.

“So, as I'm heading down the street, I'm just not lifting. I'm just like, yeah, this is where I turn. And then when they showed me all the data, they were like, ‘bloody hell, you were flat through Copse?!'. And I was like, am I? It was actually really cool.”

For Kerry Condon, however, her preparation for the role of Kate – APXGP's race director – took place off the track rather than on it.

Whether it was chatting with Aston Martin technical guru Adrian Newey, or watching a race from the pit wall, Condon had a lot to learn as someone who was completely new to the sport.

The BAFTA-winner explained to F1 Nation that her experience was “radical” on set, as the team enjoyed an “immersive” experience within the F1 paddock on race weekends.

“They were so open-armed to us from the minute we arrived," Condon said. "The first race I went to was in Barcelona, just to meet people and observe everybody. Everyone was so nice and generous, particularly [former Aston Martin strategist] Bernie Collins.

“I learned a lot from Bernie because of her Irish background. I thought that was going to be perfect. I thought, ‘yes, bingo, I'm going to base it kind of on Bernie's backstory'.

“[F1 TV's] Ruth Buscombe as well was very helpful. I just kind of found out a little bit about where they went to college and what they studied and the route that they took to get there.

“I read the Adrian Newey book ‘How to Build a Car', which actually was quite easy to understand. I thought it was going to be a nightmare, but it was actually easy to understand.

“And then little things like the notepad that I have when I walk to the pit wall, I asked Bernie what she would have written on the front page of her notepad. Just in case the camera caught a glimpse of my notepad or something.

“It was kind of radical because we shot a lot of the movie live with the real Grands Prix, so a lot of the cars flying by in the background were the real cars happening in real time. That's never been done before.”

EXCLUSIVE: After teasing a potential sequel to his Oscar-winning drama The Social Network for years, Aaron Sorkin looks to have found an angle to tackle for his follow-up film. Sources tell Deadline that Sorkin has been set to direct The Social Network Part II for Sony Pictures. Insiders say that while it's being called part two, it's not a straight sequel but rather a follow-up to the original movie that explored the origins of what would become the world's biggest social media platform.


	The new film project is in development with Todd Black, Peter Rice, Sorkin and Stuart Besser producing.

	











	Sorkin's original screenplay for the new movie explores the story behind the Wall Street Journal‘s The Facebook Files, an explosive series of articles published in October 2021 that exposed the inner workings of — and multiple harms caused by — the world's largest social network.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Released in 2010 by Sony Pictures, The Social Network was a huge hit with audiences and critics and earned $226 million at the global box office. Nominated for eight Oscars including Best Picture, the film won three, including Sorkin for Best Adapted Screenplay.


	Since its release, Sorkin has noted on several occasions his interest in doing a follow-up, but he couldn't find the right angle. Following the events of January 6, 2020, when the U.S. Capitol was attacked, Sorkin found new inspiration saying in an interview last year that he believed Facebook played a part.

	











	Sources stress that the new film isn't a “January 6” movie and will focus not just on the 2020 election but also Facebook's effect on teens, preteens, violence and countries outside the U.S.


	Although the original was directed by David Fincher, Sorkin will take on directing duties for this pic having sharpened his skills since the original Social Network came out. His recent directing credits include Molly's Game, The Trial of the Chicago 7 and Being the Ricardos. 


	No production date has been set, but sources say that with various deals closed, Sorkin will now focus on finding his ensemble. One can expect every agent in town moving fast to get their rising stars in front of Sorkin for the highly-coveted parts, given what the original did for actors including Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield.


	Speaking of Eisenberg, who earned an Oscar nomination for playing Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, it is unknown how big a role he will have in this story and whether Sorkin has been in touch with him to reprise the part. That said, while it makes sense that most of the other characters would not return for this film, it's hard to imagine another movie about Facebook not having Zuckerberg appear in some form.


	Sorkin is repped by WME.

You had me at “Aaron Sorkin writes” and lost me at “Aaron Sorkin directs”

“The Antisocial Network” is right there.

There is no Facebook movie without Zuckerberg. He's got to be a part of this. And there's no better actor to play him than Jesse Eisenberg. You can't call this part 2 and not bring back Eisenberg as Zuckerberg.

What's the difference between a “sequel” and a “follow up”, in the context of a project like this?

Please — for the sake of cinema — have someone else direct it. Sorkin is a great writer, but his direction is sub-Clooney. If Fincher won't do it, bring in Bennett Miller.

	For a supposed democracy that prides itself on the principle of free speech, the United States hasn't done a great job of protecting that right in recent years. Speaking out on hot-button issues can cost you a job offer or a college diploma. Protesting government policies in the streets (or merely covering these demonstrations) means facing excessive force from police, or even the military. 


	So you could forgive people for believing reports that a man was barred from entering the country due to a J.D. Vance meme.


	That's the claim that Mads Mikkelsen, a 21-year-old Norwegian tourist (not to be confused with the Danish actor of the same name), made to his hometown newspaper Nordlys after a planned two-month vacation to the states was cut short before it even began. Mikkelsen said that he was detained by immigration authorities for hours at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey earlier this month, interrogated about terrorism and drug trafficking, and ultimately sent home to Norway because border agents discovered a Photoshopped picture of the vice president with a bald, egg-shaped head on his phone — having threatened him with a hefty fine or jail time if he didn't give them access to the device.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment on the incident, but both CBP and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, have publicly denied that Mikkelsen's trip was scuttled over the meme, insisting that he was rerouted back to Oslo because of his “admitted drug use.” Mikkelsen then confirmed to Nordlys that he had told agents about legally consuming cannabis in both Germany and New Mexico. As a pretext for keeping someone out of the U.S., that's about as flimsy as an offending meme, and Mikkelsen further stated that the explanatory document he received from authorities after he was released is full of bizarre falsehoods, such as claims that he has a Spanish passport, had come to visit family in the U.S., and was traveling with a homemade wooden pipe (in fact, his interrogators had only seen a picture of this object on his phone, along with the outrageous Egghead Vance).

	Even going by the agencies' official story, this was a shocking, thuggish abuse of power. And for all we know, the Vance meme may have indeed been a compounding factor in the decision to refuse Mikkelsen entry, downplayed and dismissed after the fact out of embarrassment. The good news is, the image is once again viral thanks to media coverage, and has been shared by everyone from Democratic senators to politicians in Europe: Ivana Bacik, leader of Ireland's Labour Party, showed a physical copy of the picture in the Dáil, or Irish parliament, arguing that the U.S. has made a “major incursion on freedom of expression.” Because Rolling Stone refuses to to be intimidated by any censorious regime, we are also publishing the meme here.


	It may be worth asking: what is the commentary here, exactly? That the vice president would be more amusing with less hair, a perfectly rounded face, and an uncanny, doll-like stare? Compared to most of the other “rare” Vance portrait edits that took over the internet in February and early March, many of which depicted him as a chubby child, it's not particularly mean, let alone some kind of threat to national security. Perhaps the most galling thing about custom agents flagging such a picture — remember, they haven't denied this part — is that when they were all the rage, Vance himself said he had seen them and thought they were funny. Why is he silent now that federal agents are vetting this sort of material in the customs process, violating the liberty and dignity of a man who also happens to enjoy it?


	Mikkelsen is hardly alone as a foreigner subjected to more invasive scrutiny when traveling to the U.S. these days. The Department of State said last week that those applying for student visas would have to submit to a review of their social media accounts in order to confirm they are not criticizing their host country or its government. Immigrants in general stand to be denied benefit requests because of activity perceived as antisemitic, which can include any show of support for Palestinians amid the continued bombing of Gaza by Israel.

	Hostile or disapproving questions about a silly meme, however, would raise the bar for paranoid border defense to an absurd new level.


	We know from history that repression begets more of the same, that authoritarians become more fragile as they attempt to eliminate even the mildest critiques of their policies and personalities. The Chinese government, for example, has long blocked online references to and illustrations of the iconic children's book character Winnie the Pooh, since bloggers kept drawing comparisons between the plump, slow-witted cartoon bear and leader Xi Jinping. This kind of oversensitivity becomes funny in its own right, and mostly just reinforces the premise of the gag.

	











	Sure, China has the ability to control whether citizens can see Pooh on social media, and the U.S. border patrol has the latitude to turn away anyone who may have ridiculed our current executive branch at some point. But as flexes of the state's strength, these actions betray institutional weaknesses. A vice president theoretically needing protection from the camera roll of a Scandinavian backpacker cannot actually claim the standing of his own office; it's simply too pathetic. As for the security personnel who stand to make that decision on the ground — we absolutely should not put it past them. It's clear from how they treat individuals like Mikkelsen that they are less interested in public safety than opportunities to harass and intimidate.


	As with every other disgrace of the Trump era, rank hypocrisy would be a part of the package. Vance, the president, his cabinet of shitposters, and the Department of Homeland Security have been reveling in all kinds of grotesque memes and AI-generated fascist slop. Much of this content is specifically crafted to smear migrants arrested by masked ICE gangs or broadly propagandize about a fictional mass invasion by marauding people of color. These are attacks on the innocent and vulnerable, yet the White House can always hide behind the excuse of comedy. The far right keeps yukking it up about how easy it is to trigger their ideological opponents this way.


	And yet, the second you ridicule them, you have crossed a red line. Don't tell Trump that Wall Street traders have a market strategy based on the common wisdom that he always “chickens out” on tariffs, or he'll call you “nasty” at a media briefing. Don't take note of press secretary Karoline Leavitt‘s huge, garish cross necklace, or she'll be embarrassed into no longer wearing it. Don't take a shot at Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for spending thousands of dollars to install a makeup studio at the Pentagon, or he'll have to use his personal and departmental accounts to lash out over the “TRASH” story.  


	Above all, do not digitally alter the sacred visage of J.D. Vance. Making him look slightly wider, or redder, or like an emo mall goth is a grave insult to one of the great patriots of our time. More than that, it emboldens America's enemies to see that our politicians can be brought low by cheap viral humor. Nowhere in the Constitution are you guaranteed the right to bear memes. You will have to suffer the corruption and stupidity and vindictive punishments of this administration without resorting to the comforts of laughter.

	Or, because we seem to be hurtling toward the kind of dystopia in which possession of unflattering Vance edits is a legal liability, we ought to be churning them out in greater numbers than ever before. Perhaps the surprise return of Egghead Vance will turn it into symbol of resistance, seen at every demonstration against the cruelties and greed of the Trump machine. It could be a poster, a flag, a towering projection on a building at night, a beacon for all unwilling to surrender.    


	As for the unfortunate Mads Mikkelsen, it seems he learned an important lesson: If he wants to truly experience the land of the free, he should just stay home.

EXCLUSIVE: Vikings star Alexander Ludwig is set to join the Netflix and MRC thriller Unabom, starring Russell Crowe, Jacob Tremblay, Shailene Woodley and Annabelle Wallis. Steven Ogg and Marc Menchaca have also joined the cast. Janus Metz will direct.


	Inspired by true events, Unabom originated as a spec from Sam Chalsen & Nelson Greaves, the writers behind Radio Silence's forthcoming Art Bell project, who have developed the film alongside 2.0 Entertainment (Bad Boys: Ride or Die, The Pope's Exorcist) since its inception. The pic follows Ted Kaczynski's (Tremblay) transformation from Harvard prodigy into the infamous Unabomber, who carried out a nationwide bombing campaign in the U.S. from 1978-95, killing three people and injuring 23.

	











	Subjected to controversial psychological experiments by Professor Henry Murray (Crowe), Kaczynski's troubled past resurfaces decades later when his manhunt, led by FBI agent Joanne Miller (Woodley), brings to light the chilling consequences of ambition and isolation.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Sophie Cassidy will produce for 2.0 Entertainment, in association with MRC. Don Lee, Chalsen and Greaves will executive produce.


	Ludwig, who in 2020 completed his sixth and final season of History's series Vikings, can currently be seen in the limited series Earth Abides for MGM+ opposite Jessica Frances Dukes, based on the novel by George R. Stewart. He was also recently seen in Bad Boys: Ride or Die opposite Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, and finished shooting a lead role in the upcoming feature film Marked Men directed by Nick Cassavetes based on the series of books by Jay Crownover.

	











	He also played Ace Spade in the Peter Segal-directed TV series Heels opposite Stephen Amell. Set in the world of independent professional wrestling, the Starz drama series follows a family-owned wrestling promotion as two brothers and rivals war over their late father's legacy.


	Menchaca can be seen next in the Netflix series Dexter: Resurrection. Ogg can currently be seen in the new SyFy series Revival and previously in BBC's acclaimed Boiling Point. He's also known for TV roles in The Walking Dead, Westworld, Better Call Saul, Snowpiercer and a recent turn in Apple TV's Emancipation, and he voiced Trevor Philips in the blockbuster video game Grand Theft Auto.


	Ludgwig is repped by Gersh, Untitled Entertainment and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. Ogg is repped by Ethos Entertainment and Buchwald.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Scott Speedman has been tapped for the lead in RJ Decker, ABC‘s drama pilot from Elementary creator Rob Doherty based on the 1987 novel Double Whammy by Carl Hiaasen. Speedman will play the title character in the 20th Television pilot, written by Doherty and directed by Paul McGuigan.


	The casting expands Speedman's existing relationship with ABC and 20th TV through his role as Nick Marsh on Grey's Anatomy. He has been recurring on the ABC/20th TV medical drama after a Season 18 series-regular stint. The RJ Decker casting is not expected to impact that, and I hear the plan is for him to be able to do both should the pilot go to series.

	











RJ Decker centers on the eponymous RJ Decker (Speedman), a disgraced newspaper photographer and ex-con who starts over as a private investigator in the colorful-if-crime-filled world of Carl Hiaasen's South Florida. He tackles cases that range from slightly odd to outright bizarre with the help of his journalist ex, her police detective wife and a shadowy new benefactor — a woman from his past who could be his greatest ally … or his one-way ticket back to prison.




			Watch on Deadline

	Speedman's RJ Decker is described as someone who has charm to spare and the owner of a short fuse and a restless soul.


	Doherty executive produces the pilot alongside Carl Beverly and Sarah Timberman of Timberman-Beverly Productions as well as McGuigan and Hiaasen. 20th Television is the studio.

	











	I hear Speedman likely would segue to filming appearances on the upcoming 22nd season of Grey's Anatomy after wrapping RJ Decker. At the time of the Season 21 finale in May, Deadline asked Grey's Anatomy executive producer/showrunner Meg Marinis whether Speedman would be back next season.


	“Obviously, deals haven't been made yet, but we love Scott, and his character Nick and Meredith are still together,” she said of one of the show's most popular couples, played by Speedman and Grey's star Ellen Pompeo. “He was also at the star ceremony supporting Ellen, so it was really great to see. Oh, and the fans were so excited to see him there with her.”


RJ Decker is the only pilot ordered by ABC in 2025 so far. Greenlighted in May for midseason 2026 consideration, it feels like a good fit for crime shows with a light tone — and a singular lead — on the network such as High Potential, The Rookie and Will Trent.


Felicity alum Speedman most recently starred in the Peacock horror series Teacup. He previously was a lead in the TNT drama series Animal Kingdom and had a major recurring role on Season 3 of Netflix's You. In features, he is known for his work in the Underworld franchise. Speedman is repped by CAA, Untitled Entertainment and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.

The "Manchild" singer also began selling signed copies of her upcoming new album.

Pride Editor


	After finding herself in inexplicably hot water over the cheeky cover to her upcoming new album Man's Best Friend, pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter is sharing a new version of the album art — and she says it got the stamp of approval from more than just her label.


	On Wednesday (June 25), Carpenter announced that she was selling signed copies of her new album (due out on Aug. 29 via Island Records), some of which featured a toned-down version of the LP's previously revealed artwork. The new black-and-white cover shows Carpenter with her hand placed on a suited man's shoulder as she peers off-camera.

	











	“i signed some copies of Man's Best Friend for you guys,” she wrote in the caption. “& here is a new alternate cover approved by God.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	The switched-up photo comes after Carpenter received a wave of backlash after unveiling the original artwork for the album, which featured her on her hands and knees touching a man's leg, while the faceless individual held up a fistful of her hair. 

	











	Some critics called out the cover's provocative and sexualized imagery, with a few going as far as to claim that the image was anti-feminist. But plenty of others defended the Man's Best Friend artwork as another extension of the singer's well-established brand of sex positivity. Even legendary singer-songwriter Carly Simon weighed in on the controversy, saying that the artwork looked “tame” to her. “She's not doing anything outrageous … There have been far flashier covers than hers,” Simon said in an interview with Rolling Stone. “I don't know why she's getting such flak.”


	The album itself is already off to a good start, with lead single “Manchild” earning Carpenter her second No. 1 hit on the June 21-dated Billboard Hot 100 and becoming her first song to debut at the top of the chart. “I can't tell you how much this means to me!!!!” she wrote on Instagram after news broke of her No. 1 debut. “This song makes me so happy. Thank you eternally for listening.”

A few days after Cannes wrapped up last month, my IndieWire colleague Ryan Lattanzio published an interview with filmmaker Nadav Lapid, whose furious new satire of modern Israel quietly premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section at the very end of the festival. That was a curious and pronounced demotion for a rising auteur whose similarly blistering previous feature (2021's “Ahed's Knee”) had been selected for the main Competition, where it emerged from a stacked field to win the Jury Prize. But the world has changed over the last four years, and — according to French outlet Le Nouvel Obs — Cannes president Iris Knobloch is no longer comfortable with shining her festival's brightest spotlight on a movie so hostile towards Benjamin Netanyahu's ongoing genocide.

 








Related Stories ‘M3GAN 2.0' Review: Bloated Killer Robot Sequel Swaps AI Horror for Desperate Action-Comedy Hudson Film Festival's Third Annual Edition Features Sundance Winners ‘East of Wall' and ‘Cactus Pears' 

Ryan's headline, “You May Never Get to See Cannes' Most Provocative and ‘Dangerous' Movie,” epitomizes the sensationalism that ad-supported websites like ours sometimes lean on to drive clicks toward stories about two-and-a-half-hour art films that the reader may never get a chance to see (a shocking admission, I know). And truth be told, I might have rolled my eyes at that framing had I not already seen the movie in question But I had seen the movie. Just as importantly, I've also seen how other movies about Israel's war on Gaza have been treated since the events of October 7, 2023, and so — to my great dismay — my only reaction to Ryan's headline was to wince in recognition of its truth. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Lapid's film is called “Yes.” The film industry's response to it has predictably been “no.” 

For the first time in my professional career as a critic, there is a subject that some festivals — and virtually all U.S. distributors — are too afraid to touch. In a bleeding-heart business that prides itself on the sensitivity it brings to difficult stories, a business in which people are regularly festooned with awards for shining a light on the darkest corners of human civilization, the Palestinian genocide has become uniquely taboo.

You know things are bleak when the Oscars are the industry's lone act of moral courage, but in rewarding “No Other Land” with the documentary world's highest honor, the Academy forced attention onto a crisis that the rest of Hollywood still won't touch.

Or even deign to profit from! Even more than its liberal bonafides, our country's independent film business loves stellar box office returns. However, the overwhelming interest in “No Other Land” — which became an object of great fascination upon its prize-winning premiere at the 2024 Berlinale, and was clearly destined for an Oscar nomination soon thereafter — mysteriously failed to translate into proper distribution. 

 










The film was earmarked for success, and had it been about any other subject, that would have been reason enough for someone to release it. And I was certain that someone would. After all, the moral consequences of settler colonialism is only the single most popular subject in the history of American moviegoing, and so it didn't seem all that far-fetched to think that a single distributor might be willing to display the same backbone as the YouTube star who sings to my two-year-old daughter about the magic of using the potty.

While rumors persist that producers rejected a handful of offers in order to preserve the movie's “Netanyahu doesn't want you to see this” mystique (a source confirmed they balked at a single lowball offer), even the most forward-thinking and outspoken executives I harangued about “No Other Land” last summer told me they couldn't afford the controversy. Precisely none of them changed their minds after the film was invited to Hollywood's biggest night.

Needless to say, that's a sharp break in the history of a business that has long seen a degree of public discomfort as more feature than bug. When rumors spread that  “Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat” would make audiences fear for their very lives, the Lumière brothers' actuality became an international sensation. Almost 100 years later, the promise of protests and death threats failed to stop Universal Pictures from turning a profit on “The Last Temptation of Christ,” which screened around the world even after an Integralist Catholic group set fire to a Paris cinema in the middle of a screening. Glib or otherwise, examples abound.

 










But Israel is unique for how its identity as an ethnostate has been weaponized into a rhetorical shield the size of the Iron Dome. Accusations of “anti-Semitism” are routinely used to silence critics — much as right-wing activists invoked misguided accusations of pedophilia to turn “Cuties” into a symbol of supposed liberal depravity. Domestic Zionist groups even threatened to revoke the lease of a theater that screened “No Other Land.” (Upon withdrawing his resolution, Miami Beach mayor Steven Meiner called upon the nonprofit theater in question to screen films in which “the viewpoint of the State of Israel is fully and accurately presented,” which of course describes “No Other Land” to a tee.) Be that as it may, one can only imagine the very real difficulties that distributors might have faced had they put themselves in the line of fire, and so the vast majority of them decided that it wasn't worth the trouble.

“No Other Land” was ultimately self-released, and its $2.5 million box office haul made it the third-highest-grossing documentary of 2024. It earned more than any movie ever distributed by the only company that made a formal offer for it. 

The point, of course, isn't that America's film industry should be doing more to profit off the back of an unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe. The point is that America's film industry is displaying a collective degree of cowardice that finds it deliberately acting against its own ethos as both an artform and a business. The former is routine, but the latter is remarkable.

 










For me, it represents a moral abstention wholly unprecedented in my lifetime. Consider Hollywood's relatively decisive reaction to other global crises. The AIDS outbreak is an imperfect comparison for several reasons, but I'm struck by the fact that sober and enduring movies about the epidemic were widely distributed as early as 1985 despite the virulent demonization of its victims. Michael Moore was booed at the Oscars for voicing his opposition to the Iraq War in 2003, only for “Fahrenheit 9/11” to gross more than $222 million the very next year. Today, it often takes less than a week for a disaster to become the subject of its own Hulu documentary.

While the films' impact on government policy and/or public opinion is debatable, movies large and small have been at the forefront of some of the 21st century's most difficult conversations. It was the movies that told us that climate change is real. That Michael Jackson was bad. That McDonald's makes you fat. It was the movies that revealed the extent of the American government's efforts to surveil its own people, took us into the broken heart of the war in Ukraine, and proved that octopuses can teach you things.

And now, among all forms of popular media, it's the movies that now feel uniquely feckless as they respond with uncharacteristic silence to one of the worst ongoing atrocities of our time. 

 










As the Jewish grandson of a Holocaust survivor, I haven't been shy about my feelings toward the atrocities being committed in Gaza. The horror I feel about them being conducted in my name, and with my tax dollars, is obviously at the root of my frustration with the film industry's continued refusal to meet — or even observe — the moment. It's a refusal so complete that Badie and Hamza Ali had to launch their own label, Watermelon Pictures, to ensure that urgent documentaries like “From Ground Zero” and “The Encampments” were made available to American viewers. 

And yet, I didn't write this column just to revisit the lack of support for “No Other Land,” or even to bemoan the fact that “Yes” faces even bleaker prospects at receiving proper distribution. Not only is Lapid's film a much thornier piece of work that's willing to provoke viewers on both sides of the “is genocide good?” debate (a license it self-grants by acknowledging the absurdity of that question), but its lack of awards potential denies it the best sales hook that “No Other Land” had to its advantage.

The specialized market is on its knees at the moment and many of its biggest players are partially funded by Israeli money. Still, this represents a striking reversal of fortune for Lapid, a filmmaker whose previous movies have all been released in the United States despite sharing the same mercilessly self-excoriating approach to Israeli-ness that rages beneath every minute of “Yes.” 

 










I suspected that would be the case for whatever movie Lapid chose to make in the aftermath of October 7. While I was dismayed that every distribution executive I spoke to at Cannes seemed to shudder at the mere thought of acquiring “Yes,” I wasn't surprised. What caught me off guard, and what inspired me to yell back into the void about an all-too-familiar subject (at a time of such widespread chaos that it seems ridiculous to think the film industry matters at all) was the possibility that “Yes” may not even get another chance to be ignored. 

It hadn't occurred to me that this singularly vital addition to post-October 7 cinema that dared to do more than pick a side might be shunned from the same festivals that leapt at the chance to screen his previous work.

“Yes” has not been formally rejected from Telluride, TIFF, NYFF, or any of the other marquee stops on the fall circuit, but as of this writing I can confirm that it has yet to be privately invited to any of them either, which isn't an encouraging sign at this point in the summer. I'm confident that cooler heads will prevail, especially at festivals that have long embraced political antagonism as a raison d'être, but the uncertainty alone is enough to redouble my fear that the film industry's recent conservatism is trickling upward even faster than it's trickling down from the executive level.

 










The problem is worsened by the broken and outmoded state of the Oscars' Best International Feature category, which lets foreign governments handpick their own submissions and launder their public images. While recent nominees like “I'm Still Here,” “Collective,” and “Argentina, 1985” didn't flatter their home countries, the system gives authoritarian regimes the power to bury dissenting films. China can block wider recognition of Jia Zhangke's “Caught by the Tides,” Iran can limit the audience for Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident,” and Georgia can suppress Dea Kulumbegashvili's “April” — a film so politically explosive it forced its director into exile. The Academy process enables the very abuses these films seek to expose.

That the Israeli Film Fund contributed financing to “Yes” is 1) hilarious, and 2) no reason to hope the country would submit a legendary self-own to the Academy Awards. (Lapid told Ryan he wasn't sure the government was even aware of the movie's existence.)

How much does that matter in the grand scheme of things? Even in an alternate universe where “Yes” wound up in the mix on Oscar night, it's not as if it would drastically reconfigure the discourse about the genocide in Gaza. A little gold man doesn't have the power to un-kill 50,000 children any more than it has the power to spare the deaths of 50,000 more. “No Other Land” winning an Academy Award didn't even prevent the further desecration of the area depicted in the film, nor did it prevent producer Hamdan Ballal from being savagely attacked by a group of masked settlers soon after he returned home from Los Angeles. 

 










The Dolby Theatre hosted two of Hollywood's only meaningful attempts to confront the slaughter, and those moments landed with disproportionate force because they pierced through our community's galling abstention from this atrocity. The speeches from the “No Other Land” team earlier this year, and “The Zone of Interest” director Jonathan Glazer the year before, cast a brief, glaring light on a crisis that the industry continues to ignore. In those moments, television confronted a reality that film has refused to acknowledge for itself— a humiliating failure for a medium once hailed as “truth 24 times per second.”

I've long argued that movies have a brighter future than streaming lobbyists would have us believe, but such willful blindness is the only thing that's ever truly dimmed my optimism for the medium's continued value. In a world starved for the very truth that our industry has neglected to acknowledge, what value could the cinema possibly hold if it lacks the courage to show us the reality that confronts us on every other screen?

When real-life Hallmark couple Erin Krakow and Ben Rosenbaum, who both star on “When Calls The Heart,” revealed via social media on June 23, 2025, that they'd tied the knot, it came as a huge surprise to fans — and maybe even some of their fellow stars, since the duo never revealed publicly that they were engaged. 

Although a handful of their famous friends were quick to reply to their June 23 announcement, including their dear friends and fellow WCTH couple Kevin McGarry and Kayla Wallace, many more have since replied with sweet words of celebration. 

A post shared by Erin Krakow (@erinkrakow)

Less than four days after Krakow posted two photos from her and Rosenbaum's nuptials, with her wearing a beautiful wedding dress and long veil, and him in chocolate brown suit, nearly 80,000 fans and friends had liked the post and almost 5,000 had left comments. 

McGarry, who plays Mountie Nathan Grant on WCTH — now the beau to Krakow's lead character Elizabeth Thornton as they head into filming season 13 — was one of the first to react to her post, sweetly writing, “Beautiful pictures, beautiful friends, beautiful husband and wife – xo”

McGarry's wife Wallace, who now appears part-time on the WCTH given her role in Paramount's “Landman,” wrote, “I'm still crying. My favourite pairing! 🧀 🍷”

On June 25, Pascale Hutton, who plays Krakow's best friend on WCTH, popped in to write, “Love you both with all my heart ❤️”

Kavan Smith noticed Rosenbaum's cool two-toned loafers and wrote, “Perfect couple. Love the shoes B”

Hyland Goodrich, who plays Krakow's son Little Jack on the show, left a comment (likely with help from his mom) that said, “A pairing written in the stars. ✨ You two are magic! 🥰🎊🤗😍”

Tierra Skovbye, who joined the cast during season 12, wrote, “You guys!!! I am so happy for you!!! ❤️❤️❤️ stunning!”

Melissa Gilbert, who also joined the cast as a guest star in season 12 and will return for season 13, commented, “This makes me soooooo happy!!! Congratulations you two!”

Viv Leacock, who plays Joseph Canfield on WCTH, chimed in, “So much love!!! So happy for you two!! Both looking absolutelyincredible!! Much love from all of us❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️”

WCTH co-creator and producer Brian Bird wrote, “So thrilled for you, Ben and Erin! Two of my favorite people in the world!”

The cast has been dropping into wardrobe for individual fittings in Vancouver throughout June, but they're sure to celebrate Krakow and Rosenbaum's union when they're all back together to start filming season 13 in July. 

A post shared by Erin Krakow (@erinkrakow)

It's not just WCTH cast members celebrating Krakow and Rosenbaum in the comment section of their wedding announcement. Plenty of other Hallmark stars have shared their excitement for them too, including Krakow's “It Was Always You” co-star Tyler Hynes, who commented, “Love n stuff ✨🤍✨”

Tamera Mowry-Housley, who recently filmed a fun Hallmark+ promo with Krakow, called out the bride's curly updo by writing, “Curls are gorgeous 😍 Congrats @erinkrakow 💍”

Rachel Boston chimed in with “Congratulations!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️” and Lacey Chabert wrote a nearly identical comment, “Congratulations!!!! 💗💗💗💗”

The pair is going strong heading into the summer.

Cardi B and boyfriend Stefon Diggs are living their best lives with a trip to France. Cardi showed off the lavish digs of their medieval mansion while enjoying one another's company in a series of Instagram Stories on Tuesday (June 24).


	While presumably in town for Paris Fashion Week, Cardi couldn't believe her NFL star boo booked them a massive castle. 












	“This man got us staying in a castle. I'm talking a real castle. Look at this, this is a real f–king castle,” she said as she showed off the building. “Look at that, there's real crocodiles in there. Mind you, I been told him, every time I go to Europe I can never go to Versailles … He said, ‘B—h, you want castle? I'll give you a castle, b—h.'”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Cardi continued to give fans a tour of the luxurious chateau while taking them back in time through the dining room, bedroom and indoor pool wing of the castle. “Look how beautiful. This man is so rich he got us in a f—king castle. Like, look at this, I can't believe we staying in a place like this. This is insane.”


Another clip found Diggs joking about how he and Cardi will be sitting and eating dinner while at opposite ends of the huge dining room.


	The Grammy-winning rapper even took fans behind the scenes of her wooden bathroom. “Look at the toilet, chile,” she posted to her IG Story. “This is where I'mma take that royal s—t. And this where I'ma wash my royal hiney.”

	











	Cardi seems to be on cloud nine in her new relationship with Diggs. Dating rumors swirled between the rapper and NFL star at the top of 2025, but they made things official when stepping out to a New York Knicks playoff game together in May.


	The Bronx native is officially in album mode, as Cardi B announced plans for her Am I the Drama? album earlier this week. The project is slated to arrive on Sept. 19.

	Social media influencer Liver King has been arrested and charged with making alleged “terroristic threats” against Joe Rogan, Austin's KXAN reports. The 47-year-old born Brian Johnson shared a series of Instagram videos earlier this week in which he challenged the podcaster to a fight. 


	“Joe Rogan, I'm calling you out, my name's Liver King. Man to man, I'm picking a fight with you,” he said. “I have no training in Jiu-jitsu; you're a black belt, you should dismantle me. But I'm picking a fight with you. Your rules, I'll come to you, whenever you're ready.” 

A post shared by Liver King (@liverking)


	“On Tuesday, June 24, 2025, at approximately 9:30 a.m., Austin Police Department (APD) detectives were notified that a subject identified as Brian Johnson, known online as ‘Liver King', had made threats against Joe Rogan on his Instagram profile,” the Austin Police Department shared in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Detectives reviewed the posts and observed that Johnson was traveling to Austin while continuing to make threatening statements. Detectives contacted Mr. Rogan, who stated he had never had any interaction with Johnson and considered the posts to be threatening. Based on this information, detectives obtained an arrest warrant for Johnson on a charge of Terroristic Threat.” 

	











	Johnson was taken into custody at a Four Seasons Hotel in Austin, Texas, on Tuesday, June 24. The videos he posted were shared consistently from Monday, June 23 into June 24. “This remains an active investigation,” the police department said.

	According to documents from the Travis County Jail, Johnson now faces one Class B Misdemeanor charge of Terroristic Threat Causing Fear of Imminent SBI. He is being held on $20,000 bond. 

A post shared by Liver King (@liverking)


	According to the Texas-based Keates Law Firm website, which bears no known association to Johnson, a Terroristic Threat Causing Fear of Imminent SBI charge generally relates to threats “to commit any offense involving violence with intent to place a person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury,” or “places the public or a substantial group of the public in fear of serious bodily injury.”

	In 2022, Rogan accused Johnson of using steroids. “There's no way you can look like that in your 40s,” Rogan said at the time. “I mean, he's preposterously jacked.” Later that year, Johnson admitted to steroid use. “I'm here now to set the record straight,” Johnson said in his video addressing the matter. “Yes, I've done steroids, and yes, I'm on steroids, monitored and managed by a trained hormone clinician. Liver King, the public figure, was an experiment to spread the message.”


	Last month, Netflix's popular sports documentary series Untold released Untold: The Liver King, exploring the creation of Johnson's digital empire. “We live in a time when someone can reach hundreds of millions of people without going through any kind of traditional gatekeeping. No background checks. Just a phone and a guy,” director Joe Pearlman said when announcing the film. “And when shock and outrage get views, what are you willing, or even able, to keep doing to stay at the top of the algorithm?”

	The fallout from President Donald Trump's decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities continued to dog the president at this week's NATO summit in the Netherlands. The current ceasefire between Israel and Iran doesn't seem totally stable, and a leaked Department of Defense intelligence report indicates the strikes may have been far less effective than the president and the White House are claiming. 


	On Tuesday, several outlets reported that an early intelligence assessment found that Saturday's strikes against three of Iran's nuclear facilities — including its central base in Fordow — only partially damaged the targets, and had likely only set back the Iranian nuclear program by a few months. 


	Trump has forcefully insisted that the bases had been “obliterated” by the strike, and the White House and other administration officials tried to dismiss the Pentagon intelligence on Tuesday. Trump repeatedly doubled down while in the Netherlands for the  NATO meeting, a critical gathering of European leaders amidst ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. 

	











	In a Truth Social post written Tuesday evening, Trump wrote: “FAKE NEWS CNN, TOGETHER WITH THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES, HAVE TEAMED UP IN AN ATTEMPT TO DEMEAN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MILITARY STRIKES IN HISTORY. THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED! BOTH THE TIMES AND CNN ARE GETTING SLAMMED BY THE PUBLIC!” 


	During a press conference with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof on Wednesday, Trump complained to reporters that CNN and The New York Times — the first outlets to report on the DOD intelligence assessment — were “fake news” and had “[made] up a phony story to get some hits.” 

	











	“They're both disgusting, really horrible groups of people,” Trump added. 


	In a separate solo presser, the president claimed multiple times that the facilities had been “obliterated,” by the strikes and that any reports to the contrary were false.

	“We destroyed the nuclear. I said, Iran will not have nuclear weapons. Well, we blew it up. It's blown up to kingdom come,” he said at one point. The president claimed that Iran had directly confirmed the destruction of the facilities, and the White House issued a press release citing a statement from Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei, who said that Iran's “nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that's for sure.”


	The extent of the damage remains unclear, and the intelligence report leaked to news outlets conceded that the striked had collapsed entrances to the facilities and potentially crippled electrical systems. However, Fordow and other facilities are buried deep underground, and the condition of the primary structures have not been ascertained. Iran also reportedly moved uranium from the facilities ahead of the strike. Trump denied this, as well, claiming the sites were hit “so hard and so fast that they didn't get to move.”


	Trump bashed the media for writing negative stories, but didn't deny the existence of the intelligence report, or what it contained.


	“It's been obliterated,” Trump said in response to a reporter asking about the strikes, before admitting that it's only been “a few days,” and the only assessments that have been done are based on initial intelligence and satellite imagery. “It could be severe or maybe it's not,” Trump said.

	Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth then jumped in to accuse members of the media of not caring “what the troops think,” and working to hurt Trump's agenda. Hegseth insisted that the nuclear program had been “obliterated,” and called the leaked report “low confidence.” Hegseth also admitted that the majority of the evidence related to the effectiveness of the strike was buried deep underground, and that if someone wants “to make an assessment of what happened at Fordow you better get a big shovel and go really deep.”


	Shortly before the presser, Hegseth announced that the Department of Defense was conducting “a leak investigation with the FBI right now because this information is for internal purposes, battle damage assessments.”

	Hours after prosecutors rested their sprawling sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy case against Sean Combs on Tuesday, prosecutors filed a late-night letter to the court saying they would no longer be pursuing theories that the Bad Boy Records founder was involved in attempted arson, attempted kidnapping, and aiding and abetting sex trafficking.


	The alleged acts were listed in Combs' indictment under Count One, his racketeering conspiracy charge. Prosecutors listed arson and kidnapping as predicate acts that included both substantive and “attempted” acts.


	“The Government is no longer planning to proceed on these theories of liability, so instructions are no longer necessary,” prosecutors wrote in their letter to U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian.


	The alleged racketeering conspiracy count still alleges Combs and his co-conspirators engaged in other predicate acts including bribery, witness tampering, forced labor, and drug offenses.


	And Combs is still facing separate counts of sex trafficking his ex-girlfriends Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and a woman using the pseudonym Jane, as well as two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly paying for male escorts to fly across the country to have sex with his girlfriends while he watched.

	











	The 55-year-old, who seemed to be in good spirits in the final days of his trial, has pleaded not guilty to all charges.


	To Mark Chutkow, a former federal prosecutor in Detroit who specialized in racketeering and human trafficking cases, prosecutors streamlining aspects of the predicate acts when giving charging instructions to the jury serves two purposes: minimizing confusion and warding off a possible defense strategy of accusing the government of overreaching. 

	











	“I wouldn't see that as a victory for [Combs] per se,” Chutkow, now a trial attorney at Dykema Gossett, tells Rolling Stone. “That's just something that happens in large, complex cases where you want to make sure that the jury doesn't get confused.”

	“The judge is clearly concerned about jury confusion, but the prosecution should be too because confusion is an advantage to the defense,” Chutkow adds. “The prosecution wants the cleanest case that they can present to the jury, so that there aren't a lot of disputes and arguments there.” 


	The alleged kidnapping of former Combs assistant Capricorn Clark in 2004 marks the start of the government's racketeering conspiracy count against Combs. Clark testified that Combs accused her of stealing diamond jewelry and had a security guard ransack her apartment looking for the items. After the guard found nothing, Clark said she was escorted to a locked, dilapidated office building in midtown where an unknown man administered five consecutive days of lie-detector tests. “He said if you fail these tests, they're going to throw you in the East River,” Clark testified.


	Years later, in December 2011, Clark said she was in Los Angeles working for Combs when he arrived at her apartment. Livid and allegedly toting a gun, Combs had just come from a freak-off with Ventura and discovered the R&B singer was dating rapper Kid Cudi (real name Scott Mescudi). “Get dressed; we're going to go kill that n—a,” Combs allegedly said. Clark said she was terrified, but when she tried to protest, Combs told her, “I don't give a fuck what you want to do.” 


	Clark claimed that as she rode in Combs' SUV with his driver over to Mescudi's Hollywood Hills home, the gun was visible in Combs' lap. She said she stayed in the car as Combs roamed around Mescudi's house, making a panicked call to Ventura when he wasn't looking.

	Weeks later, in January 2012, Mescudi testified that after rebuffing Combs' attempts to talk about his fling with Ventura, he received a call that his Porsche had been fire-bombed. A hole was cut into the roof, and a Molotov cocktail had been dropped into the driver's seat of the luxury vehicle, charring the car's interior and destroying the car. Ventura testified that Combs had earlier threatened to explode Mescudi's car in his driveway, and Mescudi said he suspected Combs had something to do with the arson attempt.


	The third alleged kidnapping incident occurred in January 2009, stemming from Combs allegedly stomping on Ventura's face in the back of a car after a night out. “I never experienced anything like that before where I was getting really, really badly beaten,” Ventura testified. 

	











	Afterward, Ventura said Combs' security members had to “sneak” her into a hotel, where she stayed for a week as her injuries healed. Although Ventura said she told Combs that she wanted to leave, Combs allegedly refused. “I don't think I would have gotten out of there smoothly,” Ventura explained when questioned why she didn't just leave the hotel by herself. “It was not safe. I didn't have just the resources I need[ed] to get out and move and not have anybody stop me,” she said. 


	The government's letter followed hours after prosecutors rested their case, which spanned six weeks and included tearful testimony from many of the trial's 34 witnesses.

	On Tuesday, Shapiro argued there was especially “thin proof” that Combs' employees had “knowingly participated in crimes with or for Mr. Combs” other than picking up “personal” quantities of drugs. When it came to freak-offs, where the alleged sex trafficking took place, Shapiro claimed Combs and his girlfriends went out of their way to hide the details of Combs' personal sex life from his staffers, booking male escorts themselves. 


	“The assistants set up and cleaned hotel rooms, but they didn't know much, if anything, about what went on between Mr. Combs and his girlfriends in the hotel rooms, other than they used a lot of baby oil and Astroglide and drank alcohol and perhaps used drugs,” Shapiro said.

EXCLUSIVE: British actress Jessica Madsen (Bridgerton) has landed the female lead opposite Xavier Molyneux In Bloodaxe, Prime Video‘s historical drama series created, written, and exec produced by Vikings creator Michael Hirst and his son, Horatio Hirst.


	Madsen will play Gunnhild, the wife of Erik Bloodaxe (Molyneux), also known as the Mother of Kings. We were first to report on Molyneux's casting yesterday.


	The show chronicles the rise of one of history's most famous Norse raiders, Erik Bloodaxe, and his formidable wife, Gunnhild. As they fight for the throne of Norway, the land is torn apart by fierce rivals, shifting loyalties, and bloody betrayals. With war looming and chaos consuming the kingdom, drawing in the ruthless Kings of other Scandinavian countries, and even a powerful English ruler, the stage is set for a thundering, cataclysmic, compelling and utterly magical new Norse Saga.

	











	Officially ordered in March, the show will be produced by MGM Television, a division of Amazon MGM Studios, with production beginning in Ireland and Iceland later this summer. Michael and Horatio Hirst will showrun and write, exec producing alongside Morgan O'Sullivan under his O'Sullivan Productions label, Steve Stark under his Toluca Pictures label, Arturo Interian, John Weber, Sheila Hockin, and Fred Toye.




			Watch on Deadline		







	While the show shares creative lineage with the 2013-20 History series Vikings and the 2022-25 Netflix follow-up Vikings: Valhalla — all three are based on historical figures and produced by MGM Television — Bloodaxe is not directly related to those efforts. The new Norse saga takes place decades after the original series and decades before Valhalla. 

	











	Madsen is best known for playing fan favorite mean girl Cressida Cowper in Bridgerton, one of the Top 10 most watched series in Netflix history, since Season 1. She's earned two SAG Award nominations as part of the ensemble and is repped by the UK's United Agents and Ethos Entertainment.

A broken clock is right twice a day, but even at its funniest, “M3GAN 2.0” feels like it's here too soon and too late. Filmmaker Gerard Johnstone returns with a frustrating and tedious follow-up to Blumhouse's smash-hit horror movie about a killer robot from 2023. 

The director reunites with original “M3GAN” stars Allison Williams and Violet McGraw for his bizarro sequel — an exhausting two-hour expansion that introduces several different versions of M3GAN (played by Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and a strange new frenemy known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno). Johnstone steers the murderous android into a muddy redemption arc just as he forces the franchise to abruptly switch genres. Swapping out scares for action beats, that unexpected approach creates a colorful techno-apocalypse with admirable ambitions aimed at something like “Terminator II — for Girls!” Still, it lacks life.

Johnstone loses his way, taking over writing the script from the wonderfully funny Akela Cooper (“Malignant”). She created the first “M3GAN” with James Wan and has a story credit on the sequel. Her wickedly dark humor lives on in M3GAN's vicious one-liners, even as Johnstone's exposition-heavy script drags the story down. From “Evil Dead” to “The Strangers,” scary movies will often make dramatic tonal shifts between their first and second chapters. That's as good a strategy as any for keeping seasoned slasher fans on their toes, but storytelling categories as potentially diverse as horror and action can draw in totally different audiences. Bolting those two crowds together can be tough, and “M3GAN 2.0” multiplies its problem by seeming ambivalent in the penumbra of real AI.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Tasked with more screen time than anyone (or anything) in this film needs, Williams reprises her role as Gemma. A reluctant caregiver and negligent toy inventor — picture the mom from “Child's Play” combined with Mark Zuckerberg on an apology tour — she almost lost her niece, Cady (McGraw), to an anxiously attached prototype a few years ago. At age 12, the Orphan Formerly Known as M3GAN's Best Friend has mixed feelings about her brush with the deadly doll. Sure, Cady's high-tech companion killed four people and a dog; not to mention, she threatened to lobotomize her aunt. But that was then, this is now, and as M3GAN explains upon her triumphant and bratty return, she only did those things because she is “a person!” with “feelings!!” and she was “UPSET!!!”

In her first movie, M3GAN was campy enough to become an accidental gay icon, on par with quietly fabulous tormenters from Pennywise to The Babadook. Now, in June 2025, Blumhouse is sending her sequel to theaters on a confused wave of Pride-themed marketing so niche it seems likely to undercut the film's PG-13 rating. The hit-or-miss studio tends to misdirect its success, but Johnstone helps Blumhouse turn “M3GAN 2.0” into an extravagant work of misunderstanding with a misshapen narrative that is both logically messy and emotionally insecure. An explosive source of passive aggression, M3GAN is beloved by moviegoers for her unfiltered reactions and atypical combination of traits. 

 










She's lethally maternal but motivated by a specific type of single-minded terror that's usually reserved for narcissistic men and the grudges of preteen girls. Arm the more menacing, earlier version of M3GAN with some real firepower, and you could unearth some extra grisly horror-action scenes. Sadly, Johnstone can't make himself cut enough dialogue to deliver on the promise of even his smartest set-pieces. M3GAN hacking into a rentable street scooter should be bloody and memorable. Instead, the sequel chains its bitchy anti-hero to a morality lesson that won't end and confirms: “M3GAN 2.0” is not a horror movie by most definitions. Compared to other Blumhouse sequels, the robotic misfire recalls the toothlessness of “Five Nights at Freddy's” and the good-idea-bad-execution of “The Forever Purger.”  It also makes you fear for the fate of future projects, including the “Ma” sequel or “Black Phone 2.”

Johnstone's repeated attempts to find the soul of “M3GAN 2.0” are better than releasing a film you know is shallow. Die-hard fans will discover enough pleasing weirdness — particularly in its pandering conclusion, inconsistent special effects, and the way Williams says “melatonin” — to make the entire affair seem worthwhile. (It's no La Roux's “Bulletproof,” but you can also expect to hear at least one outrageous needle drop from a legendary pop princess. That said, the sequel's dancing disappoints.)

 










Still, M3GAN's greatest asset was never her heart, but her lack of one. It's somewhat baffling, then, that she is easily the most likable character in a lineup of algorithmically hateable humans. The sequel's director hails from New Zealand, and that's presumably how he got Jemaine Clement to play a whacked-out tech billionaire. But Hell only knows where Blumhouse started looking when it was time to cast a slippery tech ethicist as Gemma's profoundly pretentious love interest (Aristotle Athari).

Useless narrative threads and too many wasted elements give away “M3GAN 2.0” as an amateur effort made by a talented horror filmmaker who has not yet mastered action's specific visual language or skill set. Of course, when Blumhouse makes the risky move back toward “M3GAN” with its spinoff “Soulmate” (already scheduled for next year), the should-be silly series ought to experiment with a hybrid model mixing the stakes of serious nightmares with the spectacle of nunchucks. Only then will true “M3GAN” devotees see the blood-thirsty queen of the bear crawl properly unleashed.

From Universal Pictures, “M3GAN 2.0” is in theaters on Friday, June 27.

Violet McGraw also returns as the orphaned niece of a roboticist whose rogue automaton companion must be reassembled to bring down an even deadlier doll.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	The campy sense of mischief that made Gerard Johnstone's 2023 hit M3GAN so enjoyable asserts itself intermittently in M3GAN 2.0, a logical title for a follow-up to the thriller about a murderous robot. But the humor is forced to compete with seriously overcomplicated plotting in a sequel that entangles its horror comedy roots with uninspired espionage elements, becoming a convoluted mishmash with shades of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Mission: Impossible and the Austin Powers franchise. There are amusing moments reminiscent of the original, but in terms of tone and coherence, the movie loses its way.

	The sequel works best when its focus remains on the central family unit — robotics scientist Gemma (Allison Williams), her orphaned niece Cady (Violet McGraw) and M3GAN (played physically by dancer Amie Donald in a mask and voiced by Jenna Davis), the android intended as Cady's companion and protector, who went rogue in the last movie and had to be destroyed.

The Bottom Line

	
	Bigger is not necessarily better.
	



Release date: Friday, June 27Cast: Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, Brian Jordan Alvarez, Jen Van Epps, Amie Donald, Jenna Davis, Aristotle Athani, Timm Sharp, Ivanna Sakhno, Jemaine ClementDirector-screenwriter: Gerard Johnstone

									Rated PG-13,
								1 hour 59 minutes			






	Johnstone takes on solo script duties from a story he developed with M3GAN screenwriter Akela Cooper, based on characters she created with James Wan. The director makes it clear from the opening that this will be a very different film — less interested in the domestic dysfunction and corporate mayhem of its predecessor and more concerned with arms-dealers, duplicitous techies and an industrial military complex with a shiny new toy. None of which, sad to say, is terribly fresh or exciting.

	











	Much has changed on the artificial intelligence front in the two-and-a-half years since M3GAN was released, as AI has rapidly become more prevalent in contemporary life, both online and off-. The new movie states the obvious when it talks up the need for humans to co-exist with robotics technology, albeit with legal safeguards in place. But it's too silly to have much bearing on the real world.


	The tagline for the sequel is “I'm Still That B.” But M3GAN 2.0 is too infrequently allowed to be that B. Instead, she starts acquiring empathy and morality, which we all know are no fun.


	That's not to say she has lost her snarky delivery, her mean-girl death stare or her passive-aggressive manipulation skills. “You killed four people and a dog!” Gemma reminds her. “I was a kid when it happened, doing what I thought was right,” replies M3GAN with dubious contrition. She then gives Gemma a comforting peptalk about the challenges of being a mom before launching into a truly hilarious Kate Bush homage.


	While M3GAN's humanoid casing was destroyed when she got out of control last time around, her codes survived in not-quite-sleep mode. She's been an unseen but all-seeing presence in Gemma and Cady's home, which also serves as the lab where Gemma and her colleagues Cole (Brian Jordan Alvarez) and Tess (Jen Van Epps) continue their robotics work. 


	M3GAN has way too much intimate knowledge of her inventor for Gemma's comfort, but when their lives are endangered, the robot makes a convincing case that only she can help them take down a new robo-threat. All she needs is a new body and a few upgrades.

	











	That threat goes by the name Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno), the T-1000 to M3GAN's 101 model. Developed from the M3GAN template by the U.S. Army's Defense Innovation Unit in Palo Alto and overseen by Colonel Sattler (Timm Sharp), Amelia is introduced on a test mission near the Turkish Iranian border, where she ignores her orders to rescue a kidnapped scientist, instead killing him and wiping out an entire research facility.


	Once Amelia has eliminated almost everyone involved in her creation, Gemma and Cady seem likely to be next on her list. But there's an awful lot of plot to trudge through before Amelia's inevitable encounter with the rebirthed M3GAN.


	Some of that involves Gemma's advocacy for stricter AI control measures; her quasi-romance with fellow cautionary tech activist Christian (Aristotle Athani); her secret development with Cole and Tess of an AI-free mecha-suit that will equip humans with robot strength and stamina; the industrial espionage of tech billionaire Alton Appleton (Jemaine Clement), who believes that Gemma's new exosuit could be a game-changer with the addition of his neuro-chips; and the discovery of a killer robot dating back to 1984, dubbed Project Black Box, which has been locked in a vault, continuing to develop for decades. The ultimate fear is that Amelia will harness that mother-bot's power and unleash global chaos.


	Naturally, there's also friction between rebellious Cady and her aunt, whose alarmism after the renegade M3GAN disaster in the first movie means computer science enthusiast Cady has to keep her own robotics projects hidden. Not that this thread is given the space to acquire much weight.

	











	It's delightful to see M3GAN 2.0 sashay back to life and reappear in her customary retro-preppy look, just as it is to watch her bust her signature dance moves at an AI convention, wearing a cyber-babe disguise. But too often, the star attraction takes a back seat to the much less entertaining Amelia, an icy blonde killing machine like so many icy blonde killing machines before her, with none of M3GAN's sardonic wit. I got more laughs out of Gemma's smart-home system outmaneuvering a team of FBI agents.


	Sure, Amelia gets to do some cool stuff like scamper on all fours toward a target, scramble down a wall like a spider, rip the head off one poor unfortunate and neutralize entire tactical units with her dazzling fight skills. But the action mostly feels rote and lacking in suspense. 


	While it's unfair to criticize Johnstone for wanting to change things up, it's disappointing that he's made a Blumhouse–Atomic Monster production that has almost no connection to horror. The creepiness that offset the camp in the first movie is undetectable.


	McGraw and Williams (who's also a producer here) are no less appealing than they were in the original, and Gemma gets to step into the fray with gusto once M3GAN slips inside her head via a neuro-chip. Clement is a droll presence who seems to have wandered in from the set of a James Bond spoof (“Ooh, you're a naughty one,” Alton tells Amelia, his interest further aroused when she wallops him across the face). But he doesn't stick around long enough to help get through the messy patches. And Athani signals Christian's shadiness almost from his first appearance, which removes any surprise from the busy narrative contortions of the protracted climax.

	











	The movie looks polished, thanks to Get Out cinematographer Toby Oliver's sleek widescreen visuals. But it becomes a drag as confusion spirals around who's controlling Amelia and how to stop her. M3GAN herself remains a fabulous creation with a wicked sense of humor (“Hold onto your vaginas,” she warns Gemma and Cole as she takes control of a sportscar), and the character's canny mix of sweetness and menace is by no means tapped out. But if the franchise is to continue, she needs to go back to the lab for reprogramming.

Netflix has revealed the cast and episode release date for Perfect Match Season 3, and it has leveled up the game.

The new season of the dating series will include personalities from the Netflix universe and stars from other reality shows, such as Love Island USA, The Bachelor, Siesta Key, and more.

Nick Lachey hosts the reality dating series in its third season, which brings a group of singles together in a tropical villa, pairing up and competing in challenges. As the couples compete, the most compatible couples play matchmaker and break up other couples, sending them on dates with brand-new singles they bring into the villa. When the daters return to the villa, they re-match, and any contestant left without a match is forced to leave the villa.

Ebon Moss-Bachrach's Ben Grimm absolutely won't say the words “it's clobberin' time” in the final trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps, but there are a lot of other things to get excited about. He's sporting a spiffy new rock beard, for example! We also see a lot more of Julia Garner's Silver Surfer, as she descends to Earth to herald the arrival of Galactus (Ralph Ineson), who seems big and scary despite the fact that we still haven't really gotten a good look at his character.

Galactus' arrival spells uncertain doom for Marvel's first family, who can't promise the people of this retro Earth that they'll be able to keep them safe. But whatever happens, they'll “face it together, as a family,” as Vanessa Kirby's Sue Storm says in the clip.



We also see more of Invisible Woman's powers, a few blink-and-you'll-miss-it arm stretches from Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), and Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn) exercising his greatest power of all: flirting. The Fantastic Four and their beloved planet may be forced to face their greatest foe yet, but throughout it all, one thing remains the same: Ben still won't say “it's clobberin' time.” 

Regardless, it's almost time for fans to experience the highly anticipated new Marvel entry. The Fantastic Four: First Steps flies into theaters July 25.

"It is not how people in this country treat each other when facing hard times," the open letter reads.

	Anna Chan



	Zayn Malik, Sheryl Crow, Scarlett Johansson and many other stars are asking Congress for just “One Thing”: Don't cut funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or Medicaid in the federal budget bill, which the Senate is expected to vote on as soon as this week.


	Celebrities from various fields joined non-profit group Feeding America — which runs a network of food banks to help those in need access healthy food with the goal of ending food insecurity — to sign an open letter published Wednesday (June 25), urging politicians to reject the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid that are currently included in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” According to CBS News, the new work requirements in the House Republicans' bill would mean that an estimated 16 million people may become uninsured by 2034.

	











	The bill had also proposed shifting some costs of food stamps from the federal government to the states, but according to the Associated Press, the Senate parliamentarian said that such a move would violate the chamber's rules; these rulings are not often ignored. NPR reports that the bill would also cut more than $290 million from SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that should the bill pass, the poorest families would see a decrease in resources by about $1,600 a year, while the richest would gain about $12,000.

	“Food is a beautiful way humans show care, compassion and love to those around us. It's a fundamental part of the human experience and a basic right we all deserve,” the open letter from Feeding America and endorsed by celebrities notes, adding that millions of Americans rely on SNAP and Medicaid to help make ends meet. “Congress is now considering a bill that would make some of the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in U.S. history – taking 9.5 billions of meals a year through SNAP off the table and pushing hundreds of thousands of people off Medicaid and into food insecurity.”


	“This is unacceptable and wrong. It is not how people in this country treat each other when facing hard times,” the letter continues. 


	In addition to the former One Direction member, “All I Wanna Do” singer and Oscar-nominated actress, stars of stage, screen and music including Alan Cumming, Matt Damon, Michelle Williams, David Arquette, Chrishell Stause, Paul Scheer and Danai Gurira signed the open letter to Congress. 


	Read the letter in full below:


Dear Members of Congress,


We all have powerful memories of sharing meals with friends, with family and even with strangers in moments of celebration, grief or everything in between. Food is a beautiful way humans show care, compassion and love to those around us. It's a fundamental part of the human experience and a basic right we all deserve.


Ongoing high grocery costs mean food is out of reach for so many families, and many of our neighbors simply do not have enough to eat. They don't know where their next meal is coming from or if that meal will be enough to nourish and sustain them.


Millions of people in this country, including an estimated 15.5 million children and 7.2 million seniors, rely on programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid to make ends meet. These programs make it possible for them to live more healthily and with dignity, in turn helping communities across America to thrive.












Congress is now considering a bill that would make some of the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in U.S. history – taking 9.5 billions of meals a year through SNAP off the table and pushing hundreds of thousands of people off Medicaid and into food insecurity.


This is unacceptable and wrong. It is not how people in this country treat each other when facing hard times.


We call on Congress to reject cuts to these vital programs that help millions put food on their tables and provide access to health care.

You knew it was coming. After the recent new film adaptations for all manner of Jane Austen-penned classics — the 2020 “Emma,” the 2022 “Persuasion,” and a recently announced limited series version of “Pride and Prejudice,” to say nothing of an extremely successful recent re-release of Joe Wright's film version of the iconic novel — it was only a matter of time before Austen's “Sense and Sensibility” was teed up for its own new spin.

And it's arrived! Focus Features and Working Title Films announced Wednesday morning, as first shared on soon-to-be star Daisy Edgar-Jones' Instagram, that “Sense and Sensibility” is getting a brand-new film adaptation. Edgar-Jones will star in the film as Elinor Dashwood, the eldest sister of three (and most iconically portrayed by Emma Thompson in Ang Lee's luminous 1995 film, which Thompson also wrote), with “Blue Jean” filmmaker Georgia Oakley set to direct from a script by bestselling author Diana Reid.

Per today's announcement, “Originally published anonymously with the byline reading ‘By A Lady,' Austen's ‘Sense and Sensibility' established her as a literary force and remains a cornerstone of English literature. The timeless exploration of restraint and passion follows sisters Elinor (Edgar-Jones) and Marianne Dashwood, opposites in their emotional approach, as they navigate love, loss, and financial uncertainty amid the societal expectations of 18th-century England. Celebrated for its wit, deep social insights, and enduring cultural relevance, the novel launched the bright career of one of history's greatest authors.”

 










There is no word yet on other casting picks, but the film will surely provide excellent roles for a variety of stars, including Marianne, and a trio of male suitors the sisters come to know, including Edward Ferrars, Colonel Brandon, and John Willoughby.

Focus and Working Title make a fitting home for the film, as they've previously collaborated on both Wright's 2005 adaptation of “Pride & Prejudice” and Autumn de Wilde's 2020 take on “Emma.”

Oakley is known for both writing and directing her debut feature “Blue Jean,” which earned Oakley a BAFTA Award nomination for Outstanding Debut. Her debut, the bestseller “Love & Virtue,” won several book prizes, including the ABIA Book of the Year Award. Her second novel, “Seeing Other People,” was also a bestseller and was shortlisted for the Indie Award for Best Fiction. Her third book, “Signs of Damage,” was released to critical acclaim in March 2025. 

Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner of Working Title Films will produce alongside India Flint of November Pictures and Jo Wallett. 

There is no word yet on when the film will start production or when it's expected to release, but we will keep our dance cards open for 2026.

The "Manchild" singer also has a new collab beverage to help people cool down.


													By
												

	Stephen Daw


Pride Editor


	After translating the success of her mega-hit “Espresso” into a custom Dunkin' iced coffee last year, Sabrina Carpenter is teaming up with the coffee chain once more to help her fans beat the summer heat. 


	On Wednesday morning (June 25), Dunkin' unveiled its 2025 summer menu, including its latest collaboration with the pop singer. The newest beverage to join the menu — called Sabrina's Strawberry Daydream Refresher — is a sweet strawberry and oat milk drink, topped with “a cloud of velvety cold foam.”

	











	To celebrate the partnership, Carpenter stars in the chain's new ad for the Strawberry Daydream drink. The clip shows the singer answering calls for the “Dunkin' Daydream Hotline,” where she interfaces with a late-night caller looking for something refreshing. “Oh, you're hot … I see. I think I know what you're really craving,” she coos into a microphone, introducing her creamy new beverage. After a beat, though, she scrunches up her face and says, “I'm sorry, did you—” before getting cut off.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Carpenter, in the meantime, is coming off the breakthrough success of her latest single “Manchild,” which became the singer's first-ever No. 1 debut on the Billboard Hot 100 last week. On the latest chart, “Manchild” falls to No. 2, as Alex Warren's “Ordinary” earns its third week at the chart's summit.

Is there such a thing as creating your own paradise? Well, the star-studded cast of Ron Howard's “Eden” are about to find out. Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, Daniel Brühl, and Sydney Sweeney lead the film, which dramatizes the “shocking true story” (per the film's official logline) of a group of disillusioned outsiders who left civilization to start their own society on a remote, uninhabited island.

Of course, the clan later discovered that the “greatest threat isn't the brutal climate or deadly wildlife, but each other,” as the synopsis tells us. “As tensions spiral and desperation takes hold, a twisted power struggle unfolds, leading to betrayal, violence, and the deaths of half the colony.”

Noah Pink wrote the script with Howard directing, as well as producing alongside Brian Grazer, Karen Lunder, Stuart Ford, William M. Connor, and Patrick Newall.

And for those wondering, yes, the “Eden” cast did actually rough it themselves. De Armas previously told Vanity Fair that starring in “Eden” pushed her to get to her “craziest” self onscreen, with the publication also citing that Howard “actually had to push back on both Law and Kirby's commitment to Method, Floreana-style living.”

 










De Armas admitted that she was “a little scared” to take on the role, as the film is “really out there.” She later decided that she “wanted the challenge” of starring in the feature. “Having this crazy threesome relationship, and being a woman of opposites — either she's sweet and tender and fragile and nervous and scared, or she's absolutely crazy and dangerous, it was kind of finding that limit. What was the craziest I could get? How far could I go?,” de Armas said.

The “Ballerina” star later explained why the singing aspect of the film was part of the stress of shooting. “I just couldn't convince [Howard] to let me lip sync so I had to learn the song. It was horrible. I was terrified,” de Armas said. “I would rather do 100 stunts than sing that song. It was terrifying because it's also in front of all the actors. I just felt very exposed and vulnerable and it's not one of my talents for sure.”

However, it all proved to be worth it: The IndieWire review for “Eden” deemed de Armas a “scream in a cast filled with standout performances.”

Vertical will release “Eden” in theaters on Friday, August 22. Check out the teaser below.

Iconic ventriloquist and puppeteer Shari Lewis gets a documentary ode to her trailblazing career as a children's entertainer in “Shari & Lamb Chop.” The new documentary, from “Love, Gilda” director and Emmy-nominated filmmaker Lisa D'Apolito, takes an up-close and personal look at her life and career starting with the CBS television series “Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts” in the early 1950s, through “The Shari Lewis Show” and “The Charlie Horse Music Pizza,” with her second husband Jeremy Tarcher. 

Kino Lorber releases the documentary in theaters on July 18, with digital, educational, and home video releases to follow. Watch the trailer, an IndieWire exclusive, for “Shari & Lamb Chop” below.

Here's the official synopsis: “Before Fred Rogers and Jim Henson, there was Shari Lewis, a children's television pioneer whose whimsical characters and ebullient spirit have guided generations of children as they came of age. Raised in the Bronx by a proud feminist mother and a professor father who moonlighted as Peter Pan the Magic Man, Shari became a multitalented dancer, singer, and magician. But when an injury sidelined her dance aspirations, she channeled her creativity into a passion for ventriloquism, creating the now beloved sock puppet characters Charlie Horse, Hush Puppy and, of course, Lamb Chop.

“From her early years of TV success to the crush of her show's cancellation to her 1990s comeback in her 60s, Lisa D'Apolito's heartfelt doc charts the life, loves, and career hits and misses of the spunky perfectionist whose talent and perseverance stand as a testament to women's power and forever changed the landscape of children's entertainment. Featuring interviews with ventriloquists inspired by Lewis alongside nostalgia-rich clips and home movies, this vibrant portrait brims with the same warmth, wit, and magic that defined her, celebrating the power of imagination and the inner child within.”

Said D'Apolito, “Shari Lewis's life is the ultimate comeback story. Shari mesmerized and empowered generations of children and their family in believing in themselves and having fun doing it. Audiences for the film have been multi-generational and have laughed and cried together and fallen in love with Shari and Lamb Chop. I hope it is a film that you can go with your grandparent, parents and your children and whether you watched Shari on TV or not, it brings the magic of childhood.”

Said Mallory Lewis, Shari's daughter, “I could not be happier that the world is finally going to get to truly know my mother's story and for the first time meet the fascinating and complex woman, the wife, the mother, the producer, that was Shari Lewis! They will not be disappointed.”

 










The film is produced by White Horse Pictures and MoJo Global Arts and presented by Concord Originals and Olive Hill Media in association with The 51 Fund, Carlene Laughlin, and Chicago Media Project. The film first premiered at DOC NYC.

The documentary is produced with the full cooperation of the Shari Lewis estate, through her daughter Mallory, who shares in her mother's legacy performing with Lamb Chop regularly across the U.S.

Dear Batman movie music people: won't you please consider Anamanaguchi? That's the question the band is asking in the very fun video for their new song, “Magnet.” “‘Magnet' is a love song with some extreme feelings–an almost dark romance that feels like it's gliding out of control in a blissful way,” the band said in a statement. “We realized after the fact that this balance is a key part of the formula for Batman music.”

It also makes a pretty good formula for a music video. The band brought on director and cinematographer Jared Raab to put together a clip almost as meta as the name of his recent project, the SXSW-premiering Nirvanna The Band The Show The Movie. In it, the band doesn't even strive to be in a specific Batman movie. (The Batman Part II won't be out for a while anyway.) “We have to strike while the iron is hot, and they're making more Batman movies all the time,” they surmise before the video cuts to a sort of digital application full of clips of the band interspersed with all those past Batmen. This writer isn't a Batman movie music person, but if she was, she would probably be swayed.



“Magnet” will appear on the chiptune band's first-ever lyrically driven rock album, Anyway. They're also working on the soundtrack for the new Scott Pilgrim game, Scott Pilgrim EX, due out in 2026. (It's not a Batman, but it's still pretty good.) The band also recently announced a 32-stop North American tour. You can find dates and ticketing info here. Anyway is out August 8. Maybe it will show up in a Batman soundtrack sooner rather than later.

	Readers of Sunday's New York Times were treated to an unusual full-page ad from a rival newspaper — the venerated satire periodical The Onion. Most of the available space was taken up by a mocking editorial piece with a headline that blared: “Congress, Now More Than Ever, Our Nation Needs Your Cowardice.” In a note at the bottom of the page, the company revealed that print copies of the op-ed were being delivered to the very lawmakers it ripped apart as complacent do-nothings under an increasingly authoritarian Donald Trump. 


	And, just by wild coincidence, the stunt came right as the administration barreled ahead with the bombing of Iran, a destabilizing and politically unpopular action that for many Americans recalled the preludes to other catastrophic wars the U.S. has initiated in the Middle East. Whether Congress can successfully challenge Trump's unilateral show of military force — something it is technically obliged to do under the Constitution — remains to be seen. But the smart money is almost always on The Onion‘s prescient cynicism.

	











	Here, Ben Collins, who has served as CEO of the 37-year-old publication since it changed owners in April 2024, talks about why the staff decided to make a bold statement in the Gray Lady, the success of their relaunched print model, an ongoing legal battle with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and how The Onion‘s writers stay one step ahead of a surreal new normal.

So, this New York Times op-ed. Can you tell me how that came together, and why this was the moment for it?[The writing staff] have been sitting around looking at the failure of the legislative branch, which I thought was a co-equal branch of our government, but I guess it isn't. We're learning a lot of new stuff all the time. And they really wanted to go for it. The only note that I give them is just, if you are ready to go for it, let's go for it as hard as we can. So we reached out to the New York Times for editorial space. We didn't even know what we were going to put in there yet, necessarily, months ago. I just wanted them to have the ability to do something in that space. And they came up with that headline, and they were like, it's time. They also came up with the idea to mail that headline to Congress. I don't know who was in the room, but somebody on editorial staff was like, why don't we just make this all one thing, let's mail it to Congress, publish it as a full page of the New York Times, and make it a big hairy deal. We're hitting the gas pedal here, and think it's working. Hopefully they should be showing up in the mailboxes of every single congressperson.

What kind of a reaction are you expecting?I have no idea! The thing that The Onion does best is it creates, in my opinion, some catharsis. It [allows] people without the full vocabulary for the moment to create a complete sentence for themselves. It allows them to put up a protest sign. We wanted people to understand that they are not alone in feeling particularly helpless in this moment. And we want Congress to understand that maybe they could fucking do something at some point in any capacity about the litany of horrors that we have been subjected to in the last six months.


It's also fun to do it in the in the New York Times, since their editorial section has advocated for some questionable things over the decades.Yeah, I mean, we're right back in 2003. The timing is crazy in terms of the the the Iran bombing — I almost called it Iraq, because the language and the op-eds are the same as when I was growing up. I read a David Shields book called War Is Beautiful, it's a collection of New York Times photos of Iraq and Afghanistan where they made war look like this beautiful Disneyfied fireworks display, and that's not what it is. War is fucking brutal and horrible and evil. And it does feel like we're back in this mode where completely disconnected elites are killing people for sadomasochistic enjoyment. I grew up with this, and so did The Onion. This is where The Onion is at its at its best, when they are fully lined up against what is very clearly “The Man,” and the machine is in full swing, from cable news to the Times op-ed page to the government itself, with every Republican in Congress and some Democrats [embracing] the idea that if we just annihilate some of these people, there will be no consequences. We've been through this before. During the Iraq War, The Onion was one of the only places to stand up against it. It was just, like, The Onion and the fucking Dixie Chicks, and now we're right back in that moment. Thankfully, I think more people can smell that this reeks and are not buying the party line of lobbyists that appear in the mainstream news saying that this will end all of our problems in the Middle East. We're just doing what we did 20 years ago.


It's been a little over a year since the leadership shakeup at The Onion. What have you learned in that time, and are you feeling a sense of accomplishment a year later?Things have dramatically changed in the media landscape, and the fact that we're important and viewed as truth-tellers is an incredible indictment of the rest of the press. It's insane. I will say I am so deeply proud of the independent journalists out there that have stepped up and have a lot to lose in the face of harassment campaigns and lawfare and the immense power against them — they've done some of the best work ever. That's why we gave the scoop to Marisa Kabas at The Handbasket, she is just one of many people in independent media right now who are doing some of the best and most unafraid journalism I've seen in my lifetime. What we've seen is people who have told the truth and not kowtowed and not just bent over for this administration, or tried to meet halfway on fascism. Those are the places that have done really well. We've gone all in on speaking the truth, despite how dangerous it is now — the truth is incredibly absurd, so it just happens to line up very nicely with our business model. But yeah, it's been both horrible and horrific and and heartening to see that our work is more important than ever. And, you know, I would guess that by the end of the year, we're going to be one of the biggest newspapers in the country by distribution. We ship this paper to all 50 states and over 50 countries. I'm proud of the people who work here because they stood up a newspaper in a three months and have only made it bigger and better and sharper and more incisive.

	











A lot of people would look around at the state of the world and say it's beyond parody or satire. How do your writers think about that and face that challenge?That's a question that we get a lot, and I think that it just shows how hard this is and that you need professionals. What we do is incredibly inefficient, and it's art, and it's hard, and that's what makes us great. We throw away like 150 headlines a day. That's not an exaggeration. Every day, they go in there, they write usually over 150 headlines, and they whittle them down to two or three. Sometimes it's zero. Sometimes nothing comes out of that. And then they they decide, like, is this a video? Is something we grab as a NIB, which stands for “news in brief.” Where does this live in the Onion universe, basically. And then from there, they build out the joke. It's surgery every single time on each verb and and article and everything. It's just a tremendous amount of work. If Sam Altman or whoever came in here and took over this company, it would be fucking obliterated instantly. Because it's an old-fashioned machine that we have that works really well. We have 40 years of institutional knowledge here. The thing that I've come to realize is there's a math and a science and art to this. I think most people feel that satire is like, turn everything up to 2x speed or just do the inverse or something. I think what The Onion does is like 1.25x speed. It allows you to see into some funhouse future. And it just allows [the writers] to cook a lot easier. They don't overdo it. And by doing that, it kind of like keeps it within the bounds of reality, but in a way that is both funny and biting.


There's a strong tradition there, but in this last year, we've seen some big swings that we wouldn't have seen from the old Onion. I realize it didn't quite work, but are we going to see more stuff like the attempted acquisition of Infowars out of bankruptcy?We're still working on that, brother. As I've said, Alex Jones is the Michael Jordan of evading justice. He's gummed up the work so substantially in every way, and scared every judge and every person that he can intimidate. So we're still trying to get through it, and we are confident we'll end up with it by the end of the day, but I don't know when the end of that day is, so we're still fighting. But yes, expect us in weird places. We constantly want to show up, saying the sentence that everybody's thinking but can't say in public right now. We have this incredible market advantage of not being beholden to anybody right now. And it's great for our bottom line. What I'm trying to say is, we're going to be rich. It's a gold mine for us, baby! Expect us to do both the right and the funny thing in incredibly surprising and weird ways in the next few months and hopefully years. We have a bunch of stuff lined up that will hopefully get people off their couch a little bit. We want to be able to say stuff that other people, for institutional reasons, can't say, or they're too afraid to say.

	











You may be the only CEO in America making that promise.We're in a unique position, certainly. And other places have to learn from this — being afraid all the time and just constantly making transactional moves. How long can you survive like this? What is even the point of being alive if you're just gonna continue managing rot? And it seems like that's what 98 percent of people are doing in these media companies right now. I don't know, take a chance. Nobody likes what's happening. Especially if you're a journalism company or a media company, you're [meant to be] actually reflecting what people want or what people believe. So get some guts and do something interesting. It's not that hard.


So that's your advice to Jeff Bezos?Him, no, he shouldn't. He should not do anything ever again. He should just stop whatever he's doing. [Those] people who have gotten us to a very bad spot should go take their boats into the ocean and do sea-steading or whatever they keep saying they're going to do. Go light fireworks in the ocean and look at them for the rest of your lives, just be happy. Go away from us, please.


I have an ethics question. Your partner, Kat Abughazaleh, is running for Congress in Illinois. I was just wondering if you'll abuse your power to endorse her through the through the paper of record.I've been threatening all of everyone in Illinois with personal punishment if they don't say that she's the coolest person who's ever lived. I'm extremely rich. What I do is I drive my Lamborghini to everyone's house and I just berate them at their doorstep. So that's my plan. If you haven't been berated yet by me at your doorstep, or had me shouting at you from the Lamborghini, then, frankly, I haven't done my job. She's fucking great. I'm proud of her. She's doing so good. And yeah, the second that we get into internecine local politics at The Onion is the second that we've lost the plot.


Though it is a Chicago paper, after all.It is a Chicago paper. That's correct. I'm assuming we've done some Chicago stuff, right? I'm actually gonna look it up. I don't really know, but let me see if we did, like, a Rod Blagojevich story. Oh, these are fucking ancient. Let's see. “Rod Blagojevich Trying To Sell Presidential Commutation to Cellmate For $2.8 Million.” Pretty good. So, yeah, there is Illinois politics in general. But no, that whole thing is very strange, because I've never been around actual politics, so to hear it in the other room when I wake up every day — she spends every day just like, pounding on doors and shaking hands. And it's very different lifestyle, certainly.

It seems in the nature of The Onion that it's going to take rotten people down a notch rather than elevate good politics. But then you had this idea to put up information about gun violence on the Infowars site. Is there room for earnestness at The Onion, where it's not just sarcasm? I don't actually think so. I think there are words and there are actions. You can do good deeds with your actions, but in terms of the words that we put out on a day-to-day basis, we are going to remain stupid as fuck and silly, and we're going to try as hard as we can to get to the to the meat of stuff by not telling the truth. That is what The Onion is, writ large. We will obviously do stuff too, we will do whatever we can to make the world better. Hopefully, you'll see that in the next few months, as we kind of grow and build on top of this weird little newspaper empire established in a year. But we don't let anybody get in the way of the actual writing or the editorial or the videos they make, or anything like that. That stuff is sacrosanct, and if we can do some good on the side as a means of getting that writing in front of more people, even better. Good stories are kind of against the law right now. We want to show up in places and make people believe that good things are possible and that you're not going nuts, that things are actually quite exactly as bad as you think they are. And here's, like, a very short sentence that will allow you to think about the world through that construct. That's the whole goal here, man.

Now here's a flex: just how much money Arnold Schwarzenegger made on 1988 comedy “Twins.” The film, which co-starred Danny DeVito as Schwarzenegger's fraternal twin brother, turned out to be the actor's biggest payday of his career.

Schwarzenegger said during a recent appearance on “Watch What Happens Live” (in the below video) that, instead of not taking much of a salary for his work on the film, he opted for a deal for a percentage of its box office gross. The feature ended up making $216 million worldwide in theaters, and continued to profit with a home video release.

 










“Well, number one was ‘Twins,' because we got no money for the salary but ownership with a piece of the backend,” Schwarzenegger said of his biggest paycheck ever. “It was fantastic. We went all the way to the bank with that.”

It turns out, Schwarzenegger made more than $40 million on the film. “It was more than that. It was more than any movie I ever made,” he said.

The backend deal came to be after the studio had doubts about action star Schwarzenegger leading a comedy. “If we don't take any salaries, we can shoot the movie for $16.5 million. We worked out a deal where we got 40 percent of the backend of the movie,” he said. “It happened to be the best deal we've ever made.”

 










And “Twins” almost spurred a franchise due to its massive success: Schwarzenegger said that sequel “Triplets” almost added Eddie Murphy to the cast. However, original director Ivan Reitman “passed away before we wanted to start shooting.” Schwarzenegger had said in 2017 that the script for “Triplets” was “almost written” at the time.

Schwarzenegger can now be seen in the second season of “FUBAR” alongside Oscar nominee Monica Barbaro, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Fortune Feimster. Schwarzenegger also might collaborate with his real-life son Patrick Schwarzenegger for an action film.

Patrick told The Hollywood Reporter that he can't wait to work with his father on-screen. “I mean, that's the goal down the road is to do those types of things. I'd love to do that, if it was the right thing,” he said. “I've talked to my dad about it, and I've told him I'd love to do that if it was the right thing. I've never wanted to, but now I feel like I have some credits under my belt, and that I've had some work, and I feel like I've gotten to the point where I would feel comfortable working with him.”

A new compilation of Joni Mitchell's jazz music has been announced. Spanning her 1968 debut, Song to a Seagull, through her performance at the 2022 Newport Folk Festival, Joni's Jazz traces Mitchell's longstanding love affair with the titular genre. The 61-track release features rare and unreleased live recordings, demos, and alternate takes. Check out the full tracklist and listen to a demo of “Be Cool,” from 1982's Wild Things Run Fast, below.

Mitchell is dedicating Joni's Jazz to Wayne Shorter. “It was a joy to play with him,” she said of the late jazz great. “He will be missed, but he will remain alive for me in this music.” The project features Mitchell's collaborations with Shorter, as well as those with jazz legends Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and Charles Mingus.

Joni's Jazz will be out September 5, via Rhino, in 8xLP and 4xCD box set formats. The physical editions are accompanied by liner notes, photographs, and some of Mitchell's original artwork. It's also being released digitally.

Back in January, we were treated to two TV shows that didn't share a whole lot in common on paper: One was an unnerving, brainy suspense series set within the clinical walls of an office building, the other a dystopian political tale taking place in a bunker that's run by a billionaire. But while quite dissimilar in tone and execution, Severance season two and Paradise both took aim and a similar target: greedy entities manipulating citizens for personal benefit. What's more, the characters in each thriller questioned authority figures in the face of persistent disillusionment and outrage—and eventually defied those powerful few for deceiving, controlling, and exploiting them. And as it turned out, these early 2025 shows were early signifiers of the wave of resistance-related storylines on TV to come.  

Over the past six months, several series have captured, in ways big and small, audience's gnawing sense of malaise about a whole host of issues: oppressive governments, labor woes, a scammy healthcare industry, an ever-expanding wealth gap, the commercialization of art, and corporate greed, to name a few. And they're entertaining while being rooted in a rage-against-the-machine attitude in a time that calls for it. Despite their disparate genres, shows like Common Side Effects (a surreal animated production critiquing Big Pharma), Hacks (a Hollywood-set comedy that had an art-vs.-commerce through-line this year, much like Mythic Quest and The Studio), and South Korean phenom Squid Game (the upcoming third and final season of which relentlessly drills down on economic inequality) hit hard by weaving modern frustrations into its plots. They depict the paranoia and desperation that comes with political and commercial instability—and satisfyingly imagine what it might be like to fight back. 

No drama achieves this more achingly than Tony Gilroy's Andor, which dissects the surveillance state and fascism through rebellion in its tense final round. Just look at episode eight, when the ruthless Empire slaughters peaceful protestors, with the Ghormans' pleas echoing real-life atrocities almost in real time. As The A.V. Club‘s recap of the hour puts it, “The parallels aren't subtle, because they aren't meant to be. They're bloody and brutal and naked and ugly and exhausting and heartbreaking. But subtle? What would be the point? We're long past that.” 

Paradise is a comparatively cornier espionage thriller with a climate crisis twist. But the Dan Fogelman series, like Andor, also isn't subtle about its ideology. The show revolves around a secret-service agent's efforts to expose a billionaire for her unchecked abuse of power and hoarding of resources instead of rescuing those stranded on a destroyed planet. Essentially, Xavier's (Sterling K. Brown) goal is to bring down a filthy rich, Elon Musk-esque founder who has wormed her way into government and the inner circle of a former POTUS. (Yes, this feels lifted directly from real events.) Unlike a few tiresome recent dramas about the wealthy getting away with their crimes, Paradise wants to hold them accountable. A similar galvanizing sentiment fuels The Handmaid's Tale‘s final season, which sees June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss) and her allies finally start to destroy Gilead.  

As the real world spirals into fascism, at least there's some victory to be found on the screen. But analyzing thorny modern issues through fictional characters is admittedly nothing new. Just think of  M*A*S*H‘s anti-war narratives and The Wire‘s breakdowns of institutional corruption—or how Mr. Robot, The Boys, and Industry address the impact of privatization, not to mention the onslaught of “eat the rich” films and shows from a few years back. 

And then there's Black Mirror. This year's seventh season boasts the harrowing “Common People,” which follows a schoolteacher with a brain tumor who signs up with a cutting-edge startup so that their synthetic tissue servers can keep her alive. But at what cost? Unable to afford the pricey subscription services, her husband secretly performs degrading tasks online. When they still can't pay, the company doesn't empathize with or care to alleviate their pain. An argument can be made that Amanda (Rashida Jones) and Mike Waters (Chris O'Dowd) could've chosen not to seek the help from Rivermind Technologies. Then again, the couple was presented with a solution and a long-term future, only for it to be slowly chipped away. 

Adult Swim's trippy Common Side Effects sets its sights on a similar dilemma. “The whole system is sick,” Marshall Cuso (Dave King) says. His discovery of a cure-all mushroom puts him in the crosshairs of a pharma giant, top officials, and the FBI, with the show skewering the healthcare and insurance industries that prey on a vulnerable public. Compounding this, Rheutical Pharma employee and Marshall's high-school lab partner Frances Applewhite (Emily Pendergast) struggles with doing the right thing or selling out for a promotion and raise. Frances is quick to justify her betrayal of Marshall, only to discover that she's trapped in a nightmare that she can't change from within. 

Another show that details the woes of modern medicine is The Pitt, which unpacks a high-stakes 15-hour ER shift for doctors and nurses and underlines the strife between hospital staff and the board. “Why don't you go back to your micro-managerial ivory tower and let us get the fuck back to work?” Dr. Robby (Noah Wyle) yells at a medical officer worried about optics after a tragedy in a fit of screw-the-system rage. 

Of course, ironically, these aforementioned shows live on streaming platforms that are part of huge conglomerates themselves. Charlie Brooker's Netflix series even contains an episode about the rising prices of subscription services. Meanwhile, Severance (not unlike Prime Video's The Boys) is a bleak satire about corporate culture produced by a tech titan, with season two ending on the promising note of an uprising as Lumon workers band together to fight for their rights. It seems that no matter the style or setting they're packaged in, anti-establishment ideas are easy to find—and connect with—on our screens right now. And witnessing these characters speak truth to power is pretty damn cathartic.

For The Wizard of Oz at Sphere, the Vegas venue navigated challenges and opportunities to deliver a new audio experience that's both strikingly familiar — and boldly different.


													By
												

	Eric Renner Brown



One day several months ago in Culver City, California, orchestral musicians filed into the Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage at Sony Pictures Studios unsure of what awaited them on their music stands.


	“They come in, and they see the Wizard of Oz sheet music,” recalls Grammy Award-winning music supervisor Julianne Jordan. “They were all freaking out. They all came up to me and were like, ‘We never thought we'd ever be playing this — let alone playing this here.'”


	The Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage is hallowed ground in the world of film scoring. Countless soundtracks have been recorded there — beginning with The Wizard Of Oz, in 1939. Now, nearly a century later, another orchestra was re-recording the score, for a film experience that aims to be as groundbreaking as the original movie once was.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Jordan supervised music for The Wizard of Oz at Sphere, the Las Vegas venue's ambitious first foray into licensing — and modernizing — an existing film property for Sphere's towering screen and cutting-edge audio system. Along with a team comprised of some of contemporary Hollywood's best musical minds — including Oscar-nominated composer David Newman and Oscar-winning engineer Shawn Murphy — Jordan was instrumental in figuring out how, exactly, to bring Oz‘s score to life in a venue that its original creators could've never dreamed of.


	For the same reason an old cassette tape might sound bad on high-end home audio equipment, Sphere, with its advanced technology, couldn't simply press play on the original version of Oz. That meant augmenting the original visual component (including with the use of AI), but also reconstructing the film's audio for Sphere Immersive Sound, in some cases from the ground up.


	“It would be a huge miss to do this film as a 1939 optical audio track,” says Paul Freeman, who as vp and principal audio artist at Sphere Studios, the division overseeing the Oz project, touches “everything that makes noise in the venue.”


	When it came to the score, the solution — re-record it — was deceptively complex. About a year and a half ago, when the project began gathering steam, Sphere's team brought orchestras of different sizes to the venue, arranging them in various physical formats simply to see how orchestras sounded within its dimensions. Then, as recording commenced, the team divided the ensemble into component sections — “not unheard-of” in today's filmmaking, Jordan says, but not common either — to record them separately, which would make the audio easier to manipulate in Sphere later. “When everybody's in the room playing together, there's a fluidity that you don't get when you're just playing in sections,” Freeman says, though Jordan notes that because Murphy “has done it before, he knew how to put it all together.”


	This separation didn't only allow the Sphere team to render the score in unprecedented clarity — it also provided narrative benefits. “An example is when the Tin Man sways back and forth,” says Freeman. “We're taking the strings that are orchestrationally augmenting that, and we're positionally augmenting that with him. The strings are playing, mimicking his movement [musically], but now we're physically moving it in space [throughout the venue] at the same time. We do that several times in the film.”


	When re-recording the score — originally captured in mono — musicians played in the era's style of film music, using then-common techniques such as pizzicato and vibrato; the ocarina used for the original “If I Only Had a Brain” recording was used again this time around.


	Sphere licensed the orchestral compositions from Sony Music Publishing, as opposed to the original vocal parts, for which it licensed the original masters from Warner Bros. Those vocals — not to mention all the other sounds heard in the film — presented both challenges and opportunities for Sphere's team.


	When remastering classic albums, audio professionals often face a dilemma: modernizing a recording too thoroughly can make it sound conspicuously, even distractingly, different from the original. This held true for Oz, which is at times defined by the era's audio primitiveness. “You're used to hearing the [Wicked] Witch sound bad,” Freeman says. “If you try and fix that too much, it doesn't sound like the film anymore. It sounds correct sonically, but it doesn't sound like The Wizard of Oz. We've all heard this film so often that you have to be true to that.”


	The answer, he explains, was “just a bunch of smart guys with really good ears trying to get this stuff in the venue to sound correct.”


	But fidelity concerns aside, Sphere's team had the freedom to conceptualize what Oz‘s original creators might have done with the audio if they'd had access to Sphere. It's not just the orchestra following the Tin Man across the venue as he sways back and forth — it's the way dialogue follows characters as they move across the screen, or how amidst the tornado's swirl, the main orchestra remains centered while audio motifs move in tandem with the objects and people in the gale-force wind. “Point blank, when you walk into this venue and minutes into the film the tornado happens, hold on to your wig, because you're in it,” Freeman says.


	Sphere's capacity for immersive, 4D experiences have been a selling point — the venue hasn't elaborated further, but promises “environmental effects and custom scents” during the Oz show — and that extends to the infrasound system running through the venue's seats, which Freeman points out are actually speakers that activate when the seats are down. 


	“One of the things that our chairman [James Dolan] has wanted to do with our infrasound system since the beginning was make it emotional,” he says. “So, there are certain identifiable things that we're doing, not necessarily to grab your attention to it, but to make certain components more special.” For instance, the Sphere team applied backward reverb to the Wicked Witch's dialogue to create an almost imperceptible but unsettling feeling; it's just one of the subtle ways they're manipulating dialogue to elicit emotional responses from fans, and the first time Sphere has used its seats not only to vibrate, but to emit tones.


	On paper, all this change might make an Oz superfan a little trepidatious — something the Sphere team and its colleagues at Warner Bros. Post Production Creative Services considered at every turn. For both the audio and visual aspects of the film, they combed through footage and archival materials and notes to understand where the original filmmakers were coming from.


	“We all approached it with a lot of reverence,” says Sphere Studios head Carolyn Blackwood, who joined the company about a year ago, after nearly 25 years as an executive at Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema. “The choices we made were done with the idea of the purity of the original film — always with the intention to get to the clarity and the original intent of what existed there, but couldn't have been done back then, because the technology didn't exist.”


	In fact, modern audio advancements — from the techniques employed to Sphere's audio system — have also helped to clarify certain aspects of the original film. “Most people are used to hearing this on their TV,” says Jordan, who recounts sitting in recording sessions and hearing cues she never knew existed in the score, including a snippet of Mussorgsky's Night On Bald Mountain that's woven into scenes at the Wicked Witch's castle.


	As for Oz‘s most well-known musical moment, Judy Garland‘s performance of “Over The Rainbow,” Freeman says, “This is the definitive, all-time, greatest version that you will ever, ever hear. The track is all around you. It's a perfect piece of audio.”


	To Blackwood, the project is in keeping with Oz‘s broader cultural legacy. When she arrived at Sphere, the project was already in development, and naturally she asked why the team had settled on Oz, rather than another classic film. The answer she received was twofold: The cultural ubiquity was a factor, sure, but so was Oz's spot in the evolution of cinema. “When Wizard of Oz was done in 1939, it was a technological marvel,” she says. “It made sense that, once again, this 1939 movie would break new ground.”

	A land grab in President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” — which would put 250 million acres of public lands at risk of being auctioned to the highest bidder — has been judged out of bounds by the Senate's in-house rulekeeper.Trump's lard-the-rich legislation is being pushed through Congress as a “reconciliation” bill, which means it is not subject to the Senate filibuster and only needs a simple majority to pass. But such budget legislation must adhere to the “Byrd rule,” which bars extraneous provisions from being tacked on. On Monday evening, the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the privatization of nearly 3 million acres of treasured, wild spaces did not clear that bar.Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee is the chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and the architect of the provision requiring “mandatory disposal” of the public's property. Lee is an ideological foe of public lands. He proclaimed in a February post on X that “the U.S. government should never be the largest landowner in America.” He argued the feds should only “keep the national parks,” its “military bases,” and “maybe some of the most historically and environmentally sensitive properties.” It should then, Lee insisted, “sell the rest — not all at once, but steadily.”


	Lee is an extremist even in his own party. And his provision faced fierce opposition from environmental groups, top Democrats, a former Trump Interior Secretary, and even the Republican senators from Idaho, where more than 20 million acres were at risk. (Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch put out nearly identical statements over the weekend saying they “do not support” the provision to “sell public lands.”)Despite the political and parliamentary blowback, Lee is not giving up. In a post on X Tuesday, he wrote that he is “doing everything I can to support President Trump and move this forward.” He wrote that his next version of the bill will take steps to protect “farmers, ranchers, and recreational users.” Lee would take all Forest Service land out of the mix, limiting the selloff to Bureau of Land Management lands, and only those properties within 5 miles of “population centers.” Doing a second-rate Trump impression with all-caps, Lee vowed to establish “FREEDOM ZONES” to “ensure that these lands benefit AMERICAN FAMILIES,” asserting that the move would address “crushing” housing prices. “Stay tuned,” he wrote. “We're just getting started.”


	To better understand the state of play regarding Lee's contentious proposal, Rolling Stone reached out to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who used to chair Lee's committee. Nearly half of the land in Wyden's home state of Oregon is owned by the federal government, with the BLM managing nearly all of the southeast quadrant of the state, bordered by Nevada and Idaho.In addition to being a longtime champion of public lands, Wyden is currently the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee where he is seeking to blunt the Big Beautiful Bill's giveaways to the “gazillionaires.”

What are you hearing from your constituents about the public lands selloff?

	Just last weekend I had four town hall meetings in the state, open to everybody. Three were in places where Donald Trump got 70 percent or more — Ontario, La Grande, and Baker City. In these bright-red communities, there was very substantial opposition to the question of selling off public lands. 


	They're alarmed about what privatizing lands means for drinking water and the air. They're worried about big developers coming in and destroying the lands that they enjoy — for hunting, fishing, camping and more. And they're worried about what it means for rural jobs that are supported by public lands. 


	This is in our DNA. The reality is, when the federal government owns much of your state, you feel strongly about treasures that are emblematic of what's important to you. Protecting public lands is in Oregon's DNA.

What does Monday night's procedural ruling mean?


	What the parliamentarian did was to strike Lee's proposal. So, boom, struck. But Lee has come back already with something that basically keeps the BLM aspects of this, because he thinks that'll be easier than the [selloff of land managed by the] Forest Service. 


	He wants to make it near the population areas. But that makes the people in populated areas close to recreation particularly vulnerable. As far as I'm concerned, this is at least as bad as the earlier version, and potentially worse, because it'll affect bigger groups. More people, close to population centers. Prescription for trouble.By the way, this is also an invitation to extremists to set up camp in rural areas. 


How so? Connect the dots for me. 


	Because there are no ground rules. If you're one of these extremist outfits and you want to get outside any kind of government accountability and scrutiny and oversight, this is your opportunity.


So the danger is that it's not just the BlackRocks, the private equity funds, or the golf resort developers that might get in on the land grab, but you could have extremists looking to set up an encampment?












	That's what I asked about this weekend. I mentioned big economic interests and hedge funds and all that. But I said, “How many of you remember the Rajneeshees?”


You're referring to the dangerous cult that infamously made a compound in rural Oregon in the 1980s.


	There's no limits on those kind of people.To your broader point, there doesn't seem to be any process spelled out by Lee. A lot seems to depend on how connected you are to the Interior Secretary or Trump's Cabinet.


	It's made for interest groups who want to hot-wire the process. None of this is backed up by accountability. What really makes this a political farce is that Montana is excepted. How'd they get a free ride? They went to Trump early on. There's been connections with a lot of those [Montana] folks and the Trumps. And they got it, right?


Do you see Lee as committed to this privatization effort?This didn't come to him in the last couple of months. I was chairman of the committee, so I know the members. This has been his position for years. What's different here is that he thinks he's got an executive branch that'll help him.


Lee is talking about “FREEDOM ZONES” to benefit “AMERICAN FAMILIES.” Is it your sense that that means the freedom for rich folks to buy lakeside chalets?


	There's been repeated claims that selling off public lands will address America's housing affordability crisis. We need more affordable housing. But you aren't going to get that by helping the people at the very top get even wealthier, while the poor get poorer. 


	Nothing in this bill does anything to ensure that there's going to be affordable housing for people of more-modest means. But you can be sure that the people who are going to benefit are the wealthiest Americans who can find a new luxury vacation home. 


Norms are flying out the window. Do you expect that the Republicans are going to honor the parliamentarian's rulings on this? 


	I hope so. We'll have to see. The Republican Senate proposals are consistently about giving people at the top more benefits. What I want as the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee is to give everybody in America the chance to get ahead. 


	We have two tax codes in America. The firefighter pays taxes with every paycheck. If you're a gazillionaire you can pay what you want, when you want to. The [Trump] bill starts with the fact that the rate [cuts] are for the multi-millionaires and the billionaires. That's paid for by cutting [services for] people in modest means.

Final thoughts about the land grab?


	This is particularly important to Westerners. I want to protect our treasures. I want people to be able to make a living. I was chairman of the committee. I know from 1,100 open-to-all town hall meetings [that I've done in the state], this is personal. This is deeply felt. This is what Oregon and Western-land states are all about. What are we gonna say, when people bring up these policies? “No way.” Not complicated. “No. Way.”

Mariska Hargitay has been attending red carpet events for her documentary, “My Mom Jayne” (which has offered a glimpse into her childhood and the secrets that were kept from her, including the revelation that her biological father is not Mickey Hargitay, People reports). However, the film's promotion has also provided a unique opportunity for fans to see more of the actress and her family.

Hargitay is married to Peter Hermann, and the couple has been married since 2004, after meeting on the set of “Law & Order SVU.” The pair is also proud parents to three children, August, Andrew, and Amaya.

Hargitay does not often post photos of her family on Instagram, and they are rarely photographed all together (although they have attended events and walked red carpets together before). However, when they recently attended the 2025 Tribeca Festival at Carnegie Hall on June 13, 2025, they posed on the red carpet for an absolutely gorgeous family photo.

Ten days later, June 23, 2025, the family stepped out again to attend an event at the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Hargitay and Hermann posed for photos with their two eldest children, August and Amaya. 

They look so grown up!

Hargitay and Hermann became parents for the first time in 2006, when their son August Miklos Friedrich Hermann was born. The actress was 42. They later adopted Amaya Josephine Hermann in April 2011, and six months later, in October 2011, they adopted their third child, Andrew Nicolas Hermann.

Hargitay has opened up about having children later in life. “I'm so grateful that I'm an older mom. Grateful that I became successful older. I don't know if I could have handled it when I was younger,” she told People in January 2024. “When I was younger I wasn't as present but as I've gotten older I've started to accept and appreciate.”

She continued, “And now I'm going to savor this moment. I want to share my lessons and where there is pain that I can fix that really inspires me to lighten the load.”

Hargitay has also shared a lesson that she learned from motherhood. “The thing that's made me a better parent is my kids,” she told People in 2018. “Because they taught me to really listen. My husband is my North Star, and my kids are my teachers.” What a gorgeous family!

Kim Kardashian is once again making headlines with a striking transformation.

In a fresh campaign for SKIMS' collaboration with Roberto Cavalli, the 44-year-old entrepreneur and reality star stunned fans by swapping her iconic long brunette locks for a voluminous curly blonde bob. The unexpected hairstyle, accessorized with a wide red headband, gave Kardashian an entirely new look, prompting many to do a double-take.

The campaign features Kardashian modeling a tiger-print scoop-neck swimsuit, part of the limited-edition line between her shapewear brand and the luxury Italian fashion house. While the swimwear caught attention, it was the head-turning hairstyle that had fans talking.

Though the blonde curls are likely the result of a wig, Kardashian has never been shy about switching up her style. In fact, her latest transformation arrives just months after a dramatic cut from celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton.

“Love this new chop on kim, we got 7 inches off her hair!” Appleton captioned a Feb. 2 Instagram post, adding, “(No it's not a wig before u start lol).”

A post shared by SKIMS (@skims)

This isn't the only recent hair makeover in the Kardashian household. Earlier in June, Kardashian's daughter North West, 11, debuted bright blue hair, trading in her natural dark locks for a bold pop of color.

Hair has always been an extension of identity for Kardashian, who shares four children—North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm—with ex-husband Kanye West. She's spoken candidly about the link between hair and mood, telling Allure in 2022, “I'm sassier. I'm more confident as a blonde. As soon as I go back to brunette, I'm a boss.”

Her commitment to hair maintenance is well-documented. In a 2018 episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” Kardashian revealed to her mother Kris Jenner, “I put it in my will that I have to always have my hair done.”

The SKIMS x Cavalli moment is just the latest in a long line of beauty evolutions for Kardashian. From fiery red to platinum blonde, and now this bouncy blonde bob, her hair choices continue to be a canvas for self-expression—and a spark for conversation across social media.

“The creative director for the wigs deserves a raise,” one fan commented. “I can't breathe !! This is soo breathtaking, Kim !!” wrote another. 

As fashion and beauty fans eagerly follow the rollout of the SKIMS collaboration, it's clear that Kardashian's transformations remain as headline-worthy as ever.

“Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won,” Cuomo told supporters on Tuesday.


							By 

	The Associated Press



Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday night after Andrew Cuomo conceded the race in a stunning upset, as the young, progressive upstart who was virtually unknown when the contest began built a substantial lead over the more experienced but scandal-scarred former governor.


	Though the race's ultimate outcome will still be decided by a ranked choice count, Mamdani took a commanding position just hours after the polls closed.




	With victory all but assured, Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist who ran an energetic campaign centered on the cost of living, told supporters, “I will be your Democratic nominee for the mayor of New York City.”

	“I will be the mayor for every New Yorker, whether you voted for me, for Governor Cuomo, or felt too disillusioned by a long-broken political system to vote at all,” he said. “I will work to be a mayor you will be proud to call your own.”

	Cuomo, who had been the front-runner throughout a race that was his comeback bid from a sexual harassment scandal, conceded the election, telling a crowd that he had called Mamdani to congratulate him.


	“Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won,” Cuomo told supporters.


	Cuomo trailed Mamdani by a significant margin in the first choice ballots and faced an exceedingly difficult pathway to catching up when ballots are redistributed in New York City's ranked choice voting process.

	











	Mamdani, a member of the state Assembly since 2021, would be the city's first Muslim and Indian American mayor if elected. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams skipped the primary. He's running as an independent in the general election. Cuomo also has the option of running in the general election.


	“We are going to take a look and make some decisions,” Cuomo said.


	Cuomo and Mamdani were a study in political contrasts and could have played stand-ins for the larger Democratic Party's ideological divide, with one candidate a fresh-faced progressive and the other an older moderate.


	Cuomo characterized the city as a threatening, out-of-control place desperate for an experienced leader who could restore order. He brought the power of a political dynasty to the race, securing an impressive array of endorsements from important local leaders and labor groups, all while political action committees created to support his campaign pulled in staggering sums of cash.


	Mamdani, meanwhile, offered an optimistic message that life in the city could improve under his agenda, which was laser-focused on the idea that a mayor has the power to do things that lower the cost of living. The party's progressive wing coalesced behind him and he secured endorsements from two of the country's foremost progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.


	Unofficial results from the New York City's Board of Elections showed that Mamdani was ranked on more ballots than Cuomo. Mamdani was listed as the second choice by tens of thousands of more voters than Cuomo. And the number of votes that will factor into ranked choice voting is sure to shrink. More than 200,000 voters only listed a first choice, the Board of Elections results show, meaning that Mamdani's performance in the first round may ultimately be enough to clear the 50% threshold.

	











	The race's ultimate outcome could say something about what kind of leader Democrats are looking for during President Donald Trump's second term.


	The primary winner will go on to face incumbent Adams, a Democrat who decided to run as an independent amid a public uproar over his indictment on corruption charges and the subsequent abandonment of the case by Trump's Justice Department. Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, will be on the ballot in the fall's general election.


	The rest of the pack has struggled to gain recognition in a race where nearly every candidate has cast themselves as the person best positioned to challenge Trump's agenda.


	Comptroller Brad Lander, a liberal city government stalwart, made a splash last week when he was arrested after linking arms with a man federal agents were trying to detain at an immigration court in Manhattan. In the final weeks of the race, Lander and Mamdani cross endorsed one another in an attempt to boost their collective support and damage Cuomo's bid under the ranked choice voting system.


	Among the other candidates are City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer.


	Mamdani's grassroots run has been hard not to notice.


	His army of young canvassers relentlessly knocked on doors throughout the city seeking support. Posters of his grinning mug were up on shop windows. You couldn't get on social media without seeing one of his well-produced videos pitching his vision — free buses, free child care, new apartments, a higher minimum wage and more, paid for by new taxes on rich people.

	











	That youthful energy was apparent Tuesday evening, as both cautiously optimistic canvassers and ecstatic supporters lined the streets of Central Brooklyn on a sizzling hot summer day, creating a party-like atmosphere that spread from poll sites into the surrounding neighborhoods.


	Outside his family's Caribbean apothecary, Amani Kojo, a 23-year-old first-time voter, passed out iced tea to Mamdani canvassers, encouraging them to stay hydrated.


	“It's 100 degrees outside and it's a vibe. New York City feels alive again,” Kojo said, raising a pile of Mamdani pamphlets. “It feels very electric seeing all the people around, the flyers, all the posts on my Instagram all day.”


	Cuomo and some other Democrats have cast Mamdani as unqualified. They say he doesn't have the management chops to wrangle the city's sprawling bureaucracy or handle crises. Critics have also taken aim at Mamdani's support for Palestinian human rights.


	In response, Mamdani has slammed Cuomo over his sexual harassment scandal and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.


	Cuomo resigned in 2021 after a report commissioned by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women. He has always maintained that he didn't intentionally harass the women, saying he had simply fallen behind what was considered appropriate workplace conduct.

After a three-year absence from HGTV, longtime “Rehab Addict” star Nicole Curtis is back with a new four-episode season premiering on June 24, 2025. She'll take on properties in Detroit and in Wyoming — a purchase she made on a whim as she flew back from a restorative trip to Paris in 2022. 

The show feels like a whole new ballgame for Curtis, who says she took time to heal from past traumas and build her own production company. The four-episode season features lots of familiar faces from the home restoration expert's past seasons and life, including her ex-boyfriend, Ryan Sawtelle. But that turned out to be a bit of a regret. 

“That is the worst idea I ever came up with,” she admitted to TV Insider. “I'm just going to throw it out there. I'm always an optimist.”

A post shared by Ryan Sawtelle (@ryansawtelle)

Sawtelle's Instagram profile describes him as a woodworker with experience in home renovation and the founder of the White Heart Foundation, which serves wounded veterans. The organization has been supported by celebrities including Rob Lowe and Chris Pratt. 

After two bitter divorces, Curtis was initially thrilled to connect with Sawtelle in 2018, whom she told People the following year brought her “a calm I've never known.”

“Not that it's been easy,” she told the outlet at the time. “Everyone has a great first few months rocking everything they have in common, but after six months you start digging into the other stuff and you either grow apart or negotiate those differences and move forward. And (you) have to make a decision to focus on the fun.”

People reported that Curtis started following Sawtelle on Instagram as he chronicled his eight-year-old niece Arden's brave journey with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), an aggressive pediatric brain tumor. Curtis had supported her friend Bobby — a frequent “Rehab Addict” contributor — when his daughter Tessa was fighting another form of brain cancer. She and Sawtelle bonded over those hard journeys and other life experiences, she told People in 2019. 

Ahead of the June 2025 season premiere, Curtis told People, “We were together a long time and I was very close to his family. So we never really stayed out of contact. Your lives are so enmeshed.”

When she started working on the house in Wyoming, she didn't know many people there who could help her, but Sawtelle lives in nearby Utah, so she called him up. 

“We just went out there together and checked out the house,” she said. “It wasn't anything else. There was definitely no reconciliation or ‘Maybe this was a mistake not being together.' No, no, no, …. Us going separate paths was a hundred percent the best idea that we ever had.”

A post shared by Nicole Curtis (@detroitdesign)

Although there will be other familiar faces in the four-episode season, Curtis told People that her two sons won't be featured. 

Her grown son Ethan, whom she shares with her ex Steven Cimini, is in her 20s and appeared on multiple seasons of “Rehab Addict” when they were both much younger. She also has Harper, born in 2015, with ex Shane Maguire. 

“I learned my lesson,” she told People of featuring Ethan on the show when he was younger. “I think there's one gift we can give our children, and I give them privacy. They're out in public with me a lot, and I shield them. My son, when we first started the TV show years ago, we didn't have all the social media presence. He was in sixth grade, he thought it was cool, and his buddies thought it was cool to be on TV. And they still make fun of him because they're like, ‘Oh my gosh, we can see you as a young boy, you had braces' and all this. But I won't do that again. My boys are my most precious, precious things in the entire world to me.”

Jensen Ackles, Eric Dane and Jessica Camacho lead Derek Haas' 13-episode race to save L.A. from a nuclear attack.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	The 10th and last episode of Countdown that Amazon sent to critics is head-scratchingly bad — a cavalcade of anticlimaxes and improbable choices so tone-deaf on every level that I was convinced the show was about to unleash a doozy of a twist as part of what I assumed to be its season finale.


	Were the characters in this mediocre 24 knockoff that might have run on TNT circa 2007 actually going to turn out to be ghosts? Or aliens? Or poorly programmed artificial intelligence navigating a politically denuded simulacrum of 21st-century Los Angeles? Would the twist be that this race-against-the-clock drama without any clocks to race against was taking place in the mind of a small child with no nuanced understanding of human behavior? Or perhaps in the mind of a large manatee with no understanding of human behavior?

The Bottom Line

	
	Prepare to count down from "entertainingly dumb" to "just dumb" in record time.

	Alas, no.

	The twist of the 10th episode of Countdown turned out to be that this was not, in fact, the finale of the first season of Countdown. There are, in fact, three additional episodes that weren't sent to critics, at least one of which could still utilize one of my predicted twists. I'll never know.


	The truth is that if Amazon had only given critics up until the eighth Countdown episode, which ends on a cliffhanger that the ninth episode resolves fairly stupidly, my review would have been tepid but probably not negative. Until that point, Countdown was generic and blandly reactionary, but not flagrantly so. And, although it made me appreciate the taut proficiency of even third-tier 24 anew, I was never bored and I was willing to give the show credit for its effective use of varied L.A. neighborhoods. I couldn't ignore, though, how dumb the ninth episode was and how much worse and more peculiar the 10th episode turned out to be.

	











	Some viewers will absolutely be able to. In addition to capitalizing on the ample fandom for several of the show's stars — Jensen Ackles, mostly — Countdown could practically be retitled “Thing to Watch on Amazon Before New Seasons of Reacher, Alex Cross, Terminal List and the Next Bosch Spinoff Premiere.” After all, as I already said, it isn't like there's any actual counting down going on in Countdown.


	Created and written in its entirety by One Chicago mastermind Derek Haas, Countdown begins entertainingly with a recognizable television favorite discovering something at the Port of Los Angeles. Soon, a race through Downtown L.A. ensues. The character, who works for the Department of Homeland Security, doesn't last long, raising the dual questions: Who killed this short-lived character and what did he learn that necessitated having him killed?


	These questions must be answered by Nathan Blythe (Eric Dane), a law enforcement and task force veteran who has pulled together, for very specific reasons, this team: Meachum (Ackles) is LAPD, coming off of nine months undercover at a prison in Palmdale and harboring a secret. Oliveras (Jessica Camacho) is DEA, coming off of several undercover stints with various cartels and maybe harboring a secret. Bell (Elliot Knight) is an FBI counterterrorism expert, while Shepherd (Violett Beane) is an FBI cyber-investigations expert, but neither has a secret. Finau (Uli Latukefu) has been working gangs and narcotics for the LAPD for 18 years, and while it's initially suggested he has some history of involvement in police violence, it's never mentioned again. There's also Drew (Jonathan Togo), from Homeland Security, who has one character detail and no secrets.

	











	Within the confines of the pilot, we learn that the season-opening murder was related to some quantity of nuclear material transported through the docks, an arsenal that could turn L.A. into Hiroshima or Chernobyl (a comparison made by one character, even though those two circumstances are not actually analogous).


	By the start of the second episode, we learn that the man behind the conspiracy is Boris (Bogdan Yasinski), a wannabe Belarusian oligarch with the most nebulous all-purpose grudge ever devised for television. Shows like 24 and Homeland have proudly boasted about the research that allowed them to create villains who gave the impression that the series had their finger on the geopolitical pulse. Boris appears to have been created to remain as far away from any sort of geopolitical pulse as possible. At no point did I find him scary or intriguing or well-played.


	For nearly eight hours, Blythe and his task force go around L.A. following up on leads, almost always a name that Shepherd is able to find in some database. They go to almost every neighborhood in Los Angeles County and the surrounding environs, generally preceded by a gigantic chyron telling us that we're in Inglewood or Culver City or Pacoima or High Desert. 


	It is my highest praise for the city that, for the most part, Countdown gives the impression of shooting in every neighborhood that they name-check, occasionally even capturing hints of the personality of those neighborhoods. There are times that those neighborhood references and acknowledgements of local freeways turn Countdown into the action-thriller equivalent of the SNL sketch “The Californians,” which would have made more sense as a title than Countdown.

	











	Somebody in Los Angeles has the makings of a nuclear weapon that could obliterate the city. That's established immediately. But the “where” doesn't become clear until the ninth episode and the “when” is never a part of the equation, which means that you have a show called Countdown that even includes the sound effect of a ticking clock without the necessary urgency of a specifically upcoming attack. Haas and the team of veteran directors just assume that because they've said something bad is possible, that's as concrete as viewers will require to experience building tension.


	It's not! At no point in the episodes I've seen do any of the characters seem to experience urgency themselves. They're just puttering around Los Angeles like heavily armed Uber drivers, or like they're playing a game of Where in L.A. Is Carmen Sandiego. But I can't tell you how much time passes in the first season. Nor can I explain why there's a whole episode in which, with a pending threat of nuclear attack, two characters have an ongoing debate about whether to get a third character cake or cupcakes for a surprise birthday. Nor why, when one character is seriously wounded, every member of the task force goes to sit in a hospital waiting room looking glum, rather than continuing the job of SAVING LOS ANGELES FROM A NUCLEAR ATTACK.


	In line with the series' lackadaisical approach, every piece of information has to be repeated multiple times for the benefit of distracted viewers — a response to second-screen viewing that is infiltrating television in general, but Amazon shows especially egregiously. Fully half of Blythe's dialogue is sending different permutations of characters to these different locations, so that the rhythm of the show goes like: “I think Boris might be in Azusa!” “Oliveras, you and Meachum go to Azusa!” “TITLE CARD: AZUSA.” “So this is Azusa?”

	











	None of the characters is all that interesting, though the cast is up to the general task. Dane conveys gruff, admirable authority with every barked command. Ackles, who spent 300+ episodes making glib smartassery likable on Supernatural, is impressively able to win affection for a character who, if you stop and think about it for even a second, is closer to dangerously narcissistic than rascally heroic. Ackles and Camacho have a combustible chemistry that the show steers into to the detriment of every other member of the ensemble, rendering Beane, Latukefu and Knight decidedly secondary pieces of the cast. They're all still better than Merrick McCartha's smarmy Los Angeles DA Valwell, who shows up every episode to make trouble for our team as a one-dimensional adversary.


	Still, at least for some of the time, there's a muscularity to the series' direction, which pairs one chase after another with punk or metal needle-drops. I'm not so emotionally callused that I can't enjoy a pursuit set to Motörhead's “Ace of Spades.” There's nothing to the aesthetic that you haven't seen in dozens of broadcast police/SWAT/alphabet agency procedurals (and that shows like Southland didn't do better), but it's mostly taut and occasionally breathless.


	The last two episodes I've seen are, unfortunately, neither taut nor breathless. They're dumb and illogical, and while I'm sure a twist could have spackled over the abrupt unraveling, I'm doubtful it would have made Countdown good. Where things concluded after the tenth episode was not a place I'm interested in going.

The pair have been romantically linked since the summer of 2023.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce said forget highly-publicized Hollywood red carpets, and made their red carpet debut as a couple in their own style.


	The pop star and the Kansas City football player recently made their debut at the opening night ceremony for Kelce's Tight End University in Nashville. In a video posted on the event's official Instagram account, the pair could be seen walking onto the red carpet hand-in-hand, with smiles stretched across both their faces. The caption read, “Tight End Era.”




	While it wasn't a glamorous Grammy Awards or Met Gala red carpet, it made sense that Swift and Kelce, who keep their relationship private, opted for a more casual debut. Another photo on the Tight End University Instagram also featured the couple standing next to the program's other founders, George Kittle and Greg Olsen, and their significant others.

A post shared by Tight End University – TEU (@te_university)


	Tight End University, a three-day training program for tight ends founded in 2021, aims to have attendees “bond, collaborate with and learn amongst their peers while participating in a variety of activities including film study, on-field drills, recovery, rehabilitation and more,” according to the program's website.


	Kelce and Swift have been romantically linked since the summer of 2023, with the “Fortnight” singer regularly attending the tight end's Chiefs games during NFL seasons. Kelce also popped up at Swift's Eras Tour shows throughout its nearly two-year run.


	After the Eras Tour wrapped in December, the pair has maintained a low profile as they continue to grow their connection, making the occasional public appearance. 

	











	Meanwhile, fans of Swift and Kelce have been patiently waiting for them to make their red carpet debut for nearly two years. However, due to both their busy schedules, it was likely a challenge for them to attend red carpet events together, at least until now.


	“The red carpet moment that the world has waited on for two years happened at TEU? I kind of love this. Met Gala? Grammys? Hell no we're doing TEU” one user wrote in the video's comment section. Another person added, “This, as their first red carpet appearance, is kinda perfect!!”

The ruling in a case involving Amazon-backed Anthropic lends credibility to the notion that AI video generators that could one day compete with studios are doing something transformative.


							By 

	Winston Cho



Transformative.


	That's how a federal court characterized Amazon-backed Anthropic‘s use of millions of books across the web to teach its artificial intelligence system. It's the first decision to consider the issue and will serve as a template for other courts overseeing similar cases. And studios, now that some have entered the fight over the industry-defining technology, should be uneasy about the ruling.




	The thrust of these cases will be decided by one question: Are AI companies covered by fair use, the legal doctrine in intellectual property law that allows creators to build upon copyrighted works without a license? On that issue, a court found that Anthropic is on solid legal ground, at least with respect to training.

					Anthropic Wins First Round In Lawsuit From Music Publishers Over Song Lyrics		
			









	The technology is “among the most transformative many of us will see in our lifetimes,” wrote U.S. District Judge William Alsup.


	Still, Anthropic will face a trial over illegally downloading seven millions books to create a library that was used for training. That it later purchased copies of those books it stole off the internet earlier to cover its tracks doesn't absolve it of liability, the court concluded. The company faces potential damages of hundreds of millions of dollars stemming from the decision that could lead to Disney and Universal getting a similar payout depending on what they unearth in discovery over how Midjourney allegedly obtained copies of thousands of films that were repurposed to teach its image generator.

	











	Last year, authors filed a lawsuit against Anthropic accusing it of illegally downloading and copying their books to power its AI chatbot Claude. The company chose not to move to dismiss the complaint and instead skipped straight for a decision on fair use.


	In the ruling, the court found that authors don't have the right to exclude Anthropic from using their works to train its technology, much in the same way they don't have the right to exclude any person from reading their books to learn how to write.


	“Everyone reads texts, too, then writes new texts,” reads the order. “They may need to pay for getting their hands on a text in the first instance. But to make anyone pay specifically for the use of a book each time they read it, each time they recall it from memory, each time they later draw upon it when writing new things in new ways would be unthinkable.”


	If someone were to read all the modern-day classics, memorize them and emulate a blend of their writing, that wouldn't constitute copyright infringement, the court concluded. Like any reader who wants to be a writer, Anthropic's technology draws upon works not to replicate or supplant them but to create something entirely different, according to the order.


	Those aren't the findings that Disney or Universal — both of whom are suing Midjourney for copyright infringement — wanted or expected. For them, there's reason to worry that Alsup's analysis will shape the way in which the judge overseeing their case considers undermining development of a technology that was found by another court to be revolutionary (or something close to it). More broadly, it could be found that AI video generators, like Sora, are simply distilling every movie ever made to create completely new works.

	











	“This Anthropic decision will likely be cited by all creators of AI models to support the argument that fair use applies to the use of massive datasets to train foundational models,” says Daniel Barsky, an intellectual property lawyer at Holland & Knight.


	Important to note: The authors didn't allege that responses generated by Anthropic infringed upon their works. And if they had, they would've lost that argument under the court's finding that guardrails are in place to ensure that no infringing ever reached users. Alsup compared it to Google imposing limits on how many snippets of text from any one book could be seen by a user through its Google Book service, preventing its search function from being misused as a way to access full books for free.


	“Here, if the outputs seen by users had been infringing, Authors would have a different case,” Alsup writes. “And, if the outputs were ever to become infringing, Authors could bring such a case. But that is not this case.”


	But that could be the case for Midjourney, which returns nearly exact replicas of frames from films in some instances.


When prompted with “Thanos Infinity War,” Midjourney — an AI program that translates text into hyper-realistic graphics — replied with an image of the purple-skinned villain in a frame that appears to be taken from the Marvel movie or promotional materials, with few to no alterations made. A shot of Tom Cruise in the cockpit of a fighter jet, from Top Gun: Maverick, is produced when the tool was asked for a frame from the film. The chatbots can seemingly replicate almost any animation style, generating startlingly accurate characters from titles ranging from DreamWorks' Shrek to Pixar's Ratatouille to Warner Bros.' The Lego Movie.

	











	“The fact that Midjourney generates copies and derivatives of” films from Disney and Universal proves that the company, without their knowledge or permission, “copied plaintiffs' copyrighted works to train and develop” its technology, states the complaint.


	Also at play: The possibility that Midjourney pirated the studios' movies. In the June 23 ruling, Alsup found that Anthropic illegally downloading seven million books to build a library to be used for training isn't covered by fair use. He said that the company could've instead paid for the copies. Such piracy, the court concluded, is “inherently, irredeemably infringing.”


	With statutory damages for willful copyright infringement reaching up to $150,000 per work, massive payouts are a possibility.

The ruling in a case involving Amazon-backed Anthropic lends credibility to the notion that AI video generators that could one day compete with studios are doing something transformative.


							By 

	Winston Cho



Transformative.


	That's how a federal court characterized Amazon-backed Anthropic‘s use of millions of books across the web to teach its artificial intelligence system. It's the first decision to consider the issue and will serve as a template for other courts overseeing similar cases. And studios, now that some have entered the fight over the industry-defining technology, should be uneasy about the ruling.




	The thrust of these cases will be decided by one question: Are AI companies covered by fair use, the legal doctrine in intellectual property law that allows creators to build upon copyrighted works without a license? On that issue, a court found that Anthropic is on solid legal ground, at least with respect to training.

	The technology is “among the most transformative many of us will see in our lifetimes,” wrote U.S. District Judge William Alsup.


	Still, Anthropic will face a trial over illegally downloading 7 millions books to create a library that was used for training. That it later purchased copies of those books it stole off the internet earlier to cover its tracks doesn't absolve it of liability, the court concluded. The company faces potential damages of hundreds of millions of dollars stemming from the decision that could lead to Disney and Universal getting a similar payout depending on what they unearth in discovery over how Midjourney allegedly obtained copies of thousands of films that were repurposed to teach its image generator.

	











	Last year, authors filed a lawsuit against Anthropic, accusing it of illegally downloading and copying their books to power its AI chatbot Claude. The company chose not to move to dismiss the complaint and instead skipped straight for a decision on fair use.


	In the ruling, the court found that authors don't have the right to exclude Anthropic from using their works to train its technology, much in the same way they don't have the right to exclude any person from reading their books to learn how to write.


	“Everyone reads texts, too, then writes new texts,” reads the order. “They may need to pay for getting their hands on a text in the first instance. But to make anyone pay specifically for the use of a book each time they read it, each time they recall it from memory, each time they later draw upon it when writing new things in new ways would be unthinkable.”


	If someone were to read all the modern-day classics, memorize them and emulate a blend of their writing, that wouldn't constitute copyright infringement, the court concluded. Like any reader who wants to be a writer, Anthropic's technology draws upon works not to replicate or supplant them but to create something entirely different, according to the order.


	Those aren't the findings that Disney or Universal — both of whom are suing Midjourney for copyright infringement — wanted or expected. For them, there's reason to worry that Alsup's analysis will shape the way in which the judge overseeing their case considers undermining development of a technology that was found by another court to be revolutionary (or something close to it). More broadly, it could be found that AI video generators, like Sora, are simply distilling every movie ever made to create completely new works.

	











	“This Anthropic decision will likely be cited by all creators of AI models to support the argument that fair use applies to the use of massive datasets to train foundational models,” says Daniel Barsky, an intellectual property lawyer at Holland & Knight.


	Important to note: The authors didn't allege that responses generated by Anthropic infringed upon their works. And if they had, they would've lost that argument under the court's finding that guardrails are in place to ensure that no infringing ever reached users. Alsup compared it to Google imposing limits on how many snippets of text from any one book could be seen by a user through its Google Book service, preventing its search function from being misused as a way to access full books for free.


	“Here, if the outputs seen by users had been infringing, Authors would have a different case,” Alsup writes. “And, if the outputs were ever to become infringing, Authors could bring such a case. But that is not this case.”


	But that could be the case for Midjourney, which returns nearly exact replicas of frames from films in some instances.


When prompted with “Thanos Infinity War,” Midjourney — an AI program that translates text into hyper-realistic graphics — replied with an image of the purple-skinned villain in a frame that appears to be taken from the Marvel movie or promotional materials, with few to no alterations made. A shot of Tom Cruise in the cockpit of a fighter jet, from Top Gun: Maverick, was produced when the tool was asked for a frame from the film. The chatbots can seemingly replicate almost any animation style, generating startlingly accurate characters from titles ranging from DreamWorks' Shrek to Pixar's Ratatouille to Warner Bros.' The Lego Movie.

	











	“The fact that Midjourney generates copies and derivatives of” films from Disney and Universal proves that the company, without their knowledge or permission, “copied plaintiffs' copyrighted works to train and develop” its technology, states the complaint.


	Also at play: the possibility that Midjourney pirated the studios' movies. In the June 23 ruling, Alsup found that Anthropic illegally downloading 7 million books to build a library to be used for training isn't covered by fair use. He said that the company could've instead paid for the copies. Such piracy, the court concluded, is “inherently, irredeemably infringing.”


	With statutory damages for willful copyright infringement reaching up to $150,000 per work, massive payouts are a possibility.

The future Emmy winner had her life all laid out to her by a man using colorful phrases.

Sean Zanni/WireImage

 Mariska Hargitay made an arresting visit to the Call Her Daddy podcast this week, speaking about her new documentary portrait of her mother Jayne Mansfield, My Mom Jayne, as well as her work on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, which she's been on, in her words, "since 1926."


 At the beginning of her career, Hargitay was fairly certain her path was in comedy — not playing a detective for 26 seasons — and she felt pretty entrenched in Los Angeles, living in a large house with several friends. But a visit to the East Coast indicated that her life was about to change.


 "I used to go to New York twice a year and just see theater. I was 34, and I come to New York, and a friend of mine said, 'You have to go to this psychic on Long Island.' I didn't even know where Long Island was," Hargitay recalled.

 She continued, "So I drive out to this guy's house on Long Island, and he gives me a psychic reading. And because my mom was famous, I was like, you are just probably gonna Google me, you know, Jayne Mansfield's daughter, and then come up with some bulls---. So I sit down with this guy and he says, 'You see that face?' I have this on [a] recording. 'You see that face right now?' I said, 'Yeah.' He goes, 'You're gonna be famous for that face, that face, that serious face.'"


 A little taken aback, Hargitay replied, "I'm gonna be a comedian. And he says, this is my favorite thing I think anyone's ever said to me. He goes like this: 'I don't give a rat's ass what you think.'"


 Continuing, the psychic said, "'You're gonna be famous for that face.' And then he says to me, 'And you're moving to New York.' And I said, 'No, I have this gorgeous house my father built.' I was living in a house with, like, 32 roommates because I had this house and it had five rooms. I rented out rooms, so I'm actually living out an episode of Friends. Not an episode, but the whole season because I had so many roommates. [So] I was like, 'I live in L.A. This is my town. I have my roommates. I have my house.'"


 Then the punchline: "Swear to God, six months later, I got SVU."

 And since that time, she has been a New York City staple — unable to walk to the bagel store without people giving her hugs and telling the woman who plays Detective Olivia Benson all about their personal struggles. (Something Hargitay takes in great stride, as she explains in the podcast.)


 Importantly, however, is the phrase rat's ass.


 "He said, 'I don't give a rat's ass'," Hargitay repeated. "How great is rat's ass?"

Anyone see anything they can't explain? A resident living in New York's upper Hudson Valley reported a strange site flying in the sky late Saturday night. The person who filed the report even says the object was traveling through the clouds at a hypersonic rate of speed.

The sighting once again raises the question if the source is some sort of unidentified flying object, or simply something like miliary aircraft, or naturally occurring phenomena?

New York has a long history with unidentified flying objects, as the state ranks 5th overall for sightings across the United States. It's no secret New York, particularly the state's Hudson Valley area, has a long history with unexplained flying phenomena and other strange sightings.

As stated many times, these observations of so-called UFOs can easily be explained as drones, military planes, communication satellites, or even a meteor burning up in the upper atmosphere, though.

A resident living in Climax, New York reported to the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting center that they witnessed an object traveling at a hypersonic rate of speed the night of June 21. The report describes what they allegedly saw as "orbs seen through cloud cover at incredible speeds."

The witness say that for about an hour they saw two white orbs "through thick cloud cover", flying across the sky at an extremely fast rate of speed. The person say that this would continue every 5 to 10 minutes for roughly around an hour that night.

The report says that the person witnessed "the orb start as one", and then "split off and make a U-turn" through the sky.

Chuck Russell, the director behind The Blob and A Nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Warriors, is summoning some serious occult energy in his return to horror with Witchboard, a reimagining of the 1986 cult favorite. 

The first trailer has dropped, and it's packed with eerie imagery, ritualistic vibes, and a whole lot of supernatural mayhem. 

Set in modern-day New Orleans, Witchboard follows a young couple who unwittingly unlock something ancient and malevolent after discovering a cursed pendulum board in their newly-renovated French Quarter café. What begins as a dream venture quickly spirals into a nightmare of possession, temptation, and full-blown occult terror.

Madison Iseman (I Know What You Did Last Summer) leads the cast as Emily, alongside Aaron Dominguez (Only Murders in the Building), Antonia Desplat (Shantaram), and Charlie Tahan (Ozark). Also along for the ride is Stranger Things star Jamie Campbell Bower.

Speaking with Bloody Disgusting, Russell said: “I wanted to get back to the horror genre. I've been keeping an eye out for that over the course of my career, and I wanted to do something even scarier and more imaginative. I wanted to top my other two horror films,” he said.

He added: “I put everything I hadn't tried into this film. I hope that fans of my work will recognize my touch. But we have dreams; we have deadly hallucinations. We have body swaps; we have literal time travel. It's fun in that regard, but number one is to scare the hell out of people, and I think we've done that, too.”

The trailer and poster showcase something far more visceral and stylized than the original Witchboard. There's a dreamlike terror to the imagery, flashes of fire-lit rituals, warped bodies, and distorted realities that suggest Witchboard is tapping into something deeply unhinged. It's full-blown metaphysical horror.

The film is set to hit theaters August 15, 2025,

A coronal hole in the sun could result in visible auroras over about 15 U.S. states tonight (June 25), with the Space Weather Prediction Center expecting a moderate geomagnetic storm.

A "hole" in the sun is sending a high-speed stream of charged particles toward our planet, which could make dancing auroras visible from about 15 U.S. states tonight (June 25).

The auroras are predicted to be most intense over Alaska and Canada, but they could potentially also be seen across the north of the contiguous U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center.

"The aurora may become visible over some northern and upper Midwest states from New York to Idaho," representatives for the Space Weather Prediction Center wrote in an update.

If skywaters are treated to a northern lights display tonight, it will be thanks to a coronal hole in the sun's atmosphere. These less-dense areas of the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, enable streams of charged particles, or solar wind, to escape into space at high speeds. When these high-speed streams collide with Earth, they can increase geomagnetic activity, which produces auroras.

The Space Weather Prediction Center is anticipating that the coronal hole streams will trigger a moderate (G2) geomagnetic storm. The geomagnetic storm scale ranges from G1 to G5, with G5 being the most severe. Storms of a G2 magnitude aren't rare but can produce strong auroras.

The U.K.'s Met Office has forecast minor to moderate (G1 to G2) geomagnetic storms on Wednesday, though it noted that a strong G3 storm can't be ruled out.

Auroras occur in the sky when charged particles from the sun hit Earth's upper atmosphere, colliding with oxygen and nitrogen particles. These particles then glow different colors as they shed energy from the collision, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Oxygen gives off the greens and reds in the auroras, while nitrogen gives off the blue and purple colored light, according to NASA.

The auroras are expected to form above Alaska and Canada, with the light show's southern extent just grazing the northern edge of the contiguous U.S. However, auroras don't have to be directly overhead for people to see them and can be observed from as far as 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) away, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center.

Auroras are typically best viewed just after sunset or just before sunrise. However, they are tricky to predict, and there's no guarantee that people living in northern states will be able to see anything on the northern horizon.

Geomagnetic activity is expected to drop after tonight, with a minor G1 storm forecast for Thursday (June 26), according to the Space Weather Prediction Center.

[WARNING: The following story contains spoilers about the first three episodes of Countdown.]

It may be hard to believe, but Jensen Ackles can be called a TV veteran since he has been entertaining TV viewers for nearly 30 years. He first grabbed viewers' attention in 1997 as teen Eric Brady on NBC daytime soap Days of Our Lives before chasing demons alongside Jared Padalecki on The CW's Supernatural for 15 years. Since then, he's appeared on ABC's Big Sky, CBS' Tracker, and as superhero Soldier Boy on The Boys (a role he'll reprise for the Prime Video show's fifth and final season). He also found time behind the camera by directing six Supernatural episodes, an episode of Padalecki's Walker, as well as executive-produce and narrate the short-lived Supernatural spin-off The Winchesters.

 










Now, Ackles stays on the right side of the law as sardonic Det. Mark Meachum in the action drama Countdown, which drops its first three installments on Wednesday (the rest of the 13-episode series rolls out weekly). On the series, a Department of Homeland Security agent is suddenly murdered, so a special task force is created with Meachum and others from different arms of law enforcement. However, that murder investigation leads them to bigger threats that has the potential of destroying Los Angeles. Jessica Camacho, Uli Latukefu, Violett Beane, Elliot Knight, and Grey's Anatomy and Euphoria star Eric Dane round out the cast.

Here, Ackles tells us more about why Countdown appealed to him, that surprising TV face we saw in the opening of the series, as well as an update on the Supernatural reunion with Padalecki and Misha Collins on The Boys.

 










Gold Derby: You were looking for something to do under your new Amazon deal, so what was it about Countdown that just seemed like the right thing to start with?

Jensen Ackles: Derek Haas [Countdown creator, showrunner, and executive producer], largely. He and I had a couple conversations and then I flew out to L.A., we had lunch, and there was just an instant kind of connection there. Obviously, his resume and pedigree speaks for itself. The guy is well versed in storytelling and character-building and also doing broadcast, which I come from as well. I felt like he had a really good sense of how to build a set and how to build a crew, and how to build a team and a cast that could really sing.

And I gotta be honest, I'm not gonna lie. Since Supernatural, I didn't think it would ever get that fun again. This was some of the most enjoyable days on set I have had in my life. From top to bottom, everybody was there to do solid work but to also have a great time doing it. The days that we were all together for the task force headquarters were the greatest days ever because we were all having fun, and we were on set and we were just laughing and we were playing games in between sets or in between scenes. I hope that the chemistry off-screen translated onscreen. I believe it did and I hope we get to do it for many more years.

Tell me about Mark Meachum. How would you describe this guy in your words?

He's a inherently good guy that has just been dealt a really, really bad hand. He's trying to make it in this world the best way he knows how. He could have gone the bad route and been a drug dealer or a drug runner or working for the bad guys very easily, which is probably why he did so well undercover. He can relate to these guys more so than somebody who grew up in white-collar America and had loving parents. This guy comes from broken home, broken family, and a broken deal.

 










I think that he decided to not go the dark route and try to try to bring light to the darkness. It's a fun character to play because there is darkness in there. It's an internal battle, so he fights throughout the series. The fact that he's got this terrible diagnosis — again, he's been dealt a bad hand — but instead of opting to just cash in and be like, "I'm done. I'm out," he's like, "No, I'm going to jump on this grenade and save as many people as I possibly can."

We learn of Meachum's health issues in the first episode. Can you clarify what he is actually dealing with?

It's an inoperable brain tumor. And that was one of the great things that Derek wrote in — this guy is not just a maverick. He's not just a cool guy with sunglasses and smoking cigarettes. Do you know Den of Thieves with Gerard Butler? He's just this tough guy in a leather jacket that should ride for a motorcycle club, but instead he's a cop. I'll watch those movies all day. But Meachum, he's not doing it because he's that guy. He's doing it because he's got nothing to lose and he would rather take risks so that his team doesn't have to.

Seeing Milo Ventimiglia in the opening was a big surprise since that has been kept under wraps. How did that come about? Did you make a call?

 










I don't know if this is out of the purview of what we should talk about, but that whole thing was filmed with another actor and who did a great job, but they brought him in as a guest star and they shot that whole sequence. Then, I think once they got into the editing room, they were like, "This feel like it needs to be a familiar face." So it's a testament to the Amazon team and a testament to Derek and Jonathan Brown, who directed the first episode and [is] also our producing director, since they were like, "The stakes need to be heightened here because this sets the whole show on its journey."

Derek came to me and says, "I think we're going to reshoot that whole sequence, and it's obviously a lot of money to redo it, but we got to get somebody. Do you know Milo?" I was like, "Of course I know Milo. He'd be fantastic. Does he want to do it?" He said, "We pitched it to him and we think he's in." I sent Milo a text and was like, "Bro!" So he came for a costume fitting, but he came to set to say hi. I hadn't seen Milo in maybe a year or two, but we go way back, obviously. It was really good to see him and I was just giddy that he came on. And he nailed it as I knew he would.

It's too bad his character dies so quickly in the opening!

Oh, trust me. I was already pitching, "Can we do some flashbacks where Milo comes in and we actually know each other?" Derek was like, "Let me do the writing."

We find out Meachum may not be the best at romantic relationships since his fellow task force member, DEA agent Amber Oliveros (Camacho), knows his former fiancée. Is there some romantic tension between Meachum and Oliveros that we may see develop over the first season?

 










You will. I mean, with any good "will they or won't they?", there's got to be tension. That is definitely an intentional situation there, but instead of Meachum trying to win her over, he's more like, "I don't need to deal with that. I'm just gonna stay in my lane." But they are partnered up effectively, so you get a bit of a buddy comedy. And Jess just brought it all to the table and did a fantastic job of bringing a really strong character and somebody who's not gonna placate to Meachum at all. That relationship needs that friction, and it will be kind of your classic "will they or won't they?" So far, it's "won't they?"

You directed on Supernatural and Walker, so any chance we're seeing you in the director's chair at all in Season 1?

I would absolutely love to direct at some point. I want to make sure we have a strong foundation and we have our feet on the ground with what we're doing first. Look, if they threw me in the director's chair tomorrow, I would feel abundantly confident in the cast, but more so the crew. Vanessa Joy [Smith], who's our director of photography, is one of the best I've ever worked with in my life. [She] and her crew are just amazing. She did all five seasons of Mayans M.C. and she is an absolute joy. I mean, it's right in her name! She's such a pro. So, yeah, if your DP is of that caliber, it's hard for a director to really fail. I love being in a position directing-wise where I can't fail.

You're working with Jensen and Misha on The Boys. How would you describe working again with them?

We already shot it, and it was like three brothers coming together to have dinner at somebody else's house. It was like, "All right, listen, Mom's not here, but we've got to clear our plates at the end. Everybody just mind your p's and q's. Don't mess this up. We've got a reputation. Let's not destroy it."

PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE have just droppped a surprise cover of a Lola Amour hit single.

On June 24, 2025 (Tuesday), Japanese boy group PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE — or simply, PSYCHIC FEVER — posted a short video on their social media, which sees members KOKORO and REN covering a short snippet of Lola Amour's 2023 track “Raining In Manila.” It sees them singing the song's chorus, with KOKORO covering the main lines while REN provides backing vocals.

Watch the short cover below:

Notably, a few days before this on June 21, 2025 (Saturday), Lola Amour also posted a short video on their own social media accounts, which sees the the Filipino funk-pop band covering PSYCHIC FEVER's summer hit “Gelato.” Jokingly referred to by the band as a result of them having “five hours to kill before a show,” the cover sees Lola Amour put their signature laid-back, brass-infused spin on the track. Watch it here.

Released on June 14, 2023, Lola Amour's “Raining In Manila” quickly gained widespread attention online from listeners within the Philippines and beyond, becoming the band's breakthrough into the mainstream. It served as the first single from their self-titled debut album, which came out last April 10, 2024.

Meanwhile, PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE's “Gelato” came out last May 15, 2025. It is the lead track from the seven-piece group's latest EP, entitled PSYCHIC FILE III, which was released on May 30.

Listen to the original versions of Lola Amour's “Raining In Manila” and PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE's “Gelato” below:

Kate Shemirani's daughter, Paloma, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer. Despite doctors informing her that she had an 80 percent chance of survival with chemotherapy, Paloma refused treatment and instead opted for alternative therapies, reportedly under her mother's influence. She died in July 2024 at the age of 23. Also read | World Cancer Day 2025: Cancer spreads from person to person? Here are 4 most common myths and facts about the disease

In a June 23 interview with BBC Panorama, Paloma's brothers, Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani, blamed their mother Kate's anti-medicine conspiracy theories for her death. They said that Kate's influence led Paloma to reject chemotherapy and medical treatment. Kate Shemirani is a former nurse whose registration was cancelled reportedly due to promoting misinformation about Covid-19.

Kate styles herself as 'the Natural Nurse' on social media and has 'been known to spread conspiracy theories and once-fringe anti-medicine views to millions' – which her sons believe contributed to Paloma's decision to refuse cancer treatment. Paloma's elder brother Sebastian said: “My sister has passed away as a direct consequence of my mum's actions and beliefs and I don't want anyone else to go through the same pain or loss that I have.”

The brothers alleged that their mother texted Paloma's boyfriend, Ander, saying, "TELL PALOMA NOT TO SIGN [OR] VERBALLY CONSENT TO CHEMO OR ANY TREATMENT". The brothers further said they hope they can help prevent other deaths like Paloma's, and they believe social media companies should take stronger action against medical misinformation.

“I wasn't able to stop my sister from dying. But it would mean the world to me if I could make it that she wasn't just another in a long line of people that die in this way,” Gabriel said.

According to her sons, Kate's anti-medicine views were accelerated in 2012, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Even though she had the tumour removed through surgery, she credited alternative therapies for her recovery and reportedly shared online how she used a programme including juices and coffee enemas to become 'cancer-free'.

Kate has not directly responded to the allegations made against her by her sons in connection with Paloma's death, but has publicly blamed the NHS (National Health Service) for her daughter's death.
