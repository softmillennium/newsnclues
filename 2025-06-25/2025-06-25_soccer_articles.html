                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, U.S. Men's National Team legend Brad Friedel believes the new-look competition could prove beneficial in the long run for some. A searing summer has taken its toll on many involved, with players visibly struggling during outdoor games with the nationwide heatwave. Hydration breaks have been implemented to help players cope with the humid conditions, while both Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund have recently sent their substitutes to the locker room during games to stay cool. Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca even admitted that it has been “almost impossible to train,” with the Blues cutting their session ahead of their recent 3-0 win against ES Tunis short with temperatures hitting 99 degrees Fahrenheit, with humidity making it feel like 110 degrees. However, according to longtime Premier League shot stopper Friedel, lessons learned during the Club World Cup could prove invaluable in 12 months' time. “I've spoken to a couple of national teams that are preparing for the World Cup, and they've asked where would be best to set up camp if they have games here or there,” Friedel told Mirror U.S. Sports in May. If you play outdoors, for instance, in Dallas in the middle of the summer, you could have a tornado and wind and rain, or you could have what feels like 120 degrees Fahrenheit on the pitch. What I would say, if you're a player and you're playing for the first time in the States in the summer and you know you're going to be involved with your national team in the World Cup, that'll be very good for them because they'll understand the different weather conditions and climate conditions in areas of the country.” Friedel, who played for the likes of Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa, recalled having played in the historic Cotton Bowl in Dallas, which, like 11 of the 16 venues set to be used in 2026, does not have a roof over the field. He noted how midday kickoffs would feel like walking into a steam room, going on to note that outdoor games in places like Atlanta, Miami, and Orlando can be “brutal in the summer.” However, neither the third-place playoff game nor the final will be played in covered stadiums, with Miami's Hard Rock Stadium and East Rutherford's MetLife Stadium scheduled to host the respective games. All but three of the knockout stage games will be held outdoors. Watch every game from the FIFA Club World Cup on DAZN for free. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardoso's transfer, if completed, will be the third-highest transfer fee paid for an American player behind Christian Pulisic ($65 million) and Folarin Balogun ($43 million). Derby County finished 19th in the Englsih second division while scoring just 48 goals. Agyemang has scored eight goals in 18 appearances for Charlotte this season. Ricardo Pepi's breakout season in the Dutch Eredivisie was cut short due to a season-ending meniscus injury, but there are Italian and Spanish clubs interested in making a move for the 22-year-old striker, including Premier League club Fulham, according to Fabrizio Romano. Following a forgettable season at AC Milan, which ended in a managerial change, Yunus Musah is expected to move clubs this summer, and Napoli is keen on the 22-year-old midfielder, according to multiple reports. Nottingham Forest, who finished seventh in the Premier League last season, are in talks over a package deal that would land them Belgian winger Samuel Mbangula and American winger Tim Weah for a combined fee of €23 million ($26.7 million). Weah had six goals and five assists in all competitions for Juventus last season. Could Malik Tillman's breakout summer end with a high-profile move to Bayer Leverkusen? That's the latest reporting out of Germany from Sky Sport. Leverkusen are looking to fill the attacking void left after selling Florian Wirtz to Liverpool for a record fee, and Tillman — a native of Germany and product of Bayern Munich — could help fill that void.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Women's National Team icon Carli Lloyd's no-nonsense takes will soon be returning to FOX and FS1 airwaves, after it was announced that she would form part of the network's studio team covering the upcoming UEFA Women's Euros and CONCACAF Gold Cups. Lloyd's third straight summer working in-house with the network, having previously covered the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in 2023, and the CONMEBOL Copa America in 2024, the National Soccer Hall of Famer said she was “thrilled” to be returning for another summer. “With the UEFA Women's Euro starting up and the U.S. off to a good start in the Gold Cup, I'm thrilled to be back with FOX Sports for what promises to be an incredible next few months of soccer,” said the USWNT legend, who apologized to her former teammates earlier this year for how she treated them, in a statement. “I can't wait to cover all the storylines across both tournaments and especially with the UEFA Women's Euro, continuing to be a part of growing the women's game on FOX with a really impressive schedule that puts the tournament and players center stage.” “This isn't a surprise to me,” Lloyd admitted, as per Awful Announcing. And I haven't seen much that has changed. “From a tactical perspective, it's been the same. Players don't seem to be cohesive on the field, don't seem to be playing in synchronicity." Lloyd went on to claim that “There's something not right,” adding: “And it's not one thing, there's multiple things that have just been spiraling out of control, and now it's being revealed on the world's biggest stage. You can't get away with doing all of these things for so many years.” However, the likes of USMNT legend Alexi Lalas, who works with Lloyd at FOX, backed her amid a barrage of criticism, describing her as “wonderful” following her viral rant. We also want to have pride in terms of what is going on on the field," Lalas said. They've got to fix some things going forward, the criticism they got I think is warranted, and fair. Because if not, they're going to go home quick.” Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But because your domestic league isn't the best in the world, and because your nation's best players eventually move on to clubs in Europe, you don't follow it. Instead, you stay at home and watch games from across the ocean. And you insist your friends who regularly frequent the Azteca or the Bombonera aren't authentic fans, because they root for an inferior product. It's the kind of chatter that would guarantee a bar fight most places. Yet in too many corners of American soccer fandom, it's become accepted that your Peacock Premium subscription offers a better value than a ticket in an MLS or USL supporters section. Perhaps the FIFA Club World Cup will change that. Yes, the play of Brazilian clubs in particular has impressed so far. But the tournament's more lasting legacy in America may be the tens of thousands of passionate supporters from South and Central America, North Africa and even East Asia who have literally taken over stadiums, mass transit systems and public plazas throughout the group stage. In the process, they've shown at least a few Yanks that your street cred isn't less simply because you don't pay your season ticket bill in euros or pound sterling. From the Xeneizes in South Florida to the Red Devils in Seattle, fans from all corners of the globe have brought an energy rarely seen at American NFL stadiums, even if their numbers weren't always enough to completely fill such cavernous venues. Those supporters, whose countries have produced Messi, Neymar, Achraf Hakimi and Mo Salah, are well aware their teams and their leagues aren't the best on Earth. Critics may argue American fans are handicapped from making similar investments in a sporting product unless they believe it to be an elite product. It's a nonsensical take once you realize our second-most popular sport literally involves watching college students beat the bejesus out of each other for three-and-a-half hours, 12 fall Saturdays a year. And MLS hasn't helped itself in recent years by (poorly) mimicking European soccer culture and (greedily) charging English soccer prices. Even so, in the end there's only one fundamental difference between a Botafogo fan in Rio and a Fire fan in Chicago: When the Botafogo fan goes to work on Monday, there's no jerk in the break room who tells him he's never seen an MLS game because he only watches Chelsea. If anything, that makes American fans of MLS and USL even more impressive, exactly because their versions of the sport are less popular than they should be. But supporting the local game makes you more of a true fan, not less.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luis Rubiales, the former president of Spain's football federation, has lost an appeal against his sexual assault conviction. Rubiales was fined €10,800 (£9,206) in February for kissing captain Jenni Hermoso without her consent after Spain's women's team won the 2023 World Cup. The incident - in which Rubiales grabbed Hermoso's head and kissed her on the lips - triggered protests and calls for his resignation. He denied the sexual assault charge, describing the kiss as an "act of affection" and "completely spontaneous". It found that Rubiales "restrained himself" when interacting with other players and "could also have done so, without too much effort, with the captain". At the original trial, Hermoso said she had not given permission for the kiss, which she felt "disrespected" her and "stained one of the happiest days" of her life. The court upheld the sentence handed down in February, which included a ban on Rubiales going within a 200m radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year. Prosecutors had alleged he pressured Hermoso into publicly saying the kiss was consensual, which Rubiales denied. Three other former Spanish football federation employees - coach Jorge Vila, marketing executive Rubén Rivera and sporting director Albert Luque - were previously cleared of coercion, a decision which was upheld on Wednesday.

All four players have either been involved in sponsorship activations, or spoken positively about the tournament or attended games with FIFA during the Club World Cup. It added that FIFA attendees are still to be confirmed. The Big Art sales representative also said that this paid-for entry represented a “rare opportunity to align your brand with FIFA and engage directly with global decision-makers, influencers and icons from across the world.” FIFA did not comment when asked by The Athletic what role it had in the pricing of the event, or whether it is appropriate for individuals or brands to spend thousands of dollars to engage directly with FIFA leadership. FIFA subsequently promoted the event on its website, without mentioning the prices, but said that the night “will begin with a cocktail reception, followed by a gala dinner featuring world-class cuisine, fine wines and high-end production befitting the truly historic and game changing tournament.” Last month, the first ticketing packages for next summer's men's World Cup went on sale with the release of a collection of high-end hospitality options. The initial release was limited to certain hospitality offerings involving several games packaged together, starting at $3,500 (£2,625) per person and climbing to an eye-popping $73,200 (£54,750).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the radical left would like everyone to believe that men possess no inherent physical advantage when it comes to sports, that defies all reality, biology and common sense. As part of their preparation for the upcoming Euro 2025 tournament, they faced Luzern's U15 boys' team in a friendly match. Yes, U15 stands for "under 15 years old," which means the boys' team comprises players 14 and younger. One might think that adult females – especially the best of the bunch in an entire country – might have a chance against male teenagers who have barely reached puberty. As part of their preparation for the upcoming Women's Euro 2025 tournament, Switzerland's National Team lost to the Luzern's U15 boys' team in a friendly match, 7-1. However, the physical advantage that boys possess over girls was on full display in Wednesday's match. Not only did Luzern beat Switzerland, they demolished them in a 7-1 result. This isn't the first time we've seen a professional women's soccer team lose to boys. Carli Lloyd, a player on that USWNT squad, admitted that the mid-pubescent teenage boys were "bigger, stronger and faster" than the adult professional-soccer-playing women. But, hey, there's no advantage for men over women in sports, right? Dan began his sports media career at ESPN, where he survived for nearly a decade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bayern Munich's 1-0 loss to Benfica in Charlotte, North Carolina was costly in a few ways. Winning the group would have had several key benefits for Bayern Munich, which are now off the table (per Kicker via @iMiaSanMia): • Bayern would avoid the tougher path to the final (as things stand) with PSG, Inter, Real Madrid, Man City • The quarterfinal would be played at night time (9 p.m. local time) instead of a physically demanding midday match with the heat The strategy for Bayern Munich in this tourney was peculiar to say the least. Willing to play Jamal Musiala against Auckland City FC and Boca Juniors when he was not needed was odd, but to heavily rotate in the Benfica match when the team needed a win was the real head scratcher. Bayern Munich must rotate more effectively than it did last season, but there is a time and place for everything. In such a key match vs. Benfica — with so much at stake, it could have been assumed that head coach Vincent Kompany would have played this match a little more close to a real knockout game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since last year's Olympic gold medal triumph, U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes has been handing out international debuts like Oprah Winfrey's Ultimate Car Giveaway: "You get a cap! Four players joined their first senior USWNT training camp this week, bringing Hayes' tally to 27 first-time call-ups since arriving on the sidelines just over a year ago. Nineteen players to date have earned their first USWNT caps under Hayes. Recent USWNT lineups have been the youngest and least experienced in over two decades. However, this phase of drastic experimentation is ending soon. Hayes recently told ESPN that, after this window, which includes a pair of games against Ireland and a friendly against Canada over the next seven days, she expects to have narrowed down her roster to the core of players she will lean on at World Cup qualifying next year, and at the 2027 Women's World Cup. Effectively, that makes this week a final in-person audition for some hopefuls trying to break through and climb the U.S. depth chart. There will be no more chances for players to prove they belong before FIFA's international calendar keeps the team apart until October. This is an inflection point for the USWNT pool, which expanded over the past year but will soon become focused on a core group of players again soon. The coach's task will be to evaluate how players do in this ongoing camp in addition to the previous four training camps this year. As such, there is undoubtedly an urgency for some players to impress the USWNT coach right now. This week is their last shot to make their case to Hayes while she's standing a few feet away on the training field or in the meeting room -- integral parts of team selection that are almost entirely shielded from the public eye. USWNT manager Emma Hayes joins "Futbol W" to reveal why certain players have been left out of the roster for their upcoming international fixtures. Angelina Anderson, Claudia Dickey and Mandy McGlynn have a combined three caps (all for McGlynn, and all from the past seven months). They've all had strong moments (and some low points) in NWSL play, but they haven't had much face time with Hayes. All three goalkeepers will be under increased scrutiny at this camp with more experienced players missing -- and they might be fighting to join Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who looks like the favored No. A large group of mostly inexperienced defenders, along with the three goalkeepers in camp, will have another chance to build rapport with all-world defender Naomi Girma, the only European-based player on the most recent USWNT roster. They've each been solid in the NWSL and Sams already has an Olympic gold medal (earned before her first cap, uniquely) after surfacing on Hayes' radar last year. Hayes is still looking for answers -- and she's using this final experimentation window to widen her search. All four players have been standouts in the NWSL, and this is their last chance for a while to earn an in-person evaluation by Hayes and her staff. It is also the chance to leave a strong in-person impression for some of the newer regulars (relatively speaking) like forwards Michelle Cooper, Yazmeen Ryan and Emma Sears, to make a breakthrough. Hayes used Bugg as an example of how the team also needs to prepare for the 2028 Olympics and 2031 World Cup, which will each be played on home soil. Attacking midfielder Jaedyn Shaw is the present-day example of this fluidity. Hayes is a studious coach who says she watches everything, whether in person or on late-night streams from her home in England. Recent history supports the notion that she will call up players based on their league form, but Hayes keeps reminding everyone that she "can only pick the players that are available" rather than "the very best 23, 26 players." Except for one game, Hayes has not had her entire starting forward line of Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson or Sophia Wilson available since the Olympics last August. Come October, Hayes will assemble a roster that will largely consist of the players tasked with qualifying for and winning the 2027 World Cup. There will be plenty of personnel and lineup changes over the next two years along that journey to Brazil, but this week is the last opportunity for many players to insert themselves directly into Hayes' vision for success at the 2027 World Cup. Hayes wants to have a core group set ahead of the USWNT's games in October, and Hayes has already accrued a decent sample size of evidence over the past six to eight months of extended auditions. Against Ireland and Canada -- and in the trainings in between -- players will have one more golden chance to show they can contribute on the big stage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eight countries are unable to compete in qualification for the World Cup as FIFA does not recognise them as official nations. Out of those nations, Congo withdrew from their remaining fixtures earlier this year after their football association, FECAFOOT, was briefly suspended by FIFA. And Eritrea - who haven't played a competitive match in five years - pulled out of qualification before it began, with The Guardian claiming its governing body are concerned that players will seek political asylum in opposing nations due to the conditions in the country. The African nation are still recognised by FIFA so can return to competitive international football at any point. Pope Francis supported Argentine giants San Lorenzo and reportedly held talks with UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin about potential Vatican City membership ahead of the Euro 2020 final. He is a big fan of baseball, has been described as 'quite the amateur tennis player', and appeared to indicate his support for Serie A side Roma last month. Micronesia's football association, along with the British writer Paul Watson, administered a futsal competition in 2023 in an attempt to push them closer to FIFA membership or recognition. Their uphill battle, though, is highlighted by a pure lack of resources. In 2015, their under-23 team was entered into the Pacific Games, being drawn against Tahiti, Fiji and Vanuatu. Nauru are perhaps the closest team on this list to gaining membership of a continental governing body. Plans are in place to rebuild the nation's grassroots schemes, and they would have players with Nauru heritage living in Australia to call upon if they were admitted to the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC). Backed by Reading icon Dave Kitson, the nation invited a Royals XI team to face them in a one-off match, though the fixture has not yet taken place. At international level, however, the Monegasque Football Federation is not a member of UEFA or FIFA and therefore Monaco cannot play in World Cups. Were Monaco ever to be admitted to UEFA, the likes of PSV star Olivier Boscagli - who was born in the principality state - could play for them. The Palau Soccer League - the nation's only football division - was due to be relaunched in October 2024 on their only football-specific pitch. They were due to enter the Confederation of Island Football Associations (CONIFA) World Football Cup in 2018, but withdrew due to financial reasons. Tuvalu are in a different position to some nations on this list as they have a men's and women's domestic structure. Some of their players have competed for Australian A-League sides, while their top scorer, Alopou Petoa, formerly played in the top amateur division in New Zealand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For more stories like this one, subscribe to A People's History of Kansas City on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite podcast app. Just under a year from now, Kansas City plans to welcome hundreds of thousands of soccer fans from all over the world for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. "We're really excited about the opportunity that gives us to really rise on the world stage, and demonstrate why Kansas City is a great place to live and come to visit for these kinds of events," says Lindsey Douglas who is the COO of KC2026 — the nonprofit responsible for event preparation. Kansas City is the smallest host city in North America to participate, and it's been building up to this moment for decades. Fans can join epic watch parties in the Power & Light District, and find games of all experience levels around the region. But Kansas City may not have embraced this sport at all, if it hadn't been for the immigrants who first advocated for and educated people about the beautiful game — back before the city even had soccer fields to play on. “Soccer is still what you would call an underdog sport,” says G.E. According to White, a group of players in 1863 established “association football” with its own set of regulations separate from sports like rugby. “They decided to have a completely foot-oriented game,” White says. Now with its own governing body, association football spread to British colonies, throughout the rest of Europe, and into the New World. During the late 19th century, the United States underwent an industrial boom, as a large number of immigrants from Great Britain, Ireland, Portugal and other European countries moved here to work manufacturing jobs. Those workers brought soccer with them to cities on the East Coast and Midwest. Between hosting the 1904 Olympics and World's Fair, this multinational manufacturing hub did a lot to establish some of the early national soccer infrastructure. But both soccer and the immigrants who played it got labeled as outsiders. It's hard to paint a full picture of how soccer first started in Kansas City, because there was so little being written about immigrant communities, in addition to the significant language barrier. But old newspapers clippings, from The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times, offer glimpses at different pieces of the puzzle. One of the first people to start a soccer team in Kansas City was J.T. A former St. Louis player, Gallagher had moved to Kansas City and was “looking for more recruits” to meet him at Association Park (once located at 20th Street and Prospect Avenue) to try out. In schools, kids were mostly taught American-made sports. “You can't really play soccer in the Midwest or northeast in the winter unless you want to play on a field that's covered with snow or ice and that's difficult,” White says. Even those conditions, however, couldn't stop Kansas City's soccer lovers — such as José Portuguez, a Costa Rican immigrant, and my grandfather. I documented our journey, and the stories my family told. José Portuguez died back in 2021, when he was 97 years old. And I always knew vaguely that he was also a part of the reason Kansas City became a soccer town. There, José helped organize an intramural soccer league of international students, and even coordinated tournaments with nearby schools — driving hours to games around Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. Soccer players were hungry for community, because it could be lonely outside of that world. Jim says players were constantly fighting for respect, and field space. Even though that attitude would irritate him, José would stay cool, and use the opportunity to teach them more about the game. After José graduated from KU, he married his college girlfriend — my grandmother — and in the 1950s moved to Kansas City. They started a family while José worked as an engineer, but my grandpa looked for any chance he could to play soccer. My family says he found remnants of those early immigrant teams around the city and region, in Parkville, Leavenworth and St. Joseph. But to get soccer taken seriously in Kansas City, he would need a friend. And he found one in Augustin “Chino” Medina. As a player for Atlas and other bigtime teams, Medina was twice the national scoring champion. Towards the end of his career, Chino met his wife: a woman from Kansas City's Westside, who would come to Mexico to see her family. He had never lived in the United States, and didn't speak English. It was at church that Chino Medina found support. Specifically, at Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish, and the Guadalupe Center — of which Cris Medina is the former director. Its mission today is to help improve the lives of Latinos in Kansas City, but the center was originally created to offer services and help “Americanize” these new arrivals. “They wanted the immigrants to play American sports,” Cris Medina explains. By the time Chino Medina had arrived, though, the Guadalupe Center had been taken over by Mexicans, who instead focused on Mexican pride rather than assimilation to white culture. An associate priest from Spain named Ignacio Orozco, who worked at the church, formed a recreational soccer team called Guadalupe. “They were just like, ‘Man, this can't be true. This guy's a star soccer player in Mexico and he's going to come play with us? Kansas City's soccer players eventually grew tired of holding games and practices on baseball or football fields. They had outgrown park fields with DIY goals. So according to Jim Portuguez Chino Medina and my grandpa arranged a meeting with the mayor of Kansas City, Harold Roe Bartle. Known by his nickname “The Chief,” Bartle loved sports and eventually played a big role in convincing the Dallas Texans football team to move to Kansas City. Medina and Portuguez made the case to Bartle: Their sport was growing, it didn't need a lot of equipment, but they did need soccer fields of their own. No more competing with other sports for space. Plus, soccer was a healthy activity, and good for the kids. “I think that's what got the mayor's interest,” says Jim Portuguez. They got the greenlight to install official soccer fields at city parks like Gilham and Swope with goals and bleachers. To guys like my grandpa, this was a big deal, because it showed these players that they had buy-in from the city. Diaz said that other teams formed in time. Despite their language and cultural differences, these soccer-playing immigrants formed deep connections. “And the Europeans didn't speak English either,” Diaz told me with a laugh. Cris Medina and his siblings remember attending some of those games when they were little. It was a central part of their social lives. That was an all day deal,” Medina recalls. It seems fitting how much of this soccer scene revolved around feeding people, since feeding the greater soccer family was also part of their mission. Their dad Chino Medina later opened the restaurant La Fonda El Taquito, which has become a staple soccer watching joint on Kansas City's Westside. These soccer families hosted out of town teams, had parties afterwards, and went to exhibition matches outside of the city. This was all being organized by working people, some with kids, in their spare time, all for the love of the game. Kansas City has come a long way since then. The Swope Park Soccer Village, managed by Sporting KC, now boasts six full sized fields, constantly bustling with practices and matches. An even larger soccer complex now exists in Overland Park, and more pitches have been built in parks and schools across the metro. Without those critical first pioneers, though, soccer might still have been mostly relegated to backyards or DIY pitches. This episode of A People's History of Kansas City was reported, produced, and mixed by Suzanne Hogan with editing by Mackenzie Martin and Gabe Rosenberg. We'll learn about the sport's ongoing fight for recognition, how women's soccer emerged and then dominated.
