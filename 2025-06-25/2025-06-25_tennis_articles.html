                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis fans will never forget the epic Wimbledon clash between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut, which is still commemorated to this day. The Grand Slam is certain to produce many twists and turns before crowning its champions, but there is one record that simply will never be broken. The pair battled it out on Court 18 at Wimbledon for 11 hours and five minutes, with 23rd seed Isner eventually getting the better of qualifier Mahut. Isner thinks he and Mahut served really well in the epic encounter, which saw both players hit over 100 aces each.

At 6'10”, Isner has unsurprisingly gone down as one of the best servers in the history of both men's and women's tennis.

Jakub Mensik (12.9) and Quentin Halys (12.7) occupy spots three and four respectively, with Halle champion Alexander Bublik (12.2) completing the current top five. The American fired down a phenomenal 14,470 aces from his 772 matches, with Karlovic in second this time with a tally of 13,728 from 694 matches.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reigning French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz is set to compete in the US Open mixed doubles for the first time after the tournament moved it from overlapping with singles to mid-August. The Spanish 22-year-old will compete alongside former US Open winner Emma Raducanu. He called the new format "fun," leading former No. 1-ranked doubles player Kristina Mladenovic to pan him and other singles stars set to feature in the competition. "When you hear Alcaraz or others say they're going to have fun while preparing for the US Open, it's embarrassing," she told Eurosport France. "A Grand Slam is neither preparation nor fun. “In terms of business strategy, it's a brilliant idea. There's no issue with holding such an event, but above all, don't call it a Grand Slam." Alcaraz and Raducanu are not the only stars set to compete. 1 Jannik Sinner will partner with Emma Navarro, while four-time US Open winner Novak Djokovic is set to play with Olga Danilovi. “I'm super excited about it,” Alcaraz explained at Queen's. “I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament.“I will try to bring my doubles skills. Mladenovic is also an accomplished singles player: the two-time Grand Slam quarterfinalist was once ranked as high as tenth in the world. Mladenovic was a 2023 US Open finalist but has not won the competition. Mladenovic is not set to compete in mixed doubles at the 2025 US Open against the likes of Djokovic and Raducanu. "There's no problem putting on such an event, but above all, don't call it a Grand Slam!" Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While winning any Grand Slam is a monumental accomplishment in tennis, winning Wimbledon remains the peak of the sport. Since the tournament started in 1877, it's remained tennis' most prestigious event. When you think of tennis, Wimbledon immediately comes to mind. The 2025 tournament is set to kick off soon, and plenty of the big names will be looking to win it all. On the men's side, Carlos Alcaraz will look to carry his French Open momentum forward. Alcaraz will head into Wimbledon as the No. 2 ranked men's player, behind Jannik Sinner, who Alcaraz defeated to win the French Open. On the women's side, Barbora Krejcikova will look to defend her crown after taking down some tough competition last year. But a number of higher-ranked women will look to prove themselves after disappointing performances at Wimbledon in 2024. Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek both suffered early losses at the tournament. That should give Krejcikova plenty of competition as she looks to repeat. That's fairly standard for the event, which normally begins at the end of June and ends in mid-July. Below is a full schedule for Wimbledon 2025: Sunday, July 6: Fourth round singles play begins Draws have not been completed for Wimbledon 2025 at this time. Both the men's and women's draw will occur Friday, June 27. This section will be updated once draws are completed. Wimbledon seeds will mostly follow the ATP and WTA rankings. Wimbledon already released a seeding announcement for the 2025 tournament ahead of its draw. That's an increase of 11.1 percent compared to last year's prize pool. The total prize pool for 2025 Wimbledon singles players is £38,828,000. Wimbledon 2025 will air on ESPN in the United States. Every match is available to be streamed with ESPN+.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Managing surface upkeep throughout wet and windy winter months and baking hot summer months is a difficult process, resulting in many clubs opting for hard courts, which are easier to manage. World number 17 Jakub Mensik revealed his almost non-existent childhood grass court experience after victory at the Eastbourne Open over Reilly Opelka. Speaking to Tennis TV on Wednesday afternoon, the Czech star was asked how much time he spent playing on grass as a youngster. 👏Jakub Mensik takes down Opelka 7-5 6-3 to advance into the #LexusEastbourneOpen quarter-finals pic.twitter.com/a4Cgwz7br5 He said: “Never, I mean of course right now it's my second season so you know so it's my ninth or tenth match of my career on the grass court so I mean if I'm not counting Juniors' Wimbledon then last year and this year is my first time on the grass. “Like I'm saying last year[‘s] first matches I was feeling on the grass like an elephant on skates. However, his serve was second-best against the Czech star. The 19-year-old served 12 aces to Opelka's 10, while also winning 73 per cent of his first-serve points and 81 per cent of his second-serve points. Aside from his serving performance, Mensik won two of his three break-point opportunities and did not give Opelka a single break-point opportunity during the entire match. It was a performance that put Mensik in good standing, then, ahead of Wimbledon beginning on 30th June.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The fast-rising Brit aims for a career best result at his home Grand Slam.ByPete BodoPublished Jun 25, 2025 copy_link After Jiri Lehecka secured the decisive break point in his bitterly contested semifinal win over Jack Draper last week at Queen's Club, Draper angrily whacked his racquet on a courtside LED advertising screen, disabling a portion of it.This was an uncharacteristic but telling outburst by the 23-year old British star, who later told reporters, “When you try your best and things don't go your way, it's easy to spill over. Sometimes I just play on a bit of a tightrope.”Draper's action underscored that with Wimbledon imminent, that tightrope is stretched thin and high. For Brits, it's like accomplishing that without using supplemental oxygen. As Andy Murray, the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years, said after breaking through: “It's hard.

As Andy Murray, the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years, said after breaking through: “It's hard. Don't be fooled, that stress and pressure that Scotland's Murray cited only diminishes in quality, not kind, for Draper. Since then, Cameron Norrie has been the only British player to make a semifinal (2022).“That spotlight is [always] going to be burning pretty brightly,” Tim Henman, the four-time Wimbledon semifinalist and broadcast analyst from Oxford England, told the BBC in a prescient moment in 2023. “But I definitely think Jack has the capacity mentally, physically and technically to deal with it.”It was an accurate assessment, for Jack Draper's coming of age this year—a process deferred by multiple injuries earlier in his career—has been a pleasure to behold. He has ticked off all the boxes required to be a legitimate Grand Slam contender, something he was not a year ago at this time when he was ranked No. “That spotlight is [always] going to be burning pretty brightly,” Tim Henman, the four-time Wimbledon semifinalist and broadcast analyst from Oxford England, told the BBC in a prescient moment in 2023. “But I definitely think Jack has the capacity mentally, physically and technically to deal with it.”It was an accurate assessment, for Jack Draper's coming of age this year—a process deferred by multiple injuries earlier in his career—has been a pleasure to behold.

He has ticked off all the boxes required to be a legitimate Grand Slam contender, something he was not a year ago at this time when he was ranked No. Since then, Draper has been to a Grand Slam semifinal at the US Open. He's won a Masters 1000 in Indian Wells, defeating in succession Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Carlos Alaraz and Holger Rune. Draper also made a Masters 1000 final on clay in Madrid, and wrapped up a breakthrough season on red dirt with a fourth-round performance at Roland Garros.To top things off, his trip to the semifinals at Queen's earned him the No. 4 ranking and seeding—the last British man placed so high was Murray—a critical achievement that means Draper won't have to play either of the top seeds, Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz, until the semifinal. But there is still this little thing about being British at Wimbledon.Draper has found ways to protect himself from the burden of expectations. He doesn't really pay lip service to the British tabloids, with their desire to whip their readers into a patriotic frenzy. Draper has rarely spoken this year about Wimbledon, let alone conquering it. Earlier in the year he denied having specific goals: “I just feel like I'm living my dream by playing on these stages.”Draper's caution is understandable. He battled significant injuries for roughly two years until about 18 months ago. During the down times, those childhood fantasies about being a big star and winning Wimbledon faded. “A lot of the stuff for me [when I was struggling] was kind of getting my head around the fact that it wasn't going to be I'm going to rock it at Wimbledon and win.” 4 ranking and seeding—the last British man placed so high was Murray—a critical achievement that means Draper won't have to play either of the top seeds, Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz, until the semifinal.

In a discreet moment before the Madrid final, Draper did allow—without mentioning Wimbledon—that the dividend of playing well on clay would give him a lot of confidence going to the faster surfaces that he enjoys more. '”Draper's most obvious skills peg him as a potential force on grass. Draper, like Rafael Nadal, is a natural right-hander who plays left-handed.“It's always been my backhand which has been the shot,” Draper said at Indian Wells. “I can hit with my eyes closed, you know. I really have no problem against any player with their forehand into my backhand.”But for all the benefits derived from a lethal backhand, big serve and wingspan, the main asset of the great Wimbledon champions has been their athleticism.

In Madrid, Draper explained that he was small for his age, so he was “always just scraping around the court” without any big weapon. 4 seed at Wimbledon, he made it sound as if the best was yet to come.“I live and breathe the sport,” he said. It's another step in the right direction.”We'll soon see if Draper can scale Mt. The pressure on Draper in the coming days will be intense, but his self-awareness and measured approach to Wimbledon should be helpful. 4 seed at Wimbledon, he made it sound as if the best was yet to come.“I live and breathe the sport,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roger Federer reveals ‘most exciting thing' about Rafael Nadal farewell “The first one I would like to remember is clear: Wimbledon 2001 and my match against Pete Sampras,” said Federer. “That match was facing the hero of a whole generation, my first time on Wimbledon's centre court, without knowing everything that tournament would bring me in my career. I chased that tournament for a long time, until this season when the floodgates opened with Rafa's elimination. “Finally, I will stick to the 2017 Australian Open final, right after my knee problems. Federer's fourth-round victory over Sampras proved to be his breakthrough match, with a then 19-year-old Federer handing his idol a first defeat at Wimbledon since 1996. The 2009 French Open final victory over Soderling not only saw Federer tie Sampras' then-Open Era record of 14 Grand Slam men's singles titles, but also complete the Career Grand Slam. Roland Garros success had eluded the Swiss up until that point, with Rafael Nadal beating him in three straight finals from 2006 to 2008. Victory over Soderling, who had beaten Nadal earlier in the event, sealed what proved to be the only French Open title of Federer's career. Federer's 2017 Australian Open final over Nadal remains one of the most celebrated Grand Slam finals of recent times, and a key match in his iconic rivalry with the Spaniard. The 20-time Grand Slam champion was the 17th seed in Melbourne, having struggled with injury throughout 2016, and had not won a major title in four-and-a-half years. Nadal had also not won a major for over two years and held a 3-1 lead in the deciding set, before Federer stormed back to win his 18th Grand Slam title, and fifth Australian Open title.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With nine Wimbledon titles to her name, Martina Navratilova knows a thing or two about grass-court tennis. No one in tennis history had a better track record at the All England Club than Martina Navratilova. The synergy between athlete and that living, breathing surface was something to behold. Navratilova won nine Wimbledon singles titles -- one more than Roger Federer -- and 120 matches there, the most of any player at a Grand Slam in the Open Era and eight more than Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros. From 1982 to 1988, she rattled off a sublime 47-match winning streak on those hallowed lawns. Who does she think is built for a deep run on grass this year? Here are the eight players she'll be watching most closely (players with at least five career Wimbledon match-wins) and what she sees as their best path to going deep next week: 2025 on grass: Defeated Elena Rybakina in the Berlin quarterfinals before losing to eventual champion Marketa Vondrousova in the semifinals. Navratilova: Looking at her record, it's hard to think she's not the favorite this year. It's hard to find a weakness or an opening against her. I'm wondering if losing the French Open final will actually help motivate her. I think she finds herself in a good spot. That should pay off for her, and she's flying high after winning the French Open. 2025 on grass: Lost her first match in Berlin to Liudmila Samsonova 7-6 (8), 7-5, 7-6 (5). I would love to see her come forward more often and finish points at net. If the draw is even slightly friendly, she could get to the semis and then she's going to be confident, maybe more aggressive. 2025 on grass: Lost her first match in Berlin to two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur. Navratilova: It was fun to see her run last year, beating Madison Keys and Emma Navarro back-to-back and taking Barbora Krejcikova to three sets in the final. She won Rome and is still a force to be reckoned with. I definitely see her living up to the seeding. 2025 on grass: Reached the semifinals at Queen's Club, losing to eventual champion Tatjana Maria; fell 7-5, 7-6 (6) to Marketa Vondrousova in Berlin. Navratilova: After winning Australia, there's a huge weight off her shoulders. Weapons are what win on grass and she's got them. Forehand is good enough, even though it doesn't pay off as much on the grass as it does on clay. 2025 on grass: Won first two matches Berlin, over wild card Eva Lys and Emma Navarro, before retiring (right hip injury) against Wang. Navratilova: It was tough to watch her struggle with the back injury. It's good to see her relatively healthy again, playing well in Berlin. Three Round of 16s … she's got a game that plays well on grass. Not afraid to go forward and knock off the volley. She's got soft enough hands to hit drop shots and plays really smart, high-percentage tennis. She's not swinging hard, but it's a heavy ball. With nine Wimbledon titles to her name, Martina Navratilova knows a thing or two about grass-court tennis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2 seed Tommy Paul features in his first tournament since Roland Garros, as he battles home favourite Dan Evans at the 2025 ATP Lexus Eastbourne Open on Wednesday. This Round of 16 tie will be the third meeting between these two stars. 13 Tommy Paul was beaten by Argentine Francisco Cerundolo in the Eastbourne International final two years ago. The American is enjoying a high moment in his career of late. However, he is yet to pick up a title in 2025 – and turns to Eastbourne for a change in fortune. READ ALSO: Alejandro Davidovich Fokina vs. James Duckworth Preview, Prediction and Betting Odds for ATP Eastbourne Open 2025 Evans produced a phenomenal display against Kecmanovic in the Round of 32 to improve his 2025 record to 3-3 and book his place in Wednesday's marquee clash. The head-to-head between Tommy Paul and Dan Evans currently stands at 1-1. This will be their first meeting since 2022, when both matches took place. Paul and Evans have faced each other twice on hard courts. However, Paul drew level in this duel when he helped Team USA earn a point in the Davis Cup by beating his lower ranked opponent. Interestingly, there has never been a straight sets finish when these two stars have faced one another. Over time, the American has crafted a potent grass court game for himself. He has reached two finals on this surface, including a title charge at Queen's Club last year. Paul will make full use of the tired legs of Evans that had to endure a three set battle on Monday. With an 85% service game win percentage and 50% break point conversion rate on grass, Tommy Paul is the firm favourite.

Roland Garros surprise package Lois Boisson will not get the chance to emulate her heroics at Wimbledon after seeing her hopes of a first main-draw appearance end abruptly in qualifying. However, Boisson's shock rise to prominence came past the cut-off to enter the Wimbledon main draw, having been ranked outside the top 400 when that deadline rolled around five or so weeks ago. That forced her to go through qualifying, a campaign which ended on Tuesday as she lost 6-2, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4 to Canada's Carlson Branstine. Branstine will face former US champion and compatriot Bianca Andreescu next with two more rounds of qualifying to go. Boisson also gained notoriety in the tennis world this year following comments from Harriet Dart in April, which saw the Brit complain about her smell and say she needs to “wear deodorant” mid-match.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roger Federer hinted that he could be reunited with Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray at Wimbledon, but was left in the dark over whether his rival-turned-friend Rafael Nadal would make the trip to SW19. Federer is considered royalty in south-west London and is given the red-carpet treatment when he returns to the site of his eight Grand Slam titles. Federer sat in the royal box next to Princess Kate in 2023 as he was honoured on Centre Court, before returning the very next year to watch Murray play before his farewell at the All England Club. "I probably will go to Wimbledon, but I don't know if Rafa will be there during the tournament,” he told TNT Sports. Federer also shared that he would likely catch up with Djokovic, as he is scheduled to play at the tournament, while Murray is expected to be in the vicinity also. He also revealed that he is trying to tempt the ‘Big Four' to reunite once again at the Laver Cup, which this year takes place in San Francisco. Federer continued: "Then there is the Laver Cup, another very special week, I will try to recruit them for the occasion. I don't know what other dates we have ahead of us, I'm sure we'll be in touch, although it might be easier for us to coincide on the golf course than on the tennis court." "It was amazing," Federer said about the tribute, when Nadal was surprised with a permanent plaque on Court Philippe-Chatrier with his footprint etched. I have heard him in several interviews talking about how he felt, that makes me very happy. "They were moments of great emotion, gratitude, it was incredible to see his reaction when they showed the plaque with his name on it. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. "For me it was the most exciting thing, that plaque will be there forever, all the players who step on the court will see it, they will surely be inspired and motivated thanks to him.

After battling a string of injuries for much of her young career, Branstine is now building momentum as a top-tier athlete and as a professional signed with two modeling agencies. A post shared by Carson Branstine (@carsonbranstine) Speaking to media at Wimbledon, Branstine opened up about balancing the demands of elite-level tennis with the fashion world. “I love being in front of the camera during a shoot,” she said, as reported by CLAY. It's been one of the reasons I've been able to pay some of my trips…I wasn't signed by these agencies because of my tennis, it was for my look.” Now 24, Branstine has faced more physical setbacks than many of her peers. “I've spent in total over five years injured.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The organization, which was co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2020, has taken out critiques of the tour schedule from players who are not named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, including French Open champions Coco Gauff and Carlos Alcaraz. It has also removed two defendants from a group it characterized as a “cartel” in its initial action, which was filed in London, New York City and Brussels. The men's and women's tours argue that their bylaws require players to settle disputes through arbitration, rather than in court. In May, they and the ITF and ITIA filed a joint motion to dismiss the PTPA as a plaintiff, on the grounds that it cannot orchestrate such an action because it does not have a formal membership. A judge has yet to rule on that motion. The original lawsuit listed 12 player plaintiffs, including co-founder Vasek Pospisil, and Reilly Opelka and Sorana Cirstea, who are active players. Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Djokovic said in a news conference at the Miami Open: “To be quite frank with you, there are things that I agree with in the lawsuit and there are also things that I don't agree with. “I found that maybe some wording was quite strong in there.” The updated complaint, filed in New York Tuesday evening, has changed some wording. Opens — described as “co-conspirators” alongside the defendants' alleged “cartel”. Some of that language is still there, including in the opening salvo: “Professional tennis players are stuck in a rigged game. This is because a cartel of professional tennis tour organizers and tournament operators have conspired to avoid competition amongst themselves and to shut out outside tournaments, affording them complete control over the players' pay and working conditions.” The four Grand Slams will not be named as defendants for at least another 90 days, amid settlement discussions between them and the PTPA, according to a filing lodged this week. The original, which included reference to complaints by Alcaraz, Gauff and five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Świątek, has omitted those complaints. It had used quotes from those players in news conferences and interviews in which they criticized how tennis is scheduled. Since the initial complaint was filed, a group of top-10 ranked male and female players has held meetings with the four Grand Slams to discuss an increased proportion of their revenues being shared with players as prize money. In the past, those leaders have expressed a desire to restructure tennis, creating a streamlined event calendar that revolves around their events and the 1,000-level ATP and WTA events, which are one rung below their tournaments. The discussions between the Grand Slams and PTPA aim to develop a framework for a new structure for professional tennis. That structure would then be circulated to the ATP, WTA, and ITF for their input. The Grand Slams and other governing bodies, however, have been doing this dance since last year, when the Grand Slams presented the tours with a plan for a so-called “premium tour,” with fewer events and a pooling of their lucrative media rights. That plan never went beyond discussions, and earlier this year, the ATP and WTA presented the Grand Slams with their own plan to reform tennis, which the Grand Slams rejected out of hand. The top players, who regularly go deep in those tournaments, have said that they don't receive necessary rest and that the sport's roughly four-week off-season is far too short. They could offer to share more than the roughly 20 percent of their revenues with players by significantly increasing prize money. Major American sports leagues, such as the NBA and NFL, share approximately 50 percent of their revenues with players. Grand Slam prize money typically amounts to between 13 and 18 percent of each tournament's annual revenue, while for ATP and WTA events, that figure rises closer to 25 or 30 percent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu's "coy smile" and "hair-preen gestures" while talking about about her new doubles partner Carlos Alcaraz indicate a romance is brewing courtside, a body language expert says. The victory came after it was announced Alcaraz, also 22, and Raducanu will team up for the revamped US Open mixed doubles event in August. Speaking about her "genuine connection" with the two-time Wimbledon champ did little to quash speculation "there is something going on between them," according to body language expert Judi James. She noted Raducanu's "coy smile" and "hair-preen gestures" during this interview, signs Ms James believes suggest a new tennis love match is on the cards. Speaking to Mail Online, Ms James added Emma appeared to "stall for time" by repeating the interviewer's question about Alcaraz but "the way the coy smile spread across her face as she rattled off their history together" - coupled with the way she played with her hair - was akin to a "fan-girl reaction". Raducanu and Alcaraz's chemistry led to fans chattering about a potential romance. Raducanu gushed in the TV interview at Eastbourne, ahead of her first-round match against Ann Li on Sunday, adding fuel to the fire. And Raducanu's features "softened" and "gaze became evasive" as she reflected on her friendship with the Spanish ace, Ms James continued, also pointing out the Londoner's "pouting and posing" in the interview. But Raducanu has remained coy in the conversations themselves about Alcaraz, firm favourite to win Wimbledon, explaining they became friends at Wimbledon 2021. She said: "He's so nice, very happy, amazing values and just a really positive light to be around. Wimbledon 2021 was the first time I started getting to know him. He was always playing the day before me, I would see him win and then I would have motivation to win and get myself into that position too. It was really cool to go through that tournament together and then I kept going through the US Open, we were staying in touch for the whole time and, yeah, it's nice."</p>
