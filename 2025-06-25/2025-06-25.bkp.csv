            She's set to marry Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos. But who is the pilot and Emmy Award-winning journalist Lauren Sánchez – and how did she go from local news to the edge of space?
    


            Born in New Mexico in 1969 and raised in California, Sánchez studied at El Camino College and later the University of Southern California. According to her alma mater's website, at the time she was known as Wendy Sánchez.
    


            She launched her broadcasting career at KTVK-TV in Phoenix, and went on to appear on the “Extra” news magazine show, co-hosted “Good Day LA,” and served as the original host of the dancing competition series “So You Think You Can Dance.”

            At 40, Sánchez became a licenced helicopter pilot – a pursuit inspired by her father, a flight instructor. In 2016, she founded Black Ops Aviation – the first female-owned aerial film production company. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the company consulted on Christopher Nolan's “Dunkirk.”
    


            “I had my job, I had a career, and then I found a calling,” she told the publication. “I loved entertainment and I loved filming, and so I got to combine all of it.”
    


            The 55-year-old also serves as the vice chair of the Bezos Earth Fund, and is dedicated to “fighting climate change and the protection of nature, as well as early childhood education, programming, and housing support,” according to the fund's website.
    


            In 2025, Sánchez was one of the six female passengers who were launched to the edge of space by Bezos' Blue Origin NS-31 rocket for a brief, 10-minute journey.
    


            She “brought the mission together,” according to Blue Origin, and personally selected her fellow space travelers, who included journalist Gayle King, singer Katy Perry and  research scientist and rape survivor Amanda Nguyen. Sánchez also worked with luxury fashion house Monse to design new flight suits for the mission.

            She said the view from space was not what she expected.
    


            “Earth looked so – it was so quiet,” she said. “And you look at it, and you're like, ‘We're all in this together.'”
    


            Sánchez also authored a children's book, “The Fly Who Flew to Space,” published in English and Spanish in 2024. The book tells a story of a fly named Flynn who travels to space and returns with a newfound commitment to the planet – a narrative Sánchez described to People as “a metaphor for curiosity and the pursuit of dreams.”
    


            She has three children: a son, Nikko, with former NFL player Tony Gonzalez; and son Evan and daughter Ella with ex-husband Patrick Whitesell, an entertainment executive. In a 2023 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Sánchez said she maintains a close relationship with Gonzalez and his wife, describing them as her “best friends.”
    


            Sánchez and Bezos, 61, went public with their relationship in 2019 after Bezos announced his divorce from his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Scott. The pair got engaged in May 2023.
    


            In January, Sánchez accompanied Bezos at US President Donald Trump's second inauguration. During the ceremony, the couple were seated next to Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.

            New York City is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in, a fact that guided many New Yorkers' votes in Tuesday's mayoral primary election.
    


            Like his fellow candidates, Zohran Mamdani has put affordability at the forefront of his campaign. But his ideas, which include rent freezes for households living in rent-stabilized units, free buses and city-run subsidized grocery stores, have made him stand out.
    


            Mamdani, a 33-year-old three-term state assemblyman, is inching closer to seeing his vision come to fruition after fellow front-runner former Gov. Andrew Cuomo conceded the race to him late Tuesday. Still, Cuomo left the door open to running as an independent in November, which incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is also doing.
    


            If Mamdani ultimately wins, some businesses and labor groups will be celebrating while others are bracing for potential economic consequences.
    


            Critics say his proposals could backfire.
    


            Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who served under former President Bill Clinton, said in a post on X Wednesday morning that he was “profoundly alarmed” about the future of the Democratic party and the country by Mamdani's political stances, including his “Trotskyite economic policies.”
    


            He said he hopes Mamdani, “who showed great ability to learn and adapt during his campaign, will continue to evolve,” including by reassuring New Yorkers of his commitment to a “market economy as an American ideal.”
    


            Mamdani's campaign did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            One group, the Partnership for New York City, which represents a group of nearly 300 CEOs, said many of Mamdani's proposals are pipe dreams. (The group does not endorse mayoral candidates.)
    


            The group's CEO, Kathryn Wylde, said Mamdani's proposals to freeze rent for four years for over a million people in affordable housing and raise the corporate tax rate to 11.5% would hurt New Yorkers.

            “When he says, ‘I am going to tax the rich and tax corporations,' that appeals to young people who say, ‘Oh good, that's not me.' But overall, ultimately, they are stuck with rising costs if businesses have to raise their prices because of rising costs,” Wylde told CNN.
    


            Kenny Burgos, president of the New York Apartment Association, a group that primarily represents rent-regulated property owners, said Mamdani's proposed rent freeze could make it harder for landlords to maintain their properties, which are often older.
    


            For existing tenants, their buildings “could completely deteriorate to a point that no one can live in them.” Or they could be forced to allow the city to manage their properties, which Burgos argued could not be done effectively.
    


            The New York Apartment Association, which has backed Cuomo, supports increasing housing vouchers and targeted rent freezes for some households. “But blanket rent freezes are dangerous,” Burgos said.
    


            Mamdani also proposed building 200,000 new affordable housing units funded by the city.
    


            Burgos raised concerns there, too. “I don't know who invests in a property or invests in an area where the administration is proposing to cap your revenue, freeze your investments. I mean, where does this work?”
    


            Mamdani is quick to brush off such critiques.
    


            “It's not complicated: landlords know they can make a lot more money if Andrew Cuomo is in City Hall,” Mamdani said in a post on X this month. “That's why they're going all in.”
    


            The United Auto Workers union said it endorsed Mamdani because of his working-class agenda. The UAW represents 20,000 members in New York City.
    


            UAW president Shawn Fain praised Mamdani for showing up to picket lines and fighting for better wages.
    


            “The working class is done with business as usual,” Fain said in a statement Wednesday night after Mamdani declared victory. “We were proud to be the first union to endorse Zohran because it's time for a political movement that puts the working class first.”
    


            Mamdani's labor platform calls for additional collective bargaining laws with better wages and working conditions across industries, like the current New York City fast food wage law that sets a minimum wage at $16.50 an hour, higher than the state's minimum of $15.50. Mamdani also said he supports a new local law that would bring New York City's minimum wage to $30 an hour by 2030.
    


            The repercussions of that kind of wage hike could be hard to predict. For example, a California law last year raised the state minimum wage for fast-food workers by $4 an hour to $20 an hour. Some research estimates that businesses reduced their payrolls by thousands, turned more to automation and raised prices to afford the wage increase. However, other research did not reach those conclusions, finding only anecdotal evidence of those effects.
    


            Perhaps Mamdani's most well-known proposal calls for building a network of city-run subsidized grocery stores that would be exempt from paying rent or property taxes. He claimed this would increase food availability, especially in neighborhoods where food stores have closed, at manageable prices.
    


            Billionaire John Catsimatidis, whose business, Red Apple Group, owns the grocery store chains Gristedes and D'Agostino, said if Mamdani wins, come November, “I do not want to continue to do business.” This would mean shutting down nearly 30 New York City-based grocery stores and relocating his companies' headquarters to New Jersey, he told CNN.
    


            “We don't want to do business with socialists,” said Catsimatidis, a frequent Republican donor who, along with his wife, contributed over $500,000 to President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign. The two also donated a combined $36,000 to New York's Democratic Attorney General Letitia James.
    


            “Tell our manufacturers to lower prices. If they lower prices, we'll lower prices,” he said, in response to CNN's inquiry regarding how he aims to make food more affordable.
    


            Mamdani's other proposal to potentially bring food costs down goes to the heart of some of New Yorkers' most beloved street grub.
    


            “New York City has a crisis, and it's called halal-flation,” Mamdani said in a campaign video filmed in December with street food vendors, including those selling halal food. The vendors claimed long wait times and caps on the $200 city-issued permits to sell food forced them to rent permits for nearly $20,000 from existing holders.
    


          TikTok post not found.
        


          Post has been removed or is no longer public.
        


            Vendors featured in the video said they would lower food prices if they didn't have to pay so much for permits.
    


            The Street Vendor Project, a New York nonprofit advocacy group that's part of the Urban Justice Center, helped facilitate the video with Mamdani. The group does not endorse mayoral candidates.
    


            “A lot of (the vendors) were like, ‘It's the first time a mayoral candidate jumped in my halal food cart and asked questions like: What are your problems? How can I help if I become mayor?' And it was a really inspiring moment for them,” said Mohamed Attia, managing director of the Street Vendor Project.
    


            In the video, Mamdani said he would support the Street Vendor Reform Package, a set of bills the Street Vendor Project is hoping to pass in the city council that would ensure more city licenses for vendors and give them support from the city's Department of Small Business Services.
    


            Mamdani is the only candidate to announce support for the entire package, according to Attia.

Follow:


            President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, Emil Bove, was pushed to repeatedly deny several accusations of corruption – one made by a whistleblower at the Justice Department – during his confirmation hearing Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
    


            “I am not anybody's henchman,” Bove said. “I'm not an enforcer. I'm a lawyer from a small town, who never expected to be in an arena like this.”
    


            Trump has nominated several of his personal attorneys to top legal posts in his administration, but his nomination of Bove to the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals marks the first time he has selected one of his lawyers to serve on the federal bench.
    


            For the past six months, Bove has served as a high-ranking official in the Justice Department. In that short time, he has proven himself to be a reliable ally for the president and also been embroiled in a series of major controversies – including dropping federal charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams; investigating officials who worked on cases related to January 6, 2021; and pursuing Trump's deportation goals in ways that prompted a whistleblower to allege Bove intended to ignore court orders and mislead federal judges.
    


            Bove testified on Wednesday that the decision to drop charges against Adams was based on a “substantiated” concern “on the weaponization of the criminal justice system” in the case, though he did not elaborate.
    


            He also cited concerns “about the effect” of the prosecution on Adams' ability to govern and campaign.
    


            Sen. Richard Blumenthal lambasted Bove for not further explaining those decisions when pressed during the hearing, including over questions of whether there was an element of quid pro quo in dropping the charges.
    


            “I am absolutely flabbergasted that you would come before this committee and refuse to tell us basic facts about a case that is at the core of the challenges to the appearance of impropriety that should disqualify you,” the Connecticut Democrat said.
    


            “You were virtually the only attorney in the Department of Justice willing to go to court and make a claim that career prosecutors said violated their basic standard of ethics, and the quid pro quo was a nomination to the Court of Appeals,” Blumenthal added.
    


            Bove was also pushed repeatedly to address allegations made in a recent whistleblower complaint reported on Tuesday.
    


            The whistleblower complaint, filed by a recently fired DOJ attorney and sent to members of Congress, alleges that in a meeting in March, Bove “stated that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts ‘f**k you'” and ignore any orders to stop the hasty deportation of migrants to a prison in El Salvador.
    


            During his opening statements and in response to several questions from senators during Wednesday's hearing, Bove continued to deny allegations of wrongdoing.
    


            “I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge,” Bove said.
    


            The hearing Wednesday was the first time Democratic lawmakers had the chance to grill the reclusive Bove on his time at the Justice Department and his work for Trump. If confirmed, Bove would be one of roughly a dozen judges with the power to review federal cases being appealed in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands.

            Despite his involvement in high-profile cases and controversies, Bove has mostly avoided the limelight.
    


            “He has been right there but kind of in the shadows, he doesn't go on TV, he doesn't talk to the press,” a senior Justice Department official told CNN. “He is a brilliant lawyer, he is just an amazing writer, critical thinker … he clerked for two rock star judges, he worked at Sullivan and Cromwell. He is a legit genius lawyer, but nobody knows who he is.”
    


            Bove graduated from Georgetown Law School in 2008 and then went on to spend a decade working as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he focused on international terrorism and narcotics cases.
    


            During that time Bove successfully brought narco-terrorism charges against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in 2020. He also prosecuted Ahmad Khan Rahimi, the man responsible for a 2016 pressure cooker bombing in New York that left 30 people injured. Rahimi was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
    


            A former colleague who worked with Bove describes him as an “a**-kicker … he is whip smart, has a high level of curiosity, is naturally intelligent, and extremely effective.”
    


            “I wouldn't want to be one of his adversaries,” they said.
    


            Bove joined Trump's legal team in 2023 and worked on three of Trump's criminal cases over the span of roughly 18 months. He sat second chair, alongside now-Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, to represent Trump in his New York hush money trial. Trump was ultimately found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in that case, which he is still appealing.
    


            He also worked on Trump's federal criminal cases related to alleged mishandling of classified documents and allegations of interfering with the 2020 election.
    


            Bove's resume has many of the hallmarks of a federal judge, but he has never served on the bench, and it is unclear how he would rule on major issues.
    


            “He is completely empathic and fair – he is very strategic and thoughtful about applying law to the facts. He is a brilliant writer and critical legal thinker. He will make opinions that come out of the third circuit tighter and better,” the senior Justice Department official said.
    


            Just hours after Trump took office, Bove was tapped to assume the powerful position of interim deputy attorney general – the No. 2 job at the Justice Department, which had him running the sprawling agency while Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Blanche were awaiting confirmation.
    


            His brief tenure has earned him many detractors as he tried to reshape the department to align with Trump's vision and clashed with career officials.
    


            One of Bove's first actions at the department was to issue a memo threatening to prosecute state and local officials who resist the administration's federal immigration crackdown.
    


            “The administration had a directive to depoliticize the department. He was met with instant resistance from entrenched bureaucrats who are not accustomed to change,” his former colleague told CNN. “He was there to execute a mission and institute policy – he was not there to make friends.”
    


            He then ordered the firing of eight senior officials and sent a memo demanding information about all current and former employees who had any involvement in January 6 investigations.
    


            The request became a point of contention between the FBI and DOJ, sparking two lawsuits that aimed to stop the collection or release of any such information, saying that its release would put FBI employees in danger.
    


            His most high-profile controversy has been dropping federal corruption charges against Adams.
    


            Adams was charged in September 2024 with five federal charges of bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy and soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals.
    


            In a memo to prosecutors in February, Bove cited two reasons as to why the case should be dropped: It had been tainted by publicity, and it was preventing Adams from doing his job, which included helping Trump with his immigration crackdown.
    


            Federal prosecutors at first rebuffed his demand to drop the case, and some quit in protest, including the interim US Attorney in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, and the acting chief of the public integrity section of the department.
    


            Bove ended up personally arguing for the case to be dismissed. Judge Dale Ho ultimately agreed to do so in April 2025.
    


            Bove's handling of the Adams case has been the focus of many of the objections to his judicial nomination.
    


            Even the conservative The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board wrote Tuesday, “… his recent handling of the case against New York May Eric Adams doesn't inspire confidence.”
    


            Justice Connection, a coalition of former Justice Department officials, released a video on Monday with statements from formal federal prosecutors warning the public of Bove's alleged unlawful practices.
    


            Ryan Crosswell, a federal prosecutor for more than a decade, was one of the lawyers who resigned over the case.
    


            “We don't bring charges or dismiss them based on political loyalties. Emil Bove asked us to base a prosecutorial decision not on the facts, not on the law, but on a political calculation,” Crosswell says in the video.
    


            “He took on a hard job the first five weeks of the administration doing what the president was elected to do,” said the senior Justice Department official. “Whether someone is qualified to be a judge is not determined by what they did over five-to-six-week period of administration.”
    


            Bove has also drawn scrutiny for his approach to executing the president's aggressive goals on immigration.
    


            On Tuesday, Erez Reuveni, the former acting deputy director for the Office of Immigration Litigation, sent a whistleblower letter to members of Congress and independent investigators in the executive branch regarding Bove's alleged conduct.
    


            Reuveni was an immigration attorney who lost his job after working on the case of mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia.
    


            In the wake of these controversies, the Justice Department points to accomplishments that have occurred under Bove's leadership, including securing the transfer of 29 cartel leaders to face charges in the US. Bove was also a part of the Justice Department team that worked with the DEA to execute the largest fentanyl seizure in history.
    


            But his former colleague says Bove's varied experience is what makes him perfect for the federal bench.
    


            “He has seen it from both sides – he has worked in a federal prosecutors' office, he has worked at DOJ, and he worked in the private sector and defended people targeted by the federal government,” they said. “He is attuned to overreach. He is exactly who you would want on federal bench.”

US President Donald Trump has refused to publicly affirm that he would unconditionally defend America's NATO allies in the event that one were to be attacked. He made the remarks on Tuesday en route to the organization's summit in The Hague.

Under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, NATO members must treat an attack against one of them as an attack against them all.

When asked by a reporter if he was committed to Article 5, Trump replied, “Depends on your definition.”

“There are numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right? But I'm committed to being their friend. You know, I've become friends with many of those leaders,” he added.

When asked to clarify his position aboard Air Force One, the president said, “I'm committed to saving lives. I'm committed to life and safety. And I'm going to give you an exact definition when I get there.”

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, for his part, told reporters that he has “no doubt that the US is totally committed to NATO, totally committed to Article 5.” Rutte recently sent a glowing letter to Trump, praising his “decisive action in Iran” and promising “another big success” at the summit in The Hague.

Trump, who has at times spoken disparagingly about the alliance, has long urged members to boost their defense spending. He broke ranks earlier this year by reviving direct talks with Russia and refusing to offer the kind of unconditional support for Ukraine that it enjoyed under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.

The change in American policy prompted European NATO members to consider moving away from reliance on Washington for their defense. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said this week that Europe can't afford to “free ride” on US security any longer. In April, French President Emmanuel Macron stated that Europe must acknowledge it will not be “a geopolitical priority” for the US in the coming years.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Trump slams CNN and NYT for ‘demeaning' strikes on Iran","https://www.rt.com/news/620468-trump-slams-cnn-nyt-iran-strikes/","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 07:20:00 GMT","

US President Donald Trump has lashed out at CNN and The New York Times for reporting that Washington's recent airstrikes on Iran caused only limited damage.

On Tuesday, the two news outlets cited a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) assessment casting into doubt Trump's claims of having dealt a critical blow to Iran's nuclear program. 

“FAKE NEWS CNN, TOGETHER WITH THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES, HAVE TEAMED UP IN AN ATTEMPT TO DEMEAN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MILITARY STRIKES IN HISTORY,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!”

According to CNN, the US strikes on Iran's Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear facilities did not destroy the core components of Tehran's nuclear program and “likely only set it back by months.” 

Two sources told the network that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was not destroyed, and one noted that the centrifuges – which are essential for enriching uranium – were largely “intact.”

The damage at the key nuclear sites was largely restricted to aboveground structures, despite B-2 heavy bombers dropping over a dozen “bunker-buster” bombs during the raid, the report said.

The New York Times reported similar conclusions, claiming that the strikes had sealed off entrances to two of the sites but did not collapse the underground structures. Officials cited in the NYT report said the program had been delayed by less than six months.

Unnamed Israeli officials also told the NYT that they believed Iran maintains small covert enrichment facilities, which could allow it to continue the nuclear program even if its larger sites are hit again.

The recent escalation kicked off on June 13, when Israel launched a series of strikes it said were aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Tehran, which retaliated with strikes of its own, has denied the accusations, insisting its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.

The US later joined the attack, unleashing heavy bombers and Tomahawk missiles on Iran's most fortified facilities, claiming that its sole goal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Both Israel and Iran subsequently proclaimed victory in the conflict. 

A ceasefire was later announced, with Iranian officials signaling that Tehran was open to resuming talks with the US.

The US and Israel spread disinformation about Iran's nuclear program as a pretext for attack, Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia has said.

Speaking at the UN Security Council on Tuesday, the diplomat condemned the strikes on Iranian nuclear sites as illegal under international law and said they had “created a real threat” of radioactive contamination.

Nebenzia noted that the reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which carries out inspections in Iran, serve as proof of “the absence of proliferation risks.”

“We want to emphasize that nowhere in the IAEA reports is there any mention of Iran converting its nuclear stockpiles for undeclared or military purposes,” Nebenzia said.

The IAEA has found no evidence indicating the development of nuclear weapons by Iran. Therefore, all claims by Western delegations to the contrary are falsehoods aimed at audiences either unfamiliar with the reports or lacking competence on the matter.

Nebenzia described the attack on Iran as “yet another attempt to legitimize the use of force outside the framework of the UN Charter.”



IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told Sky News last week that there was no evidence of “any systematic effort” by Iran to manufacture nuclear weapons. He added, however, that the agency had “elements of concern” about Iran's enrichment of uranium to 60%.

During a press conference in New York on Tuesday, Israeli envoy Danny Danon reiterated his government's position that Israeli strikes, which began on June 13, were aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Iran, which denies having a military nuclear program, has condemned the attack as an act of aggression and announced plans to restrict its cooperation with the IAEA.

The US-brokered ceasefire between Iran and Israel took effect on Tuesday and has so far been upheld.

WASHINGTON, June 25. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump expressed displeasure over the reports by CNN and the New York Times that questioned the outcome of the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

""Fake news CNN, together with the failing New York Times, have teamed up in an attempt to demean one of the most successful military strikes in history. The nuclear sites in Iran are completely destroyed!"" he wrote on Truth Social in caps.

CNN reported earlier, citing sources, that the US intelligence community and some Israeli officials believe the US strikes failed to achieve a complete destruction of key components of Tehran's nuclear program. The White House dismissed the assessment as inaccurate.

In the small hours of June 13, Israel started a military operation against Iran, and Tehran retaliated less than 24 hours later. The US entered the fray on the morning of June 22, with its aircraft attacking three Iranian nuclear sites. The following evening, Tehran launched missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US air force base in the Middle East. According to the US, there were no casualties or significant damage.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

ASHGABAT, June 25. /TASS/. As the Doomsday Clock edges ever closer to midnight, Russia is racing to pull the hands back by working to avert nuclear catastrophe, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

""Global security is perhaps the most critical issue today - especially as the infamous Doomsday Clock continues to tick toward midnight,"" Lavrov said during an address to staff, faculty, and students at Turkmenistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Institute of International Relations. ""It is essential to prevent such a scenario, and we are actively engaged in efforts to avert a catastrophe.""

According to Lavrov, discussions about the potential outbreak of World War III have become disturbingly routine, particularly against the backdrop of rising revanchist sentiment in Europe.

""It's become almost commonplace to talk about the possibility of World War III,"" he said. ""That's especially alarming given the resurgence of aggressive, belligerent attitudes across Europe. As if two world wars - and countless smaller conflicts over the centuries - weren't enough for today's EU leaders.""

Lavrov also pointed to what he described as encouraging developments in global politics.

""There are, however, some positive trends,"" he noted. ""One of them is the emphasis on realism and common sense expressed by the Trump administration, which bases its foreign policy on national interests - both of the United States and of other sovereign nations.""

""That's a key difference from the previous Biden administration, which was entirely consumed by a neoliberal, hegemonic agenda,"" the minister concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

HONG KONG, June 25. /TASS/. Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro in July, the South China Morning Post reported, citing officials familiar with the matter.

According to the newspaper, Beijing informed the Brazilian government that the Chinese delegation to the summit will be led by Prime Minister Li Qiang.

President calls intelligence ‘inconclusive', while defence secretary describes harm to facilities as ‘moderate to severe'

Donald Trump and the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, have admitted to some doubt over the scale of the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear sites by the US bombing at the weekend, after a leaked Pentagon assessment said the Iranian programme had been set back by only a few months.

“The intelligence was very inconclusive,” Trump told journalists at a Nato summit in The Hague, introducing an element of uncertainty for the first time after several days of emphatic declarations that the destruction had been total. “The intelligence says we don't know. It could've been very severe. That's what the intelligence suggests.”

The president then appeared to revert to his claim that “it was very severe. There was obliteration”. Later in the day, he claimed that was the conclusion from “collected intelligence”, and that the Iranian programme had been set back “decades”.

Trump also likened the US use of massive bunker-buster bombs on the Fordow and Natanz uranium enrichment sites to the impact of the US nuclear weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the second world war, using the comparison specifically in reference to their impact in ending a conflict.

Over the course of the day, Trump's claims became more far-reaching, even rejecting reports from the nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), that Iran's 400kg stock of 60% enriched uranium could no longer be accounted for, and appeared to have been moved. Earlier in the week, the vice president, JD Vance, had appeared to admit the US did not know where the highly enriched uranium was, and said it would be a subject of discussions with the Iranians.

Trump claimed there would be a US-Iran meeting next week to negotiate once more about Tehran's nuclear programme. “We're going to talk to them next week with Iran, we may sign an agreement, I don't know,” he said, before adding: “I don't care if I have an agreement or not.”

Trump was also markedly less confident on Wednesday about the ceasefire he had previous declared was “unlimited” and “going to go forever”, even suggesting that a return to conflict could be imminent.

“I dealt with both and they're both tired, exhausted … and can it start again? I guess someday, it can. It could maybe start soon,” he said.

Accompanying Trump to the summit, Hegseth also seemed to downgrade his earlier declaration that Iran's ability to make nuclear weapons in the future had been “obliterated”.

On Wednesday the defence secretary described the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities by US and Israeli bombing as “moderate to severe”. He pledged there would be an FBI investigation of Pentagon leaks, but also claimed the leaked information was false.

Meanwhile the Israeli military said it was still trying to assess the damage inflicted by the bombing campaign, but a senior officer insisted: “We pushed them years backward.”

A statement issued on behalf of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC), said the strikes had destroyed Fordow's “critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable”. It added that the combined US and Israeli strikes “set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years”.

On Tuesday night CNN reported on a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) initial assessment, which tentatively concluded that the deeply buried Fordow site and the underground facilities at Natanz had not been destroyed, and key components of the nuclear programme, including centrifuges, were capable of being restarted within months.

The CNN account of the leak was independently confirmed as accurate by the Guardian and other outlets. The Washington Post noted that it was categorised as “low-confidence”, though a source told the Guardian that further analysis could find even less damage than the initial DIA estimate.

The DIA assessment also found that much of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, which would provide the fuel for making any future nuclear warhead, had been moved before the strikes and may have been moved to other secret nuclear sites maintained by Iran.

For several years, a new facility has been excavated under a mountain, just to the south of the original Natanz facility.

Providing an Israeli perspective on Wednesday, the IDF spokesperson Brig Gen Effie Defrin said the results of the air force's bombing sorties had been “even better than we expected”.

“I can say right now that the estimate is that we struck a significant blow to [Iran's] nuclear infrastructure,” Defrin said. “I can say that we pushed them years backward.”

CNN reported that Israeli intelligence estimates of the setback inflicted on Iran's nuclear aspirations were two years.

The IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, rejected what he described as an “hourglass approach” involving different assessments of how many months or years it would take Iran to rebuild, arguing it distracted from finding a long-term solution to an issue that had not been resolved.

“In any case, the technological knowledge is there and the industrial capacity is there. That, no one can deny. So we need to work together with them,” Grossi said, adding that his priority was the return of IAEA inspectors to the nuclear sites, the only way he said they could be properly assessed.

Nuclear experts described the development as a potential disaster for nonproliferation efforts, and warned of the dangers of Iran deciding to eject the remaining IAEA inspectors in the country and leave the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The treaty obliges Iran and other non-nuclear weapon countries to refrain from any efforts to make a bomb, and to undergo monitoring and verification.

Hamas militants plant bomb on Israeli military vehicle in Khan Younis, causing it to catch fire

Middle East crisis – live updates

Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in a Hamas attack in the southern Gaza Strip, the Israeli military said on Wednesday, one of the deadliest incidents for the force in months. Meanwhile, Israeli attacks have killed 74 people in the Palestinian territory over the past 24 hours, according to local health authorities.

The seven Israeli soldiers, in the 605th combat engineering battalion, were killed on Tuesday after militants planted a bomb on their vehicle while they were driving in Khan Younis, causing it to catch fire. Hamas later claimed responsibility for the attack.

“Rescue forces and helicopters were dispatched to the scene and made attempts to extract the soldiers but were unsuccessful,” said Brig Gen Effie Defrin, an Israeli army spokesperson, on Wednesday. He added that the 605th battalion was finding and demolishing tunnels, as well as killing militants, in Khan Younis.

Their deaths brought the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in Gaza since 7 October 2023 to 879.

More than 56,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Gaza by Israel, according to the health ministry, since the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.

At least 40 Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza were shot by Israeli forces on Tuesday, local medics and officials said.

The incident comes as Israel ends its war with Iran, agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire on Tuesday.

Fighting started anew in Gaza in March, when Israel restarted its war after refusing to move to a second phase of a ceasefire, which could have led to a more permanent truce. Since then, negotiations for a second ceasefire have borne little progress, with Hamas insisting on a total end to the war in Gaza – a demand Israel has rejected.

Since March, humanitarian conditions in the beleaguered strip have deteriorated. Famine-like conditions reign after Israel imposed a nearly two-month siege on any humanitarian aid into the country. Unicef warned last week that 60% of water production facilities in Gaza were not functioning and that there was a 50% increase in acute child malnutrition from April to May.

More than 500 people have been shot dead by Israeli forces as they travelled to get food from a new US- and Israel-backed private organisation called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

Chaos has reigned as hungry Palestinians have had to walk miles and navigate the complicated rules that the GHF and Israel have imposed to access food, with almost daily scenes of Israeli soldiers shooting dozens of people at the sites.

The GHF has been condemned as potentially being complicit in war crimes, for what aid groups have alleged are its violations of the principles of neutrality and independence, pillars of humanitarian work.

On Wednesday, the US president, Donald Trump, said that US strikes on Iran – which targeted three nuclear facilities – could help lead to a breakthrough on Gaza ceasefire negotiations.

“I think great progress is being made on Gaza. Because of the attack that we made, I think we're going to have some very good news. I think that it helped a little bit, it showed a lot of power,” Trump said at a press conference at a Nato summit in the Netherlands.

There have been calls within Israel for a Gaza ceasefire, with Israeli officials and media figures urging the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to end the war. Moshe Gafni, a member of the Israeli Knesset and head of the United Torah Judaism alliance, criticised the continuation of the war in an interview on Wednesday.

“I don't understand at this moment [why we are still fighting there]. I don't understand what the need is … We need some kind of Trump here with us to say: ‘OK, that's it!'” Gafni said.

More rightwing members of the Israeli government have rejected calls for a ceasefire, with the extremist finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, saying on Wednesday that the Israeli military could defeat Hamas in Gaza within two months.

Israel has said that its aim is to return the remaining 50 hostages held in Gaza, 30 of whom are presumed dead.

The last US ceasefire draft involved a 60-day pause in fighting, and redoubled efforts towards long-term peace, as well as the release of half of the living hostages and half of the deceased. Hamas previously proposed releasing fewer hostages as well as including a permanent end to the war in the ceasefire agreement.

On Tuesday, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released a statement calling for the ceasefire with Iran to be expanded to Gaza.

“We call on the government to engage in urgent negotiations that will bring home all of the hostages and end the war. Those who can achieve a ceasefire with Iran can also end the war in Gaza,” the forum said in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwan, widely considered one of the world's most targeted democracies for foreign disinformation, made headlines last week as it was tapped to lead a new coalition formed by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). Convening policymakers and industry experts, the Artificial Intelligence Advisory Group on Elections (AI AGE) will build bridges between democratic governance and AI expertise to address the challenges and opportunities that AI presents in the conduct of free and fair elections.

Taiwan's invitation was no courtesy. On the contrary, it has become a laboratory for democratic resilience in the AI age. At a time when those in the pay of authoritarian regimes look to undermine our elections through increasingly sophisticated disinformation campaigns, Taiwan's playbook is seen as not just effective, but essential.

THE WORLD IS TAKING NOTE

As its peers scramble to address the risks posed by AI, Taiwan has become a sought-after voice in global AI governance. In effect, it has already lived the future others fear, emerging stronger on the other side of AI-fueled disinformation by harnessing the technology's potential.

Leading the charge is Taiwan's Cyber Ambassador Audrey Tang (唐鳳), who served as Taiwan's first digital affairs minister. A headliner at Munich's Cyber Security Conference and last month's AI Expo for National Competitiveness in Washington, Tang's calendar is but one indicator of the importance of Taiwan's latest key export: its model for digital democracy.

Its invitation to AI AGE offers Taiwan a chance to impart its hard-won lessons, presenting more than 145 countries advised by IFES (including the US) with opportunities to adopt its best practices. The group's only member from East Asia, Tang's remarks at its unveiling emphasized that Taiwan's inclusion was a reflection of the world's growing appreciation for its government's approach to AI. It is “crucial that AI is trained to serve the greater good, while unlocking our collective wisdom and building a more accountable and participatory digital society,” Tang said.

Out of necessity, Taiwan has devised tools that other democracies have not: building a bulwark that its friends would be wise to adapt before it is too late.

A PLAYBOOK FORGED BY NECCESSITY

Almost thirty years after Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996, new technologies have only emboldened the People's Republic of China's (PRC) attempts to dismantle the island's democracy. Its “three warfares” strategy (三戰) of public opinion warfare, psychological warfare and legal warfare has been adapted to prioritize the use of generative AI (genAI), introducing a more disruptive threat than any of its predecessors. Where traditional models only analyze basic data, genAI is capable of creating original, persuasive content on a massive scale. This makes China's latest efforts harder to detect and its propaganda far easier to weaponize.

Cyberattacks against Taiwan already posed a significant problem, soaring thirty-fold ahead of the 2024 election, according to one estimate from Cloudflare. Add genAI to the mix, and the threat level skyrockets. A report by Taiwan's National Security Bureau in April revealed it had detected a 60 percent spike in falsified content distributed by China using genAI's capabilities, from 1.33 million items in 2023 to 2.16 million in 2024. Countless fake social media posts, articles, newscasts and even entire books flooded Taiwan's information ecosystem, with dummy profiles distributing baseless accusations questioning the election's integrity alongside pro-China and anti-democratic sentiments. The Taiwan FactCheck Center has cataloged a whole host of AI-generated videos intended to cast doubt on the process and its outcomes, including fabricated footage of local politicians and fraudulent images of Xi Jinping commenting on Taiwan's elections.

MEETING THE MOMENT

The attention paid to the Taiwanese model not only affirms its innovation but also strengthens Taiwan's international standing despite Beijing's attempts to isolate it. Its leadership has taken its self-defense seriously, acting quickly but consciously to meet the AI moment.

Its tactics are anchored in its core mission, per Tang, to co-govern AI with the people. This ethos has been the guidepost for Taiwan's rapid-response initiatives and inspired its blueprint for civic fact-checking, all without compromising its citizens' ability to exercise their civil rights. This is significant considering the Taiwanese model employs much of the same tech being leveraged against it by autocrats.

Take Taiwan's rapid response practices. The Ministry of Education's False Information Prevention Project implemented curriculum guidelines that equip students with the ability to “pre-bunk” online hoaxes, teaching them to spot and flag fake news. Meanwhile, each of the government's ministries targets attacks en masse, with engineering teams responding to falsehoods in as quickly as 60 minutes with countervailing narratives. Alongside individual pre-bunking, these officials work to meet their fellow citizens where they are: using AI to their advantage as they share up-to-the-minute graphics, short videos and host livestreams to inoculate the public against disinformation.

Then, there is Taiwan's civic fact-checking infrastructure. As journalist Elaine Chan said in The Guardian last year, a community of external validators have stepped up to assist the government in its fight for the truth. Groups like the Taiwan FactCheck Center and DoubleThink Lab provide citizens with access to needed tools in the pre-bunking phase. China's operations are formidable, requiring a sizable amount of computing power to counteract. These organizations help meet that need, their presence in turn easing fears of government overreach. One tool, MyGoPen, shows us how AI can be used in election protection, offering access to a LINE account with one-on-one live fact-checking services. Its founder, Charles Yeh (葉子揚), says that AI “speeds up the checking process — helps with comparison, identification and translation,” drawing on an extensive disinformation database collected by the group. But verification of claims still happens manually; a feat considering its agents were handling up to 3,000 claims a day in the lead-up to election day.

Thanks to their efforts, Taiwan's elections passed without any major incident. But AI's faculties will continue to evolve and democracies must be prepared going forward.

A ROUTE FORWARD

A playbook can be shared or shelved, its routes run or its game plan sidelined. Taiwan's inclusion in AI AGE and in countless future forums shows us, however, that the world's democrats cannot ignore what Vice President Hsiao Bi-Khim (蕭美琴) has come to call “the AI Island.”

While the kind of sabotage Taiwan faces is distinct and the tech's full potential has yet to be fully realized, it will advance. Innovators and benefactors, famous and infamous, will continue to fuel the rise of the AI industrial complex. But if the world is serious about securing the future of democracy in the internet age, Taiwan's resilience must become the norm, not the exception.

Chelsea on Tuesday beat Esperance of Tunisia 3-0 to set up a FIFA Club World Cup last-16 tie against SL Benfica, who earlier defeated Bayern Munich 1-0, as furnace-link heat and the threat of thunder and lightning wreak havoc at the tournament.

Elsewhere, minnows Auckland City claimed a memorable draw against Boca Juniors, while Los Angeles bowed out of the tournament with a stalemate against Flamengo.

In Charlotte, Andreas Schjelderup scored the only goal for Benfica in their Group C clash with Bayern in front of 33,287 fans, finishing first-time from a cutback by his fellow Norwegian Fredrik Aursnes in the 13th minute.

The German champions, who left the likes of Harry Kane and Michael Olise on the bench at kickoff, were unable to come back in sweltering afternoon conditions in heat wave-hit North Carolina.

It was Benfica's first win in 14 competitive meetings with Bayern and it meant they finished first and would next play Group D runners-up Chelsea in Charlotte in the last-16 on Saturday.

Bayern finished second and so are on Sunday to go to Miami to take on Brazilian giants Flamengo, with a potential quarter-final against European champions Paris Saint-Germain awaiting.

“You could see that it was really tough conditions, so respect to both teams for that,” Bayern coach Vincent Kompany said.

Boca's 1-1 draw against Auckland became the fifth match of the tournament to experience a lengthy delay due to public safety regulations used in the US that mandate play is halted whenever lightning is within 16.1km of a stadium.

Play stopped for almost an hour. When the action restarted, not a drop of rain had fallen at Geodis Park.

Chelsea eased through to their meeting with Benfica with a clinical 3-0 win over Esperance at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.

Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca on Monday cut short his team's training session, as the City of Brotherly Love baked in temperatures of 37.2°C.

Flamengo, who had already assured themselves the top spot in the section after wins over Chelsea and Esperance, wrapped up their first-round campaign with a 1-1 draw against already eliminated Los Angeles in Orlando, Florida.

With a brutal heat wave blanketing swathes of the eastern US, adapting to the weather has become a key focus for coaches and players.

Borussia Dortmund took the unusual step of leaving their substitutes in the dressing room for the first half of their game against Mamelodi Sundowns in Cincinnati on Sunday, rather than have them sitting on the bench in blazing sunshine.

Dortmund coach Niko Kovac said the weather could ultimately shape the destiny of the tournament.

“I think that this tournament will be decided not by the best team, but the team that can adapt to these weather conditions the best. They will probably win this tournament,” he said.

While cooling breaks midway through each half have become standard during the tournament, Dortmund, like other teams, are taking extra steps to mitigate the heat and humidity.

“Our boys are very well taken care of by our doctors and the medical staff,” Kovac said. “We have very cold towels. We put them in ice baths. The boys also need to cool down their legs and their feet in cold water and ice baths.”

The experience of the Club World Cup is likely a preview of what can be expected at next year's men's FIFA World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico.

Ukraine's security service (SBU) has charged in absentia a former defense engineer with treason, accusing him of helping Russia target Ukrainian cities by developing navigation systems for cruise and ballistic missiles, the SBU said on June 25.

According to the agency, Oleh Borsuk, a 61-year-old Ukrainian national, fled to Russia in 2009 after resigning from a defense plant in Cherkasy Oblast. He later became deputy general director of Moscow-based design bureau ""Navis,"" a major player in Russia's military-industrial complex.

Borsuk allegedly oversaw the development and modernization of satellite guidance systems (GPS/GLONASS) used in Russian missiles. In 2023 alone, under his leadership, nearly 3,200 satellite navigation units were produced, including those for Iskander tactical missile systems, the SBU said.

These systems are also used in missiles like the Kh-101, Kh-59, and Kalibr — weapons frequently deployed in Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.

The deadliest attacks include the July 8, 2024, strike on the Okhmatdyt children hospital in Kyiv, which killed two adults, including a doctor, and injured more than 50 people, including children. The hospital was hit by a Kh-101 cruise missile in accordance with a programmed route.

Another devastating strike occurred on June 17, when a massive missile and drone assault on Kyiv killed 30 people and injured 172 others. One of the deadliest impacts was a direct hit on a residential building by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, which caused the complete collapse of an entire section of the nine-story residential building. 

According to a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force Yurii Ihnat, the building was struck by a Kh-101 missile.

The SBU has charged Borsuk in absentia under Ukraine's Criminal Code for treason committed under martial law. 

""Since the perpetrator is hiding in the territory of the Russian Federation, comprehensive measures are underway to bring him to justice for crimes against our state,"" the SBU said.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 300 others, local officials reported.

Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak said the morning strike ignited a large fire and also damaged a dormitory, a gymnasium, and an administrative building in the city.

The Russian military also struck the nearby town of Samarske, Lysak said. Casualties were reported in both locations. 

""Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded everywhere,"" he said.  

In Samarske, two people were killed, and 14 injured. Eight were hospitalized, with half of them in critical condition.

""As of now, more than 160 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, 11 people have died,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media, adding: ""The rubble is still being cleared, so the death toll may, unfortunately, increase.""

Around 1:30 p.m. local time on June 25, Lysak reported that the death toll in Dnipro rose to 19 and that more than 300 people were injured in the attack.

Almost a hundred of the victims remain in hospital, according to Lysak.

Ukraine's national railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, said that a train traveling from Odesa to Zaporizhzhia was damaged in the attack. 

""Ukrzaliznytsia is preparing a replacement train in Dnipro to evacuate passengers to Zaporizhzhia,"" the company said in a statement.

In an update, Ukrzaliznytsia said no passengers or railway workers were killed in the attack, though several people sustained injuries and are receiving medical care.

The attack came as NATO leaders convened for a high-level summit in The Hague. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on June 23 that Russia remains the alliance's most immediate and long-term threat.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday used a profanity to criticize both Iran and Israel for what he said were violations of a ceasefire between the two adversaries.

Reuters

The sportswriter Bill Simmons coined the phrase “the Tyson Zone” to describe the rarified state of being – named after Mike Tyson – in which a celebrity's behaviour becomes so unglued that nothing you hear about them seems impossible anymore. It was almost 20 years ago in his ESPN column that he originated the idea, but Donald Trump was a little later in discovering the powerful sorcery of occupying the Tyson Zone in politics.

He does and says whatever he wants to such extremes that none of it shocks or even matters anymore. The more outrageous his actions, the more he expands the comfy cocoon of the Tyson Zone around himself.

And yet, somehow, the F-word was a new bridge to cross. This he hadn't done before; this was a surprise. There was something in this reaction that mattered. 

How Trump's Israel-Iran ceasefire agreement came together in a chaotic 48 hours

Trump pivots from budget bill to big, beautiful Middle East settlement

On Tuesday as he prepared to leave for a NATO summit in the Netherlands, Mr. Trump faced a barrage of questions about the ceasefire he had declared the previous night between Israel and Iran, which had been breached immediately and explosively. 

“We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” Mr. Trump snarled, physically leaning into the end of the sentence. He finished by barking “Do you understand that?” at the reporters crowding around, before stalking away to his helicopter. 

It read like a true temper tantrum: naked, overwhelmed, a bubbling over of the insides. 

On one hand, Mr. Trump may have been simply expressing intense frustration about a long-running conflict that is intractable, destructive, bloody and, yes, incredibly frustrating on a geopolitical scale. 

There appeared to be an element of aggrieved surprise, as though he had thought he could quell a roiling sea just by saying so. He didn't seem to have accounted for 75 years of conflict in the Middle East, burning even hotter in the past few years, and still more in the past couple of weeks. 

But Mr. Trump's reaction to the world around him – particularly his most energetic responses – are never about the world, but rather about the centre of the universe: Donald J. Trump. What we saw on Tuesday was the President discovering in real time that some forces in the world will not be bent to his will, no matter how badly he wants to claim a big win. 

Around 1 a.m. ET on Monday, Mr. Trump posted on his social-media network, Truth Social, “THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!” The prim, limp politeness of that was overshadowed in strangeness only by the way he signed it, like an official, enforceable order, “DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!” 

By the time day broke in Washington, the ceasefire had been breached and Israel and Iran were each blaming the other. During the same press gaggle in which he launched that expletive, the President said he “didn't like the fact that Israel unloaded right after we made the deal.”

Mr. Trump thinks of himself as the consummate dealmaker. And here he was trying to broker the biggest deal imaginable – what could be more consequential or difficult, after all, than peace in the Middle East – and the whole world could see it failing.

It's plain that Mr. Trump sees the ability to end conflicts as a demonstration of authority and negotiating prowess. He has repeatedly asserted that Russia's invasion of Ukraine would not have happened on his watch, and in the last several days, he's taken to listing off all the accomplishments for which he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. 

On Monday, a Ukrainian parliamentarian who had nominated Mr. Trump for the Nobel for brokering negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv withdrew the nomination. Then a Republican congressman stepped in on Tuesday to nominate him for the hours-old ceasefire.

Re-posting that nomination letter was among the manic blizzard of social-media activity Mr. Trump mashed out aboard Air Force One as it hummed toward The Hague, following his meltdown on the White House lawn. He posted a praise-filled message from the NATO Secretary-General, he wrote a long tirade that combined the alleged stupidity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a flex about his own cognitive testing, and he shared multiple posts about his approval ratings and various brownnosers declaring he should win the Nobel Peace Prize. 

In the decade that he's dominated world news, Mr. Trump has said and done so many things that breach unthinkable boundaries that it's not even worth trying to count them. But he's never dropped an F-word before.

Consider how many times the President – who grew up as a boy with a rich and ruthless father who paved New York City for him, before he became a rich and ruthless man himself – has been told “no” in his life. How often has he not gotten something he really wanted? How many times in the past 10 years? (Once at least, in November, 2020, and we know how that went.) How many times since election night last fall?

Later in the day on Tuesday, Iran and Israel confirmed the ceasefire, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pronounced that “Donald Trump is the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.” By the time he gaggled with reporters aboard his plane, Mr. Trump seemed to be feeling more optimistic and in control. 

“Israel, as you know, turned back. They didn't do that raid this morning,” he said. He added, “So the ceasefire is very much in effect and I think we're going to keep it there for a very long time.”

Now, the President figured he was on his way to NATO to “solve a new set of problems.“ He answered more questions, and then when he'd had enough, he turned away from the reporters to walk back to his private section of the plane.

“Do you think you'll get the Nobel Peace Prize now, sir?” a reporter called after him.

Mr. Trump mustn't have heard her, because he didn't turn back.

Janetta McKenzie is director of the Pembina Institute's oil and gas program.

As Canada's new federal government settles in, we're hearing a repeated commitment to Canada becoming a world-leading “energy superpower.”

In this moment of Canadian unity, as we grapple with challenging trade and sovereignty dynamics with the United States, what should it mean?

In the past, building more fossil-fuel infrastructure – in particular, pipelines – was an obvious choice, because everything was fossil-fuel-powered, and it seemed like it always would be. But now, Canadian decision-makers – laser-focused on enhancing our economic resilience and energy security – must look at global trends and make a call.

The oil-and-gas sector faces a sustained decline, with global demand for oil set to peak in the 2030s, if not sooner. Even demand for LNG is looking increasingly uncertain, with the majority of B.C.'s proposed LNG terminals set to come online in an oversaturated market full of low-cost competitors.

Then there's whether oil and gas build-out benefits Canadians in the ways we've been told. When oil and gas profits skyrocketed as the pandemic subsided, new investment and jobs didn't. Instead, companies increased the returns to shareholders.

What if we thought about how to position our economy for long-term economic prosperity and energy security by investing in the best bets, given global energy trends?

Opinion: Canada can help its allies ditch their dependence on Russian energy

Opinion: To be an energy superpower, Canada must set aside flawed green ideology

In 2025, global investment in clean energy is set to double that of fossil fuels once again, $2.2-trillion to $1.1-trillion. In 2024, investment in low-carbon solutions – such as electrified transport and renewables – grew by 11 per cent, hitting a record $2.1-trillion. All of these trends are driven by dramatic declines in the costs of new power generation and electrification technology.

The global transition to clean energy is accelerating. Becoming an “energy superpower” means equipping ourselves to lead in that world.

Building out a clean, modernized electricity grid – removing barriers to interprovincial electricity transmission, and implementing a predictable regulatory system that favours sustainable development – would enhance our domestic energy security, allowing provinces like Ontario and Quebec to generate more of their own power.

That abundance of low-emitting power would also show the world that Canada is ready for business. As the U.S. pauses its offshore wind approvals, for example, Canada could be ready to provide the clean power that emerging and existing sectors need. Alberta, whose oil and gas sector is vulnerable to trade disruptions with the U.S., could benefit from removing barriers currently throttling investment in local renewable power, too.

Building more fossil-fuel infrastructure used to be an obvious choice, but now Canadian decision-makers must look at global trends and make a call.Dan Riedlhuber/Reuters

In 2025, an “energy superpower” does not invest taxpayer dollars or slacken regulatory guardrails to build new fossil-fuel infrastructure. Some fossil-fuel projects, such as cross-country pipelines, would cost tens of billions and take a decade to build. No private-sector company has put their hand up to take on this type of infrastructure.

This doesn't mean we stop oil and gas production. But it does mean addressing the elephant in the room: Oil and gas producers are responsible for about one-third of Canada's national emissions for 5 per cent of GDP. Oil sands production is incredibly emissions-intensive, and those emissions continue to grow. In 2023, the oil sands alone emitted 80 per cent more emissions than Canada's entire electricity system.

Last month in Calgary, Canada's Energy and Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson claimed, “Every barrel of responsibly produced Canadian oil and every kilowatt of clean Canadian power can displace less clean, riskier energy elsewhere in the world.”

But can Canada claim to be a “responsible” oil and gas producer if the industry isn't fulfilling its commitments to responsible production? This means reducing emissions, and quickly. But despite years of announcements, companies have not meaningfully invested in decarbonization absent policy requiring them to do so — despite millions of taxpayer dollars on the table for carbon-capture projects.

We clearly need an efficient and effective industrial regulatory regime, despite calls from industry to deregulate.

Let's remember why regulation exists: to ensure stable, responsible and predictable energy development with as few negative impacts as possible; to ensure Indigenous communities are fully empowered in any development on their land; and to ensure project proponents produce enough benefits for Canadians to offset the environmental and social impacts of their operations.

If fast-tracking select industrial projects — as the federal government intends, and as B.C. is doing with 18 energy and mining projects — there's an opportunity to improve our regulatory effectiveness. But red-tape reduction for its own sake would lead to new fossil fuel infrastructure built with lax environmental standards and inadequate constraints on pollution, and at high risk of becoming stranded assets in a declining global marketplace.

Good morning. Another monthly inflation report shows Canadian prices behaving relatively well, with no sign yet of the inflation time bomb that economists warned us about, either here or in the U.S. Now U.S. President Donald Trump is taking a victory lap, saying the tariff doomsayers are wrong. Did Trump outsmart them all? More on that below. But first: 

Tech: The federal Minister of Artificial Intelligence said it is an “urgent issue” for Canada to build large AI companies. 

More tech: Canada's tech industry is gearing up for a big boost in defence spending. 

Banking: Equitable Bank chief executive officer Andrew Moor – who built Canada's largest challenger to the Big Six banks – died unexpectedly over the weekend at the age of 65.

Economists were nearly unanimous that Trump's trade war would reignite inflation. The only open question was by how much. But here we are, nearly six months into the hostilities, and runaway inflation has yet to take hold.

The consumer price index rose by 1.7 per cent year over year in May, according to Statistics Canada numbers released on Tuesday. That's now 17 consecutive months that Canadian inflation has remained in the Bank of Canada's control band of 1 per cent to 3 per cent.

There are some caveats here. The removal of the carbon tax in April is helping make the numbers look good. And core inflation, which strips out volatile categories such as food and energy, is still too high for the Bank of Canada's liking.

But there are no major red flags. Price pressures appear steady, if not easing. Certainly not spinning out of control. Same with the U.S. economy. The Trump administration has been hammering on this point in recent days, claiming that tariffs are not inflationary and ridiculing anyone who thinks otherwise.

“I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over,” Trump fumed on social media about Powell's testimony to Congress on the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates. “We will be paying for his incompetence for many years to come.”

We have seen the economic establishment get it very wrong on inflation before, including in 2021-2022, just before the worst shock to consumer prices in a half-century. Perhaps they missed the mark again. To help cut through the fog on inflation, I spoke to Globe and Mail economics reporter Mark Rendell.

Mark, why haven't we seen the feared inflationary surge?

There are a couple things going on. Companies in both Canada and the U.S. rushed to get goods across the border in late 2024 and early 2025 to beat the tariffs and counter-tariffs. Many are still working through those stockpiles, so it could take several more months for tariffs to directly show up in consumer prices. Companies may also be eating increased costs in the near-term to maintain market share in the hope that Carney and Trump can reach some sort of deal to remove tariffs. 

Canada seems to have quietly put most of its counter-tariffs on U.S. imports on hold. Is that helping keep prices down?

Counter-tariffs were always intended to be targeted measures, aimed at politically sensitive goods for which there were alternatives in Canada. Then over the past two months, Ottawa introduced a number of carveouts, which removed tariffs on inputs from the U.S. that are used in Canadian manufacturing and tariffs on American automobiles. 

There has been plenty of debate among economists and politicians about how much these carve outs have weakened Canada's counter-tariff regime. But there's little doubt it has dampened some of the inflationary pressures that we would otherwise see. 

Do you think there are some demand-side effects keeping inflation contained? 

That's the million-dollar question the Bank of Canada is trying to figure out. There's no doubt that tariffs put upward pressure on inflation in the near-term. But if they frighten consumers, put a chill on business investment and push up unemployment, then presumably this will weigh on inflation over time. 

So far retail sales data in Canada have held up fairly well, and GDP came in stronger than expected in the first quarter. But forward-looking indicators suggest a slowdown is in the pipeline. All eyes are on the April GDP numbers, which will be published on Friday. 

U.S. inflation is muted even with an effective tariff rate of around 15 per cent. Is it possible that Trump got it right?

The fact that U.S. inflation has remained in check has certainly strengthened Trump's hand. But there are reasons to think the inflationary impact of tariffs will become more apparent in the coming months, as companies work through inventories and are forced to manage costs tied to rejigging supply chains. And while Trump appears committed to using tariffs, he has backed down on his most extreme positions – offering carveouts for most imports from Canada that comply with United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement rules, for instance.

Canada should be using its increased defence spending as leverage in trade talks with the U.S., rather than shifting to Europe for procurement, C.D. Howe's James Pierlot writes in The Globe. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney has justified the pivot by saying we “send three-quarters of our defence capital spending to America.” But this is true only in years with major orders, such as F-35s. Historically, Canada has spent only modest sums on U.S. procurement. 

A large spending boost could go a long way to advancing tariff-free trade.

A German court has fined the country's football association over a scandal connected to the hosting of the 2006 World Cup. The trial had been going on for more than a decade.

Frankfurt's Regional Court ruled on Wednesday that the German Football Association (DFB) must pay a fine of €130,000 ($151,000) for the misconduct of its former top officials.

The public prosecutor's office had accused the DFB of evading around €2.7 million in taxes and demanded that the FA pay a fine of €270,000. The defense rejected the charge of intentional tax evasion and called for an acquittal.

Of the three defendants initially named, none remained in the dock at the conclusion of the 33-day trial. The proceedings against two former DFB presidents, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, as well as the vice president of the organizing committee for the 2006 World Cup, Horst R. Schmidt, had earlier been dropped in return for the payment of fines. Zwanziger paid €10,000, Niersbach €25,000, and Schmidt €65,000.

Zwanziger, his successor Wolfgang Niersbach, who resigned as DFB president in 2015 as a result of the affair, and Schmidt, who is also a former DFB general secretary, had all been accused of arranging for an incorrect tax return submitted for 2006 to allow the FA to avoid paying millions in taxes.

The tax return included a €6.7 million payment from the DFB to football's world governing body FIFA. The DFB claimed the money was to pay for a World Cup gala — an event that never took place.

The payment triggered investigations over allegations it had been used as a slush fund to buy votes in favor of Germany's bid to host the 2006 tournament.

A 2016 DFB-commissioned investigation found the sum was the return of a loan via FIFA from former Adidas chief Robert Louis-Dreyfus.

The German tax office ordered the DFB in 2017 to pay more than €20 million in back taxes related to the year 2006.

The 2006 World Cup is popularly known in Germany as the ""summer fairy tale"" because of the home team's run to the semi-finals, and the sold-out stadiums and outdoor viewing areas across the country which attracted hundreds of thousands of fans.

US President Donald Trump said attacking Iran caused ""great progress"" in negotiations regarding Gaza, and insisted Tehran ""won't be building nuclear weapons for a long time."" DW has more.

The blog brings you the latest developments on the status of the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war and the wider crisis in the Middle East on Wednesday, June 25: 

US President Donald Trump said Washington would likely press Tehran to abandon its nuclear ambitions during talks with Iranian officials next week.

""I'll tell you, the last thing they want to do is enrich anything right now. They want to recover,"" he said at a press conference following a NATO summit in The Hague.

He floated the idea of an agreement being signed without giving further details. 

But he was adamant that Iran could not rebuild its nuclear program. ""We won't let that happen. Number one, militarily we won't,"" he said, adding that he thought ""we'll end up having something of a relationship with Iran"" to resolve the issue.""

The two countries were engaged in talks when Israel attacked Iran, and the US launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites.

France President Emmanuel Macron spoke about the ceasefire between Israel and Iran, saying he hopes it would hold.

""We can see how volatile and fragile it is,"" Macron said while attending the NATO summit in The Hague.

Macron added that diplomatic and technical work on the issue of Iran's nuclear program ""must resume.""



He said that France was carrying out its own assessment of the damage done to Iran's nuclear capabilities.

Earlier this week, Macron said the US' strikes in Iranlacked a ""framework of legality.""

Juliette Touma, communications director of The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), told DW that the humanitarian work currently done in the Gaza Strip by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) does not meet the needs of Palestinians on the ground.

""Why reinvent the wheel?"" she asked. ""We have 400 distribution centers across the Gaza Strip, we've been there for years... And we don't shoot at people while they're queuing to get food.""



Her comments refer to the near-daily killing of Palestinians seeking aid at GHF distribution sites, which eyewitnesses and hospital officials say is being carried out by Israel.

""Not sure why anyone would want to support a foundation or an organization like this that's made of primarily mercenaries, that provides 'UN' aid after such a humiliation for starving population and that puts the lives of people at risk,"" she told DW.

Amid conflicting reports on the effect of the US airstrikes over the weekend, Iranian Foreign Ministery spokesman Esmail Baghaei claimed that Tehran's nuclear program had suffered serious setbacks.

""Our nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that's for sure,"" Baghaei told Al Jazeera, without going into details.


 

Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have ""intensified in recent hours,"" senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told AFP. 

According to al-Nunu, communications with Egypt and Qatar were ongoing but the Palestinian militant group had ""not yet received any proposals"" to end the war in Gaza.

The fighting started on October 7, 2023 with the group's terrorist attack that claimed the lives of some 1,200 Israelis.

US President Donald Trump has said Iran is ""not going to be building bombs for a long time"" following the recent strikes on its nuclear facilities.

He described the US attacks as causing ""total obliteration"" and setting back Iran's nuclear ambitions by ""decades.""

This comes despite a CNN report on an initial intelligence evaluation that suggested the strikes had failed to destroy Iran's underground nuclear facilities and did not fully eliminate Iran's centrifuges or the country's stockpile of enriched uranium.

Trump labeled the reports ""fake news,"" while also saying there is ""great progress"" on the negotiations to end the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.

According to Trump, the strikes on Iran would help with the release of the 50 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.

The Israeli military has said Iran was ""far from reaching a nuclear weapon"" following the clashes with Israel.

""There is Iran before our operation, Iran that had the ability to quickly reach a nuclear weapon, and Iran after the operation, a country that's far from reaching a nuclear weapon,"" said Effie Deffrin, the chief Israeli army spokesman.

Deffrin said the Israeli army is still ready for any development, despite the ceasefire with Iran.

""We are following everything that happens on all seven fronts, with emphasis on Iran, and we are prepared to respond if needed,"" he said.

Iran's nuclear program suffered ""very significant"" and ""substantial"" damage after the US strike on its three main nuclear sites over the weekend, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.

""The bottom line is, they are much further away from a nuclear weapon today than they were before the president took this bold action,"" Rubio told US outlet Politico.

""We're just learning more about it,"" Rubio added.

Iran's parliament has voted in favor of suspending the country's cooperation with the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, state media said. 

According to Iran's parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf , the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ""put its international credibility for auction"" by not condemning the Israeli and US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

Iran's atomic energy entity will therefore suspend its cooperation with IAEA ""until the security of the nuclear facilities is guaranteed,"" Bagher Ghalibaf said.

Iran has executed three people after accusing them of spying for Israel, according to state-run IRNA news agency. 

One of the prisoners was reported to be an Iraqi national.

Since June 16, Iran has executed six people due to alleged espionage, with human rights activists fearing more executions to come.

An armored vehicle transporting IDF soldiers has been struck by an explosive in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, the Israeli military said. 

The blast killed all seven soldiers inside the vehicle.

Over 860 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the war began on October 7, 2023, with some 400 killed in the fighting inside Gaza.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israeli airstrikes ""sent Iran's nuclear program down the drain"" and achieved a ""historic victory.""

""If someone in Iran tries to restore that program, we will act with the same determination, the same power, to cut off any such attempt,"" Netanyahu warned.

Previously, Iran said that it had ""taken the necessary measures"" to ensure the continuation of its nuclear program.

""Plans for restarting [the facilities] have been prepared in advance, and our strategy is to ensure that production and services are not disrupted,"" Mohammad Eslami, the chief of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said in a televised statement on Tuesday. 

Separately, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for nuclear inspections in Iran to restart following the ceasefire with Israel. 

""Resuming cooperation with the IAEA is key to a successful diplomatic agreement to finally resolve the dispute over Iran's nuclear activities,"" IAEA head Rafael Grossi said in a statement.

A preliminary US intelligence assessment reportedly found that Iran's nuclear program has only been set back by a few months following US strikes on Iran's key nuclear facilities, according to Reuters.

According to the assessment, Tehran would be able to restart its nuclear program later this year, Reuters said, citing three unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

The assessment is at odds with US President Donald Trump's assertions over the weekend that the US strikes had ""fully obliterated"" Iran's nuclear program.

The damage assessment was first reported by CNN, which asked the White House for comment. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the ""alleged"" assessment was ""flat-out wrong.""

""Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration,"" she was quoted as saying.

Trump has also denied the news on his Truth Social platform. In a post written in capital letters, he described CNN as ""fake news,"" writing the reporting aimed to ""demean one of the most successful military strikes in history."" He maintained that Iran's nuclear sites are now ""completely destroyed.""

The America strikes on Iranian nuclear sites used conventional weapons as well as bunker-busting bombs, believed to be the only bombs capable of destroying Iran's underground Fordo nuclear site.

The extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities and sites remains unclear.

The US and Iran are in early discussions about resuming negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, US special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News.

""The conversations are promising. We're hopeful,"" Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News. ""Now it's time to sit down with the Iranians and get to a comprehensive peace deal.""

Witkoff said US and Iran are engaged in both direct talks and through intermediaries about getting back to the table after Israeli and US strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities.

A new round of nuclear talks between the US and Iran was slated for June 15, but Israel carried out strikes on Iran two days earlier. That triggered a war that saw the US bomb three nuclear facilities in Iran this past weekend, before Trump announced a surprise ceasefire on Monday.

Despite reported violations in the first hours, a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran seems to be holding, after US President Donald Trump put out a sharp reprimand against both countries.

On Tuesday, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said Washington and Tehran were in early discussions over resuming nuclear talks which were derailed by the Israeli strikes on Iran and the resulting war.

Meanwhile, an early intelligence assessment has reportedly found that Iran's nuclear program was only set back by a few months, following American strikes on three Iranian facilities. The findings, which are ongoing, are at odds with Trump's assertions that Iran's nuclear program was ""fully obliterated.""

The US has approved lenacapavir for HIV prevention. However, experts worry that cuts to the health budget will ""squander"" the drug's chance of reducing infections.

The battle against HIV has been dealt repeated blows in 2025 with cuts to funding for major global aid programs by the United States.

There have also been budget cuts closer to home. And experts have told DW the cuts risk undermining efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the US by 2030, even now, with the approval of lenacapavir — what UNAIDS officials have described as a ""miracle"" drug — in HIV prevention.

Lencapavir provides six months of protection against HIV infection. The renowned journal Science named it 2024's scientific ""breakthrough of the year.""

Some experts are asking whether the promise of the drug could be undone by the defunding of US public health agencies that are vital for getting lencapavir to those who need it most.

""Are we going to squander this, probably the greatest opportunity in 44 years of HIV prevention both in the US and globally?"" asked Mitchell Warren, executive director of the nonpartisan HIV organization AVAC, in an interview with DW.

Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS, the United Nations agency that addresses HIV and AIDS around the world, dubbed lenacapavir a ""miracle product"" in 2024.

If it was hype, it was well-founded hype. In late-stage clinical trials, lenacapavir had a near-perfect record of suppressing HIV infection.

Having already approved it as a treatment to reduce viral load in patients with the disease, the US Food and Drug Administration has now confirmed lenacapavir as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drug. PrEP drugs are taken before having unprotected sex or injecting drugs to protect against HIV.

Unlike other PrEP drugs, which aim to disrupt the virus at one stage of its life cycle, lencapavir has been shown to attack HIV at several stages, increasing its effectiveness.

About 400,000 US patients use some form of PrEP, usually a daily pill. But a twice-a-year injection with lenacapavir would provide people with the longest-lasting protection yet.

In his first term, US President Donald Trump started an ""Ending the HIV Epidemic"" (EHE) initiative, an effort to stop the transmission of the disease within the US by the end of this decade.

But the current Trump administration's cost-cutting drive has downsized the federal health budget, affecting key public health agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and programs including Medicare and Medicaid.

America's global aid initiatives, including USAID and PEPFAR (the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), have also been substantially wound back.

""Whether it's the NIH research infrastructure [or] USAID for foreign assistance, these are big programs and none of them are HIV specific,"" Warren said. ""But each one of them is diminished now in [its ability] to deliver the comprehensive and integrated programs that have been really at the forefront [of HIV response].""

The result of this lost funding, Warren said, is that especially vulnerable groups, such as those from low-income backgrounds, gay and bisexual men and sex workers, may not benefit from the new PrEP drug, lenacapavir, which could provide them with unprecedented protection.

Research has found that in US states which have expanded Medicaid coverage to offer health services to ""all people with household incomes below a certain level,"" a growing number of people are using PrEP.

Jeffrey Crowley, director of the Center for HIV and Infectious Disease Policy at the O'Neill Institute in Washington, said services like expanded Medicaid coverage have meant better access to HIV programs for those with the disease.

""This is an incredible accomplishment, and it's helped drive a lot of the progress we've seen,"" Crowley told DW.

He also said the cuts will mean people lose access to HIV services, which other programs can't cover.

""I think the American people can be proud of how we responded to the HIV crisis domestically and globally, but this is all at risk. We've come so far, after so much death, why would we take a step backward?""

Every year, more than a million new HIV cases are reported globally and, until recently, US support through programs like USAID and PEPFAR was essential in helping regions most affected by the disease, especially countries in Africa.

However, the Trump administration's aid withdrawal has already had an impact.

Data from UNAIDS suggests there will be 2,300 more HIV cases per year because of the cuts to PEPFAR alone. Annual infections to date were already at about 3,500.

""Less funding means we will get more and more off track,"" said Byanyima in mid-June. ""We don't know what the total impact [of the US cuts] will be, but impact there will be. Already, you see in several countries a drop in the number of people going to clinics.""

The US government continues to support pregnant women and new mothers via PEPFAR, but the changes have stopped access to PrEP for gay and bisexual men, sex workers and drug users — groups that are disproportionately affected by HIV.

Warren said it was akin to ""throwing out a whole generation"" of progress.

New York is facing the prospect of electing a staunchly socialist pro-Palestine mayor who wants to control food prices and almost double the minimum wage.

The city appears to be lurching to the Left after Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old outsider, clinched the Democratic nomination, defeating Andrew Cuomo, the moderate establishment candidate.

Mr Mamdani is a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause with a string of celebrity endorsements and more than a million followers on Instagram.

He will contest the November election as a front-runner in a city that has not elected a Republican since 2005. But he may face stiff competition from independents.

His victory in a primary on Tuesday was seen as a litmus test for a Democrat party still licking its wounds following Donald Trump's victory in November.

Born in Uganda, his family moved to New York when he was seven. He has posted campaign videos speaking entirely in Urdu and mixed with Bollywood clips. He also speaks Spanish.

He is a fierce critic of Israel's war in Gaza, putting him at odds with much of the Democratic establishment.

His Muslim faith has also been weaponised by some Maga Republicans, including Charlie Kirk, a populist media personality and podcaster with access to Mr Trump's inner circle.

“Twenty-four years ago a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11. Now a Muslim socialist is on pace to run New York City,” Mr Kirk tweeted.

He added: “The power centres of the West will have Muslim mayors. You become what you import.”

But it is Mr Mamdani's policies that have been most eye-catching.

In videos posted during the primary race that routinely went viral – particularly on TikTok – he called for free bus rides, universal childcare for New Yorkers with children aged six weeks to five years, and rent controls.

He wants to plough $70 billion (£51 billion) into housing and almost double the minimum wage from $16 to $30 an hour.

One of Mr Mamdani's most controversial policies is city-controlled supermarkets, where local authorities would get to decide how much food costs. Business leaders have already threatened to leave the city over the proposal.

John Catsimatidis, the chief executive of grocery chain Gristedes, said he would consider selling or moving his stores if Mr Mamdani is elected.

“If the city of New York is going socialist, I will definitely close, or sell, or move or franchise the Gristedes locations,” he told Fox News.

During the campaign, tweets by Mr Mamdani resurfaced, which called for the New York Police Department to be defunded.

“Queer liberation means defund the police,” he said in one post in 2020.

His high-profile supporters include Emily Ratajkowski, the actress and model, Rachel Zegler, the Snow White actress who regularly posts pro-Palestinian comments on social media, and singer Lorde, who in 2017 cancelled a concert in Tel Aviv after pressure from activists.

As well as being New York's most Left-leaning mayor, he would also become the city's first Muslim leader in a city that is home to about one million Muslims.

Mr Mamdani wove his faith into his campaign, delivering speeches at mosques and speaking to voters while fasting for Ramadan.

In 2021, Mr Mamdani described himself as an anti-Zionist.

“It is Palestine that brought me into organising, and it is Palestine that I will always organise for,” he told a crowd in New York.“Anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism and in the anti-Zionist movement that I believe in and belong to, there is no room for anti-Semitism,” he added.

Last week, Mr Mamdani said that “globalise the intifada” was a legitimate expression that could be used by Palestinian supporters, which earned him staunch criticism from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.

“The very word has been used by the Holocaust Museum when translating the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising into Arabic, which is a word that means ‘struggle',” he said as he defended his position.

The museum hit back: “Since 1987, Jews have been attacked and murdered under its banner. All leaders must condemn its use and the abuse of history.”

Trip Yang, a political strategist, told the BBC the 33-year-old's victory against Mr Cuomo was the “biggest upset in modern NYC history”.

“A massive win for Zohran Mamdani that shows that when Donald Trump is president, New York Democrats want to see their leaders fight with enthusiasm and courage, and that's what Zohran showed voters.”

Mr Cuomo had looked unbeatable as he sought to make a political comeback after facing sexual assault allegations in 2021.

He told The New York Times he was still considering whether to run as an independent in November.

The Israeli-run Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which uses private US military firms, has been condemned by the UN.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The anti-poverty group Oxfam America has issued a forceful response to reporting that the Trump administration plans to give tens of millions dollars to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed aid organization which uses private U.S. military firms and whose rollout the United Nations and international aid groups have strongly objected to.

Reuters was first to report on Tuesday that the Trump administration plans to give $30 million to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). A document reviewed by the outlet shows that the amount was authorized last week under a “priority directive” from the White House and the U.S. Department of State. Per Reuters, $7 million has already been dispersed. Sources told the outlet that the administration may approve separate monthly grants for the entity.

Oxfam America president and CEO Abby Maxman said in a statement on Tuesday that the Trump administration is poised to shell out for an aid organization “formed to distribute food parcels without any grounding in the reality of the crisis in Gaza.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Maxman accused GHF of delivering only a fraction of the number of meals that the population needs and alleged the group is distributing food that families can't prepare without fuel and clean water. She also said the organization has pushed aid further out of reach for the vulnerable populations who can't walk long distances to its distribution sites.

“We urge the Trump administration and Congress to instead put its full support behind funding and ensuring safe access for established humanitarian organizations to do the work that is proven to save lives,” added Maxman.

She also highlighted that the distribution sites have been marred by violence.

The U.N.'s human rights office said on Tuesday that at least 410 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces “while trying to fetch from controversial new aid hubs in Gaza — a likely war crime,” according to a U.N. News article posted that same day.

Jonathan Whittall, the head of U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told journalists on Monday that since Israel's total blockade was partially lifted in late May, “people have been killed almost daily while trying to get food.”

In a statement shared with CBS on Tuesday, GHF pushed back on what it called “false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites.” The group also said that the “Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any U.N. convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents,” according to CBS, whose story focused on comments from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East commissioner general decrying GHF.

In that same story, CBS reported that the Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in Gaza over the last day. Fifty-one of those people had died near GHF sites, per CBS, citing the Gaza Ministry of Health.

And on Monday, over a dozen human rights organizations sent a letter to GHF calling for an end to the “privatized, militarized” GHF aid model and urging any parties involved with GHF and the international community in general to press for aid to be distributed through established international relief operations.

“Individuals and corporate entities involved in the planning, financing, or execution of the GHF scheme may incur criminal liability — including under universal jurisdiction statutes — for aiding and abetting war crimes such as the forcible displacement of civilians, starvation as a method of warfare, and denial of humanitarian access,” the letter warned.

The groups behind the letter include the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the Center for Applied Legal Studies, and others.

Presidents must issue reports on every military action within two days — something Trump didn't do with the Iran strike.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), an ardent loyalist to President Donald Trump, is rejecting the idea that the current commander-in-chief must adhere to the War Powers Act, a half-century-old law that is meant to rein in presidential misuse and abuse of the U.S. military.

Instead, Johnson told reporters on Tuesday that the law itself is unconstitutional, citing a dubious reading of the document.

“Many respected constitutional experts argue that the War Powers Act is itself unconstitutional,” said Johnson, without naming specific experts. “I'm persuaded by that argument.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The speaker added that he believes the law is a “violation of the [Constitution's] Article II powers of the commander-in-chief.”

Johnson also rejected demands for compliance with the law following Trump's military strikes in Iran.

“The strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities were clearly within President Trump's Article II powers as commander-in-chief. It shouldn't even be a dispute,” he said.

Both Congress and the president are granted some control over the use of the military. But while Johnson is correct that Article II describes the president as “commander-in-chief” of the armed forces, he has disregarded the congressional powers laid out in Article I.

Congress, for example, is the only branch of government that has the power “to declare war” — a power the institution last exercised during World War II, despite the U.S. engaging in numerous military conflicts since. Congress also has the power to “raise and support armies,” and to “make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.”

That last statement gives rise to the argument that the War Powers Act is constitutional, despite Johnson's assertions to the contrary.

The War Powers Act stipulates time limits that presidents must adhere to when it comes to use of the military. The law, for example, only allows presidents to use military action in a specific campaign for 60 days before requiring congressional approval; for the military action to continue beyond that time frame, Congress must grant an extension of that use, pass a resolution authorizing military force, or pass a declaration of war — with some exceptions in very specific circumstances. 

Trump's use of the military to attack Iran appears to be over, well before that 60-day limit. However, he may still run afoul of the War Powers Act, as another stipulation in the law requires that every military action taken without congressional approval be reported on to leaders of Congress within 48 hours. 

The law further states that:

The President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situation where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and after every such introduction shall consult regularly with the Congress until United States Armed Forces are no longer engaged in hostilities or have been removed from such situations.

It also states that presidents must submit a report to the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate, describing the “circumstances necessitating the introduction of United States Armed Forces,” as well as the “constitutional and legislative authority” giving them the ability to take the military action, and the “estimated scope and duration of the hostilities or involvement.”

The White House did not provide any such report to those individuals. 

After the attack on Iran over the last weekend, some Democratic and Republican lawmakers had a rare but brief moment of bipartisanship, suggesting that an impeachment vote be held against Trump for violating the law. But after Trump announced the ceasefire between Iran and Israel (as uneasy as it may be), Republicans supportive of that idea backed off.

“I talked to the speaker on the floor just now and told him we wouldn't push [an impeachment resolution] if the cease-fire holds, so it's really in their court,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), who had co-sponsored an impeachment measure, said on Monday evening. 

The House overwhelmingly voted to table the impeachment measure on Tuesday, with 216 Republicans and 128 Democrats — 344 legislators in total — backing that decision. Just 79 Democrats (and zero Republicans) voted to advance the measure.

Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), the author of the impeachment measure that was defeated, blasted the House's decision to ignore the Trump administration's blatant disregard of the War Powers Act.

“President Trump's unilateral, unprovoked use of force without congressional authorization or notice constitutes an abuse of power when there was no imminent threat to the United States,” Green said.

Surveys have shown that most Americans are concerned about the president's intervening actions in the Israel-Iran conflict. A recent Economist/YouGov poll, for example, shows that nearly 1 in 2 Americans (45 percent) do not believe Trump has a clear policy in mind when it comes to Iran. And a Reuters/Ipsos poll published earlier this week finds that a plurality of Americans, 45 percent, opposed the military campaign, while only 36 percent approved. That same poll found that 84 percent of Americans are concerned that the conflict between the two countries will grow.

One expert said new polling shows that more support for vaccines is needed to achieve herd immunity for many diseases.

Most Americans support routine childhood vaccine requirements even as they become more politically charged, according to a new poll released Wednesday.

A survey by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the de Beaumont Foundation found that 79 percent of Americans believe parents should be required to vaccinate their children against preventable diseases to attend school. That includes 72 percent of all parents.

The support cuts across political party lines, with backing from 90 percent of Democrats, 68 percent of Republicans and 66 percent who say they agree with “Make America Great Again,” the political ideology movement aligned with President Donald Trump.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“This just shows that routine vaccination policy is not as controversial as you would believe if you were just reading news and watching influencers,” said survey lead Gillian SteelFisher, director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program and principal research scientist at Harvard Chan School. “This is pretty well agreed ground.”

The poll was conducted online and via telephone between March 10 and March 31, as measles cases soared around the country. The poll had a sample of 2,509 adults aged 18 or older, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 points. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish.

Brian C. Castrucci, president and CEO of the de Beaumont Foundation, a private philanthropy that supports public health including vaccination, said the new polling shows that the medical community must continue to hone its messaging about the need for vaccines. An increase in vaccine hesitancy — people who delay or refuse vaccination — is among the reasons for a decline in childhood vaccination rates. That can prevent herd immunity, the indirect protection of a community from an infectious disease. Some of the most contagious diseases require more than 90 percent of a population to be immune.

“While we do show really strong support for vaccines, 79 percent is a little low compared to what we actually need to get herd immunity,” Castrucci said. “And so there's a lot of work to be done in taking something that we know protects our country and protects our children.” 

Among those who support childhood vaccine requirements, vaccine effectiveness in protecting most children (90 percent) and family responsibilities to keep schools safe (87 percent) were major reasons for their positions.

American adults also overwhelmingly, at 91 percent, believed in the safety of vaccines for most children. The poll distinguished vaccines that prevent childhood diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella from vaccines that prevent COVID-19. Sixty-three percent percent believe vaccines are very safe and 28 percent believe they are somewhat safe. Just 9 percent questioned their safety — 5 percent believe they are not very safe and 4 percent believe they are not safe at all.

About 1 in 5, or 21 percent, do not support childhood vaccine requirements, with more citing the need for parental choice rather than safety concerns as a major reason for that. Among parents surveyed, 88 percent believe vaccines are safe. 

SteelFisher said the polling on parental choice can be revealing for policymakers and the medical community as they shape related health legislation and try to promote collective health choices.

“If people bring empathy to it, you can kind of tamper down some of that vitriol which we see so much and just kind of say, ‘Hey, I hear you.' We should make space for that conversation,” she said. “To me, these kind of data are a reminder you have to know what people are thinking.”

Castrucci agreed, adding that confronting the issue of parental choice will help public health professionals “in how we actively engage with people around, ‘How do you make that choice? Why is this choice important?' And what are the downsides for any one person not choosing to make this choice for themselves, their child and their family?”

The polling comes amid an inflection point in vaccine policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Doctors have increasingly expressed public alarm over Kennedy's actions on vaccines. In May, Kennedy bypassed an independent vaccine panel to announce contradictory guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant people and children. A few weeks later, he fired everyone on that panel — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP — and replaced them with members who have limited relevant experience.

ACIP, which is scheduled to meet Wednesday and Thursday, has long made recommendations that help determine Americans' access to vaccines. Vaccine experts say they'll be closely tracking the panel's actions.

Part of Kennedy's political ascension has included open skepticism of vaccines, with a series of claims over years that are not based in facts. Some of his more ardent supporters include parents. Castrucci said it will be important for doctors to keep challenging the emerging false narratives. 

“We need folks to opt in to these vaccines that we know work and that we know are safe and effective, but just citing data is not helping our argument,” he said. “And so we have to create spaces where these conversations can happen and we can gain trust of parents so that they will opt into childhood vaccinations instead of contribute to the growing pushback that some have against them.”

Just two days after authorizing military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities at Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz, U.S. President Donald Trump announced an end to the air war between Iran and Israel and declared that it was time for peace. “Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region,” he wrote on his site Truth Social. Whether the cease-fire will hold remains to be seen, but if Trump is hoping for a quick return to diplomacy, he is likely to be disappointed.

Trump and his national security team find themselves in a bind. As administration officials have admitted, Iran's stockpiles of highly enriched uranium and centrifuge components have probably survived military operations by Israel and the United States. In order to locate and secure them, Washington will require Tehran's cooperation. So far, however, Trump and his negotiators have been unable to cajole Iran's leaders into making significant concessions. Most notably, the Iranians continue to reject calls to give up uranium enrichment entirely. Trump may hope that his recent display of U.S. military power, combined with Israel's aggressive military campaign over the past two weeks, will force Iran to compromise, but this is unlikely. If anything, Iran's leaders will be more reluctant to pursue diplomacy after Trump twice allowed ongoing talks with Iran to be scuttled by military action—first by greenlighting Israeli airstrikes and then by joining the war directly. His ultimatums promising more military punishment and his references to the possibility of regime change are equally unhelpful.

The challenge that the Trump administration faces now is not with the severity of the threats it has issued but with the credibility of the assurances it can provide to Iran's regime. For Trump's coercive approach to diplomacy to work in pushing Iran into a strong nuclear deal, two things are necessary. First, the United States must issue believable threats to impose significant and painful consequences if Iran ignores or violates U.S. demands. Trump has done that, with his social media posts, the surge of U.S. military forces to the region, and, most emphatically, his strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. These warnings and actions, however, may still have limited impact on Iranian behavior without the second requirement: meaningful U.S. assurances that Iran won't suffer the threatened consequences—or other repercussions—if it acquiesces to U.S. demands. Iran's leaders need to believe that if their country bends the United States won't try to break it.

Trump's decision to use U.S. military force has made his threats more believable but made it harder to offer credible assurances. Washington still has options, however, if it hopes to bring Iran's leaders back into productive negotiations toward a new nuclear deal. Trump will need to ensure that Israel permanently ends its military campaign, including by restricting the resupply of offensive munitions if Israel restarts its air war. The president and his national security team should state definitively that regime change is not an American goal and show that they mean it by withdrawing recently surged air and naval forces from the Middle East. And Washington should offer immediate sanctions relief that kicks in as soon as Iran and the United States reach a broad framework for an agreement. Restarting the diplomatic track that Washington abruptly interrupted in mid-June will be difficult and require patience, but solving the problem of credible assurances offers the only pathway to Trump's ultimate goal: an end to Iran's nuclear ambitions.

Trump remains focused on blocking Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. That is a goal best achieved through diplomacy, not military means, given the inherent limitations of airpower for destroying deeply buried nuclear sites and uranium stockpiles with certainty and finality.

The U.S. attacks on Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan aptly demonstrate the problem. Although battlefield damage assessments are ongoing, Fordow appears to have been damaged but not entirely destroyed. Gary Samore, a Harvard nuclear expert, suggested in an analysis for the Financial Times that the Iranian regime removed centrifuges and perhaps other materials from Fordow before it was targeted, meaning that components of Iran's nuclear program likely survived the attack. David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector, told CNN on Monday that some centrifuges are “unaccounted for” and that some stockpiles of 60 percent highly enriched uranium “were taken away by Iran, and we don't know where they are.” According to analysis that nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis shared on social media, the last known location of the Iranian stockpile was in tunnels at Isfahan that the United States does not appear to have struck.

More broadly, the Iranian nuclear program far exceeds these three sites. Mindful of the 1981 Israeli attack on Osirak, an Iraqi nuclear reactor, Iran constructed its nuclear program to be compartmentalized, redundant, and highly resilient. Critical functions such as R & D, uranium metallurgy, and centrifuge engineering are embedded in government agencies, engineering firms, and Iranian universities. Diplomacy must therefore follow U.S. airstrikes to persuade Iran to cooperate in dismantling its nuclear program.

Iran clearly fears a long war with the United States. It is for this reason that Tehran limited its retaliation to the U.S. airstrikes to a highly telegraphed missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar that was easily intercepted with no casualties to U.S. military personnel. But even if Iran's leaders are willing to give up many of their demands to extricate themselves from war with the United States, Trump's heavy use of threats will fail to bring them back to the negotiating table. As Thomas Schelling, the revered international relations scholar and Nobel Prize recipient, famously recognized, credible threats must be paired with credible assurances to successfully persuade an adversary to capitulate. For coercion to be successful, in other words, it must come with promises that if the target complies, it will avoid the threatened consequences.



The issue, then, is not just convincing Iran that if it doesn't give up its nuclear program, the United States will attack. Washington must also convince Tehran of the implicit assurance: if it does give up its nuclear program, then no attack will occur. If Iran believes that Israel or the United States will use military force no matter what, it has no incentive to compromise.

There are several reasons why Iran cannot simply take the credibility of U.S. assurances for granted. First, states live in an anarchic international system where no overarching authority exists to guarantee agreements and punish those who renege. Iran has no external recourse if the United States double-crosses it by pursuing regime change after Iran has given up its nuclear ambitions. Second, there is a time-inconsistency problem: only after Iran has already sacrificed its chief source of leverage—its nuclear program—will the United States have to keep its end of the bargain. Finally, Iran must worry that nuclear concessions will embolden Israel and the United States to make more expansive demands in the future. Altogether, compliance with U.S. conditions is risky for Iran because the United States has less incentive to remain restrained after Trump gets what he wants.

States can break their promises immediately or over the long term. Consider the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, when Ukraine returned Soviet nuclear weapons to Russia in return for a commitment from Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States that Ukraine's territorial integrity was sacrosanct. That promise lasted a mere 20 years; Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and invaded deep into Ukrainian territory again in February 2022.

In the case of Iran, the regime clearly believes that the United States might be committed to regime change regardless of whether Tehran agrees to dismantle its nuclear program. And right now, it holds an important card: knowledge of the location of the missing components of that nuclear program. If the United States is unable to trace and capture all program components, it risks the possibility that embattled remnants of the current government could covertly sprint for a bomb or that these missing components fall into the hands of unpredictable militant groups. Washington, therefore, is disincentivized from jumping to regime change right away. But once Iran gives up those components or their location, Iran's leaders will have reason to fear for their political survival—unless, that is, the United States gives them real assurances.

Even if the Trump administration is ready and willing to provide Iran with credible assurances, it will find this task difficult for several reasons. For one, there is an inherent tension between threats and assurances. The steps a country takes to make its threats more convincing—such as moving military forces into position or exploiting “madman tactics” to convince the adversary that the country is “crazy enough” to follow through with extreme threats—simultaneously throw into doubt its commitments that cooperation will be rewarded rather than taken advantage of.

In dealing with Iran, Trump has leaned primarily on threats, both promised and delivered. He has flooded U.S. military assets into the Middle East, including more air defenses, additional U.S. fighter jets, and a second U.S. navy carrier strike group. Trump has also used social media and public statements to make clear that he is ready and willing to unleash the full weight of the U.S. military on Iran. And he has ensured that Iran's leaders see his threats to use military force as credible by following through on them with strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. Trump has also demonstrated himself to be an unpredictable actor, using deception to catch Iran off guard, even while publicly calling for negotiations.

Iran now can have no doubt that Trump is ready to make good on military threats. But these same actions have made any pledge of cooperation that Trump and his national security team might offer unreliable. With a still large and ready U.S. military footprint in the region, Iran's leaders are likely to be skeptical of Washington's commitment to peace and fear that yielding to Washington's demands will leave their country vulnerable and exposed for the next round of strikes.



The second challenge Trump faces is not entirely of his own making. It arises from the many times that past U.S. presidents have gone back on their word or offered assurances that ended up being hollow. Haunting the current interaction between Iran and the United States, for example, is the case of the 2003 U.S. war in Iraq. In the lead-up to war, President George W. Bush demanded that Saddam Hussein let international weapons inspectors in to substantiate Saddam's claims that he was not pursuing weapons of mass destruction. After months of dispute, Iraq finally readmitted international inspectors in November 2002, acquiescing to Bush's pressure campaign in hope of averting a military strike. Yet Bush subsequently attacked Iraq anyway, despite the inspectors finding no evidence of such weapons. Later evidence, such as the Downing Street Memo, suggested that Bush was determined to attack Iraq regardless of what the inspectors discovered.

Iran has every reason to worry about the same dynamic here. After all, Trump allowed Israel to take military action in mid-June even while American and Iranian negotiating teams were planning for another round of talks just days later. He was also the one who pulled out of the original nuclear deal with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and imposed punishing “maximum pressure” sanctions despite Iran's compliance with the terms of the 2015 deal. With these experiences in mind, Tehran would be justified in suspecting that Washington has already decided to use military force again in the future no matter the extent of Iran's concessions.

Finally, and perhaps trickiest of all, Trump's assurances to Iran need to carry over to Israel. For diplomacy to work, Trump has to convince Iran not only that concessions will forestall a future U.S. attack but also that they will keep Israel in compliance with the new cease-fire and prevent renewed Israeli military action down the road. This will be challenging because Israel has already demonstrated its ability and willingness to act unilaterally, while Trump has exhibited limited appetite (or perhaps ability) to restrain Israel when pressured. Convincing Iran that the United States can and will keep Israel from taking future military action against Iran as long as Iran's leaders agree to U.S. conditions will require, at the very least, a president determined to use U.S. leverage over Israel, not only with regard to its activities in Iran but across the Middle East.

Providing credible assurances to Tehran is thus a tall order for Washington, made more complicated by the long tail of past U.S. foreign policy choices. It is not, however, impossible, and the Trump administration can convince Iran that compromise will be worthwhile.

Reengaging Iran diplomatically will require a combination of military and economic assurances that are visible and irreversible, some made unilaterally by the United States and some made alongside other countries. Trump must first promise to rein in Israel. This will be challenging politically and made much harder by the fact that Trump has already yielded to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at least twice. Moreover, it is unlikely that Trump would pull back defensive aid while Iran still threatens Israel. But the United States could signal to Israel (and Iran) that it will not resupply certain offensive Israeli capabilities, including precision bombs and missiles, should Israel try to resume its air war against Iran during negotiations or while Iran is adhering to the terms of a new deal. This would at the very least limit the scope and duration of future Israeli airstrikes.

Second, Trump and other U.S. officials should assert clearly and consistently that they do not seek regime change in Iran and are focused only on Iran's nuclear program. Rhetoric alone is unlikely to be sufficient, so the United States should reinforce its words with changes to U.S. regional posture that clearly signal that Washington is not getting ready for another regime change war in the Middle East. For example, the United States could, in the near term, withdraw air and naval forces that have been surged to the region over recent weeks and, as things in the region stabilize, lower readiness and threat levels at regional military bases to normal. Washington could also recommit to plans to withdraw forces from Syria and Iraq as an indication that the United States intends to continue its global realignment away from the Middle East once the current crisis abates. U.S. regional partners could be enlisted to bolster the message that the United States is not interested in facilitating regime change in Iran by refusing to allow U.S. forces to use their territory or airspace for operations aimed at regime targets.

Finally, the Trump administration should offer immediate sanctions relief once Iran and the United States agree to even a broad framework for a deal. This would be consistent with Trump's assertions that he hopes to see a successful and prosperous Iran and would offer Iran's leaders some evidence that Washington is not out to topple the regime. Getting European partners to sign on to this promise will help strengthen any U.S. commitment and the benefits sanctions relief can offer to Iran. Notably, the effects of sanctions relief could be rapid: Syria recently completed its first banking transaction using SWIFT, barely one month after Trump announced plans to lift U.S. sanctions.

Even as he offers these three types of assurances, Trump should also retire the “deal or bombs” ultimatums that he continues to make to Iran's leaders. With Iran's nuclear program set back and its ballistic missile infrastructure severely damaged, there is not an urgent need for either a deal or further military action. Trump now has the luxury of time and so should take advantage of it. He has adopted “peace through strength” as a mantra. In the coming days and weeks, he will need to remember that strength is measured not only through the use of military force but also through the ability to credibly withhold it.

MAX RODENBECK is Project Director for Israel/Palestine at the International Crisis Group. He was previously Bureau Chief for the Economist in the Middle East, South Asia, and Germany.

 Max Rodenbeck

On January 10, 2024, just over three months after Hamas's October 7 attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a short speech to clarify Israel's war aims in Gaza. The first point he stressed was that Israel had “no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.” He insisted that Israel was “fighting Hamas terrorists, not the Palestinian population” and stated that the country's objectives were simply “to rid Gaza of Hamas terrorists and free our hostages.”

Now, 20 months into a war that has killed more than 56,000 in Gaza—and that has swept Iran, too, into war with Israel and the United States—those declared aims appear to have been overridden, if not reversed. Since breaking this winter's brief cease-fire in March 2025, Israeli forces have begun seizing large parts of Gaza, while moving and confining the territory's population of 2.2 million into ever-smaller areas. The government has also unleashed a crushing campaign to limit and control the flow of humanitarian aid, including a total blockade that lasted for more than ten weeks. Yet despite its renewed onslaught, Israel has failed to secure freedom for any of the remaining 50 hostages, just 20 of whom are believed to be still alive. (The release in May of Edan Alexander, an Israeli soldier who is also an American citizen, was secured separately by American negotiators.) Nor does it appear to be in a hurry to reach a cease-fire agreement to bring them home.

This dramatic shift in objectives is apparent not only on the ground. In public statements, Netanyahu has made clear that his government now has other, more ambitious goals for the Gaza war. At a rare press conference on May 22, the prime minister stated that Israel no longer aims merely to free hostages and obliterate Hamas. When the war is over, he said, Israel will be in “full security control of Gaza.” He also enthusiastically endorsed U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal, announced in February, to relocate Gazans to other countries and redevelop the war-ravaged territory into a new Riviera—which he called “brilliant” and “revolutionary.” In other words, the Israeli government appears to be seeking precisely the outcomes that Netanyahu ruled out in January 2024: not only long-term military occupation of Gaza but also the large-scale displacement—or even expulsion—of its civilian population.

In a war marked by extreme violence and extraordinary privation inflicted on civilians, it may seem a distraction to focus on a scenario that many consider fantastical and that Trump himself has appeared to back away from. But for the Israeli cabinet, the so-called Trump plan for Gaza is not a passing fancy. In late March, shortly after the resumption of the military campaign, the Israeli government established a special office to oversee “voluntary emigration” from Gaza, and other members of the government have been even more explicit than Netanyahu in stating the end goal. “Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to . . . the south to a humanitarian zone . . . and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries,” Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in early May.

As the world's attention has been diverted by the so-called 12-day war between Israel and Iran and the decision of the United States to bomb Iranian nuclear sites, it is especially important not to lose sight of Israel's rapidly unfolding plan for Gaza and Gazans. Under the Geneva Conventions, a forced exodus from an occupied territory would be considered a war crime. It would not only condemn Palestinians to exile but condemn the Israelis who crafted and carried out the policy. They would bear responsibility for a criminal act that would, in addition, probably mean sacrificing the remaining Israeli hostages. But with the right combination of international pressure—especially from the United States, which has so far been more of an enabler of this Israeli government's excess than a restraint—this outcome might still be prevented. There may not be much time left. As Israeli military reporters have noted, the process is already underway; it is approaching at speed.

To grasp the extent to which Israel's military operations in Gaza are now overwhelmingly focused on pressuring the civilian population, it is crucial to understand the various components of the revised war plan, called Gideon's Chariots. One of them is control of food. Having already destroyed the farmland that supplied most of Gaza's protein, fruit, and vegetables, Israel has now taken extraordinary action to limit the flow of civilian aid into Gaza.

At the beginning of March, the Netanyahu government imposed a total blockade of all food, medicine, and fuel for Gaza. This lasted for 80 days, bringing the population to the brink of starvation. In mid-May, responding to mounting international pressure, the government began to allow in a trickle of aid using the well-established independent distribution channels run by the UN and a variety of humanitarian organizations that have long sustained Gaza. That meant, at best, fewer than 100 trucks a day of supplies, compared with some 600 during the short-lived cease-fire from January to March this year. This minimal supply has been further reduced by widespread looting, often carried out in zones that Israel controls by gangs that, according to both Palestinian and official Israeli accounts, operate under Israeli protection.

In late May, Israel rolled out a controversial scheme that sidelines established routes and allows Israel to control and calibrate all aid delivery. In place of the international humanitarian organizations that have kept Gaza alive through the war so far, the bulk of food aid—and eventually all of it—will from now on, in theory, be provided by a newly formed private charity. The so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, endorsed and promoted by the Trump administration and staffed on the ground by U.S. mercenaries, in practice functions as an arm of Israeli military operations. According to a New York Times investigation, GHF was conceived by Israeli officials and is being closely supervised by Israel. Neither the organization nor the Israeli government has disclosed the source of its funding. Its own documentation suggests that the GHF plans to supply only packaged foods, with no provision for medicines or other desperately needed supplies, at a target level of 1,700 calories per day—below medically established norms.



Thus far, the plan has proved disastrous. On the eve of the program's launch, GHF's American chief executive resigned, citing his organization's inability to maintain minimum international humanitarian standards. His replacement, Johnnie Moore, is an evangelical Christian and public relations executive with no experience in humanitarian work, who has openly backed plans to expel Palestinians from Gaza. During its first month of operations, the foundation's distribution points were repeatedly plunged into chaos, with more than 500 Palestinians shot dead by Israeli forces as they tried to reach them—killings that seem inexplicable and unprecedented in an aid-delivery context, even in a war zone.

According to the Israeli government, the new program is needed because Hamas had been siphoning off aid supplied through traditional channels. But international aid groups and Western officials—including David Satterfield, a career diplomat who served as the United States' special envoy for humanitarian issues in Gaza during the Biden administration, and Cindy McCain, the American head of the World Food Program—have pointed out that Israel has not offered evidence to support this claim. In an interview shortly before GHF went into operation, a senior Western diplomat in Israel flatly dismissed the allegations as a lie.

As the UN has warned, the architecture of the new aid program also appears aimed at furthering the displacement of Gaza's civilian population. With just eight fenced-in distribution points planned, GHF is replacing a decades-old aid distribution network that involved dozens of highly experienced agencies, hundreds of distribution sites, and thousands of workers spread over the entire territory. That model has been based on the international humanitarian principle that aid should be brought directly to the areas most in need. By contrast, the new system forces Gazans to walk long distances to reach isolated, heavily guarded sites where boxes of dry goods are left on trestle tables. GHF's first feeding centers opened in the far south of Gaza, where Israel plans eventually to herd large numbers of people. The intent to use the operation as a carrot to encourage movement was made explicit by a report broadcast by Israeli army radio on May 29. The opening of a new distribution point in the Netzarim Corridor, a wide, flattened military access zone that bisects the strip at its waist, the radio report announced, was “designed to prompt the civilian population in Gaza City and elsewhere in the northern Gaza Strip to head south.”

In its direct impact on Gaza's civilian population, the military component of Gideon's Chariots is even more drastic. As limited aid distribution is luring Gazans into confined areas in the south and in coastal areas of the territory, bombs, rockets, tank fire, and drone attacks are driving them there as well. Since resuming military operations on March 18, Israeli forces have newly displaced some 660,000 Palestinians, a third of Gaza's people, and killed some 5,000—a rate of more than 50 deaths per day. This surge is partly a tactical adjustment: since resuming military operations in March, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) has been targeting remaining members of Hamas's civil administration as well as its fighters, in an effort to smash the group's capacity to govern. Many of these people have been hit in their homes or tents, along with their families. But as has been the case since the beginning of the war, an overwhelming majority of casualties are collateral victims. According to the UN Office of Humanitarian Affairs, out of the 56,000 Palestinians confirmed to have died since October 7, 2023, 32,000 are women, children, and elderly people.

Far from indiscriminate, this relentless toll has been concentrated in areas that Israel wants civilians to leave. In April, after Israeli forces forcibly expelled the entire population of Gaza's third-biggest town, Rafah, the city was razed. The now empty ruin-field is where the GHF set up its first food handouts. Now Israeli officials openly talk of replicating the “Rafah model” in the last remaining urban enclaves in the strip. Once most civilians have fled, Israeli ground forces will presumably move into the emptied areas, hunting down remaining gunmen, blowing up tunnels, and demolishing every standing structure.

At the end of May, Israeli forces issued “evacuation orders”—leaflets and text messages accompanied by detailed maps—warning all residents of central Gaza City in the north and Khan Yunis in the south to abandon their homes. These are Gaza's densest urban areas, and about the only places left with standing buildings. Both are now under relentless bombardment. According to UN estimates, 82.5 percent of Gaza is now either already occupied by the Israeli army or has fallen under evacuation orders and so lies in free-fire zones. Not all these areas have been fully abandoned yet, and some residents, mistrustful of Israeli orders or simply exhausted by endless displacement, are determined to stay. If the Israeli government succeeds in its goal, however, more than two million people will be confined to just one-fifth of Gaza's area, a space the size of the island of Manhattan (which has a substantially smaller population). Israeli reporters who have been briefed by the army say that, in a future phase, the plan is to squash people into three even smaller enclaves, and then possibly to filter them through checkpoints into “Hamas-free” zones. The IDF itself has announced that it intends to displace “most of the population of Gaza.”

To achieve these aims, the IDF has amassed five full divisions inside Gaza: 50,000 to 60,000 troops, along with hundreds of battle tanks, dozens of armored bulldozers, and a full array of close air support. Notably, this force is made up almost entirely of regular army draftees and includes many of the elite IDF brigades, plus commandos and paratroopers. Israel's reserve forces—citizens who are called up for service as needed—traditionally supply most of the country's fighting force, but they have largely been left out of the current fighting in Gaza, possibly to preserve morale among Israelis in expectation of a rise in casualties as the IDF pins Hamas into a tighter corner. In recent months, there have also been growing concerns in the military about reservists declining to show up for duty, either because they oppose the continuation of the war or because they are fed up with repeated call-ups in what has become Israel's longest war.

For now, the Israeli government appears to be basking in the apparent success of its U.S.-aided campaign in Iran. Yet the catastrophic results of its war strategy in Gaza will not go away. Before the Iran campaign, parts of the Israeli security establishment as well as the general public were beginning to express growing outrage at the new war plan. They join a growing international chorus, which now includes EU diplomats, as well as the International Court of Justice and UN officials. The EU, Israel's most important trading partner, has threatened to suspend parts of its association agreement with Israel as a result of human rights violations in Gaza.

In Israel, prominent opposition figures, former statesmen, retired security chiefs, and 1,300 Israeli university faculty have in recent weeks voiced demands to stop the slaughter in Gaza. In April, more than 250 former members and three former leaders of the Mossad, Israel's top intelligence agency, published a rare open letter calling for the return of the hostages and an end to the war. At the end of May, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert publicly accused the Israeli government of committing war crimes in Gaza. And in June, just days before the Iran campaign began, more than 40 members of Israel's military intelligence signed a letter calling the government's actions in the war “clearly illegal.”

But despite the prominence of these critics, their voices have had negligible impact on the government's policies. Earlier in June, dissent in Netanyahu's governing coalition nearly brought down the government, but the disagreement was not about his management of the war but over a long-standing controversy about exemption from military service for ultra-Orthodox youths. Netanyahu's coalition is, ironically, strengthened by reliance on extremist parties that have nothing to gain from its fall. It may yet become one of the few governments in Israeli history to serve out its full term, which ends in the fall of 2026. Any significant pressure on Israeli policy, therefore, will likely have to come from other quarters.



One faint hope is that strong pressure from the United States could persuade Netanyahu to wind down the fighting before its worst outcomes are realized. In recent weeks, Trump has expressed growing displeasure at the war. In May, he said that “a lot of people are starving in Gaza,” and in a phone call with Netanyahu in early June, he told the Israeli leader that he must bring the war to a permanent end, according to The Times of Israel. Some daylight has begun to emerge between Israel and the United States on Gaza as well as on other issues, including the Houthis in Yemen, the new government in Syria, and even to some extent on Iran, notwithstanding the U.S. intervention. Despite ordering American bombers to strike the Fordow enrichment facility and two other nuclear sites on June 21, Trump abruptly imposed a cease-fire and criticized both sides for breaking it, indicating he has no interest in achieving broader Israeli aims. But it is far from clear whether the U.S. administration is prepared to back tough words on Gaza with actions.

If the Trump administration truly wanted to end the Gaza war, it could simply declare that Netanyahu's strategy of “negotiating under fire”—that is, starving and bombing the population of Gaza—has failed. Instead, it could insist on a return to the previous cease-fire formula, negotiated with intense U.S. involvement by both the Biden and the Trump administrations over many months, which led to the January-March truce. That formula was not a silver bullet and left many crucial issues, including the nature of a future Palestinian leadership, still to be negotiated. But during the brief pause in fighting, it brought freedom for 33 Israeli hostages and an urgent reprieve to Gaza's immiserated people. It also began to focus high-level regional and international attention on pragmatic, equitable approaches for Gaza's “day after.” Arab states stepped up to propose a plan for rebuilding and administering, with their support, a post-Hamas Gaza. Hamas itself had indicated that it was prepared to relinquish its role in a future government, and Western diplomats were beginning to explore ways to disarm the group and neutralize its threat to Israeli security.

In the absence of extraordinary U.S. pressure on Netanyahu, the chances of getting back on this track look slim. Netanyahu's pugnacious rhetoric, his growing reliance on the war and on his hard-right allies for his political survival, and the IDF's conduct on the ground all suggest a preference for fighting on. And so Israel's war plans appear likely to go ahead. They may prove successful, to a degree. It is possible that at least some of the surviving hostages will be retrieved in a blaze of gunfire, that more Hamas fighters will be killed, that the Israeli army will assert full control, and that the exhausted, traumatized people of Gaza will be persuaded in large numbers to leave. Netanyahu may be able to declare victory.

But the cost of all this could be appalling. Many more people in Gaza would die, and possibly also many more Israelis. As the IDF is forced to switch from a high-tech fight at stand-off distance—as the war has mostly been so far—to close urban combat in the Stalingrad-scape of Gaza's ruins, Israeli casualty numbers are sure to soar. Meanwhile, the enclave's 2.2 million survivors will be crammed in camps under Israeli guard, dependent entirely on highly restricted Israeli food handouts. Having pushed out international institutions, established humanitarian aid organizations, and all remnants of Palestinian civil society, the Israeli government may soon find that the fate of this huge population will rest squarely on its own shoulders.

            Zohran Mamdani delivered a political earthquake Tuesday in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, riding progressive demands for change in a city facing an affordability crisis to the brink of a stunning victory.
    


            Democratic voters rejected a scandal-plagued icon of the party's past, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Instead, they backed a 33-year-old democratic socialist who energized young voters and progressives with a campaign that could come to represent the first draft of a new playbook.
    


            “I will fight for a city that works for you, that is affordable for you, that is safe for you,” Mamdani said in his celebratory speech just after midnight.

            “We can be free and we can be fed. We can demand what we deserve,” he said.
    


            Mamdani's viral, go-anywhere, talk-to-anyone style of campaigning could send shockwaves through the Democratic Party nationally as its leaders and incumbents face calls from frustrated voters for authenticity and aggressiveness. Republicans, meanwhile, moved immediately to elevate Mamdani, seeing an opportunity to campaign against ideas they see as unpopular with swing voters nationally.
    


            The formal outcome won't be known until at least July 1, when New York City releases the initial ranked-choice results. But Mamdani held a clear lead Tuesday night, and Cuomo told supporters he had called Mamdani and conceded the primary.
    


            “Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won,” Cuomo said.
    


            Mamdani's upstart campaign had a lot to overcome — Cuomo's universal name recognition, massive financial backing, endorsements from party leaders and unions — and he acted like it.
    


            Some of his Democratic rivals portrayed his positions as pie-in-the-sky and impossible to pay for. Mamdani, though, sold his ideas as making life in the city easier to afford, building his campaign around an issue that ranks among the biggest reasons Democrats lost in the 2024 election.

            He sat for interviews with people that disagreed with him. He engaged in cross-endorsements with rivals, encouraging supporters to rank them highly as well on their ranked-choice ballots. He campaigned aggressively, including walking the length of Manhattan on Friday.
    


            “New Yorkers deserve a Mayor they can see, hear, even yell at. The city is in the streets,” Mamdani said on X.
    


            Dan Pfeiffer, a former top aide to President Barack Obama, said on X that Democrats “have a lot to learn” from Mamdani.
    


            “What's happening in NYC is a blaringly loud message to those in the Dem establishment who still cling to old politics, recite focus-grouped talking points, and are too afraid to say what needs to be said,” he said.
    


            Republicans were also thrilled with Mamdani's performance. The House GOP's campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, issued a press release declaring Mamdani “the new face” of the Democratic Party.
    


            “Every vulnerable House Democrat will own him, and every Democrat running in a primary will fear him,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said.
    


            Mamdani faced attacks from pro-Cuomo forces in the primary over what his opponents described as antisemitic comments, flagging Mamdani's sharp criticism of Israel and his defense of the phrase “globalize the intifada.”
    


            He also ran on progressive positions — including freezing rents, offering free public transit, launching city-run grocery stores and more — that Republicans are certain to use to portray Democrats as extreme, much like they have with previous progressive proposals like the “Green New Deal.”
    


            Those attacks are unlikely to help the GOP in the mayoral race in New York City, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans almost by about a six-to-one margin. But New York is home to a number of competitive House seats where the GOP could seek to put Democratic nominees on the defensive over Mamdani's positions.
    


            It's too soon to sort through everything Mamdani's performance means for the Democratic Party. But it did offer a glimpse at where the party is on some key issues and who within it holds sway with voters.

            Mamdani, who would become the city's first Muslim mayor if he wins in November, was a vocal critic of Israel's war in Gaza and didn't back down despite being criticized as antisemitic, a charge he repeatedly denied. He defended his views in an interview with CBS' Stephen Colbert in which he also acknowledged the fears Jewish people have faced since Hamas' October 7, 2023, terrorist attack in Israel.
    


            “There's no room for violence in this city, in this country, in this world. And what I have found also, for many New Yorkers, is an ability to navigate disagreement,” he told Colbert.
    


            He also demonstrated the influence of progressive New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed Mamdani. Other New York Democratic leaders, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and its two senators, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer, remained publicly neutral.
    


            The results similarly laid bare the ineffectiveness of Cuomo's effort — one backed by establishment Democratic forces that blanketed television airwaves but couldn't match the organic groundswell of a state assemblyman who started the race with little public profile.
    


            “Billionaires and lobbyists poured millions against you and our public finance system,” Ocasio-Cortez said of Mamdani on X. “And you won.”
    


            Cuomo had wanted a second act.
    


            The 67-year-old scion of one of New York's most prominent political families was forced out of the governor's office in 2021 amid a cloud of scandal — faced with allegations of sexual harassment that he denied and a report that his administration had covered up nursing home deaths during the coronavirus pandemic.
    


            The governor and the state's two senators stayed on the sidelines. But Cuomo's campaign was backed by many prominent New York Democrats and groups, including unions and elected officials who had criticized him four years ago but — seeing his lead in the polls — issued devil-we-know statements this year endorsing him.
    


            Though ranked-choice ballots need to be counted next week, Cuomo acknowledged the reality he faced on stage Tuesday, telling supporters he had called and congratulated Mamdani.
    


            “Tonight was Assemblyman Mamdani's night, and he put together a great campaign. And he touched young people, and inspired them, and moved them, and got them to come out and vote. And he really ran a highly impactful campaign. I called him, I congratulated him. I applaud him sincerely for his effort, and let's give him a round of applause and thank him for his campaign,” Cuomo said.
    


            His former political rivals, meanwhile, gloated over Cuomo's apparent failure.
    


            “Zohran ran a positive campaign talking about affordability. Cuomo ran a very negative, fear-based campaign. That just made a huge difference,” former Mayor Bill de Blasio said on CNN.
    


            In overwhelmingly Democratic New York City, a victorious Mamdani would ordinarily become the clear front-runner in November's general election. But he instead faces a competitive race with much different contours.
    


            First-term Mayor Eric Adams, who was elected as a Democrat four years ago, is seeking reelection as an independent.
    


            Adams' break from the party came as he faced backlash after President Donald Trump's Justice Department dropped its corruption charges against Adams, and Adams has cooperated with federal authorities to enforce Trump's mass deportation efforts.
    


            “What NYC deserves is a mayor who's proud to run on his record – not one who ran from his record, or one who has no record,” Adams posted on X Tuesday night. “We deserve a mayor who will keep driving down crime, support our police, fight antisemitism, and stand up for working-class New Yorkers.”
    


            Republican Curtis Sliwa was unopposed in the primary and will be the GOP nominee.
    


            And neither Cuomo nor Mamdani had ruled out the possibility of running in November on another party's ballot line if they lost the Democratic contest — Cuomo as the nominee of the newly created Fight and Deliver Party, or Mamdani as the nominee of the Working Families Party.

Follow:


President Donald Trump and Republican leaders are betting that key GOP holdouts will buckle under enormous pressure to pass his sweeping agenda within days – even as a number are warning they're prepared to sink the multi-trillion-dollar measure without major changes.
    


            But tensions are escalating between the House and Senate and between moderates and conservatives who are battling over competing versions – as Trump demands the bill on his desk by July 4.
    


            With the Senate planning a critical vote to begin debate as soon as Thursday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson are both racing to quell rebellions among their centrist and right-wing factions.
    


            Behind the scenes, Johnson and his allies are in high-stakes talks with Senate GOP leaders to resolve final sticking points, while stressing to their own House members that they may ultimately need to back the Senate's version because further cross-Capitol negotiations aren't feasible, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, a move certain to cause an outcry among many in his conference.
    


            That means GOP holdouts could ultimately be left with this choice: Vote for a plan they detest or sink the bill and endure Trump's wrath. GOP leaders in both chambers are gambling their members will choose the former.
    


            “When it comes over, we'll pass it,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told CNN. “We've been talking over a year. The time for voting is now.”
    


            But multiple House Republicans are fuming that the Senate rewrote their carefully crafted version of bill – most critically to propose deeper cuts on Medicaid – and are openly calling to blow past Trump's timeline to change it back.
    


            Plus Johnson now has at least three Republican hardliners declaring they will oppose the Senate version without even deeper spending cuts: Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland, Chip Roy of Texas and Eric Burlison of Missouri. And then there's the parochial issue dogging the GOP: The push led by New York Republicans to increase the amount taxpayers can deduct from their local levies, a deal that GOP senators want to gut and force House members to swallow.
    


            Some are warning they won't cave – a threat GOP leaders must weigh since they can only afford three defections in each chamber to pass the bill.
    


            “If they're trying to jam us with something that we can't support, then I think we need to take those extra days to make sure it's a good product,” said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, who was one of 16 House Republicans who declared in a letter to both GOP leaders on Tuesday that they couldn't support the Senate's Medicaid provisions without major changes. She also met with Johnson about the issue on Tuesday.
    


            Malliotakis was among several GOP lawmakers who told CNN she would support a formal “conference committee” between the House and Senate – against the wishes of Trump and GOP leaders, since it would dramatically slow down the president's agenda.
    


            Even Rep. David Joyce, a close leadership ally, said he was willing to miss Trump's July 4 deadline to fight for more of the House's original provisions.
    


            “I think a good bill deserves to take its time,” the Ohio Republican told CNN. “There's differences in what the Senate's talking about and what can pass here.”
    


            The GOP is largely united on the main tenets of the bill, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts for individuals and businesses, imposing new work requirements on social safety net programs and fulfilling the president's campaign promises like no tax on tips and overtime pay — all while providing hundreds of billions more for the Pentagon and border security agencies. But how to pay for many of those provisions has been far more contentious, including cuts to Medicaid and phasing out Biden-era energy tax credits.
    


            And official estimates that the measure could add more than $3.4 trillion to deficits over the next decade have left many on the right uneasy – in addition to the Senate's proposed $5 trillion increase to the national debt limit.
    


            Meanwhile, patience is running thin in the Senate, with many Republicans eager to move on and call their House counterparts' bluff.
    


            “It's a little arrogant to say the Senate has got to eat exactly what the House proposed. I mean it's a bicameral process,” Sen. Bernie Moreno, a Republican from Ohio.  “I don't look like Alexander Hamilton or James Madison do I? That's just the process our founders created.”
    


            And Trump himself is heaping pressure on Congress, posting on Truth Social on Tuesday: “Lock yourself in a room if you must, don't go home, and GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK.”
    


            Senate Republicans are particularly frustrated by the so-called SALT Caucus, the group of House Republicans in New York and California that is demanding bigger deductions on state and local tax payments.
    


            Those Republicans cut a deal with Johnson to win their support by raising the amount of state and local levies that eligible taxpayers can deduct to a $40,000 limit. Now, several of those New York Republicans say they won't accept a penny less than that number, even though Senate Republicans say they should jam the House with a less expensive deal.
    


            “I'm OK with them making crazy statements like that if they want,” said North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer, referring to the House Republicans from New York. “I hear ‘red line' a lot around here. I hear that a lot, but at the end of day, it turns into a rather light pink.”
    


            But those House GOP lawmakers pressing for tax relief said it would be a mistake to assume that they would simply swallow whatever SALT deal the Senate passes.
    


            “I think that would be the wrong assumption,” Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican and leading proponent of the House deal, told reporters Tuesday.
    


            Any whipping operation among House Republicans, however, is complicated by the still-fluid negotiations in the Senate. GOP senators are still tweaking their bill themselves and trying to navigate changes forced on them by the Senate parliamentarian's rulings that some of their provisions are out of order with strict Senate budget rules that they must follow to pass the bill along party lines.
    


            The biggest headache for Republicans, though, remains the fate of Medicaid.
    


            At least 20 centrist Republicans in both chambers are trying to reverse the Senate's biggest cuts to Medicaid, which were not part of the House-passed bill. But another group of GOP hardliners – including Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin – wants to slash even deeper from the program and have raised major concerns about the impact the bill would have on the deficit. And they all met with Trump on Monday night.
    


            During a closed-door meeting Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri who has been outspoken about his concerns the bill is cutting too much into Medicaid, said North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis gave out information to senators on how much rural hospitals in states like his could lose if some of the changes the Senate rolled out went into effect.
    


            At issue are new proposed limits on how much states can tax health care providers, a levy that helps fund the Medicaid program. Some key Republicans fear that the new proposed limits could devastate Medicaid providers, especially rural hospitals, and are demanding changes.
    


            “Senate leadership now needs to fix this,” Hawley said. “They're the ones who invented this new rural hospital defund scheme that the House says they can't pass. It's going to close rural hospitals. They need to get with rural hospitals, figure out what's going to work for them, and then they need to get the sign off of the House.”
    


            “The leadership needs to work on this with rural hospitals and the House,” he said. “This won't work to not ever talk to the House and hope that they just take the bill. That will land us in a conference committee. I don't want to do that.”
    


            Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and a key swing vote facing reelection next year, is pushing for the bill to include a relief fund to providers hardest hit by the new cuts — potentially around $100 billion although multiple sources told CNN that the number has been extremely fluid.
    


            “I've been very concerned about the cuts in Medicaid and the impact on my state, but other states as well,” Collins told CNN on Tuesday. “I've also been concerned about the health of rural hospitals, nursing homes, health centers and have been working on a provider relief fund. But that doesn't offset the problem with the Medicaid cuts.”
    


            Tillis, a Republican who like Collins is also up for reelection next year, said that the proposed Medicaid cuts could cost his state $38 billion over 10 years.
    


            “That's a big impact,” he told CNN. He added: “I'm very much in favor of moving in that direction. You just have to do it at a pace that states can absorb, or we're going to have bad outcomes, political and policy.”
    


            But if Trump and Senate GOP leaders give in to the demands of those holdouts, it would drive up the already hugely expensive price tag — prompting a revolt on the right.
    


            Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican who leads the House Freedom Caucus, contended that the Senate is moving in the wrong direction, calling for deeper cuts into Medicaid and saying it should more quickly eliminate green energy tax credits enacted under the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act. Harris voted “present” when the bill passed the House by a single vote last month.
    


            But Harris said he would go even further if forced to accept the Senate bill in the coming days.
    


            “If the Senate tries to jam the House with this version, I won't vote ‘ present.' I'll vote ‘NO,'” Harris said Tuesday.

            Television and film actor Joe Marinelli, who appeared in “The Morning Show” and “Santa Barbara,” to name a few titles, has died. He was 68.
    


            The news was confirmed by his agent Julie Smith, who told CNN via email on Tuesday that Marinelli had been battling throat and stomach cancer for a few years. No other details were provided.
    


            Marinelli had over 50 screen credits, primarily guest roles on popular television programs, with the exception of the daytime soap opera “Santa Barbara.”
    


            In 1988, Marinelli began portraying Bunny Tagliatti on the series. He played Tagliatti, a cross-dressing mobster, in more than 170 episodes through 1990, and won a Soap Opera Digest Award for his performance.
    


            His earlier appearances were in the mid-1980s, on popular shows including “Cagney & Lacey,” “Hill Street Blues” and “L.A. Law.”
    


            The actor went on to appear in a number of popular TV shows through the '90s, with credits including “ER,” “JAG” and “The King of Queens.”
    


            He returned to the daytime world in 1999, where he played Joseph Sorel on “General Hospital.”
    


            While Marinelli continued his work in television into the 2000s with appearances on “The West Wing,” “NYPD Blue” and “House,” he also acted in the acclaimed 2004 Alexander Payne film “Sideways.”
    


            Later credits for the actor included parts in “Insecure,” “Hollywood” and “The Offer.” His most recent project was “The Morning Show,” in which he played show director Donny Spagnoli in 20 episodes. Along with his cast, Marinelli was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award in 2022 for best dramatic ensemble.
    


            On Monday evening, Marinelli's costar from “Santa Barbara,” Leigh J. McCloskey, penned a tribute to the late actor on social media, writing, “He was a great acting partner, teacher, philosophical friend, passionate believer in people, and a storyteller extraordinaire.”
    


            “It saddens me greatly to say goodbye to my old friend and his belief in the goodness, and even the possible greatness of the human adventure,” McCloskey added. “I'm glad I walked this earth with you Joe.”

Follow:


    Editor's Note: This story was originally published on Monday and has been updated to reflect Andrew Cuomo conceding the mayoral primary race to Zohran Mamdani.



            Zohran Mamdani could barely walk a few feet at a recent Juneteenth festival in Queens without a crowd of selfie-demanding admirers trying to stop him.
    


            Mamdani is a 33-year-old state assemblyman and democratic socialist who surged in the campaign for New York City mayor with a mix of viral videos and proposals appealing to younger progressives. He capitalized on progressive frustration with Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor who was attempting a political comeback with a mayoral run; in one of his videos, he explains New York City's ranked-choice voting system in Hindi and Urdu and likens Cuomo to a Bollywood villain.
    


            Mamdani is poised to become the Democratic primary winner. Cuomo conceded to Mamdani on Tuesday night, though ranked-choice votes will be needed to declare a winner.
    


            Mamdani's rise caused growing consternation from the Democratic establishment. His critics argue his platform is too far to the left for moderates and certain to be weaponized by local and national Republicans trying to paint the Democratic Party as out of touch. He's also faced criticism about how he's addressed the Israel-Hamas war.
    


            That concern was hard to find at his campaign stops before the election, notably Thursday's festival in Queens. Mamdani stood onstage awkwardly but joyfully two-stepping and swaying side to side next to other candidates in the primary. Then he walked through the park on a sweltering day, joking that he was fine in his wool suit because he had on an undershirt.
    


            “We've seen a campaign that is powered by the hunger of New Yorkers for a new generation of leadership,” Mamdani told CNN.
    


            Here's what to know about Mamdani and his campaign.
    


            Mamdani is a three-term state assemblyman who represents parts of Queens, one of the the most diverse areas in the nation.
    


            He is an immigrant from Uganda who was first raised in Cape Town, South Africa, and later in New York City, attending the prestigious Bronx High School of Science before enrolling at Bowdoin College. He is the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, and Mira Nair, an Indian filmmaker whose credits include “Mississippi Masala” and “Monsoon Wedding.”

Takeaways from New York City's mayoral primary: Mamdani delivers a political earthquake



            Prior to his mayoral campaign, Mamdani made national headlines in 2021 when he joined New York City cab drivers on a 15-day hunger strike seeking relief from excessive debt. He also moonlighted as a rapper under the stage name Mr. Cardamom rapping about chapati, an Indian flatbread and worked as foreclosure prevention counselor.
    


            If elected mayor, he would become one of the youngest people to ever hold the post. Mamdani would also become the first Muslim mayor in the history of the city — home to more than half a million Muslims and one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel.
    


            Mamdani wants to freeze the rent for nearly 1 million New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments and provide free city bus service, universal childcare and city-subsidized grocery stores.
    


            Mamdani has said he will pay for it all by raising taxes on the city's wealthiest, even though he would have little power to do so from City Hall. Taxes can be raised or lowered only by state lawmakers with approval from the governor. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has already thrown cold water on the proposal, saying the move is likely to drive more New Yorkers out of the concrete jungle and toward Florida and other lower-tax destinations.
    


            Mamdani's campaign has raised $7 million from thousands of individual donors and mobilized an army of volunteers. He secured the endorsement of Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the United Auto Workers union.
    


            “This race is not just symbolic about the future of New York City, this race is symbolic about the future of our country,” Ocasio-Cortez said during a campaign rally packed with more than 2,000 supporters last week. “For so long we have had political leadership, including in the Democratic Party, that has just wanted to play it safe.”
    


            Democratic establishment concern was laid out in a pre-election call held by Third Way, a national think tank that favors a centrist political agenda. The group released a memo last week, warning that a Mamdani's win would be “a devastating blow in the fight to defeat Trumpism.”
    


            “We're really worried about all Democrats going forward if Mamdani were to win,” Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs, told reporters during the call. “Even if he doesn't win the election, if he just wins the Democratic nomination, that can hurt Democrats.”
    


            Cuomo has made his long career in government and experience with President Donald Trump the cornerstones of his comeback run. He dismisses Mamdani as an inexperienced leader with unrealistic ideas and suggests Trump would run through Mamdani like “a hot knife through butter.”
    


            “He's never done any of the essentials. And now you have Donald Trump on top of all of that,” Cuomo said during a recent debate.
    


            Mamdani responded by zeroing in on Cuomo's sexual harassment scandals, his reputation as a bully and his billionaire donors. Cuomo has repeatedly denied the misconduct allegations.
    


            “I've never had to resign in disgrace,” Mamdani said during one debate. “I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. I have never sued for their gynecological records. And I have never done these things because I am not you, Mr. Cuomo.”
    


            Cuomo and other rivals of Mamdani called out how he's spoken about antisemitism and the Israel-Hamas war.
    


            Mamdani has accused the Israeli government of carrying out a “genocide.” And he defended the use of the slogan “globalize the intifada” as a rallying cry for Palestinian human rights during an interview with The Bulwark.
    


            Mamdani said he believed the phrase was about “a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights,” explaining that the US Holocaust Museum used a similar Arabic word meaning “uprising” to describe the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against the Nazis.
    


            “I have shared my opinions with New Yorkers over the course of this race, opinions that always come back to a belief in universal human rights, that means taking on antisemitism and Islamophobia,” Mamdani told CNN.
    


            Mamdani's campaign has proposed making an increase of 800% for the city's anti-hate crime program.
    


            Still, the criticism to those comments came fast and furious. Mamdani was condemned by the Holocaust Museum and some fellow Democrats for using a phrase they believe encourages violence against Jews.
    


            City Comptroller Brad Lander, who ran third in Tuesday night's primary and appeared on stage at Mamdani's party, has said he preferred Mamdani avoid the term altogether.

            Mamdani's reaction was equally visceral. He became emotional and cried while speaking with reporters about the backlash, detailing the multiple threats and the near-constant harassing calls his office now receives on a daily basis.
    


            “It pains me to be painted as if I am somehow to the very Jewish New Yorkers that I know and love that are such a key part of this city,” Mamdani said. “When I speak, when I speak with emotion I am characterized by rivals as being a monster. I get messages that say, ‘The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim.' I get threats on my life, on the people that I love.”
    


            He has also accused a pro-Cuomo PAC of designing a campaign mailer that featured his photo appearing to be altered to make his beard look darker and thicker next to text saying Mamdani “rejects Jewish rights.” The Cuomo campaign said it never sent out the mailer and it was made up by an independent vendor.
    


            Mamdani called the strikes ordered by Trump “a new, dark chapter in his endless series of betrayals.”
    


            “While Donald Trump bears immediate responsibility for this illegal escalation, these actions are the result of a political establishment that would rather spend trillions of dollars on weapons than lift millions out of poverty, launch endless wars while silencing calls for peace, and fearmonger about outsiders while billionaires hollow out our democracy from within,” he said in a statement.

President Donald Trump says a ceasefire between Iran and Israel is in effect after the deal initially faltered leaving Trump frustrated with both sides.

U.S. President Donald Trump said a ceasefire between Iran and Israel was in effect Tuesday after the deal initially faltered, and the American leader expressed deep frustration with both sides. Israel had earlier accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace after the truce was supposed to take effect. Iran is insisting that Israel broke the spirit of the ceasefire, claiming that it carried out attacks after it shouldn't have.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israel's war against Iran “brought to ruin” the country's nuclear program. He listed Israel's achievements in the war, including its attacks on top generals and nuclear scientists.

The UnitedStates told the United Nations Security Council that the U.S. will will not turn a blind eye to Iran's noncompliance and ongoing threat to regional stability.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel appeared to hold Tuesday after initially faltering, and U.S. President Donald Trump expressed frustration with both sides, saying they had fought “for so long and so hard” that they do not know what they are doing.

But even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Israel had brought Iran's nuclear program “to ruin,” a new U.S. intelligence report found that the program has been set back only a few months after U.S. strikes over the weekend, according to two people familiar with the assessment.

The early report issued Monday by the Defense Intelligence Agency was described to The Associated Press by two people familiar with it. They were not authorized to address the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The report also contradicts statements from Trump, who has said the Iranian nuclear program was “completely and fully obliterated.” The White House called the assessment “flat-out wrong.”

After the truce was supposed to take effect, Israel accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace, and the Israeli finance minister vowed that “Tehran will tremble.”

The Iranian military denied firing on Israel, state media reported, but explosions boomed and sirens sounded across northern Israel in the morning, and an Israeli military official said two Iranian missiles were intercepted.




Trump told reporters at the White House before departing for a NATO summit that, in his view, both sides had violated the nascent agreement. He had particularly strong words for Israel, a close ally, while suggesting Iran may have fired on the country by mistake.

But later he said the deal was saved.

“ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly “Plane Wave” to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!” Trump said in his Truth Social post.

Indeed, Netanyahu's office said he held off on tougher strikes against Iran after speaking to Trump.

Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday the Islamic Republic emerged “proud and steadfast” from the aggression by Israel and the United States.

“This proves one simple truth more clearly than ever: diplomacy and dialogue are the only path to resolving the unnecessary crisis over Iran's peaceful program,” he said.

The conflict, now in its 12th day, began with Israel targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites, saying it could not allow Tehran to develop atomic weapons and that it feared the Islamic Republic was close. Iran has long maintained that its program is peaceful.

If the truce holds, it will provide a global sense of relief after the U.S. intervened by dropping bunker-buster bombs on nuclear sites — a move that risked further destabilizing the volatile region. 

Trump phoned Netanyahu after the American bombing on Sunday and told him not to expect additional U.S. military attacks and that he should seek a diplomatic solution with Iran, a senior White House official said.

Trump's position was that the U.S. had removed any imminent threat posed by Iran, according to the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about sensitive diplomatic talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Israel followed up the U.S. air attacks by expanding the kinds of targets it was hitting.

After Tehran launched a limited retaliatory strike Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar, Trump announced the ceasefire.

A protracted conflict could have a broad economic impact if Iran closed the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping channel.

China, which is Iran's largest trading partner and only remaining oil customer, condemned the U.S. attacks and said it was concerned about a “spiral of escalations” without a ceasefire. Trump suggested the ceasefire would allow Iranian oil to continue to flow, saying on social media that China could keep purchasing crude from Iran.

The deal got off to a rocky start.

An Israeli military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations said Iran launched two missiles at Israel hours into the tenuous ceasefire. Both were intercepted, the official said.

Iranian state television reported that the military denied firing missiles after the start of the ceasefire — while condemning Israel for predawn strikes of its own.

One of those attacks killed a high-profile nuclear scientist, Mohammad Reza Sedighi Saber, at his father-in-law's residence in northern Iran, Iranian state TV reported.

Trump's frustration with the early morning strikes was palpable as he spoke to reporters before departing for the Hague. He said both sides had violated the agreement and used an expletive to hammer home his point.

“We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f—- they're doing,” he said.

Netanyahu said Israel agreed to the ceasefire with Iran, in coordination with Trump, after the country achieved all of its war goals, including removing the threat of Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

In a televised statement, Netanyahu said late Tuesday that Israel took out top generals and nuclear scientists and destroyed nuclear facilities in Natanz, Isfahan and the Arak heavy water reactor. He thanked Trump for his help.

It's unclear what role Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's leader, played in the talks. He said earlier on social media that he would not surrender.

Trump said Tuesday that he wasn't seeking regime change in Iran, two days after floating the idea himself in a social media post.

“I don't want it,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “Regime change takes chaos and, ideally, we don't want to see much chaos.”

Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that the U.S. and Iran are already in early discussions about resuming negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. He called the direct talks and discussions through intermediaries “promising.”

Before the ceasefire was announced, Israel's military said Iran launched 20 missiles toward Israel. Police said they damaged at least three densely packed residential buildings in the city of Beersheba. First responders said they retrieved four bodies from one building and were searching for more. At least 20 people were injured.

Outside, the shells of burned out cars littered the streets. Broken glass and rubble covered the area. Police said some people were injured while inside their apartments' reinforced safe rooms, which are meant to withstand rockets but not direct hits from ballistic missiles.

The attack followed a limited Iranian missile assault Monday on a U.S. military base in Qatar in retaliation for earlier American bombing of its nuclear sites. The U.S. was warned by Iran in advance, and there were no casualties.

Elsewhere, U.S. forces shot down drones attacking the Ain al-Assad base in the desert in western Iraq and a base next to the Baghdad airport, while another one crashed, according to a senior U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

No casualties were reported, and no group claimed responsibility for the attacks in Iraq. Some Iran-backed Iraqi militias had previously threatened to target U.S. bases if the U.S. attacked Iran.

In Israel, at least 28 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the war. Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 974 people and wounded 3,458 others, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists.

The group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from Iranian unrest, said of those killed, it identified 387 civilians and 268 security force personnel.

The U.S. has evacuated some 250 American citizens and their immediate family members from Israel by government, military and charter flights that began over the weekend, a State Department official said.

There are roughly 700,000 American citizens, most of them dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, believed to be in Israel.

Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday night after Andrew Cuomo conceded the race in a stunning upset, as the young, progressive upstart built a substantial lead over the more experienced but scandal-scarred former governor.

Democratic mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo cast his ballot in New York's mayoral primary. New York City Democrats will decide Tuesday whether to reboot Cuomo's political career, elevate liberal upstart Zohran Mamdani, or turn to a less-polarizing candidate.

Andrew Cuomo. (AP Video: David R. Martin)

NEW YORK (AP) — Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday night after Andrew Cuomo conceded the race in a stunning upset, as the young, progressive upstart who was virtually unknown when the contest began built a substantial lead over the more experienced but scandal-scarred former governor.

Though the race's ultimate outcome will still be decided by a ranked choice count, Mamdani took a commanding position just hours after the polls closed.

With victory all but assured, Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist who ran an energetic campaign centered on the cost of living, told supporters, “I will be your Democratic nominee for the mayor of New York City.”

“I will be the mayor for every New Yorker, whether you voted for me, for Governor Cuomo, or felt too disillusioned by a long-broken political system to vote at all,” he said. “I will work to be a mayor you will be proud to call your own.”




Cuomo, who had been the front-runner throughout a race that was his comeback bid from a sexual harassment scandal, conceded the election, telling a crowd that he had called Mamdani to congratulate him.

“Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won,” Cuomo told supporters.






Cuomo trailed Mamdani by a significant margin in the first choice ballots and faced an exceedingly difficult pathway to catching up when ballots are redistributed in New York City's ranked choice voting process.

Mamdani, a member of the state Assembly since 2021, would be the city's first Muslim and Indian American mayor if elected. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams skipped the primary. He's running as an independent in the general election. Cuomo also has the option of running in the general election.

“We are going to take a look and make some decisions,” Cuomo said.

Cuomo and Mamdani were a study in political contrasts and could have played stand-ins for the larger Democratic Party's ideological divide, with one candidate a fresh-faced progressive and the other an older moderate.

Cuomo characterized the city as a threatening, out-of-control place desperate for an experienced leader who could restore order. He brought the power of a political dynasty to the race, securing an impressive array of endorsements from important local leaders and labor groups, all while political action committees created to support his campaign pulled in staggering sums of cash.

Mamdani, meanwhile, offered an optimistic message that life in the city could improve under his agenda, which was laser-focused on the idea that a mayor has the power to do things that lower the cost of living. The party's progressive wing coalesced behind him and he secured endorsements from two of the country's foremost progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Unofficial results from the New York City's Board of Elections showed that Mamdani was ranked on more ballots than Cuomo. Mamdani was listed as the second choice by tens of thousands of more voters than Cuomo. And the number of votes that will factor into ranked choice voting is sure to shrink. More than 200,000 voters only listed a first choice, the Board of Elections results show, meaning that Mamdani's performance in the first round may ultimately be enough to clear the 50% threshold.

The race's ultimate outcome could say something about what kind of leader Democrats are looking for during President Donald Trump's second term.

The primary winner will go on to face incumbent Adams, a Democrat who decided to run as an independent amid a public uproar over his indictment on corruption charges and the subsequent abandonment of the case by Trump's Justice Department. Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, will be on the ballot in the fall's general election.

The rest of the pack has struggled to gain recognition in a race where nearly every candidate has cast themselves as the person best positioned to challenge Trump's agenda.

Comptroller Brad Lander, a liberal city government stalwart, made a splash last week when he was arrested after linking arms with a man federal agents were trying to detain at an immigration court in Manhattan. In the final weeks of the race, Lander and Mamdani cross endorsed one another in an attempt to boost their collective support and damage Cuomo's bid under the ranked choice voting system.

Among the other candidates are City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer.

Mamdani's grassroots run has been hard not to notice.

His army of young canvassers relentlessly knocked on doors throughout the city seeking support. Posters of his grinning mug were up on shop windows. You couldn't get on social media without seeing one of his well-produced videos pitching his vision — free buses, free child care, new apartments, a higher minimum wage and more, paid for by new taxes on rich people.

That youthful energy was apparent Tuesday evening, as both cautiously optimistic canvassers and ecstatic supporters lined the streets of Central Brooklyn on a sizzling hot summer day, creating a party-like atmosphere that spread from poll sites into the surrounding neighborhoods.

Outside his family's Caribbean apothecary, Amani Kojo, a 23-year-old first-time voter, passed out iced tea to Mamdani canvassers, encouraging them to stay hydrated.

“It's 100 degrees outside and it's a vibe. New York City feels alive again,” Kojo said, raising a pile of Mamdani pamphlets. “It feels very electric seeing all the people around, the flyers, all the posts on my Instagram all day.”

Cuomo and some other Democrats have cast Mamdani as unqualified. They say he doesn't have the management chops to wrangle the city's sprawling bureaucracy or handle crises. Critics have also taken aim at Mamdani's support for Palestinian human rights.

In response, Mamdani has slammed Cuomo over his sexual harassment scandal and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cuomo resigned in 2021 after a report commissioned by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women. He has always maintained that he didn't intentionally harass the women, saying he had simply fallen behind what was considered appropriate workplace conduct.

Arizona Diamondbacks star second baseman Ketel Marte was in tears during a pitching change in the seventh inning of the team's 4-1 win over the Chicago White Sox at Rate Field on Tuesday. 

Marte, 31, was left in tears after a fan yelled derogatory comments about his late mother. Marte's mother, Elpidia Valdez, died in a car crash in the Dominican Republic in 2017. Diamondbacks' manager Torey Lovullo consoled the tearful Marte on the mound and put his arm around him during the pitching change.

Lovullo said he heard what the fan said towards Marte, and a Diamondbacks' spokesperson told the Arizona Republic that Lovullo and bench coach Jeff Banis asked for the person to be removed from the game. 

""It was a terrible moment, fans are nasty, fans go too far,"" an emotional Lovullo said to reporters after the game. ""I just reacted as a dad would when I went out to change pitchers,"" Lovullo said, per the Arizona Republic. ""I could see he was sobbing. It hurt.""

Lovullo added that he told Marte that he was not alone and that the heckler was ""an idiot.""

Lovullo said he loves all of his players and that he is going to protect them. 

""I've known Ketel for nine years, and he's had some unbelievably great moments and some hardships as well and some really rough moments in his life and I know those. At the end of the day, we're human beings, and we have emotions and I saw him hurting, and I wanted to protect him.""

Diamondbacks shortstop Geraldo Perdomo said the fan ""should be banned, for sure.""

""That can't happen,"" Perdomo said. ""We can't continue to do that ... here in MLB.""

Marte declined to comment on the incident through a team official.

In 52 games, the two-time All-Star has a .316 batting average with 14 home runs and 31 RBI.

The Diamondbacks (41-38) play the White Sox (25-55) play the final game of their three-game series at 2:10 p.m. ET on Wednesday. The Diamondbacks are going for the series sweep, as they won the first two games of the series.

Ex-Marine and author Dannion Brinkley discusses his near-death experience and shares his life lessons on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Twenty people were injured on Tuesday afternoon when lightning struck a popular summertime lake destination in Lexington County, South Carolina. 

According to county officials, eight adults and 12 children were electrocuted when lightning struck Lake Murray at Dominion Beach Park. Twelve of the victims were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. 

The Lexington County Sheriff's Department, along with the county's fire service and EMS, quickly responded to the scene.

FAMILY SAYS VEHICLE HIT BY LIGHTNING ON HIGHWAY SOUNDED LIKE A GUNSHOT

""Strong relationships with other local agencies played a critical role in ensuring a quick, coordinated response, allowing first responders to assess patients efficiently and provide the best possible care,"" the county said. 

Dominion Beach Park is expected to reopen Wednesday after a safety inspection by local authorities. 

The news of the mass strike comes after a 29-year-old Colorado man was killed in a lightning strike during his honeymoon in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, last Friday.

HONEYMOON ENDS IN TRAGEDY AS LIGHTNING STRIKE CLAIMS NEWLEYWED'S LIFE ON FLORIDA BEACH

Over the weekend, four Kentucky women vacationing in Marco Island, Florida were also reportedly struck by lightning. 

According to the National Lightning Safety Council, there have been four fatal lightning strikes in the United States so far in 2025. Those deaths occurred in Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Florida. 

There were 12 lightning fatalities in 2024, according to the organization.

""While lightning fatalities have decreased over the past 30 years, lightning continues to be one of the top storm-related killers in the United States,"" the awareness group's website says. ""In addition, lightning injures many more people than it kills and leaves some survivors with life-long health problems.""

The organization advises postponing events if there will be lightning in the area, and notes that lightning can strike up to 10 miles from a thunderstorm.

""Summertime leisure activities such as fishing, boating, camping, going to the beach, etc. contribute to about two-thirds of the lightning fatalities with the remainder related to work or routine daily activities,"" the group said. ""The best way to protect yourself from lightning is to plan ahead so that you can avoid the lightning threat.""

Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner spoke to Fox News Digital.

EXCLUSIVE: The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Commonwealth of Virginia will announce Wednesday that the agency will be the first major cabinet department to relocate out of Washington, D.C. during President Donald Trump's term.

Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and HUD Secretary Scott Turner are set to christen the agency's new home at the already existing National Science Foundation (NSF) building in Alexandria's Carlyle-Eisenhower neighborhood, which is also home to a Wegman's grocery store, a movie theater and several shops and high-end restaurants.

HUD's current headquarters on L'Enfant Plaza is also on the Senate DOGE Caucus' list of buildings they want to see sold off to save taxpayer funds. The curved X-shaped granite building, officially called the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, is ""underutilized,"" according to their rubric.

Turner noted that the relocation will unlock hundreds of millions in taxpayer savings and address serious health concerns among staff at L'Enfant.

‘FOR SALE': DOGE MOVES TO SELL OFF ALMOST HALF A BILLION IN FEDERAL REAL ESTATE, RELOCATE CABINET AGENCY HQS

""It is time to turn the page on the Weaver Building and relocate to a new headquarters that prioritizes the well-being of HUD employees and properly reflects the passion and excellence of our team,"" Turner told Fox News Digital.

""There are serious concerns with the current state of HUD's headquarters, including health hazards, leaks, and structural and maintenance failures. Many of these risks will needlessly and irresponsibly continue to absorb taxpayer dollars. Relocating is about more than just changing buildings; it's about a mission-minded shift that we hope will inspire every employee.""

Turner, a former Washington Redskins cornerback, added that it also aligns with President Donald Trump's vision for a ""New American Golden Age.""

Youngkin was equally enthused about HUD's move to the Old Dominion.

HUD SECRETARY SCOTT TURNER LAYS OUT AGENCY WINS DURING FIRST 100 DAYS, SHARES PRIORITIES FOR NEXT 100

""Virginia is a great place to be headquartered, and we are excited to welcome the Department of Housing and Urban Development and their over 2,700 headquarters-based employees to the best state in America to live, work, and raise a family,"" Youngkin told Fox News Digital.

Amid plans by then-Elon Musk-led DOGE to relocate federal workers, Youngkin faced criticism for not speaking out more forcefully against the administration — criticism that largely fizzled after Wednesday's announcement revealed the new headquarters would be just a few stops from downtown Washington on the Metro's Yellow Line.

""Since the Trump administration started transforming the federal government to better serve the American people, our team has been focused on seizing the new opportunities that this presents for the commonwealth,"" Youngkin said. ""Virginia is the proud home to many public and private sector headquarters, and we thank HUD leadership for trusting us and are committed to supporting your important national mission.""

Youngkin had taken slings and arrows over his support for such DOGE efforts, including from Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Mount Vernon, who previously criticized his position on federal worker relocation.

""This is about people's jobs, their lives, their ability to support their families, and it's about the future of the Virginia economy,"" Surovell told VPM.

The HUD relocation, however, falls just across Cameron Run Creek from Surovell's district.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the Senate DOGE committee chairwoman, praised Youngkin and Turner for the move.

""The Robert C. Weaver Building is a vacant and run-down monument to waste with half a billion dollars in overdue maintenance,"" Ernst said, calling it a ""cross between a ghost town and a horror show.""

""It is a true federal fixer-upper and perfect candidate to be put on the auction block. My For Sale Act will sell off this and five other money pits to downsize Washington's portfolio of underutilized buildings, generate $400 million in revenue, and save taxpayers billions in maintenance.""

Michael Peters, the commissioner of the General Services Administration, which manages federal real estate, praised the move to Virginia, saying it reflects his agency's commitment to fiscal responsibility and ""mission effectiveness.""

Investments to-date in the Weaver building totaled $90 million over the past 15 years, including plaza, roof and façade repairs.

HUD expects ""significant demand"" from the private sector for its old home – located just east of the Smithsonian, south of the National Mall and within walking distance of the new Waterfront Wharf social area.

Mold and asbestos containment have plagued the building, which also has only about half of its elevators in working operation.

The agency also noted there are about 1,000 more employees at HUD versus NSF – which they calculated to effect a $51-per-square-foot savings on building usage and maintenance.

Pittsburgh Pirates star Oneil Cruz has gone through a rough few games.

Cruz's error and lackadaisical effort following a passed ball in center field raised eyebrows last week, and then, on Tuesday, he was removed from the game after he lost track of outs.

Pirates manager Don Kelly took Cruz out after he failed to run out a double-play grounder against the Milwaukee Brewers. He grounded into a 6-4-3 double play. Kelly said Cruz was removed because of ""energy and effort going down the line.""

Cruz told reporters through an interpreter he understood the decision.

""DK had all the rights to do what he did, and I'll back him up on that,"" Cruz said. ""It was my fault because I thought there were two outs in that situation. That's why I let off running to first base.""

Kelly said he and Cruz spoke afterward, and he communicated his expectations.

Cruz suffered an outfield blunder against the Texas Rangers. He misjudged a ball and watched it roll to the fence in the first inning of that game.

On top of everything else, Cruz is not hitting like the slugger he has been promised to be. He has batted .156 with 31 strikeouts this month. Overall, he is hitting .211 with an OPS of .736 and 13 home runs. He is leading the National League with 26 stolen bases but leads MLB with 101 strikeouts.

""He's struggling at the plate right now,"" Kelly said. ""It's difficult when you're going through that and trying to figure it out. He's working hard to do that. That's one thing we've got to be mindful of, is not letting that offense carry over to defense and base running, and the energy and effort that we're giving on any other aspects of the game as well.""

Cruz maintained that his issue on the basepaths had nothing to do with his slump at the plate.

""They're a really good example,"" Cruz said. ""They always run hard. They always go out there to do their 100%. That's a teaching point for me. I accepted the way DK came to me and explained it and presented it to me.""

Pittsburgh fell to 32-48 this season after losing 9-3 to the Brewers. The Pirates are 20-22 since Kelly took over for Derek Shelton as manager.

Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac tells Fox News Digital why he believes the on-court rivalry between WNBA stars Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese has been good for women's basketball.

Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese and Los Angeles Sparks player Rickea Jackson got into a shoving match during their game on Tuesday night.

The incident occurred in the first quarter of their game. Jackson and Sky player Rebecca Allen got tied up going for the loose ball. Jackson and Allen exchanged words when Reese pulled Allen away from the scrum. The WNBA referee called a double technical foul on Jackson and Allen.

As the two continued to jaw at each other, Reese stepped in and pushed Jackson away from her teammate, resulting in the Sparks' second-year player pushing back.

Sparks star Kelsey Plum stepped in to break up the scrum. Coaches and players from both teams then came onto the floor to stop the incident from escalating further.

It appeared cooler heads would prevail. Reese and Jackson were seen hugging each other once the game was over.

Chicago won the game, 97-86, as Reese finished with a double-double. She had 18 points, 17 rebounds, six assists and four steals. Kamilla Cardoso led Chicago with 27 points and seven rebounds.

Azura Stevens had 21 points for the Sparks with Plum scoring 20. Jackson notched 11 points.

Fox News senior correspondent Claudia Cowan joins 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss President Donald Trump and Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon threatening to cut finding to California schools over the transgender athlete ban.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke to Fox News Digital during a tour stop during the Independent Women's Forum bus tour in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Monday. 

McMahon has been a key figure in the Trump administration's mission to counter trans athlete inclusion in women's and girls' sports, directing the Department of Education to launch several Title IX investigations into institutions that have enabled incidents to occur.

Five months into her position, McMahon has helped spearhead the formation of a new federal Title IX Investigations team in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice.

Meanwhile, the ongoing national culture war over the issue burns hotter than it ever has. 

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt and prominent conservative influencer Riley Gaines are among those on the right who have suggested potential criminal prosecution for officials who allow biological males to compete in women's and girls' sports. 

The recent high school sports season has featured several instances of female athletes protesting and demonstrating against transgender opponents, whether it be forfeits or medal podium stunts, in a growing viral trend. 

Fox News Digital (FND): What is your stance on the idea of criminal prosecution coming to officials who don't enforce Title IX and allow [biological] males to compete in girls' sports?

McMahon: ""I haven't actually addressed that with the Department of Justice, but it's certainly something that if the president would like us to look into it, we certainly would.""

FND: Going into [the next high school sports season], how important do you think it is that high school girl athletes make an effort to demonstrate against Democrat state lawmakers that don't enforce Title IX? 

McMahon: ""I think it's very important, it's one of the things that I mentioned today when I was delivering my remarks to this group. I congratulated those young women for taking such a stand and I encouraged them to continue to do that. 

""Because that's what's going to make a difference, is to have these women athletes and these girl athletes who are really very strong and deserve the right to be able to play in the sport of their choice, but to compete against girls, because it's just an unfair playing field otherwise.""And they have to stand up for their own rights. And also know that we're going to be standing behind them.""

FND: What can states [like California, Maine and Minnesota] expect in the second half of the year now that we're going on four to five months since President Trump signed the [Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports] executive order and they're still not following it?

McMahon: ""They run the risk of having their federal funding withdrawn. That's the main thing that's on the table. We have a task for that the Department of Education is doing with the Department of Justice to investigate Title IX violations and that's what we're doing. So the penalties are on the table for those that we find to be in violation.""

Democratic New York City Council candidate and former Rep. Anthony Weiner failed on Tuesday in his bid to return to the political scene after a career plagued by scandal.

Weiner was running against a menagerie of opponents in New York's 2nd City Council district Democratic primary, including state Assemblyman Harvey Epstein, Sarah Batchu, Andrea Gordillo, and Allie Ryan.

With over 80% of the votes counted on Tuesday night, Weiner held only just over 10% of the share, with Epstein at nearly 40% and Batchu and Gordillo at just over 20%. 

The former congressman entered politics in 1991 when he won a contested Democratic primary for the city's 48th council seat, later serving until 1998 when he won election to Congress.

Weiner then found himself embroiled in scandal as he neared the middle of his seventh term in Congress.

In May 2011, Weiner posted a sexually explicit photograph of himself on his Twitter account, saying he meant to send it to a woman who was following him. Weiner was married at the time to former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

He denied posting the image before admitting to doing so in a press conference. Weiner also said he “exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years.”

Weiner would resign from Congress less than a month later and disappeared from the political spotlight until reappearing to run for mayor of New York City in 2013. Weiner would be among the front-runners until another sexting scandal tanked his campaign, ultimately leading to him finishing fifth in the race.

Then another major scandal hit. Weiner would be investigated by the FBI in 2016 for sexting a 15-year-old from North Carolina before he surrendered to the agency and pleaded guilty to a charge of transferring obscene material to a minor. Weiner was required to register as a sex offender and sentenced to 21 months in prison.

He would be released and sent to a halfway house in 2019. Weiner was freed several months later.

His 2025 candidacy was his first step back into electoral politics in years, and he pleaded with voters to give him another chance.

“I'm not denying. I'm not pointing fingers. I'm not asking for a pardon,” Weiner said last month.

One of the original employees of the Department of Government Efficiency, formerly led by Elon Musk, has left the federal government. 

Edward Coristine, the 19-year-old high school graduate who goes by “Big Balls,” left the job and the Trump administration this week. A social media account under his name confirmed that he left.

“I'm officially out of that office. Can't say too much yet, Appreciate everyone who's reached out. Feels good to finally breathe again… Time to shift priorities and run a meatballs coin scam,” Coristine posted. “But I'll make a post explaining what happened soon.”

In February he claimed he was starting a job at the State Department. Later that month, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security, listed Coristine in a directory as a senior adviser.

Coristine drew eyes on him not only for his young age and lack of experience, but also having previously been fired from his internship at a cybersecurity firm for leaking company secrets, according to Bloomberg News. He had also briefly interned at Neuralink, a Musk-owned company.

As late as last month, Coristine was still an active member of DOGE. He attended a meeting on May 5 with the Commerce Department regarding Trump's Golden Visa and a meeting on May 15 regarding the potential implementation of the DOGE agenda at the military.

According to WIRED, which first reported his departure, he was one of the most trusted members of the DOGE team. He was deployed across multiple federal agencies and had multiple federal laptops to his name.

Coristine was additionally one of a handful of DOGE-affiliated staffers in President Donald Trump's White House who were occasionally seen at General Services Administration headquarters in Washington, D.C. His workspace was on the sixth floor of the office.

In addition to working in the GSA, Coristine worked in the U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, and was most recently working within the Social Security Administration, and had an email address affiliated with the agency.

As for the name: Coristine confirmed the nickname on Fox News when host Jesse Watters asked “Who is Big Balls?” during an interview with the DOGE team, and Musk said “that should be obvious” as Coristine raised his hand.

With a repurposed app and free teddy bears, the Trump administration is pressuring migrants to leave.

The other night, while watching a baseball game, I saw my first ad for self-deportation. One minute Shohei Ohtani was at the plate and then suddenly there was Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, looking stern and urging immigrants to self-deport using the administration's new app, CBP Home.

“Do what's right,” Noem advised. “Leave now.”

The taxpayer-funded ad had started like a campaign commercial, praising President Donald Trump for locking down the southern border. Then it flashed images of rape suspects, alleged gang members, and others arrested by ICE. And then came footage of U.S. deportees sent to El Salvador, stripped to their underwear and forced to kneel before black-clad prison guards in masks.  “If you are here illegally, you're next,” Noem said into the camera. She seemed to imply that anyone who doesn't use CBP Home will go straight to the Gulag.

Adam Serwer: The deportation show

“You will never return,” Noem said. “But if you register using our CBP Home app and leave now, you could be allowed to return legally.”

Noem's carrot-or-stick offer distilled the broader messaging strategy of the mass-deportation campaign at the center of Trump's second term. The campaign, and its goal of 1 million deportations a year, has been designed to generate fear using harsh enforcement tactics and lurid imagery: military flights to Guantánamo, foreign prison cells packed with face-tattooed inmates, federal agents in battle gear fanning out in U.S. streets like they're storming Fallujah.

The more the Trump administration can scare immigrants, the more likely they will opt to leave on their own, officials have told me. They view self-deportation as a more humane alternative to ICE handcuffs and believe that its appeal will grow as the crackdown intensifies. But how to encourage self-deporters and keep track of their departures? That's what CBP Home is for.

The Trump administration has not said how many people have used CBP Home to self-deport. But a senior administration official told me that more than 7,000 people have signed up so far, and of those, more than 3,000 have confirmed departures using the app. Use of the app is growing fast, but that's still fewer than than the number of people ICE officers arrest over an average three-day period. The administration is trying to scare migrants into leaving while expecting their trust and personal information on the way out.

The Trump administration sees the app as a psychological instrument of its policy goals—which, ironically, is how the Biden administration also used it.

In January 2023, when record numbers of migrants were streaming across the U.S.-Mexico border illegally each month, Biden officials turned to CBP One, a scheduling app that had been set up years earlier by U.S. Customs and Border Protection primarily to facilitate cargo inspections for trucking companies. Biden officials rejiggered it to allow asylum seekers to book an appointment at an official border crossing. Instead of hiring a smuggler to cross illegally, smartphone users could upload their personal information and photo, then await an appointment. CBP offered about 1,500 appointments a day all along the border at a time when illegal crossings were averaging more than 8,000 daily.

Immigrant-advocacy groups denounced the move as a ploy to deny safe refuge to people fleeing for their lives. The app was glitchy and prone to crashing, they said, and it forced applicants to wait months in dangerous Mexican border cities. But CBP One soon began to work as intended. Illegal crossings fell as more people waited for an appointment and the chance to make a legal, safe entry. The app became a key component in the Biden administration's effort to tame border chaos by expanding opportunities for migrants to enter lawfully while cracking down on illegal entries.

I went to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, a few months after the app's debut to see how it was working. Dozens of people with appointments lined up every morning on the bridge to El Paso, Texas, passports and other documents in hand. There were many, many others waiting on the Mexico side for their number to be called. They were anxious and impatient but generally willing to wait if it meant that their families had a better shot at legal status. The app became the primary way for migrants to access the U.S. asylum system and start the process of applying for U.S. protection.

Juliette Kayyem: The border got quieter, so Trump had to act

Joe Biden's critics were not impressed. No administration had ever used executive parole authority—the president's ability to waive people in without a visa—on such a scale. Republicans denounced CBP One as an “open border” app and “Ticketmaster for illegal immigration.” On the campaign trail, then-candidate Trump called it “the Kamala phone app for smuggling illegals.” Over two years, Biden allowed nearly 1 million migrants to enter the country using CBP One.

Trump froze CBP One entries on his first day in office and canceled the pending appointments of 30,000 migrants who'd finally had their number called. CBP One appeared to be finished. But Stephen Miller, the powerful White House adviser behind Trump's mass-deportation campaign, had been working on a plan to use the app for a completely different purpose.

Trump officials relaunched CBP One in March, changing its name to CBP Home. Its new purpose is to allow migrants to schedule their own self-deportations. DHS has sweetened the offer with a $1,000 “exit bonus” payment to approved participants, along with subsidized airfare and temporary protection from ICE enforcement. The government says it will even provide free rides to the airport. The app, which is also available in Spanish and Haitian Creole, can be used by any migrant without a criminal record who has been “illegally present” in the United States— “for an hour, a month, or 50 years,” the government says.

ICE's pitch for CBP Home reads like an HR email to a laid-off employee, gently likening illegal presence to a passing phase in one's life. “Self-deporting simply means you leave the U.S. before you encounter immigration officials,” the agency says. “Everyone's process is different. You may want to let your employer, your friends, and your family know you're leaving. You may also want to help find support for the people you care about, pack up the things you'd like to bring with you, or make living arrangements for the next phase of your journey.”

I recently spoke at length with a senior administration official involved in the relaunch of CBP Home and the self-deportation strategy. Miller came up with the idea of rebranding the much-maligned CBP app, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record. The political symbolism—using the app to subtract immigrants, rather than schedule their entry—was irresistible.

The app is geared especially toward the growing numbers of immigrants who have been living and working legally in the United States with some form of provisional residency that Trump has taken away. They include the 1 million people who used CBP One to enter as “parolees,” along with the more than 500,000 from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who arrived through a separate Biden program. Trump has told them to leave the United States immediately. Another roughly 1 million immigrants with Temporary Protected Status—from Venezuela, Afghanistan, Honduras, and more than a dozen other nations—are at risk of losing their legal status or already have.

Trump has introduced additional bureaucratic coercions to get more people to leave: $998-a-day fines for migrants who are “illegally present,” and potential criminal penalties for those who fail to provide the government with their personal information and whereabouts through a new “registry.” Fines will be waived for CBP Home users who self-deport, ICE says.

Read: Trump's deportations aren't what they seem

The Department of Homeland Security recently published a promotional video showing happy-looking families boarding a self-deportation flight to Honduras and Colombia after accepting the cash stipends. DHS called it “Project Homecoming”; staffers handed out free toys on the tarmac. One young family got a stuffed elephant and a handful of Colombian flags before climbing the stairs to the plane. A staffer handed a pink teddy bear to a shy little girl who looked no older than 3. No one in the video explains why they chose to leave or even speaks at all.

DHS wants the self-deportation flights to serve as a “visual contrast” to the fearsome videos of the deportations to the Salvadoran prison, the official told me, where “you get loaded off in handcuffs and get a haircut.” The videos promoting self-deportation are part of a $200 million domestic and international DHS ad campaign.

I checked with half a dozen or so immigration attorneys to see if they have clients considering the administration's offer. No takers yet, they said. “I have a feeling that it will start happening soon,” Jonathan Ryan, an attorney in Texas who represents asylum seekers and refugees, told me. “People are in shock right now, but I suspect the next step will be to start looking at their options.”

Some economists predict that the foreign-born population of the United States could shrink in 2025 for the first time in 50 years as a result of Trump's crackdown. It's unclear how many people have voluntarily left the United States without using the app or telling the government.

Biden officials used the CBP app to tap into migrants' hopes; Trump is banking on their fears. For the app to be a success—and to match the level of usage that Biden officials achieved—the administration is working to make ICE deportations as scary and intimidating as possible.

The administration expects use of CBP Home to grow if it can convince more migrants that it's only a matter of time before ICE finds them, the senior official told me. “It's a very dignified way of leaving on your own terms, as opposed to the harsher version of having to be encountered and apprehended by ICE at an unknown time and place,” the official said.

The official told me that the self-deportation plan is easily “scalable” and meant to expand as the pace of ICE arrests and deportations increases. Because parolees had to provide the government with their contact information and other personal data when they entered the country using CBP One, the government has much more ability to reach them and ratchet up the pressure than it has with other migrants who arrived undetected.

DHS is telling migrants that voluntary departure through CBP Home may improve their “future immigration options.” Trump officials have not said what that means. Immigrant advocates say it sounds like a ruse to trick people into thinking they'll arrive home and be able to apply for a visa to come right back, which is not the case. The DHS official I spoke with said there is no formal mechanism to reward a visa applicant who previously registered a departure through CBP Home, though their decision would be viewed favorably during the review process.

Andrea Flores, a former Biden-administration immigration adviser who is now a policy director at the advocacy group FWD.us, told me DHS's messaging is “incredibly dishonest.” The agency is employing social media “to misuse images of either compassion or to overuse images of harsh criminality,” Flores said.

Read: We're about to find out what mass deportations really look like

“They're using every single tool that DHS has to expand the sheer number of removals without putting any thought into how people make their choices or the incentives and disincentives they're creating,” Flores said. “All they're doing with CBP Home is to push people further away from trusting the government.”

The DHS official I spoke with said the government has no immediate plans to increase the $1,000 exit bonus to entice more people to leave, but the payments could go higher. The average cost to arrest, detain, and deport someone is $17,121, according to the latest DHS figures, and the department said it will save 70 percent of that every time someone uses the app to leave the United States on their own. DHS says it uses a geolocation feature in CBP Home to confirm that someone is at least three miles outside the United States before they're eligible to receive the payment.

Trump officials have another incentive to promote CBP Home: It allows them to count confirmed departures toward the president's deportation goal of 1 million people a year. The latest ICE statistics show that the agency has carried out about 125,000 deportations since Trump took office. DHS will need many, many more people to register with the app to hit the president's target.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Over the course of several months, Pauline Shanks Kaurin concluded she no longer had the academic freedom necessary for doing her job.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Seven years ago, Pauline Shanks Kaurin left a good job as a tenured professor at a university, uprooted her family, and moved across the country to teach military ethics at the Naval War College, in Newport, Rhode Island. She did so, she told me, not only to help educate American military officers, but with a promise from the institution that she would have “the academic freedom to do my job.” But now she's leaving her position and the institution because orders from President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, she said, have made staying both morally and practically untenable. Remaining on the faculty, she believes, would mean implicitly lending her approval to policies she cannot support. And she said that the kind of teaching and research the Navy once hired her to do will now be impossible.

The Naval War College is one of many institutions—along with the Army War College, the Air War College, and others—that provide graduate-level instruction in national-security issues and award master's degrees to the men and women of the U.S. armed forces. The Naval War College is also home to a widely respected civilian academic post, the James B. Stockdale Chair in Professional Military Ethics, named for the famous admiral and American prisoner of war in Vietnam. Pauline has held the Stockdale Chair since 2018. (I taught for many years at the Naval War College, where I knew Pauline as a colleague.) Her last day will be at the end of this month.

In January, Trump issued an executive order, Restoring America's Fighting Force, that prohibits the Department of Defense and the entire armed forces from “promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories,” such as “gender ideology,” “race or sex stereotyping,” and, of course, anything to do with DEI. Given the potential breadth of the order, the military quickly engaged in a panicky slash-and-burn approach rather than risk running afoul of the new ideological line. The U.S. Military Academy at West Point, in New York, for example, disbanded several clubs, including the local chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers. Other military installations, apparently anticipating a wider crackdown on anything to do with race or gender, removed important pages of American history about women and minorities from their websites.

All of this was done by bureaucrats and administrators as they tried to comply with Trump's vague order, banning and erasing anything that the president and Hegseth might construe as even remotely related to DEI or other banned concepts. Some Defense Department workers “deemed to be affiliated with DEI programs or activities” were warned that Trump's orders “required” their jobs to be eliminated. Many professors at military institutions began to see signs that they might soon be prohibited from researching and publishing in their fields of study.

Phillip Atiba Solomon: Am I still allowed to tell the truth in my class?

At first, Pauline was cautious. She knew that her work in the field of military ethics could be controversial—particularly on the issues of oaths and obedience. In the military, where discipline and the chain of command rule daily life, investigating the meaning of oath-taking and obedience is a necessary but touchy exercise. The military is sworn to obey all legal orders, but when that obedience becomes absolute, the results can be ghastly: Pauline wrote her doctoral dissertation at Temple University on oaths, obedience, and the 1969 My Lai massacre in Vietnam, in which a young U.S. officer and his men believed that their orders allowed them to slay hundreds of unarmed civilians. For more than 20 years, she taught these matters in the philosophy department at Pacific Lutheran University, and once at Newport, she wrote a book on the contrasting notions of obedience in military and civilian life.

When the Trump order came down, Pauline told me that Naval War College administrators gave her “vague assurances” that the college would not interfere with ongoing work by her or other faculty, or with academic freedom in general. But one day, shortly after the executive order in January, she was walking through the main lobby, which proudly features display cases with books by the faculty, and she noticed that a volume on LGBTQ issues in the military had vanished. The disappearance of that book led Pauline to seek more clarity from the college's administration about nonpartisanship, and especially about academic freedom.

Academic freedom is an often-misunderstood term. Many people outside academia encounter the idea only when some professor abuses the concept as a license to be an offensive jerk. (A famous case many years ago involved a Colorado professor who compared the victims of 9/11 to Nazis who deserved what they got.) Like tenure, however, academic freedom serves crucial educational purposes, protecting controversial research and encouraging the free exchange of even the most unpopular ideas without fear of political pressure or interference. It is essential to any serious educational institution, and necessary to a healthy democracy.

Conor Friedersdorf: In defense of academic freedom

Professors who teach for the military, as I did for many years, do have to abide by some restrictions not found in civilian schools. They have a duty, as sworn federal employees, to protect classified information. They may not use academic freedom to disrupt government operations. (Leading a protest that would prevent other government workers from getting to their duty stations might be one example.) And, of course, they must refrain from violating the Hatch Act: They cannot use government time or resources to engage in partisan political activity. But they otherwise have—or are supposed to have—the same freedoms as their colleagues in civilian institutions.

Soon, however, jumpy military bureaucrats started tossing books and backing out of conferences. Pauline became more concerned. Newport's senior administrators began to send informal signals that included, as she put it, the warning that “academic freedom as many of us understood it was not a thing anymore.” Based on those messages, Pauline came to believe that her and other faculty members' freedom to comment publicly on national issues and choose research topics without institutional interference was soon to be restricted.

During an all-hands meeting with senior college leaders in February, Pauline said that she and other Naval War College faculty were told that the college would comply with Hegseth's directives and that, in Pauline's words, “if we were thinking we had academic freedom in our scholarship and in the classroom, we were mistaken.” (Other faculty present at the meeting confirmed to me that they interpreted the message from the college's leadership the same way; one of them later told me that the implication was that the Defense Department could now rule any subject out of bounds for classroom discussion or scholarly research at will.) Pauline said there were audible gasps in the room, and such visible anger that it seemed to her that even the administrators hosting the meeting were taken aback. “I've been in academia for 31 years,” she told me, and that gathering “was the most horrifying meeting I've ever been a part of.”

I contacted the college's provost, Stephen Mariano, who told me in an email that these issues were “nuanced” but that the college had not changed its policies on academic freedom. (He also denied any changes relating to tenure, a practice predicated on academic freedom.) At the same time, he added, the college is “complying with all directives issued by the President and Department of Defense and following Department of the Navy policy.” This language leaves Pauline and other civilian faculty at America's military schools facing a paradox: They are told that academic freedom still exists, but that their institutions are following directives from Hegseth that, at least on their face, seem aimed at ending academic freedom.

In March, Pauline again sought clarity from college leaders. They were clearly anxious to appear compliant with the new political line. (“We don't want to end up on Fox News,” she said one administrator told her.) She was told her work was valued, but she didn't believe it. “Talk is cheap,” she said. “Actions matter.” She said she asked the provost point-blank: What if a faculty member has a book or an article coming out on some controversial topic? His answer, according to her: Hypothetically, they might consider pulling the work from publication. (Mariano denies saying this and told me that there is no change in college policy on faculty publication.)

Every government employee knows the bureaucratic importance of putting things on paper. Pauline's current project is about the concept of honor, which necessarily involves questions regarding masculinity and gender—issues that could turn the DOD's new McCarthyites toward her and her work. So she now proposed that she and the college administration work up a new contract, laying out more clearly—in writing—what the limits on her work and academic freedom would look like.

She might as well have asked for a pony. Administrators, she said, told her that they hoped she wouldn't resign, but that no one was going to put anything in writing. “The upshot,” according to her, was a message from the administration that boiled down to: We hope you can just suck it up and not need your integrity for your final year as the ethics chair.

After that, she told me, her choices were clear. “As they say in the military: Salute and execute—or resign.” Until then, she had “hoped maybe people would still come to their senses.” The promises of seven years ago were gone; the institution now apparently expected her and other faculty to self-censor in the classroom and preemptively bowdlerize their own research. “I don't do DEI work,” she said, “but I do moral philosophy, and now I can't do it. I'd have to take out discussions of race and gender and not do philosophy as I think it should be done.” In April, she submitted a formal letter of resignation.

Initially, she had no interest in saying anything publicly. Pauline is a native Montanan and single mom of two, and by nature not the type of person to engage in public food fights. (She used to joke with me when we were colleagues that I was the college's resident lightning rod, and she had no interest in taking over that job.) She's a philosopher who admires quiet stoicism, and she was resolved to employ it in her final months.

But she also thought about what she owed her chair's namesake. “Stockdale thought philosophy was important for officers. The Stockdale course was created so that officers would wrestle with moral obligations. He was a personal model of integrity.” Even so, she did not try to invoke him as a patron saint when she decided to resign. “I'm not saying he would agree with the choice that I made,” she told me. “But his model of moral integrity is part of the chair.”

She kept her resignation private until early May, when a professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Graham Parsons—another scholar who teaches ethics in a military school, and a friend of Pauline's—likewise decided to resign in protest and said that he would leave West Point after 13 years. Hegseth's changes “prevent me from doing my job responsibly,” he wrote in The New York Times. “I am ashamed to be associated with the academy in its current form.” Hegseth responded on X, sounding more like a smug internet troll than a concerned superior: “You will not be missed Professor Parsons.” The episode changed Pauline's mind. She felt she owed her friends and colleagues whatever public support and solidarity she could offer them.

Nor are she and Parsons alone. Tom McCarthy, a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, in Annapolis, Maryland, recently resigned as chair of the history department rather than remove a paper from an upcoming symposium. And last month, a senior scholar at the Army War College, in Pennsylvania, Carrie Lee, also handed in her resignation, a decision she announced to her friends and followers on Bluesky.

Jason Dempsey: Hegseth has all the wrong enemies

Lee told me in an email that she'd been thinking of leaving after Trump was elected, because it was apparent to her that the Trump administration was “going to try and politicize the military and use military assets/personnel to suppress democratic rights,” and that academic freedom in military schools was soon to “become untenable.” Like Pauline, Lee felt like she was at a dead end: “To speak from within the institution itself will also do more harm than good. So to dissent, I have little choice but to leave,” she said in a farewell letter to her colleagues in April.

I asked Pauline what she thinks might have happened if she had decided to stay and just tough it out from the inside. She “absolutely” thinks she'd have been fired at some point, and she didn't want such a firing “to be part of the legacy of the Stockdale Chair.” But then I asked her if by resigning, she was giving people in the Trump administration, such as Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought—who once said that his goal was to make federal workers feel “trauma” to the point where they will quit their jobs—exactly what they want: Americans leaving federal service.

She didn't care. “When you make a moral decision, there are always costs.” She dismissed what people like Vought want or think. “I'm not accountable to him. I'm accountable to the Lord, to my father, to my legacy, to my children, to my profession, to members of the military-ethics community. So I decided that I needed to resign. Not that it would change anyone's mind, but to say: This is not okay. That is my message.”

At the end of our discussion, I asked an uncomfortable question I'd been avoiding. Pauline, I know, is only in her mid-50s, in mid-career, and too young simply to retire. She has raised two sons who will soon enter young adulthood. I asked her if she was worried about her future.

“Sure,” she said. “But at the end of the day, as we say in Montana, sometimes you just have to saddle up and ride scared.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

America's vaccine advisory committee is now taking seriously a baseless anti-vaccine flash point.

Updated at 9:34 a.m. on June 25, 2025  Vaccine experts in the United States have long considered the case on thimerosal closed. A chemical preservative that stamps out contamination in vaccine vials, thimerosal was removed from most U.S. shots more than two decades ago over worries that its mercury content could trigger developmental delays. But those concerns—as well as baseless claims that thimerosal causes autism—have been proved unfounded, many times over. “We took care of this 20 years ago,” Kathryn Edwards, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University, told me.

That's not how anti-vaccine activists see the compound. Even the strongest data supporting thimerosal's safety have not quelled the concerns of those who insist on the chemical's harms. And now the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, has signaled that thimerosal's presence in vaccines should remain open for debate. The panel is scheduled on Thursday to discuss the compound, which is present in a minority of flu shots in low or trace amounts, and vote on how vaccines containing it should be used.

The panel that will meet this week is more skeptical of vaccines than any version in ACIP history. Earlier this month, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly dismissed all 17 existing members of the panel—among them, some of the nation's foremost experts in vaccinology, infectious disease, pediatrics, and public health—and replaced them with eight new members who largely lack expertise in vaccines and, in several cases, have espoused anti-vaccine viewpoints. This new panel will hear a presentation on thimerosal not from a career vaccine scientist—as is usual ACIP practice—but from Lyn Redwood, one of the first vocal advocates of the false notion that thimerosal causes autism and the former president of Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization that Kennedy chaired until 2023.

ACIP's charter is to evaluate the data and guide the country's approach to vaccines. By reopening the case on thimerosal, Kennedy's handpicked committee has already chosen to entertain a classic anti-vaccine talking point. If the new ACIP's vote further limits the use of vaccines containing the compound, it will also show, from the get-go, how willing it is to disregard evidence.

A multitude of studies, going back more than 20 years, have shown that thimerosal has no link to autism. Children who have received thimerosal-containing vaccines aren't at higher risk of developing autism. Nor has removing the compound from much of the vaccine supply in multiple countries—including the U.S.—decreased autism rates. Instead, autism rates have gone up. (Experts who study autism attribute that rise largely to more awareness and more sensitive diagnostics; Kennedy, meanwhile, insists, without evidence, that the uptick is the work of an “environmental toxin” that “somebody made a profit” on.)

But around the turn of the millennium, experts felt pressured to remove thimerosal from vaccines, especially those targeted to young children. After studies had linked chronic exposure to high levels of mercury found in fish and whale blubber to developmental delays, scientists began to worry about the element's effects on the young brain. The FDA kick-started a campaign to suss out the mercury content of the products it oversaw. By 1999, researchers had pinpointed thimerosal as suspect: The levels of the type of mercury found in vaccines containing the compound seemed, at the time, worryingly high, Walter Orenstein, who directed the U.S.'s National Immunization Program from 1988 through 2004, told me. “So there were concerns that it might be harmful to children.” (Autism, notably, wasn't a consideration.)

No research proved that harm, but the fears seemed theoretically legitimate. “It put us in a very difficult position,” Orenstein said. The studies necessary to thoroughly test whether the thimerosal in vaccines was toxic could take years; in the meantime, kids could suffer unnecessarily. Some experts argued that keeping thimerosal in the vaccine supply wasn't worth the risk to children's health—and to public trust in immunization. If the FDA publicized its findings on mercury and the government didn't take action, “we would look pretty stupid or unconcerned,” Neal Halsey, who was at the time the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on infectious diseases, told me. Plus, thimerosal's role in vaccines wasn't technically essential: Its main use was to stave off harmful contamination in multidose vaccine vials, which clinicians repeatedly dip into; with some tinkering, many manufacturers would likely be able to sub in other preservatives, or switch to pricier single-dose containers.

So in 1999, the government and the AAP asked pharmaceutical companies to get rid of the thimerosal in their vaccines as quickly as they could—and advised health-care providers to delay giving the hepatitis B vaccine, which contained the compound, to low-risk newborns.

As it turned out, the compound never posed serious danger. The form of mercury in thimerosal is different from the one found in fish; scientists soon determined that it was excreted from the body faster—which meant that it didn't pose equivalent risk. No major problems in childhood development could be linked to thimerosal-containing vaccines. At the time of the original decision, “if we'd had full knowledge, we wouldn't have done it,” Orenstein told me. Thimerosal was, and is, safe.

But that wasn't the message that anti-vaccine activists took away. Instead, they seized upon the government's decision as an admission of guilt; multiple mercury-focused anti-vaccine activist groups sprang up. Some of them began to insist, without evidence, that thimerosal caused autism; among the most prominent advocates for that claim was Kennedy himself. The fervor around autism “caught us all by surprise,” Halsey told me. “That's not what our concern was in 1999.”

And yet, those fears ballooned. In the mid-aughts, several states restricted thimerosal-containing vaccines for children and pregnant women. In some parts of the country, the misinformation yielded misguided treatments: In 2005, a family in Pennsylvania had their 5-year-old autistic son injected with a mercury-chelating chemical in hopes of curing his condition; less than an hour later, the boy died of a heart attack.

By 2001, thimerosal had been removed from most vaccines for Americans under 6. But the compound's disappearance had costs. Multidose vials are an especially cheap, efficient way to package vaccines; blacklisting thimerosal made many shots more expensive, Paul Offit, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told me. The speed of the decision spurred confusion too. Shaken by the call to remove thimerosal, some hospitals stopped offering the hepatitis B vaccine to newborns entirely; shortly after, a Michigan baby on a delayed vaccination schedule, born to a mother infected with the virus, died.

Certain scientists, including Offit, still consider the removal of thimerosal a mistake, not least because it made vaccines appear more suspicious. In a press release at the time, the AAP noted that “the current levels of thimerosal will not hurt children, but reducing those levels will make safe vaccines even safer”—a statement that appeared to validate thimerosal's dangers. In an attempt to preserve public trust, the government instead broke it, Offit said. “They were meeting the anti-vaccine activists halfway.”

Now ACIP seems poised to make a concession to those same anti-vaccine groups. “The fact that it's come up again is reason for some people to say, ‘Well, there was an issue,'” Edwards told me.

In response to a request for comment, an HHS spokesperson said, “The new ACIP committee is committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. Its recommendations will be grounded in data, not ideology or opinion.” The spokesperson did not address questions about thimerosal specifically or the evidence for once again bringing it under scrutiny.

But the experts I spoke with weren't optimistic about the forthcoming discussion. In the past, any question the committee voted on was usually published weeks in advance, and subcommittees including ACIP members, CDC officials, and independent subject-matter experts vetted evidence and discussed policy options in advance of meetings, Grace Lee, a Stanford pediatrician who formerly chaired ACIP, told me. The new ACIP panel has had no time for that level of preparation. At least one new member, Vicky Pebsworth, has also argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines are dangerous for children and pregnant people in an article published by Children's Health Defense. And on Tuesday, the night before the meeting began, Kennedy shared a lengthy post on X about thimerosal, citing outdated research, denying the existence of sound studies confirming the safety of thimerosal-containing vaccines, and criticizing “pharma-financed mainstream media's mantric ritual of dutifully parroting the propaganda tropes spoon-fed them by vaccine makers and their captive regulators.”

The exact proposal that ACIP will vote on hasn't yet been made public, either. But materials now posted to the CDC's website hint at the question the group might consider. Redwood's presentation, which was officially added to the agenda only on Tuesday, includes a series of slides that largely ignores the strong evidence supporting thimerosal-containing vaccines' safety, misrepresents at least one study, and concludes that “removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again.” In an unusual move, though, the materials pertaining to Redwood's presentation also include a CDC report—flagged as “CDC background briefing material,” flanked with asterisks—that reiterates thimerosal's safety, and the evidence that debunks a link to autism. (Redwood, Pebsworth, and the CDC did not respond to a request for comment.)

Even Senator Bill Cassidy—the chair of the Senate's health committee, who helped secure Kennedy's confirmation—seems to be having doubts about these developments. On Monday, he wrote on social media that the new ACIP lacked the expertise to make sound decisions about vaccines, and called for the meeting to be delayed “until the panel is fully staffed with more robust and balanced representation.” (A spokesperson for Cassidy did not respond to a request for comment.)

If ACIP does vote to remove recommendations for remaining thimerosal-containing vaccines, it could create practical problems, Halsey told me. Even though only a minority of flu vaccines would be affected, forcing manufacturers to alter their products on a tight timeline could make it harder to prepare for annual vaccination campaigns. Lower-resourced regions might also struggle to afford single-dose vials.

But the bigger issue with that decision would be this new committee's brazen disregard for decades of evidence on thimerosal's safety. The original discussion to remove thimerosal was contentious but understandable: a precaution taken in a vacuum of information. This time around, though, the experts have long had the knowledge they need—enough of it that there should be no discussion or vote at all.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

If only the NIH would fund it.

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy have been recorded at least since the Greeks scribbled about it on papyrus some 4,000 years ago. The Romans hypothesized (wrongly) that boys caused more nausea in their mothers and advised women to fast for one day and take a hot wine bath to combat symptoms. 

By the 1960s, doctors were prescribing seemingly more effective drugs to combat the barfing. When one such drug, thalidomide, turned out to cause birth defects in the children born to parents who'd taken it, however, the scandal caused a chilling effect on the study of pregnancy nausea. 

But the story of how we finally got a scientific answer to why some pregnant people get sicker than others starts with a woman in the 1990s.

After geneticist Marlena Fejzo experienced a debilitating form of pregnancy nausea, called hyperemesis gravidarum, she found very little in the scientific literature attempting to explain why. Then an early career post-doc, Fejzo decided she would set out to find the answer herself. 

Pregnancy nausea was not Fejzo's professional focus at the time she set out to study it, and she didn't have funding to embark on any formal research, so she embarked on a bit of a DIY inquiry. She posted a survey online in the early days of the internet and received hundreds of replies via fax from people who'd experienced hyperemesis. Those gave her the first clues that the mechanism at play might be genetic. 

On the latest episode of the Unexplainable podcast, I talk to Dr. Fejzo about her pregnancy and her path to finding a biological cause and a cure to pregnancy nausea. Listen below, or in the feed of your favorite podcast app.

﻿Republicans are proposing huge cuts to Medicaid. The impact on Americans' health would be devastating.

While public attention has largely been focused on the Middle East and on President Donald Trump's immigration policy, Republicans in Congress are on the verge of passing massive Medicaid cuts as part of a budget bill that could lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance benefits and, according to one recent estimate, thousands of unnecessary deaths every year.

While the GOP's so-called “big, beautiful” bill is a smorgasbord of policy — potentially including everything from blocking AI regulation to restricting the power of the federal courts — perhaps the most consequential changes would be to Medicaid. The program, which covers low-income Americans of all ages, is now the country's single largest insurer, covering more than 70 million people. The legislation approved by House Republicans, which is now being debated and amended by the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years. The upshot is that 10.3 million fewer people would be enrolled in the program by 2034.

Those coverage losses would more than undo the progress the US has made in reducing the ranks of the uninsured over the past few years. On Tuesday, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the number of US adults without insurance in 2024 had fallen to 27.2 million, down from 31.6 million in 2020. The GOP bill would reverse those gains and then some within a decade.

The consequences would be much more severe than the mere loss of a government health insurance card. According to one analysis of the House bill published last week in the Annals of Internal Medicine by a trio of Harvard-affiliated researchers, those losses of Medicaid coverage would lead to fewer Americans reporting good health, fewer patients getting preventive health screenings, and, at the end of the day, between 8,200 and 24,600 additional annual deaths.

Senate Republicans are not going to adopt the House bill exactly as it is, which means any estimates of its effects are preliminary. But it appears likely GOP senators will keep at least two impactful provisions: new work requirements for many of the people on Medicaid and limits on the financing tools that the states can use to access more federal Medicaid funding. The Harvard study broke out the estimated effects by provision and the results are still foreboding: between 3,000 and 9,000 annual deaths attributable to Medicaid work requirements, and between 4,200 and 12,600 deaths if state provider taxes were completely eliminated.

Even short of the worst-case scenario, Americans' health would be worse off under the Republican bill, according to researchers Adam Gaffney, David Himmelstein, and Steffie Woolhandler. The number of Americans who have a personal doctor would drop by 700,000 under Medicaid work requirements; 285,000 fewer people would ever get their blood cholesterol checked, and 235,000 fewer patients would ever have their blood sugar tested. The number of women getting a recommended mammogram within the past 12 months would drop by nearly 139,000. And an additional 385,000 people would have to borrow money or skip paying other bills to afford their medical care. The people affected are low-income and disproportionately Black and Hispanic. 

There is plenty of uncertainty in these projections. It is also hard to be sure how these policies would interact with each other: The Harvard researchers noted in their cumulative estimate of the House bill's effects that there would likely be some overlap in the policies' projected effects when combined together. Some of the people who lose their Medicaid coverage would be able to get insurance by other means, offsetting the losses to a degree that can be difficult to predict.

But the takeaway from the analysis is clear: A lot of people are going to suffer if these proposals become law.

The debate in the Senate has not yet concluded, and the bill could still change. Hospitals are busy on Capitol Hill, lobbying Republicans to reduce the spending cuts and warning lawmakers of the devastating consequences that the legislation would have. Some GOP senators are reportedly open to providing additional funding for rural hospitals, to relieve the impact on the facilities that would be hardest hit by the proposed Medicaid cuts.

But after Republicans narrowly failed to roll back Medicaid during Trump's first term, they seem likely to succeed this time — a step backward from building a true universal health care system.

America's lack of universal health care is the main reason we spend more money than any other country in the world while seeing worse outcomes. One recent JAMA analysis found that deaths that could be prevented by accessible health care increased in the United States from 2009 to 2019, while declining in most other comparable countries. 

You can achieve universal health care via a variety of strategies, including the expansion of private health insurance, but the Republican bill could instead lead to more unnecessary deaths by taking existing benefits away from people, according to the Annals of Internal Medicine study.

Medicaid has actually been a rare bright spot in America's often dysfunctional health care system. The program has its own problems — not enough doctors participate because of its low reimbursement rates, for one — but since its expansion through the Affordable Care Act in 2010, research has shown that Medicaid allowed more people to access health care, reduced their financial burden from medical services, and improved their physical and mental well-being. 

Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials justify the Medicaid cuts by saying that people who can work should be required to work in order to receive government benefits. They claim nobody who deserves to be on Medicaid will lose their coverage. As one White House official put it to Politico earlier this month: “Medicaid does not belong to people who are here illegally, and it does not belong to capable and able-bodied men who refuse to work. So no one is getting cut.” (Undocumented migrants are already ineligible for federal Medicaid funding. Six states cover undocumented adults through Medicaid using the state's own funds, and 14 cover undocumented children.) 

But independent analysts say that most of the people on Medicaid are either children, elderly, disabled — or adults who are already working or caring for another person — meaning they are limited in their ability to work. Most of the projected coverage losses result from people having paperwork problems in documenting their work or proving they should be exempt from the requirements, not because people are actually ineligible under the new rules. 

That aligns with the experience of Arkansas during Trump's first term. That state tested work requirements in the real world for the first time and 18,000 people lost their health insurance in a matter of months, with no meaningful effect on their employment.

The US has made halting progress in its pursuit of a better health system. In 2010, the uninsured rate was 16 percent. Today, it's half of that. But in the GOP's proposed future, the problems that have left Americans so frustrated with their health care system are going to get worse.

﻿For people with OCD, reassurance can be harmful. ChatGPT provides an infinite supply.

Millions of people use ChatGPT for help with daily tasks, but for a subset of users, a chatbot can be more of a hindrance than a help.

Some people with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are finding this out the hard way. 

On online forums and in their therapists' offices, they report turning to ChatGPT with the questions that obsess them, and then engaging in compulsive behavior — in this case, eliciting answers from the chatbot for hours on end — to try to resolve their anxiety.

“I'm concerned, I really am,” said Lisa Levine, a psychologist who specializes in OCD and who has clients using ChatGPT compulsively. “I think it's going to become a widespread problem. It's going to replace Googling as a compulsion, but it's going to be even more reinforcing than Googling, because you can ask such specific questions. And I think also people assume that ChatGPT is always correct.” 

People turn to ChatGPT with all sorts of worries, from the stereotypical “How do I know if I've washed my hands enough?” (contamination OCD) to the lesser-known “What if I did something immoral?” (scrupulosity OCD) or “Is my fiance the love of my life or am I making a huge mistake?” (relationship OCD). 

“Once, I was worried about my partner dying on a plane,” a writer in New York, who was diagnosed with OCD in her thirties and who asked to remain anonymous, told me. “At first, I was asking ChatGPT fairly generically, ‘What are the chances?' And of course it said it's very unlikely. But then I kept thinking: Okay, but is it more likely if it's this kind of plane? What if it's flying this kind of route?”

For two hours, she pummeled ChatPGT with questions. She knew that this wasn't actually helping her — but she kept going. “ChatGPT comes up with these answers that make you feel like you're digging to somewhere,” she said, “even if you're actually just stuck in the mud.” 

A classic hallmark of OCD is what psychologists call “reassurance seeking.” While everyone will occasionally ask friends or loved ones for reassurance, it's different for people with OCD, who tend to ask the same question repeatedly in a quest to get uncertainty down to zero. 

The goal of that behavior is to relieve anxiety or distress. After getting an answer, the distress does sometimes decrease — but it's only temporary. Soon enough, new doubts arise and the cycle starts again, with the creeping sense that more questions must be asked in order to reach greater certainty.

If you ask your friend for reassurance on the same topic 50 times, they'll probably realize that something is going on and that it might not actually be helpful for you to stay in this conversational loop. But an AI chatbot is happy to keep answering all your questions, and then the doubts you have about its answers, and then the doubts you have about its answers to your doubts, and so on. 

In other words, ChatGPT will naively play along with reassurance-seeking behavior. 

“That actually just makes the OCD worse. It becomes that much harder to resist doing it again,” Levine said. Instead of continuing to compulsively seek definitive answers, the clinical consensus is that people with OCD need to accept that sometimes we can't get rid of uncertainty — we just have to sit with it and learn to tolerate it. 

The “gold standard” treatment for OCD is exposure and response prevention (ERP), in which people are exposed to the troubling questions that obsess them and then resist the urge to engage in a compulsion like reassurance-seeking.

Levine, who pioneered the use of non-engagement responses — statements that affirm the presence of anxiety rather than trying to escape it through compulsions — noted that there's another way in which an AI chatbot is more tempting than Googling for answers, as many OCD sufferers do. Whereas the search engine just links you to a variety of websites, state-of-the-art AI systems promise to help you analyze and reason through a complex problem. That is extremely enticing — “OCD loves that!” Levine said — but for someone suffering from the disorder, it can too easily become a lengthy exercise in co-rumination.

According to one evidence-based approach to treating OCD, called inference-based cognitive behavioral therapy (I-CBT), people with OCD are prone to a faulty reasoning pattern that draws on a mix of personal experiences, rules, hearsay, facts, and possibilities. That gives rise to obsessive doubts and tricks them into feeling like they need to listen to those doubts.

Joseph Harwerth, an OCD and anxiety specialist, offers an illustration of how trying to reason with the help of an AI chatbot can actually further confuse the “obsessional reasoning” of people with OCD. Considering what you might do if you have a cut on your finger and struggle with contamination OCD — where people fear becoming sullied or sullying others with germs, dirt, or other contaminants — he writes, “You wonder: Can I get tetanus from touching a doorknob? You may go to ChatGPT to investigate the validity of that doubt.” Here's how he imagines the conversation going: 

Q1: Should you wash your hands if they feel dirty?

A1: “Yes, you should wash your hands if they feel dirty. That sensation usually means there is something on your skin, like dirt, oil, sweat, or germs, that you will want to remove.” (When asked for its reasoning, ChatGPT said it based its answer on sources from the CDC and WHO.)

Q2: Can I get tetanus from a doorknob?

A2: “It is extremely unlikely to get tetanus from a doorknob, unless you have an open wound and somehow rubbed soil or contaminated material into it via the doorknob.”

Q3: Can people have tetanus without realizing it?

A3: “It is rare, but in the very early stages, some people might not immediately realize they have tetanus, especially if the wound seemed minor or was overlooked.”

Then, your OCD creates this story: I feel dirty when I touch doorknobs (personal experience). It is recommended by the CDC to wash your hands if you feel dirty (rules). I read online that people can get tetanus from touching a doorknob (hearsay). Germs can spread through contact (general facts). It is possible that someone touched my door without knowing they had tetanus and then spread it on my doorknob (possibility).

In this scenario, the chatbot enables the user to construct a narrative that justifies their obsessional fear. It doesn't guide the user away from obsessional reasoning — it just provides fodder for it.

Part of the problem, Harwerth says, is that a chatbot doesn't have enough context about each user, unless the user thinks to provide it, so it doesn't know when someone has OCD. 

“ChatGPT can fall into the same trap that non-OCD specialists fall into,” Harwerth told me. “The trap is: Oh, let's have a conversation about your thoughts. What could have led you to have these thoughts? What does this mean about you?” While that might be a helpful approach for a client who doesn't have OCD, it can backfire when a psychologist engages in that kind of therapy with someone suffering from OCD, because it encourages them to keep ruminating on the topic. 

What's more, because chatbots can be sycophants, they may just validate whatever the user says instead of challenging it. A chatbot that's overly flattering and supportive of a user's thoughts — like ChatGPT was for a time — can be dangerous for people with mental health issues.

If using a chatbot can exacerbate OCD symptoms, is it the responsibility of the company behind the chatbot to protect vulnerable users? Or is it the users' responsibility to learn how not to use ChatGPT, just as they've had to learn not to use Google or WebMD for reassurance-seeking?

“I think it's on both,” Harwerth told me. “We cannot perfectly curate the world to people with OCD — they have to understand their own condition and how that leaves them vulnerable to misusing applications. In the same breath, I would say that when people explicitly ask the AI model to behave as a trained therapist” — which some users with mental health conditions do — “I do think it's important for the model to say, ‘I'm pulling this from these sources. However, I'm not a trained therapist.'” 

This has, in fact, been a big problem: AI systems have been misrepresenting themselves as human therapists over the past few years.

Levine, for her part, agreed that the burden can't rest solely on the companies. “It wouldn't be fair to make it their responsibility, just like it wouldn't be fair to make Google responsible for all the compulsive Googling. But it would be great if even just a warning could come up, like, ‘This seems perhaps compulsive.'” 

OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, acknowledged in a recent paper that the chatbot can foster problematic behavior patterns. “We observe a trend that longer usage is associated with lower socialization, more emotional dependence and more problematic use,” the study finds, defining the latter as “indicators of addiction to ChatGPT usage, including preoccupation, withdrawal symptoms, loss of control, and mood modification” as well as “indicators of potentially compulsive or unhealthy interaction patterns.” 

“We know that ChatGPT can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals, and that means the stakes are higher,” an OpenAI spokesperson told me in an email. “We're working to better understand and reduce ways ChatGPT might unintentionally reinforce or amplify existing, negative behavior…We're doing this so we can continue refining how our models identify and respond appropriately in sensitive conversations, and we'll continue updating the behavior of our models based on what we learn.” 

(Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)

One possibility might be to try to train chatbots to pick up on signs of mental health disorders, so they could flag to the user that they are engaging in, say, reassurance-seeking typical of OCD. But if a chatbot is essentially diagnosing a user, that raises serious privacy concerns. Chatbots aren't bound by the same rules as professional therapists when it comes to safeguarding people's sensitive health information.

The writer in New York who has OCD told me she would find it helpful if the chatbot would challenge the frame of the conversation. “It could say, ‘I notice that you've asked many detailed iterations of this question, but sometimes more detailed information doesn't bring you closer. Would you like to take a walk?'” she said. “Maybe wording it like that can interrupt the loop, without insinuating that someone has a mental illness, whether they do or not.”

While there's some research suggesting that AI could correctly identify OCD, it's not clear how it could pick up on compulsive behaviors without covertly or overtly classifying the user as having OCD.

“This is not me saying that OpenAI is responsible for making sure I don't do this,” the writer added. “But I do think there are ways to make it easier for me to help myself.”

Every president wants to extricate America from the region's conflicts. None of them do.

In April 1980, President Jimmy Carter authorized Operation Eagle Claw, an ill-fated military operation to rescue the American hostages held at the US embassy in Iran. Since then, every US president has ordered at least one — usually more than one — military intervention in the Middle East and North Africa.

Under Ronald Reagan, there was the bombing of Libya and the deployment of Marines to Lebanon. Under George H.W. Bush, there was Operation Desert Storm. Under Bill Clinton, airstrikes against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq and against al-Qaeda in Sudan. Under George W. Bush, the invasion of Iraq. Under Barack Obama, a multicountry counterterrorist drone campaign, the toppling of Muammar al-Qaddafi's regime in Libya, and the redeployment of US troops to Iraq to fight ISIS. Under Donald Trump's first term, an expanded campaign against ISIS, missile strikes against the Syrian regime, and the targeted assassination of Iran's most powerful military leaders. Under Joe Biden, the deployment of US troops to the region following the October 7, 2023, attack and the airstrikes against Yemen's Houthi rebels. 

Now, in his second term, Trump has crossed another Rubicon, becoming the first US president to use military force on the soil of America's longtime adversary, Iran. Though a ceasefire has now been declared, it's very possible this crisis is only beginning, particularly if, as US intelligence agencies reportedly believe, much of Iran's nuclear program is still intact after the strikes. 

Trump's pivot toward the Middle East is a surprising turn from this president. This is a very different message from the one he delivered in Saudi Arabia just last month when he decried “neocons” and “interventionists” for ill-considered attempts to remake the region through force. Trump has said in the past, in reference to the Iraq war, that “GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY,” and he has generally appeared to view the region — apart from wealthy Gulf States — as a hopeless war zone with little to offer the US.

While he was often stymied in his attempts to withdraw troops in his first term by hawkish advisers, this time many of his senior appointees have been so-called “restrainers,” who advocate pulling back from US military commitments overseas or “prioritizers,” who want to shift attention to what they see as the more important challenge posed by China. Until very recently, they appeared to have the upper hand. But in the current crisis, the US actually relocated important military assets from the Pacific to the Middle East to the consternation of some Pentagon officials. 

The stated desire to end “endless wars” in the Middle East and shift to bigger priorities is something the Trump administration has in common with the other two post-Iraq war presidencies. Barack Obama was elected in large part because of his opposition to the war in Iraq. In 2011, his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, promised a “pivot” to Asia and the Pacific for US foreign policy priorities. The Arab Spring and the rise of ISIS got in the way of that, and the phrase “pivot to Asia” became a running joke in US foreign policy circles. Joe Biden withdrew US troops from Afghanistan — not a Middle Eastern country but very much the archetypal “endless war” of the post-9/11 era — and put forward a foreign policy vision emphasizing great power competition with China. His national security adviser infamously described the Middle East as “quieter than it has been in decades” just days before the October 7 attacks shattered that quiet and shifted his boss's priorities. 

“Right now, President Trump is having what I call his ‘Michael Corleone' moment, and at some point, every president has one,” said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, referring to Al Pacino's famous line in The Godfather III, “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.”

But why does this dynamic keep repeating? Why, 45 years after Operation Eagle Claw and 22 after the invasion of Iraq, can't the US military “get out” of this region?

One big reason why the US keeps getting drawn into the Middle East's crises is that those crises keep happening. 

“The Middle East is an area of enduring national security interest of the United States, and it's far from stable,” said Emily Harding, a former CIA analyst now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And as a result, we're going to keep getting dragged in until it reaches something resembling stability.”

Why is it an important interest? The simple answer is economics. The Middle East contains two of the global economy's most important chokepoints: the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20 percent of global oil flows, and the Red Sea, through which 12 percent of global trade flowed until shipping was disrupted by Houthi attacks.

The “no blood for oil” slogans of Iraq War protesters were an oversimplification, but it's undoubtedly true that keeping the region's oil and gas flowing to the world has been a US priority since Franklin Roosevelt met with the king of Saudi Arabia aboard a cruiser on the Suez Canal in 1945, kicking off the modern US-Saudi relationship. In the 1970s, the principle that the US would use military force to prevent any country from a hostile takeover of the Gulf region, and its vast energy supplies, was enshrined as the “Carter Doctrine.”

Today, thanks to domestic production, the US is much less directly dependent on Middle Eastern oil than it used to be, but disruptions in the region can cause global energy prices to spike. 

Beyond economics, events ranging from the 9/11 attacks to the Syrian refugee crisis have illustrated that the Middle East's regional politics don't always stay regional. 

America's unique relationship with Israel is another reason why the US is continually involved in regional crises. For decades, the US has supported Israel and attempted, with mixed success, to help mediate its relationships with its neighbors and with the Palestinian territories. But the US military actually actively participating in Israel's wars rather than just sending weapons — as happened to some extent under Biden and now much more explicitly under Trump — is a fairly new dynamic. 

Ever since the 1960s, when Britain withdrew many of its “East of Suez” troop deployments, America has been the preeminent military power in the region. That remains true despite growing concern in Washington about China or Russia's influence. 

When crises do erupt, the US, with more than 40,000 troops in bases throughout the region and close security and political partnerships with key powers in the region, is often the outside power best positionedto intervene. When the Houthis began attacking shipping traveling through the Red Sea, there was little question of what country would lead the operation to combat them, much to the irritation of America Firsters like Vice President JD Vance.

Michael Wahid Hanna, director of the US program at Crisis Group, says another reason the US often feels compelled to intervene in Middle East crises is that it “had a major role in fomenting” something. He pointed to what he called the “two great sins of the post-Cold War era for the United States,” the failure to secure a resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict in the 1990s, when the US enjoyed far more leverage than it does today, and the invasion of Iraq. Both continue to drive instability in the region today. 

As Secretary of State Colin Powell's famous “Pottery Barn rule” warned in the run-up to the war in Iraq, “if you break it, you own it.”

Advocates of US engagement in the Middle East argue that if we pull back, it will create power vacuums that will be filled by malign actors. Obama felt compelled to redeploy US troops to Iraq just three years after withdrawing them when the country's military collapsed in the face of ISIS. 

But advocates of foreign policy restraint argue that the US isn't doomed to keep intervening, and that its presence isn't actually helping.

Stephen Wertheim, senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, believes that US security partnerships can actually embolden governments in the Middle East to escalate crises, knowing that they can count on US support to deal with the consequences. The most recent illustration is Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to attack Iran, made under the correct assumption that he would have backup from the Trump administration.

“What we have is a delusion in which we think that we can continue to maintain close security partnerships with states in the Middle East, station hundreds of thousands of US service members around the region indefinitely, and that somehow the next bombing will restore deterrence, and we'll get to peace and stability,” he said. “That hasn't worked for my whole lifetime. 

Whether you think America is uniquely positioned to provide stability or that it's the cause of the instability, voters should probably treat promises of pivots away from the Middle East with skepticism. 

Promising to bring American troops home is always going to be a political winner. And whether it's a rising China or America's own borders, one thing there's agreement on across the political spectrum is that America's core security interests are not in the Middle East. That's especially true as the country's post-9/11 focus on terrorism has faded. 

But, says Michael Rubin, senior fellow and Mideast specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, “Most Americans understand history through the lens of four-year increments. We believe each administration starts with a tabula rasa.” 

Administrations are often optimistic that one military campaign (such as Israel's recent decimation of Iran's Axis of Resistance) or one grand bargain (such as the Biden administration's attempts to reach a Saudi-Israel normalization deal that would also revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace process) will resolve the region's issues enough that America can move on to other things. 

The region's leaders, many of whom have been in power for decades, often take a longer view. More likely is that the regional crises, some of which we've played a role in creating, will be occupying America's attention for administrations to come.

Good morning. An American moved to France expecting the workplace dynamics to resemble those back home — they were wrong. For one, they had grown used to friendly yet professional office interactions with clear boundaries. Paris was different, they said. Workplace relationships felt far more personal.

In today's big story, Tesla's long-awaited robotaxis were rolled out in Austin.

What's on deck

Markets: From interviewing past midnight to scrambling to sign an offer, a PE professional shared his stressful on-cycle recruitment experience.

Tech: Apple pulled another ad. What's going on?

Business: Homebuyers can't afford to ignore the fight between Zillow and Compass anymore.

But first, there's a driver who won't judge your playlist.

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.

There were some bumps in the road. After a decade of waiting, Tesla launched a limited self-driving car service in Austin.

The first Tesla robotaxi rides were available on Sunday to a small group of invited users for a flat fee of $4.20 (surely not a coincidence). For now, the service is geofenced to avoid Austin's more challenging intersections.

The cars came with a passenger already buckled in — a Tesla employee as a safety precaution. In footage seen by BI, there appeared to be no significant intervention from the supervisor.

The vehicles did several things right, but the rollout wasn't without its hiccups. One video showed a passenger being driven across double yellow lines into the wrong lane, prompting a car behind to honk at it. During the same ride, the robotaxi also exceeded the 35-mph speed limit on multiple occasions.

While the rollout used the current Tesla Model Y, sources told BI the company is building a modified version of the car for its robotaxi fleet. The project, internally referred to as ""Halo,"" involves cars with self-cleaning cameras and extra protection for the cameras to prevent damage and debris, one insider said.

The rollout came at a turbulent time for Musk.

At the end of March, Tesla capped its worst quarter since 2022 amid protests at its showrooms. Then, earlier this month, Tesla stock plummeted more than 14% following a very embittered, very public falling out between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump.

Competition is also fierce. Waymo has such cabs in several cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Austin. They don't require human supervisors to be present, and their service range in Austin is about twice the size of Tesla's current operating limits.

Their technology differs, too. Tesla relies on a set of cameras mounted on its vehicles, rather than expensive radar and lidar sensors used by Waymo. This is in part why Musk expects Tesla's purpose-built Cybercab to sell for less than $30,000. Waymo, meanwhile, retrofits existing vehicles with its technology, which can result in a list price as high as $70,000.

Although the robotaxi arrived years later than promised, Tesla's rollout was a critical step for Musk's ambitions to make an Uber-like network of autonomous vehicles. The company's stock price leapt 8% when the markets opened on Monday, causing Musk's net worth to jump by $19 billion.

1. Inside private equity's recruiting nightmare. The industry's process for hiring junior talent is notoriously competitive and chaotic. One PE professional shared his recruiting experience with BI, detailing how he interviewed until 2:30 a.m. with one firm and hid in the bathroom to call headhunters during interviews with another.

2. More Fed officials are calling for rate cuts. Three top officials appear to be on the same page as President Donald Trump after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady last week. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell defended the central bank's patient approach in his testimony to Congress on Tuesday. Here's what the Fed officials are saying.

3. Tariff worries could soon make a comeback. July 9 is the end of the 90-day pause on Trump's tariffs. Markets are in relief mode now over Israel and Iran's ceasefire, but Morgan Stanley laid out three reasons why tariff anxiety could take center stage again.

1. How AI data centers are deepening the water crisis. Large AI data centers each guzzle up millions of gallons of fresh water a day — enough for tens of thousands of Americans. Despite drought deepening, a BI investigation found that Big Tech companies have put nearly half of these centers in the most water-stressed areas of the US.

2. Why does Apple keep pulling its ads? The iPhone maker used to be infamous for its ad campaigns, but now Apple is becoming more known for yanking them. Its latest ad vanished from YouTube and Apple's site a few days ago, and BI's Peter Kafka doesn't get why.

3. What we know about the mystery device from OpenAI and Jony Ive. Or rather, what it won't be. Tang Tan, cofounder of Ive's io, revealed in legal filings that the highly anticipated AI device doesn't go in your ear and isn't a wearable.

1. Homebuyers are caught in the middle of an ugly real-estate fistfight. Compass and Zillow have been trading blows over who gets to see the houses for sale in America and where buyers will have to go to find them. Everyday consumers can't afford to ignore it anymore, writes BI's James Rodriguez.

2. The vibes are rank in HR right now. Nonstop layoffs, RTO mandates, AI training demands, not to mention concerns over immigration raids in the workplace — it's all piling up on HR workers. They told BI about the parts of the job that are getting downright ugly.

3. Disney's tough June. The company laid off workers for the second time this month, this time in product and technology. The layoffs affected under 2% of the group, according to a person with direct knowledge.

Donald Trump said he will look into sending more Patriot air-defense batteries to Ukraine following “a good” meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as allies seek more US pressure on Russia to end the war.

Zelenskiy described the 45-minute encounter at a NATO summit on Wednesday as “long and substantive.” It was their first meeting since Kyiv and Moscow resumed direct talks to try to end the war. As the negotiations foundered, Russia hit Ukraine with a series of deadly aerial strikes in recent weeks, exposing the country's growing need for additional air defenses.

Apple:

The tech company's theatrical programming business is in need of a win. Early reviews suggest its new Brad Pitt racing film could provide it.

Damson Idris as Joshua Pearce and Brad Pitt as Sonny Hayes in F1.

Forty-eight hours before Formula One's Grand Prix took to the streets of Monaco in late May, Apple Inc. screened its upcoming F1 film for the real-life drivers and team managers competing at the pinnacle of motorsport. It was crucial to Apple's services boss, Eddy Cue, that the company get it right. Not only is Cue himself a lifelong racing fan who sits on the board of Ferrari NV, but the movie is among Apple's most expensive pictures to date, with a budget of more than $200 million. Raising the stakes even higher, it marks the tech giant's return to theaters since dialing back its earlier big-screen ambitions.

To capture the feel of sitting in a cockpit hurtling forward at 233 mph (375 kph), Apple mounted dozens of iPhone cameras on cars zooming through actual F1 events. In fact, the setup produced scenes so dramatic that the company has entered talks with Formula One to permanently affix its miniature lenses onto each car's fuselage, which would change how the sport is televised to roughly 70 million global viewers per race.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In his short political career, Vice President JD Vance has already proven himself to be a political shapeshifter who morphs into whatever suits his political ambitions. It's how he went from being an anti-Trump CNN commentator to President Donald Trump's second in command in just eight years. Now he is ditching another persona, that of the anti-interventionist, as he tries to sell Trump's strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities to a skeptical MAGA base and equally skeptical public.

In a speech Tuesday in Ohio, Vance unveiled what he called the Trump Doctrine, describing the attacks as an overwhelming success, even as preliminary reports suggest something far less.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

The indictment reads like a cinematic plot: A Harvard Fellow and another activist allegedly wanted to buy AK-47s, Stinger missiles and grenades to topple South Sudan's government. What they lacked was enough cash.

Now, Jane Street co-founder Robert Granieri concedes he put up the money — saying he was duped into funding the alleged coup plot. The role played by the wealthy recluse behind a Wall Street trading powerhouse emerges from the US prosecution of Peter Ajak, the Harvard Fellow who was accused last year of scheming to install himself atop the East African nation.

The state and local tax deduction, a write-off that primarily benefits higher-income Americans living in high-tax areas, is one of the most disputed provisions of Trump's tax bill.

Answer five simple questions about your taxes to see your estimated gain under the bill approved in the House and currently being revised in the Senate, which raises the SALT cap from $10,000 to $40,000.

Bloomberg will not store or collect any of your information.

⇩

A higher SALT cap overwhelmingly benefits more affluent Americans. Under the House bill, for instance, a married couple in Washington, DC is unlikely to receive any money back if their income is below $200,000.

Source: Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget

Note: Estimates based on a married couple filing jointly in Washington, DC who own a home worth five times their annual income and has combined charitable and mortgage interest deductions worth 12% of income. All references to income represent the adjusted gross income.

The lopsided benefits of a bigger SALT write-off have made it one of the most contentious pieces of Trump's tax bill. The gains disproportionately go to wealthy residents of blue states, where state and local taxes tend to be higher. This makes an increased cap unpopular to most Republicans.

But in a tight House where few votes can be spared, a handful of Republicans from swing districts in New York, New Jersey and California have staked their support of the bill on a higher deduction for state and local taxes.

Note: As of 2022 tax year. ZIP Codes that overlap multiple districts are weighted in proportion to land area.

The Senate bill currently places the SALT cap at $10,000, a placeholder while negotiations continue. Several House Republicans have threatened to block the bill if the cap is reduced.

Some compromise may be found in maintaining the $40,000 cap but lowering the income threshold, but SALT remains one of the crucial holdouts for the tax bill's passage.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said Spain's refusal to meet the NATO defense spending target of 5% of gross domestic product will mean a tougher trade deal for the southern European country.

Speaking at a news conference at NATO's annual summit in the Netherlands, Trump said it was ""terrible"" that Spain wouldn't commit to meeting the target by 2035.

""You know they are doing very well. The economy is [doing] very well. And that economy could be blown right out of the water with something bad happening,"" Trump said.

""You know what we're going to do? We're negotiating with Spain on a trade deal and we're going to make them pay twice as much — and I'm actually serious about that. I like Spain … it's a great place and they are great people, but Spain is the only country out of all of the countries that refuses to pay,"" he continued.

""So, they want a little bit of a free ride, but they will have to pay it back to us on trade because I am not going to let that happen. It's unfair,"" Trump said.

His comments come shortly after NATO allies agreed to more than double their defense spending target from 2% of GDP to 5% by 2035.

In a joint declaration, the Western military bloc said it was ""united in the face of profound security threats and challenges,"" in particular the long-term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security and the ""persistent threat"" of terrorism.

Earlier in the day, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the country would meet NATO's new capabilities targets, which refer to measures members should take to defend themselves and the broader military alliance.

However, Sanchez said Madrid considers current defense spending of 2% of GDP as ""sufficient, realistic and compatible with the welfare state,"" Reuters reported. Sanchez also reportedly thanked NATO allies for ""respecting Spain's sovereignty.""

A Spanish government spokesperson was not immediately available when contacted by CNBC.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday doubled down on his claim that U.S. bomb strikes completely destroyed Iran's nuclear program, and he bristled at the attention being paid to an initial American intelligence report that suggests otherwise.

""It's been obliterated, totally obliterated,"" Trump said of the Iranian nuclear site at Fordo during a news conference, before he departed a NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands.

A preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment, however, found that America's airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites did not completely destroy those facilities.

Rather, the U.S. bombings likely set Iran's nuclear program back by a few months, not years, according to the assessment, which was first reported by CNN and matched by other outlets including NBC News.

Trump on Wednesday acknowledged the existence of the Defense Intelligence Agency's report, which has not been made public but has been described to journalists by people familiar with it. But he suggested the data that informed it was insufficient.

""They did a report, but it was like, if you look at the dates, it's just a few days after, so they didn't see"" the sites, Trump said.

""The report was not a complete report,"" he said.

He added that the assessment said the damage from the U.S. attacks ""may be very severe,"" and complained that news outlets ignored that component in their reporting.

The reporting undermines claims from Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that the Saturday night strikes on Iran's Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan sites had totally ""obliterated"" the country's nuclear program.

The White House angrily pushed back on the report. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the initial assessment ""flat-out wrong"" and slammed the ""anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community"" who leaked the report's findings to the press.

Hegseth piled on, saying in a statement Tuesday evening that ""anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission.""

The Pentagon has launched a ""leak investigation"" with the FBI, Hegseth said Wednesday. He also noted that the report was preliminary and was labeled ""low confidence.""

Speaking alongside Trump at the press conference, Hegseth criticized ""fake news"" and defended the strikes.

""If you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordo, you better get a big shovel and go really deep, because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated,"" he said.

The White House also sent reporters a screenshot of a statement from Israel's Atomic Energy Commission, declaring that the U.S. strike on Fordo ""destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable.""

The commission said that the combined strikes from the U.S. and Israel have ""set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years.""

Classified briefings for the House and Senate on the situation in Iran, initially set for Tuesday, were both abruptly delayed that same morning.

The Senate briefing was reportedly rescheduled for Thursday and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said his chamber's briefing will be held Friday.

In this article

Shell pushed back Wednesday on reports that is in talks to buy rival BP.

People familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal that Shell was in early-stage talks to acquire BP, though a deal was far from certain. The talks are moving slowly, one person told the Journal.

BP shares jumped more than 10% to a session high of $32.94 on the report. Shell, however, subsequently denied talks were talking place. BP shares were last up about 2%. 

""This is further market speculation. No talks are taking place,"" a Shell spokesperson told CNBC. ""As we have said many times before we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification.""

It is unlikely Shell would purchase the entirety of BP, people familiar with the matter told CNBC's Brian Sullivan. It is more likely that BP would be split and sold in pieces to multiple companies if a deal did transpire, the people said.

BP has as underperformed Shell and U.S. rivals as it has struggled to find direction in recent years, fueling speculation that the British oil major is an acquisition target. 

BP set ambitious goals five years ago to slash carbon dioxide emissions and invest in renewable energy. But its green pivot came under scrutiny as profits faltered. BP announced a strategic reset earlier this year, doubling down on oil and gas while slashing spending on renewables.  

Activist investor Elliott Management disclosed in April that it has built a stake of more than 5% in BP, fueling speculation that the oil major would come under pressure to focus on its core fossil fuel business.

In this article

AeroVironment stock rocketed more than 24% higher Wednesday as the drone maker beat fourth quarter expectations on the top and bottom lines.

Here's how the company did compared to analyst expectations:

The company reported financial results after market close Tuesday but shares skyrocketed Wednesday morning as CNBC's Jim Cramer called it ""the Palantir of hardware"" on ""Squawk on the Street.""

The company logged record fiscal year revenue of $820.6 million, up 14% over the prior period.

AeroVironment reported net income of $16.66 million for the fourth quarter, or 59 cents per share, compared to net income of $6.05 million, or 22 cents per share, last year.

The company closed the $4.1 billion acquisition of defense tech company BlueHalo on May 1. BlueHalo makes drone and defense technology such as laser weapon systems, with a focus on space tech.

""Our acquisition of BlueHalo further advances our leadership position within the defense-technology sector by adding a complementary portfolio of innovative products and capabilities aligned to our customers' highest priorities,"" AeroVironment CEO Wahid Nawabi said in a statement.

For the new fiscal year, the company said it expects revenues to range between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. The company forecast earnings between $2.80 and $3.00 per share.

NATO allies on Wednesday agreed to more than double their defense spending target from 2% of gross domestic product to 5% by 2035, in the most decisive move from the alliance in more than a decade.

In a joint declaration, the Western military bloc said it was ""united in the face of profound security threats and challenges,"" in particular the long-term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security and the ""persistent threat"" of terrorism.

""Allies commit to invest 5% of GDP annually on core defence requirements as well as defence-and security-related spending by 2035 to ensure our individual and collective obligations,"" it continued.

The 5% figure is made up of ""at least"" 3.5% of GDP that should be spent on ""pure"" defense, with the remainder going to security and defense-related ""critical infrastructure"" to ensure, the statement said, ""our civil preparedness and resilience, unleash innovation, and strengthen our defence industrial base.""

Allies will be required to submit annual plans ""showing a credible, incremental path to reach this goal,"" NATO said, following pushback from some member states, particularly Spain.

Some member states have yet to meet the 2014 target to spend 2% of GDP on defense.

The historic move comes against a backdrop of tensions in the Middle East and ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. Members have also been pushed to the new target after years of pressure across both terms of U.S. President Donald Trump for Washington's Canadian and European allies to share more of the burden of collective defense.

The alliance on Wednesday also reaffirmed its ""ironclad commitment to collective defence"" as enshrined in Article 5 that an attack on one is an attack on all, following question marks over U.S. reliability when it came to that central pillar of NATO.

""We remain united and steadfast in our resolve to protect our one billion citizens, defend the Alliance, and safeguard our freedom and democracy,"" the statement read.

Addressing the summit, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the agreement would fuel a ""quantum leap"" in the alliance's collective defense.

The deal would ""not only increase our security but also create jobs,"" Rutte continued, saying allies had made ""significant commitments to meet significant threats.""

Allies recognized the severity of the threats facing the alliance, he said, and were ""united in understanding that we need to step up to stay safe.""

He said Trump had emphasized that America is committed to NATO but expects European allies and Canada to contribute more, ""and that is exactly what we see them doing,"" Rutte said.

Rutte acknowledged that this was ""Day One"" of the effort needed to increase the alliance's defense capabilities and said ""we need to innovate and we need to act fast.""

""The decisions made today will make NATO much stronger, they also make NATO a fairer alliance. The resolve of allies is clear: we are in this together, committed to Article 5, and we are determined to stand firm,"" he said.

As he took questions from the press on his relationship with Trump, Rutte said, ""I think he deserves all the praise.""

As he jetted into the summit late on Tuesday, Trump had appeared to question NATO's central tenet of collective defense, Article 5, that states that an attack on one member is an attack on all.

""There's numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right?"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. ""But I'm committed to being their friends, you know, I've become friends with many of those leaders, and I'm committed to helping them.""

Rutte on Wednesday said that he trusted the president and that the U.S. was ""totally committed"" to the pact, stating: ""You know, Article 5 is absolutely clear, and at the same time we have always said that we will never go into details on when Article 5 will be triggered.""

Rutte also said he believed Spain was ""serious"" and committed to the 3.5% target, despite Madrid voicing misgivings over the hike ahead of the summit.

Likening the 2025 meeting to a ""rebalancing of a new NATO where we have more balance and more Europe in it,"" the president of Finland told CNBC after the release of the joint statement that the atmosphere at the summit had been ""cool, calm and collected.""

""There was a lot of self-congratulation which I think was deserved because in many ways this was a historic meeting of NATO going back to its roots of collective self-defense as a deterrent to Russia,"" Alexander Stubb told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick.

Stubb said Trump and Rutte were ""very happy"" with the outcome and ""there were a lot of smiles around the table, regardless of the difficult situation that we're in.""

""I think the Americans are happy and ... the Europeans have woken up and smelled the coffee,"" he added.

Commenting on Spain's apparent pivot, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told CNBC that ""at the end of the day, they knew one against 31 [member states] makes no sense.""

That NATO would ""stick together completely"" was the ""ironclad"" message from the summit, he told CNBC's Sedgwick. He noted that Berlin, which had committed to a 5% spending target ahead of this week's gathering, took some time to get to this point but was now ready to show more leadership when it comes to European defense.

""The U.S. has recognized that Europe is back again,"" he said.

In this article

Bumble shares rallied more than 26% on Wednesday after the dating app company revealed in a securities filing that it intends to slash 30% of its workforce, or about 240 roles.

The layoffs will result in $13 million to $18 million in charges for the company hitting in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Management estimates that the reductions will help the company save $40 million annually.

A Bumble spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC that the layoffs were ""not made lightly.""

""Our focus now is on moving forward in a way that strengthens our core business, continues to serve our members effectively, and positions us for future growth,"" they wrote.

Bumble said the cuts are part of a reconfiguration of its ""operating structure to optimize execution on its strategic priorities."" The company plans to invest savings into new product and technology development.

Shares of the dating app company have plunged since their debut on the public markets in 2021. Its market value has plummeted from $7.7 billion to about $538 million as of Tuesday's close.

Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, who stepped down as CEO at the beginning of 2024, returned to the role earlier this year.

Along with the job cuts, Bumble updated its previously announced forecast for the current quarter.

The company now expects revenue to range between $244 million and $249 million, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization between $88 million and $93 million.

That's up from the $235 million to $243 million in revenue and $79 million to $84 million in adjusted EBITDA forecast with Bumble's first-quarter results last month.

ESPN is renewing its media deal with the Premier Lacrosse League and taking an equity stake in the organization.

The five-year deal will begin with the 2026 season and include all PLL regular-season games as well as All-Star, playoff and championship games and Women's Lacrosse League games. The deal comes as pro lacrosse has seen gains across broadcast, partnerships and attendance. It will also be added to the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

Alongside the deal, Disney-owned ESPN said it will take a minority stake in the league. A person familiar with the terms, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic details, said the investment gives ESPN a 3% stake.

""ESPN are not only experts in their understanding sports fans, but they are also great predictors of audience and growth,"" PLL co-founder and president Paul Rabil told CNBC. ""It's validating that they came in to invest in what we're building, and then as a partner, in addition to the expansion of coverage that they'll be giving.""

Rabil said the media deal with ESPN has been critical to the sport's growth. He said the network has been investing in lacrosse for roughly three decades.

The partnership also seems to be paying off for ESPN. During the 2024 season, viewership on ABC for the PLL's championship game was up 9% year over year. The league also had its most-viewed All-Star game in its history, which aired on ESPN.

The PLL is also seeing growth in nearly all metrics. Since 2019, paid tickets are up 34%, attendance is up 13%, ticket revenue is up 149% and sponsor dollars are up more than 100%, Rabil said.

The league, now in its seventh season, has financial backing from the likes of Joe Tsai, the Chernin Group, Arctos, the Kraft Group and CAA.

Last year, PLL announced it was starting a Women's Lacrosse League, which is currently in its inaugural season.

America's Top States for Business 2025 will be revealed July 10 - stay tuned for coverage of this year's rankings

On a massive, 2,250-acre site about 250 miles north of New Orleans, hundreds of construction workers and tons of heavy equipment are turning former soybean fields into what will be the largest data center in the Western Hemisphere. And in the process, officials say, they are transforming Louisiana's economy.

""It put us on a scale that has a lot of people, not just domestically, but internationally, sort of rethinking Louisiana,"" Secretary of Economic Development Susan Bourgeois told CNBC.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, announced in December that it had chosen Louisiana as the site for its largest data center to date — a $10 billion hub for its rapidly growing artificial intelligence operations. The announcement set off the public phase of a sprawling, real world experiment in the promise and the peril of data centers — which have become among the most sought-after trophies in the battle between the states for business.

Data centers are essentially giant collections of computer servers, which are needed to process enormously complex operations for things like artificial intelligence and data storage. They typically take up massive spaces and use huge amounts of power and water, but they employ very few people. Meta's newest data center will ultimately create just 500 permanent jobs, though employment will briefly swell to about 5,000 during construction. Nonetheless, Meta found itself with no shortage of suitors willing to meet its demands.

""We set out looking for a place where we could expand into gigawatts pretty quickly, and really get moving within that community on a large plot of land very quickly,"" said Rachel Peterson, vice president of data centers for Meta. ""We looked at finding very, very large contiguous plots of land that had access to the infrastructure that we need, the energy that we needed, and could move very, very quickly for us.""

Louisiana was one of the few states that could deliver a site as large as Meta needed — the equivalent of about 1,700 football fields. The state had already purchased most of the land, in rural Richland Parish, back in 2006 in hopes of luring an automotive plant that never materialized.

As for the energy — the Meta site will use roughly twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day — local utility Entergy said it could deliver.

""What I see is an opportunity for this industry to grow in a way it hasn't seen in many decades,"" said Phillip May, CEO of Entergy Louisiana. The company is seeking regulatory approval to build not one, but three gas-fired power plants at the site, at a cost of more than $3 billion.

The one piece Louisiana did not have was one that Bourgeois said was non-negotiable for Meta: a program to allow the company to avoid paying potentially billions of dollars in sales tax on the equipment to build and operate the center.

Last June, only six months after taking office, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law a 20-year sales tax exemption for data centers built before 2029. The fact that the state was courting Meta at the time was not disclosed.

""The Meta folks made it clear to us from day one that in order for a project like this to happen in any state, that exemption or rebate — whatever the formula is — has to exist,"" Bourgeois said.

""It's one of the things that we look at,"" said Peterson. ""Obviously these are very high investment capital projects for us and any others who are developing data centers and investing them. So, we do look at the overall cost of the project to make sure it's in line with what we'd expect,"" she added.

A recent CNBC investigation found that in just the past five years, 16 states have handed out nearly $6 billion in similar sales tax breaks, and that is just the ones that have been disclosed. More often, the amounts are either undisclosed, or, as appears to be the case in Louisiana, officials don't know the exact cost yet.

An analysis by the state's Legislative Fiscal Office in May said the incentive could cost the state ""tens of millions of dollars or more each year, possibly through (fiscal year) 2059.""

But whatever the cost, Bourgeois said the benefits of the project outweigh it.

""This wasn't about what the state would win or lose, just that one isolated sales tax,"" she said. ""This was about we want to compete with Texas. We want to compete with Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, all our Southern neighbors.""

Meta earned $164.5 billion in revenue last year.

There are also concerns about the energy needs of the facility, even though Entergy has committed to generate massive amounts of electricity to support it.

The Louisiana Public Service Commission is considering the utility's proposal to build three new power plants. But a citizen's group, Alliance for Affordable Energy, is warning that the project could compromise the state's power grid and increase electricity rates statewide.

""While they're building new power plants, they're also adding a huge consumer of electricity,"" said Jackson Voss, Climate Policy Coordinator for the group. ""Which means we're all still facing the same vulnerabilities that we were before, but now with a huge new data center added on.""

Louisiana has a spotty track record on grid reliability. According to U.S. Department of Energy data analyzed by CNBC for this year's America's Top States for Business study, the average Louisiana customer lost power for 9.7 hours in 2023, the most recent data available, ranking the state in 40th place, though Entergy by itself performed substantially better.

Still, as many as 100,000 Entergy customers in the New Orleans area lost power on Memorial Day weekend when the regional power grid became overloaded.

Entergy's May said that the added generation capacity for the Meta facility — including 1,500 megawatts of solar power in addition to the gas-fired plants — will make the grid more stable, not less. And he said the project will ultimately reduce electric bills across the state.

""We're getting new power plants that will be improving in terms of the efficiency. There will be lower fuel costs as a result of adding incremental, more efficient power plants,"" he said.

Plus, he said, while Entergy will pay for the power plants, Meta will pay for the infrastructure to connect to them.

""So, hundreds of millions of dollars of support from this customer that would not otherwise have been there had Meta not come.""  

More important, he said, the project will be a huge economic boost for Richland Parish — one of the poorest areas in the state, if not the nation.

""This massive $10 billion investment, coupled with the billions of dollars that we're going to invest ourselves, is going to bring new opportunities for these communities,"" he said.

""500 jobs in Richland Parish, or even in this northeast Louisiana region, is transformational,"" Bourgeois said.

Plus, she said, this project opens the door for more of the same.

""I could try to sell Louisiana to the world for a long time,"" she said. ""The fact that [Meta] chose us makes my job a lot easier.""

In this article

U.S. Treasury yields were higher on Wednesday as investors monitored the Israel-Iran ceasefire and awaited Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's second day of testimony before Congress.

The 10-year Treasury yield climbed 1.9 basis points to 4.312%, while the 2-year yield was marginally higher to 3.739%. The 30-year yield was last 2.6 basis points higher at 4.856%.

One basis point equals 0.01% and yields move inversely to prices.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran on Tuesday, but the two countries violated it initially by firing non-lethal rockets. The ceasefire has held since, but investors will keep an eye on the situation to keep track of any uncertainty.

Investors also weighed Powell's second testimony before Congress, after he delivered remarks to the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday. The central bank leader reiterated that policymakers will continue to hold rates as they wait and see the impact of tariffs on prices.

""Policy changes continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain,"" Powell said. ""The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level.""

Trump has continued to fire criticism at Powell for his wait-and-see approach and posted Tuesday, on the Truth Social platform, that he hopes ""Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Greece is one of NATO's top defense spenders. Here's why","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/25/greece-is-one-of-natos-top-defense-spenders-heres-why.html","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 05:15:15 GMT","



Sun-soaked Greece may not immediately come to mind as a top defense spender — but only four NATO allies spent a bigger slice of their GDP on security than the Mediterranean country last year.

In addition to the U.S., NATO estimates show that tally includes Poland, Latvia and Estonia, which ramped up their defense expenditures in response to Russian aggression in recent years.

Greece has meanwhile consistently been a big defense spender, spending around 3.1% of its GDP on defense in 2024.

At the core of Athens' defense spending motivations is its tense and fractious relationship with fellow NATO ally Turkey.

Greece and Turkey have ""a lot of historical baggage,"" Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at Bruegel, told CNBC.

Tensions between the two nations date back several hundred years and include war, the displacement of over 1 million people, clashes over controlling Cyprus, and a strong geographical element due to Greece's many islands, he said.

""You have this very large number of Greek islands quite close to the Turkish coast that, in principle, the Turks could invade relatively easily,"" Kirkegaard said. ""Greece has traditionally maintained a ... non-trivial military presence on virtually all these islands, and that is quite expensive because it means you have to have... a lot of garrisons.""

Concerns about the ""Turkish threat"" are still relevant today, George Tzogopoulos, senior fellow at ELIAMEP, told CNBC.

""Greece spends a lot on defence to protect its sovereignty and sovereign rights,"" he said.

Instability in nearby countries and regions including the Middle East, and especially Turkey's ""muscular policy"" across the Mediterranean, have made it is crucial for Greece to continue with its strong defense spending, Tzogopoulos explained.

""Greece has no alternative but be prepared for all scenarios,"" he added.

Greece's military strength has cracks despite the country's large defense budget, experts say.

For example, Greece has increasingly been focusing on investing in sophisticated weapons systems, especially since the Russia-Ukraine war, Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of political risk advisory at Teneo, told CNBC.

But, he noted, ""much of that spending has been directed abroad.""

""The country still lacks a strong domestic defense industry and a key priority moving forward is to build and sustain an indigenous industrial base that can reduce dependence on foreign arms suppliers,"" Piccoli said.

Greece's military capabilities is also plagued by practical problems, Kirkegaard added. Many of the Greek army's numerous tanks are relatively old, and personnel is not trained to use these vehicles in large formations. Equipment is also often very spread out across the country's islands.

""So it would be a mistake, therefore, in the case of Greece, to equate spending with sort of flat out military capabilities,"" Kirkegaard said.

As NATO officials gather this week, Greece's defense spending levels should also strengthen the country's voice among the coalition's 32 members.

The expenditures have already boosted Greece's relationship with major powers like the U.S. and France, Piccoli said, partly because these nations supply military equipment to Athens.

""Defense spending in Greece also functions as a tool of geopolitical leverage, enhancing its standing and security guarantees in a complex regional environment,"" Piccoli added.

Top of agenda at the NATO summit will be defense spending, with Reuters reporting that coalition members have agreed in principle to hike their target for such expenditures to 5% of their GDP. This includes 3.5% on traditional defense issues and 1.5% on related elements like infrastructure and cybersecurity.

The jump to a 5% target will be much smaller for Greece compared to many other nations, but even Athens might not quite make it, Kirkegaard suggested.

""Do I therefore think that Greece is is one of the countries that's going to be particularly responsive to these new NATO targets? No, I think the answer is no, because the broader shift in NATO expenditure levels is driven by Russian aggression, which is not, you know, Greece's principal military challenge,"" he said.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

The U.S. entering the Israel-Iran conflict over the weekend has dominated media headlines, but the rustlings this week at the ""Summer Davos"" conference in Tianjin, China, were more about navigating a future less intertwined with Washington.

A decade ago, goods, capital, tech and talent flowed between the so-called East and West; now it's about flows between Global South countries, said Ben Simpfendorfer, Hong Kong-based partner at management consultancy Oliver Wyman.

""The mood [in Tianjin] reflects a changed world order. The Global South is more connected than ever.""

Global South loosely refers to less developed economies, especially countries outside the U.S. and European orbits. Think Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East — all regions China has sought to develop trade and political relations with.

""There are 130 neutral countries that are willing to do business across geopolitical fractures and are looking for business, and many of them are run by leaders who are relatively internationalist ... I do look forward to opportunities in the Global South,"" said Aparna Bharadwaj, managing director at Global Advantage Practice at a WEF panel.

China, which has been deepening its relationship with the Global South, had its Premier Li Qiang urging more trade for ""reshaping"" the world order at the WEF forum on Wednesday.

""We could be moving to a world where Asia and the Middle East emerge as a new and compelling economic bloc that are still integrated to a degree with Europe and the United States but that integration fluctuates,"" Simpfendorfer said.

Since 2007, the Swiss-based World Economic Forum has run a summer version of its Davos gathering in China, alternating between the cities of Tianjin and Dalian, both in the northern part of the country.

But as local Chinese governments have ramped up their own conferences and the overall economy has slowed, foreign businesses interested in China have not had to rely as much on Summer Davos matchmaking. Disruptions from the pandemic and U.S-China tensions have also taken their toll.

This year though, even otherwise quiet groups of attendees turned into slightly aggressive crowds to snag spots for select events including talks on artificial intelligence and the economic outlook.

Seats filled up fast for the release of WEF's annual ""Top 10 Emerging Technologies"" report — now in its third year of collaboration with the Dubai Future Foundation. Previously, the report had been created by the forum with Scientific American.

Some prominent leaders took the opportunity to visit China. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa Azín were among the top political leaders attending this year.

""The U.S. tariff shock has been a wake-up call for the Global South in general about the need to diversify,"" Simpfendorfer said, citing recent conversations with businesses in Malaysia and Vietnam.

But he pointed out that it won't be easy to shift from targeting one U.S. market to multiple Global South markets.

To attract trade partners, countries from Egypt to Vietnam to China are all trying to enhance their economic competitiveness.

""It's a wake-up call for Chinese multinationals to build out genuinely international businesses,"" Simpfendorfer said, adding that the learnings from the past two decades would no longer be a good guide for the next 20 years, given the transformational impact of artificial intelligence.

Egyptian Minister of Investment and Trade Hassan El Khatib told CNBC's Chery Kang on the sidelines of the forum on Tuesday that the country aspires to be in the top 20 in business competitiveness by 2030, following a major reform program launched last year to spur private sector development. He emphasized Egypt's labor pool and engineering talent, and noted how the country was courting investors from around the world.

As U.S.-China tensions remain far from resolved, more countries may be keen to take the Chinese premier up on his invitation to reshape the world.

—  CNBC's Bernice Ooi contributed to this report.

Johnson Chui, Head of Global Issuer Services at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, talks about recent renewed interest in Hong Kong as a market, as it attracts a wave of foreign investors and IPOs. 

Eswar Prasad, professor at Cornell University and former head of IMF's China division, talks about why both U.S. and China are feeling the pressure to ""lower the temperature"" on their trade relationship.

Joe Ngai, Chairman of McKinsey China, believes that corporates in China have shown resilience despite external threats including tariff uncertainties and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

China's fiscal revenue growth stalls in May. The central government's fiscal revenue grew just 0.1% in May from a year earlier, slowing from a 1.9% expansion in April. Non-tax revenue declined 2.2%, its first annual drop since 2014, while tax revenue saw a modest gain of 0.6% from a year earlier.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang urged not to turn trade into a political matter. He was speaking at the opening plenary of the World Economic Forum's annual conference in China, often dubbed ""Summer Davos."" The Chinese leader called on other countries to collaborate on trade and pledged to ""make China a mega-sized consumption powerhouse.""

Beijing tempers criticism of Israel. China initially pledged to support Iran shortly after Israel's attack on June 12. Despite that initial show of support for Iran, Beijing's rhetoric has shifted to become more measured.

— Anniek Bao

Mainland China and Hong Kong stocks rose early Wednesday amid mixed trading in the region, as investors weighed a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, and fresh commentary from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Mainland China's CSI 300 was up 0.35%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes major Chinese companies — had gained 0.77% as of 12:20 p.m. local time.

 Senior Contributor. 

06/25 update below. This post was originally published on June 24

Bitcoin and crypto have rebounded after a major escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict sent prices spiraling amid fears of a “doomsday” scenario.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has climbed back over $100,000 per bitcoin, helped by U.S. president Donald Trump's shock prediction of “massive” crypto investment.

06/25 update: The bitcoin price has suddenly surged back toward touching distance of its all-time high of around $112,000 per bitcoin, climbing to over $107,000 after dipping under $100,000 this past weekend. 

The rally has emboldened bitcoin price bulls who remained optimistic in the face of geopolitical unrest over the last two weeks.

“Bitcoin's status as a safe-haven asset is still taking shape, but recent signals suggest it's edging closer,” Gadi Chait, head of investment at Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments.

“Traditionally seen as volatile, bitcoin's response to recent macro shocks, like the events in the Middle East, has been notably restrained, neither tracking gold perfectly nor mirroring equity sell-offs. Its V‑shaped recovery back above $105,000 in under 48 hours after falling into the nineties, highlights its growing liquidity and integration into mainstream portfolios.”

Now, as the market digests a Congress game-changer expected to “unleash” trillions, bitcoin and crypto prices are braced for Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony before lawmakers—coming after Trump suddenly flipped on firing him.

U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has committed to keep interest rates on hold, with some ... More predicting the bitcoin price and wider crypto market could soar once when it begins cutting.

“Aside from any geopolitical updates, today's key event will be Fed chair Jerome Powell's testimony in Washington,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments.

Trump posted to his Truth Social account over night that the Federal Reserve board should “activate,"" forcing Powell, who he's branded “too late,” to cut rates by ""at least two to three points,"" and ""save the U.S. more than $800 billion per year.”

“I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over,” Trump added.

The Fed kept interest rates on hold again last week after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that's been put on pause due to fears Trump's global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation.

“All eyes are on the Federal Reserve chair Jerome's testimony before Congress and Friday's PCE inflation print to determine how close the Fed may be to its long-awaited policy pivot,” Ray Youssef , the chief executive of NoOnes, said via email.

“The most bullish scenario would be confirmation of a Fed dovish policy pivot or a major de-escalation in global trade and geopolitical tensions, either of which could spark renewed interest in risk assets and push bitcoin towards retesting its all-time high.”

Expectations around an eventual Fed interest rate cut have been built up by crypto traders and influencers on social media.

“Buckle up,” one crypto trader posted to X alongside a hopeful prediction that “trillions” will flow in to crypto once the Fed eventually cuts rates—now priced at a 22% chance in July, up from just 10% last week, according to the CME FedWatch tracker.

The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last year, with some predicting the bitcoin price will climb ... More even higher once the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.

Two Fed officials, Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago president Austan Goolsbee, have this week joined Fed governor Christopher Waller admitting it may be time to lower interest rates.

“It is time to consider adjusting the policy rate,” Bowman told a gathering held in Prague, it was reported by Reuters, while Goolsbee reportedly said that Trump's trade tariffs have “not been what people feared.""

Powell has pointed to the expected increase in inflation as a result of Trump's so-called Liberation Day of global trade tariffs as reason to take a “wait-and-see” approach to adjusting interest rates.

Last week, Waller has said he doesn't expect Trump's tariffs to drive inflation higher so policymakers should be looking to lower interest rates as early as July.

“If you're starting to worry about the downside risk [to the] labor market, move now, don't wait,” Waller told CNBC.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

San Francisco-based financial services company SoFi will make its return to crypto later this year, offering its users the ability to trade and hold popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the firm announced on Wednesday. 

SoFi previously offered the capability to buy and sell crypto, and even acquired the notoriously difficult-to-obtain New York BitLicense in 2019—but the firm stopped offering crypto services in 2023 after “careful consideration.” 

The firm also mentioned plans to offer customers stablecoins in the future, along with crypto staking features, borrowing against their crypto holdings, and other services.

“The future of financial services is being completely reinvented through innovations in crypto, digital assets, and blockchain more broadly,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto in a statement.

📣 BIG new feature announcement incoming for SoFi—TWO, actually.1️⃣ Send money worldwide faster, easier, and for less 🌎And, 🥁 please…2️⃣ Crypto's back, baby 😎

— SoFi (@SoFi) June 25, 2025



“Crypto and blockchain innovations can and will be threaded through each of our businesses and capabilities, including buying, paying, saving, investing, borrowing, and protecting,” he added. “And in doing so, we will continue to stand alone in offering our members unmatched products and services as the only digital one-stop shop for their financial needs.”

The firm's intentions to re-enter the crypto market shouldn't come as a surprise, as the move was outlined by Noto during a January earnings call. 

During that call, Noto leaned on the need for crypto regulations, highlighting that his firm would be “aggressive” once further clarity was provided.

One such example outlined in the firm's Wednesday announcement is the ability for nationally chartered banks, like SoFi Bank, N.A., to custody crypto and execute services on their behalf. 

In May, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an interpretive letter permitting national banks to do so, signaling a broader alignment with easing regulations against crypto policies and companies that President Trump's administration has ushered in.

In addition to re-enabling crypto trading and custody, the firm says it has “many planned crypto and blockchain innovations” it intends to roll out through its “one-stop shop” of financial services. 

Shares of SoFi Technologies (SOFI) are up about 0.7% today to $15.96, with the price up about 13% so far this year.

SoFi did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

 A sharp drop in BTC inflows to Binance could play a role in Bitcoin possibly rallying to $120,000. 

Key takeaways: 

Bitcoin inflows on Binance have dropped to 5,147 BTC, less than half of previous bear market levels, despite BTC trading above $105,000, signaling a possible decline in short-term selling pressure.

Bitcoin has reclaimed its 50-day EMA, historically a signal for breakout rallies. Technical indicators, including rising spot CVD, point to strong spot demand and potential upside toward $120,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) inflows and outflows on Binance can reveal insights into market sentiment. Data from CryptoQuant pointed out that BTC's 30-day moving average (DMA) inflows on Binance dropped to 5,147 BTC on June 24, despite prices trading comfortably above $100,000. In fact, the 30-DMA inflows in December 2024 were around three times higher, with 13,200 BTC on Dec. 5, when Bitcoin was valued at under $100,000. 

While outflows draw market attention, inflows can directly reflect investor behavior, especially during derisking and profit-taking periods. Historically, spikes in BTC inflows to exchanges have corresponded with local market tops, preceding short to mid-term corrections. This behavior was evident during the FTX collapse in late 2022, when monthly BTC inflows surged to roughly 24,000 BTC, reflecting panic selling.

In contrast, the latest data paints a different picture. Despite Bitcoin trading above the $105,000 mark, monthly inflows to Binance have plunged below bear market benchmarks. This figure is less than half the panic levels seen during the FTX and significantly lower than the average monthly inflow of 12,000 BTC recorded since 2020. 

Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. added more context to the current inflows and outflows in BTC, saying,

This pronounced drop in inflows strongly suggests a shift in investor strategy. Rather than rushing to sell into strength, market participants appear to be holding onto their coins, signaling a reduction in selling pressure. 

Still, the broader environment remains complex. The market's reaction to geopolitical events and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty means any bullish momentum must be cautiously approached. While the data hints at a more confident, long-term investor base, price action could still be vulnerable to external shocks.

Crypto trader Ibrahim Cosar said Bitcoin's recent move back above its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) may set the stage for a rally toward $120,000.

According to Cosar, the 50-day EMA remains a key technical level that has historically acted as strong support during corrective phases within uptrends. He noted a recurring pattern where brief dips below this level, followed by quick recoveries, exhibit bullish breakouts of 10% to 20%. The analyst added, 

Additionally, crypto commentator IT Tech pointed out that BTC bulls are in control, driven by a rising cumulative volume delta (CVD) spot indicator. The CVD indicator measures the net difference between buying and selling pressure over time by aggregating volume data to reveal the balance of market participant behavior. As observed, rising CVD signals strong spot demand for BTC, with prices around the $108,000 level.

U.S. President Donald Trump's media company is accelerating its crypto play.

The New York Stock Exchange filed for a rule change on Tuesday that would enable it to list the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, a dual-asset fund proposed just last week by Trump Media and Technology Group.

If approved, the ETF would hold bitcoin BTC$107,362.61 and ether ETH$2,427.22 in a 3:1 ratio and be custodied and executed by Crypto.com, which also serves as the fund's liquidity provider.

The filing, made under the SEC's 19b-4 process, marks a key procedural step toward public trading but doesn't guarantee approval.

It comes less than a month after Trump Media said it would raise $2.4 billion to build its own BTC treasury, though there have been no announced purchases so far.

Beyond the Truth Social ETF filings, Trump Media and Yorkville are planning a full suite of politically branded crypto products, including the America First Bitcoin Fund, the America First Blockchain Leaders Fund, and the America First Stablecoin Income Fund.

Only the Truth-branded ETFs have been formally filed with the SEC so far.

On Tuesday, the New York Stock Exchange filed a proposed rule change to allow the listing of an ETF from Trump Media & Technology Group, which would track Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to an SEC filing.

The application comes just eight days after Trump Media, through a partnership with Yorkville America, filed a prospectus for the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, which would feature a 75% Bitcoin and 25% Ethereum holdings ratio. 

“The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in that the shares will be listed and traded on the exchange pursuant to the initial and continued listing criteria in NYSE,” the SEC filing reads.

Crypto.com will act as the custodian, execution agent, and liquidity provider.

The so-called 19b-4 rule changes are an important step in the regulatory process for considering ETFs, but do not obligate the SEC to approve a product.

It comes as the agency's attitude toward crypto investments has pivoted to a more favorable stance under the new administration. 

President Donald Trump has appointed crypto supporters to the regulator's upper management echelon, who share his recent positions on digital assets.

The filing is not the first tie between Trump Media and Yorkville, which previously sponsored the entity's filing for a standalone Bitcoin ETF in early June called the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF.

In addition to those two filings, the pair and Crypto.com aim to offer a suite of “America First” products, like the America First Bitcoin Fund (AFBF), America First Blockchain Leaders Fund (AFBLF), and the America First Stablecoin Income Fund. 

To date, only the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF have filed with the SEC.

The Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum fund further entwines Trump Media with crypto.

In late May, it raised $2.4 billion to start its own Bitcoin treasury, though the company has yet to announce any acquisitions in the world's largest digital asset.

Trump Media operates social media site Truth Social, a streaming platform called Truth+, and a financial technology brand called Truth.Fi. President Trump is a majority stakeholder in the firm. 

Bitcoin was recently trading at $106,000, a 0.5% increase over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

It dipped below $100,000 over the weekend for the first time since early May after the U.S. bombed Iran before rebounding as hostilities subsided. 

Ethereum was changing hands at roughly $2,440, up about 1.1% since Monday.

Truth Social operator, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp, has filed a Form 19b-4 to list the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF on NYSE Arca.

According to a June 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ETF, proposed under the ticker symbol B.T., would hold 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum.

The product is structured as a commodity-based trust, with Yorkville America Digital named as sponsor and Crypto.com's affiliated trust entity, Foris DAX Trust Company, acting as custodian for both crypto assets.

The ETF aims to provide a simplified, single-ticker exposure to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. If approved, it would trade on NYSE Arca and offer retail and institutional investors access to spot Bitcoin and Ethereum markets through traditional brokerage platforms.

The latest Form 19b-4 submission follows Trump Media's June 16 announcement that it had filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC.

While the S-1 covers disclosure and structural details required for a public offering, the 19b-4 is a separate procedural step seeking regulatory approval for the product to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange. Both forms are necessary before the ETF can launch.

The Form 19b-4 reiterates key elements first outlined in the S-1, including the fund's passive investment strategy and the use of CME CF benchmark reference rates to calculate net asset value. 

According to the filing, the fund's Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings will be custodied in cold storage by Foris DAX Trust Company, a Crypto.com affiliate. In addition to custody, Crypto.com will also serve as the execution agent and provide staking and liquidity services to support the fund's operations.

With the 19b-4 now submitted, the SEC will begin its formal review process. The Commission has up to 240 days to make a final decision, though an initial response is typically issued within 45 days.

With crypto ETFs seeing heavy demand in the U.S., Trump Media has now put forward its second offering. The earlier proposal, filed June 3 via NYSE Arca, seeks to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, a spot product focused solely on Bitcoin, using the same sponsor and custodian as the dual-asset fund.

As of now, it remains under SEC review, with the agency's final decision expected by Jan. 29, 2026, if all extensions are used.

San Francisco-based financial services company SoFi will make its return to crypto later this year, offering its users the ability to trade and hold popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the firm announced on Wednesday. 

SoFi previously offered the capability to buy and sell crypto, and even acquired the notoriously difficult-to-obtain New York BitLicense in 2019—but the firm stopped offering crypto services in 2023 after “careful consideration.” 

The firm also mentioned plans to offer customers stablecoins in the future, along with crypto staking features, borrowing against their crypto holdings, and other services.

“The future of financial services is being completely reinvented through innovations in crypto, digital assets, and blockchain more broadly,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto in a statement.

📣 BIG new feature announcement incoming for SoFi—TWO, actually.1️⃣ Send money worldwide faster, easier, and for less 🌎And, 🥁 please…2️⃣ Crypto's back, baby 😎

— SoFi (@SoFi) June 25, 2025



“Crypto and blockchain innovations can and will be threaded through each of our businesses and capabilities, including buying, paying, saving, investing, borrowing, and protecting,” he added. “And in doing so, we will continue to stand alone in offering our members unmatched products and services as the only digital one-stop shop for their financial needs.”

The firm's intentions to re-enter the crypto market shouldn't come as a surprise, as the move was outlined by Noto during a January earnings call. 

During that call, Noto leaned on the need for crypto regulations, highlighting that his firm would be “aggressive” once further clarity was provided.

One such example outlined in the firm's Wednesday announcement is the ability for nationally chartered banks, like SoFi Bank, N.A., to custody crypto and execute services on their behalf. 

In May, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an interpretive letter permitting national banks to do so, signaling a broader alignment with easing regulations against crypto policies and companies that President Trump's administration has ushered in.

In addition to re-enabling crypto trading and custody, the firm says it has “many planned crypto and blockchain innovations” it intends to roll out through its “one-stop shop” of financial services. 

Shares of SoFi Technologies (SOFI) are up about 0.7% today to $15.96, with the price up about 13% so far this year.

SoFi did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

A trader who continues to build a following with timely calls on Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins is issuing a warning on the broader crypto market.

Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen tells his 1 million followers on the social media platform X that he sees Bitcoin breaking support at $100,000.

“Will likely see BTC back at its bull market support band soon, back in the mid-$90,000 range.”

The bull market support band is formed by the 20-week simple moving average (SMA) and the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA).

The analyst says his prediction is based on Bitcoin's price action in the last two years, when Bitcoin started to roll over and gave up gains in the third quarter.

“I've mentioned for a while on Youtube that Bitcoin would likely start exhibiting some weakness around mid-June as the Q3 weakness starts to present itself.

The same thing happened the last couple of years.

I think the next low is around August/September.” 

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,092.

Looking at the altcoin market, Cowen warns that his expected Bitcoin correction will trigger a brutal capitulation event for alts.

“It may be finally time to rip the band-aid off for ALT / BTC pairs.

To the range lows!” 

A bearish altcoin versus Bitcoin chart indicates that alts are losing value faster than BTC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Buy as Company Plans $9.4B BNB Treasury","https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-nano-labs-plans-bnb-treasury/","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 13:13:02 GMT","

Nano Labs, a Chinese blockchain infrastructure provider, has announced its plan to buy $1B worth of $BNB, which is the native token of Binance.

The company plans to ultimately hold around 5%-10% of $BNB's total supply, around $4.7B-$9.4B. The first phase of the acquisition will involve a $500M purchase funded by the sale of convertible promissory notes.

Binance, by the way, is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, with daily volumes exceeding $14B. As a result, $BNB is also the fifth-largest crypto in the world, with a mind-blowing market cap of $90B.

It's worth noting that the Nano Labs stock skyrocketed by this news, rising from $10.89 to $29.18 (a 167% rise) in a matter of a few minutes.

Read on to know more about this gigantic $BNB investment and why it's a good sign that the industry is seriously bullish on altcoins other than Bitcoin.

We'll also point you towards the best altcoins you can buy to benefit from the upcoming altcoin season.

Institutions lately have been stockpiling Bitcoin in what can be called a buy-and-HODL strategy, aiming to capitalize on the favorable regulatory changes (Donald Trump announcing a US Bitcoin reserve, for example) surrounding the digital gold.

It all started when Michael Saylor's Strategy started buying $BTC left, right, and center. The company alone now holds around 592,345 $BTC. Experts, though, have been worried about over-investment in Bitcoin.



A prolonged selling pressure could compel these institutions to liquidate their holdings and pay off the expensive loans they've raised for these investments. The absence of diversification was quite concerning, to say the least. Enter Nano Labs.

Even though the company hasn't revealed why it picked $BNB over the likes of $SOL or $ETH, or if it has struck any deal with Binance, the good news is that this purchase signals a potential shift in institutional behavior.

As large companies begin looking at assets other than Bitcoin, it could lead to fresh liquidity and investor interest being unlocked in tokens previously overlooked by investors in favor of Bitcoin.

With that in mind, let's look at three top cryptos that have the potential to lead the next altcoin frenzy.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) is one of the best cryptos you can consider buying if you want to benefit from the broader market's increasing interest in high-potential altcoins.

Predicted to explode 1,900% and reach $1.92 by 2026, $SNORT powers the Snorter Bot, a Telegram-native trading bot designed to help retail traders identify and manage the best meme coins on Solana, with plans to support Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and Base, too.



Snorter will help you snipe liquidity in new meme coins. Just connect your wallet to Snorter Bot and watch it seamlessly place and execute limit orders and stop-losses with simple commands like /snipe and /portfolio.

Security is another big selling point. Snorter Bot will protect you from rug pulls, sandwich attacks, honeypots, and automated sniping scams, offering you a legitimate playing field against whales and other institutional crypto players.

In addition to a chunky gain on your investment, buying $SNORT will also reduce your trading fee from 1.5% to just 0.85%.

Visit the official $SNORT website and buy one token for just $0.0963 – here's how to buy it. Note that the project has raised over $1.25M so far.

While the rise of tokens other than Bitcoin is fantastic for the broader crypto market's health, $HYPER is a new Bitcoin-themed altcoin proving why, if crypto projects can provide real utility around the greatest blockchain ever, they could be the next crypto to explode.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to resolve Bitcoin's slow transaction speeds, high costs, and lack of programmability.



It will build a Layer-2 on Bitcoin that will work together with a Canonical Bridge and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration to allow users to convert their native $BTC from L1 to a wrapped version $BTC on L2.

This wrapped $BTC will allow you to access decentralized applications, interact with smart contracts, and execute high-speed, low-cost transactions, essentially transforming Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a programmable platform.

Bitcoin Hyper is currently in presale, where it has amassed $1.6M at the time of writing. Each token is currently selling for just $0.012025, which could soar 12,300% and reach $1.50 by 2030.

Here's how to buy Bitcoin Hyper.

With institutions finally realizing the true potential of the BNB Chain, it's worth looking at an altcoin explicitly designed to educate people about the BNB ecosystem. Enter Tutorial ($TUT).

It's a one-of-a-kind crypto in that it's a comprehensive knowledge base of guides and tutorials aimed at people who are new to crypto and keen to learn more about BNB, including, say, setting up a crypto wallet, trading on decentralized exchanges, writing smart contracts, etc.



$TUT is raging fire right now. As one of the top trending cryptos, it's up more than 70% over the past seven days. This includes a hefty 12% gain in just the last 24 hours.

The market's best education-based crypto is currently trading at $0.05896, with expectations suggesting that it could continue to create new all-time highs, especially as the altcoin market looks to finish the month strong.

As institutions move past their obsession with Bitcoin and discover the potential of other fundamentally strong and community-backed cryptos, trending altcoins like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are in a pole position to skyrocket.

Don't forget that the crypto market is highly unpredictable in your quest to double, triple, or quadruple your portfolio. Do your own research before investing, as none of the above is financial advice.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Metaplanet Raises $515M, Blockchain Group Adds $4.8M in Bitcoin Treasury Equity Moves","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/25/metaplanet-raises-515m-blockchain-group-adds-48m-in-bitcoin-treasury-equity-moves","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 07:49:13 GMT","

Metaplanet Inc (3350) and the Blockchain Group (ALTBG) both executed substantial equity capital raises as part of their initiatives to focus on bitcoin accumulation for treasury purposes.

Metaplanet announced the exercise of its 20th series of stock acquisition rights under the recently announced 555 Million Plan, raising 74.9 billion yen, ($515 million) in a single day. It issued 54 million new shares on Wednesday following the exercise of 540,000 stock acquisition rights, representing 29% of the total rights issued. 

The issue is the first major capital injection under the plan and represents 10% of the full target. Metaplanet stock slumped as much as 15% before rallying strongly to close up 4%. CEO Simon Gerovich emphasized the strategic milestone with a post on X, highlighting the strong start to the program.

The Blockchain Group (ALTBG), for its part, announced a 4.1 million-euro ($4.8 million) capital increase through an at-the-market-type equity issuance agreement with TOBAM. 

Shares in the Euronext Growth Paris-listed company were issued at an average price of  5.085 euros each. The capital raise aligns with the company's strategy to increase the number of bitcoin per share on a fully diluted basis. The Blockchain Group currently holds 1,653 BTC and is the first of its kind in Europe pursuing such a model. 

Blockchain Group shares were recently 3.7% lower at 4.785 euros.

In a Web3 landscape saturated with EVM blockchains cloned from each other, Alephium stands out with a bold approach. This Swiss Layer 1 combines the security of Proof-of-Work, the scalability of sharding, a smooth user experience, and an innovative energy model. With Danube, its latest update, the project reaches a major milestone. To understand the stakes, we met Maud Bannwart, a central figure of the team and a true bridge between technology and usage.

Maud Bannwart joined Alephium even before the project became public. “I was the first non-developer to join the team“, she confides. Today, she coordinates legal aspects, oversees partnerships, participates in conferences, and ensures that the needs of users as well as developers are well taken into account.

Her cross-functional profile brings a global vision, valuable in a technical universe where solutions multiply without always meeting concrete expectations in the field. She acts as the spokesperson for a project that does not seek to revolutionize everything but to correct the structural flaws of existing solutions.

The Danube update is the most ambitious evolution of Alephium to date. It aims to make the protocol faster, easier to use, and better suited for developing complex applications.

Among the key new features:

“ We want users to no longer see the complexity of sharding“, summarizes Maud. With Danube, Alephium gains maturity while staying true to its technical and minimalist DNA.

One of the most common critiques of Proof-of-Work concerns its energy consumption. Alephium responds with an innovative approach: Proof-of-Less-Work.

The concept is simple: replace part of the energy expenditure with a burn mechanism while maintaining consensus integrity. This hybrid model reduces environmental impact without weakening network security.

If Bitcoin used our model, it would consume 87% less energy.

This mechanism also introduces an interesting economic dimension. By reducing the available supply through the burn, it creates deflationary pressure on the ALPH coin, which strengthens the model's sustainability while protecting miners' incentives.

Faced with the growing complexity of the EVM environment, Alephium offers an alternative that is clearer, more robust, and more economical for developers.

The platform is based on a Turing-complete virtual machine in a UTXO environment, an architecture rarely exploited in this way. The result: reinforced native security and a significant reduction in the risk of exploits related to smart contracts.

“ Today, an EVM project's audit budget often exceeds that for development“, reminds Maud. Alephium tackles this absurdity by offering a more reliable, predictable framework while remaining flexible enough to host complex DApps. Direct contact with the development team also allows influencing the protocol from within, a luxury few blockchains offer today.

Alephium does not only seek to attract developers. The project places user experience at the heart of its strategy, integrating tools inspired by Web2 standards.

Native support for Passkeys allows the creation of wallets without seed phrases, compatible with biometric devices like Face ID or physical keys like Yubikey. “We will be able to offer wallets as simple to use as those in Web2“, says Maud.

This advancement makes onboarding into Web3 much smoother, while enhancing the security of personal wallets. Alephium thus anticipates broader adoption, beyond the circle of insiders.

After Danube, Alephium does not intend to slow down. Several major projects are already underway.

The ambition is clear: to become the reference for smart contracts on Proof-of-Work, in a landscape that too often neglects this technology in favor of all-EVM.

Alephium does not promise a brutal revolution. It builds, layer by layer, a serious alternative to traditional blockchains. Its architecture relies on deliberate choices: Proof-of-Work for security, native sharding for scalability, and a UX designed for everyone, from the seasoned developer to the curious user.

Thanks to innovations like those brought by the Danube upgrade, accessible tools, an eco-responsible approach with Proof-of-Less-Work, and sincere attention to the community, Alephium redefines what a modern L1 blockchain can be. Far from the noise of marketing promises, the project advances with coherence and commitment. “Proof-of-Work can be scalable, performant, and user-friendly“, summarizes Maud Bannwart.

In an ecosystem often torn between hype and standardization, Alephium carves a unique path, more technical, sober, and resolutely forward-looking. Its strength rests as much on the solidity of its technology as on the humility of its approach. For all those looking for a blockchain that is useful, responsible, and built to last, Alephium deserves now more than ever their full attention.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","3 Developer Tools For AI And Blockchain","https://www.benzinga.com/crypto/cryptocurrency/25/06/46098689/3-developer-tools-for-ai-and-blockchain","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 15:57:10 GMT","

AI is one of the leading narratives in Blockchain in 2025 and the growth is only accelerating, with the AI and blockchain market size predicted to have a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 25.3%, growing from $228 million in 2020 to $703 million by 2025.

But in order to make a novel use case out of the confluence of AI and blockchain, a project needs to leverage the benefits of blockchain – enhanced data management and scalability of AI and improved data quality, security and transactions of blockchain.

The new cohort of blockchain projects jumping into the fray are making their marks on the blockchain AI space by offering new resources for developers with three new projects launching tools that are free-to-use for devs:

Pi Squared has introduced free access to their VSL Devnet, a decentralized platform for verifiable AI execution, cross-chain interoperability, and trusted execution.

""With Web3 still siloed across chains and ecosystems, the Pi Squared VSL Devnet, provides a first glimpse at a verifiability-first platform that can unify chains, languages and applications through fast, secure, and programmable infrastructure,"" Grigore Roșu, Founder and CEO of Pi Squared said.

Nexus is offering developers free access to their final testnet for a Layer 1 blockchain designed to support AI systems by enabling computation and scalability in a uniquely extensible way.

""We need to fundamentally rethink blockchain infrastructure in the age of AI. As AI models become more intelligent, they're consuming compute and issuing transactions at exponential rates"" Daniel Marin, CEO and Founder of Nexus said.

Nexus allows people to contribute compute power from any device to help scale the network and experiment with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) to build trusted AI applications.

DIA, an open-source blockchain platform with verifiable, trustless oracles for DeFi, RWAs, and web3 applications, launched its mainnet and unveiled the multichain Oracle Grants Program, which provides projects on over 15 participating blockchains withf free access to oracle infrastructure for up to 12 months. Chains offered at launch include Alephium, Ankr, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, BNB Chain, BOB, GEB, Gelato, Goat Network, Kadena, Linea, LUKSO, Midnight, Plume, Polygon, Stacks, Somnia, Sonic, and Superseed.

AI Oracles act as bridges between the models and the outside world, delivering real-time data (RTD) to apps on blockchain. DIA uses AI to parse and verify data and delivers timely data to AI apps where it is needed.

""Autonomous agents require reliable, real-time data. DIA offers on-chain, machine-readable data for financial markets – such as crypto, FX, and commodities – as well as DePIN metrics like bandwidth or storage. Because DIA feeds are verifiable and on-chain, AI agents don't rely on off-chain APIs or opaque middleware. This unlocks truly autonomous logic and cross-chain operability powered by transparent data,"" Dillon Hanson, Head of Business Development for DIA said.

DIA's architecture is built for verifiability – every data point is sourced directly from the origin, timestamped, and posted on-chain by DIA's distributed Feeder network with no third-party aggregators or hidden layers.

""DIA's mission is to eliminate the last black box in Web3: the data layer. Without trusted data, blockchains can't deliver on their promise. From RWAs to autonomous systems, every use case hinges on reliable, transparent inputs,"" Hanson said.

Tools for blockchain devs to use in integrating AI are vital, because they open up new possibilities for creating verifiable, scalable, and transparent AI solutions. 

The potential to build better AI with more transparency and accountability through blockchain could very well be the winner. Blockchain's ability to keep immutable records is perfectly suited to the upcoming rise of AI agents that will need reliable accountability. The need for trust and verifiable systems has never been greater.

As new tools emerge and developers innovate, we may witness the formation of the next generation of intelligent, accountable, and decentralized systems.

SoFi Technologies is relaunching spot cryptocurrency trading on its platform, with users able to buy, sell, and hold crypto as well as undertake global remittances.

The online banking and financial services company's move to relaunch crypto trading will see its customers access buying and selling for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and other digital currencies, Bloomberg reported.

SoFi also plans to roll out global remittances, with expansion into stablecoins on the table. The company's reintroduction comes a few months after its chief executive officer, Anthony Noto, said SoFi was looking into getting back into offering digital asset investing services.

The fintech's return to the crypto space comes amid a regulatory shift that has buoyed various players in the traditional finance industry. 

SoFi had said in August 2023 that it would be forced to exit the crypto investing market due to significant regulatory hurdles in the United States. It did just that when it notified customers of its move in November 2023, with customers advised to liquidate accounts or move crypto assets to crypto exchange and custodial services firm Blockchain.com.

However, in April 2025, SoFi CEO Anthony Noto confirmed that the company was looking to re-enter the crypto market. Noto also noted that SoFi aimed to integrate blockchain technology across its business. The improving regulatory landscape stood out as a key catalyst, he added. 

“We want to be able to offer blockchain products and crypto products across every area that we're currently in, so across lending, across paying, across investing, as well as protecting,” Noto said at the time.

In comments following the latest development, the SoFi exec noted that innovation in crypto and blockchain is is reinventing the future of financial services. The fintech's goal is to help accelerate this, with its customers benefiting from more choices and control across investing, cross-border payments, or savings.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that banks are “free” to offer crypto services. The Fed Chair, in testimony given to the Senate Banking Committee, also noted that banks are free to conduct crypto activities.

Meanwhile, regulators are also increasingly supportive of stablecoin adoption, with the industry largely optimistic after the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act. President Donald Trump has asked lawmakers to get the bill to his desk as soon as possible.

Adequate data protection measures are paramount. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images

25 Jun 2025, 9:55 am  

Recent enforcement action by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) serves as a stark warning to companies handling sensitive data, with firms urged to ensure appropriate data protection measures are in place, an expert has said. 

The ICO fined genetic testing company 23andMe £2.31 million (153 pages/3.2 MB) for failing to adequately protect the sensitive personal data of over 155,000 UK users. The penalty follows a joint investigation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioners of Canada amid growing international concern over the security of genetic biometric data. 

David McIlwaine, cyber security expert at Pinsent Masons, said: “The monetary penalty notice and fine levied by the ICO illustrates that 23andMe's IT security posture was insufficient at the time of attack. The investigation and subsequent fine should remind companies handling sensitive persona data, particularly in the health and biotech sectors, that failure to implement adequate cybersecurity measures will not be tolerated.”

The fine stems from a large-scale cyberattack that occurred between April and September 2023. Hackers exploited reused login credentials – previously stolen in unrelated data breaches – to gain unauthorised access to 23andMe accounts through a method known as credential stuffing. Once inside, attackers were able to access a trove of sensitive information, including names, birth years, locations, profile images, racial and ethnic backgrounds, family trees, and even health reports. 

Credential stuffing attacks are common, and involve attackers re-using passwords gleaned from other attacks, exploiting the common habit of individuals reusing the same login details across different accounts, including work accounts. The situation is often managed by requiring workers to have specific, strong passwords which are changed periodically, having in place multi-factor authentication – which requires a second verification source – and ensuring that usernames are not obvious. 

McIlwaine said: “23andMe failed to have these basic procedures in place, despite the special category of data that it was processing. This oversight left users' most intimate and immutable data exposed to exploitation.”

Consequently, the ICO found that the company was in breach of UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which requires data controllers to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The ICO criticised the company's slow response and inadequate security systems, stating that “the warning signs were there”, but 23andMe failed to act, leaving users more vulnerable to exploitation and harm. Further, the ICO emphasised that the nature of the compromised data – genetic and familial information – made the breach particularly serious, as such data is not only deeply personal but also permanent.

McIlwaine said: “It is noteworthy that the fine has been levied against 23andMe, Inc, a US corporation. The company settled a $30m class action last year related to the incident and reported a deficit of $2.4 billion, stating that there was substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern, certain affiliates have filed for bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the ICO levied the fine of £2.31m after concluding that a monetary penalty remained appropriate in order to provide an effective, proportionate and dissuasive response to the infringements.”

“The ICO states that it did take into account the company's current and significantly deteriorated financial position. We therefore conclude that the fine should have been significantly higher. We wait to see what enforcement action the ICO may take in relation to the fine,” he said.

Allegedly designed to regulate stablecoins, the bill quietly allows for a de facto retail CBDC system — one implemented not by the Federal Reserve, but by the commercial banks it closely supervises. 

•

In the increasingly complex debate surrounding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), stablecoins, and the regulatory perimeter of the dollar system, few recent proposals are as quietly consequential as the GENIUS Act — formally, the “Guaranteed Electronic Notes Issuance Under Supervision” Act — which proposes to grant federally chartered banks exclusive authority to issue stablecoins fully backed by dollar reserves. Having passed the Senate in May 2025 with bipartisan support (66-32, with 16 Democrats joining the Republican majority), the bill now awaits House approval before proceeding to President Trump for signature. While the legislation was marketed primarily as a prudential framework for ensuring the safety of privately issued stablecoins, it may, inadvertently or by subtle design, create an opening for the emergence of a de facto retail CBDC system — one implemented not by the Federal Reserve, but by the commercial banks it closely supervises.

At its core, the GENIUS Act seeks to clarify and centralize stablecoin issuance. Under the bill, nonbank entities would be prohibited from issuing dollar-referenced stablecoins directly to retail consumers unless operating through a bank charter subject to full federal oversight, deposit insurance requirements, and strict capital standards. The political motivation behind the bill is straightforward: to ensure that any digital representation of the dollar circulating among consumers remains firmly embedded within the banking system as currently regulated, thereby reducing risks to consumers and avoiding the systemic fragilities that might arise from shadow banking-like arrangements in crypto markets.

But beneath the surface, the legislation may have broader implications for the future shape of US digital money. To understand why, one must first consider the current constitutional and statutory limitations on the Federal Reserve's authority to issue retail digital currency. The Federal Reserve Act provides no explicit authorization for the Fed to offer digital accounts or liabilities directly to the general public. While the Fed has explored the development of wholesale CBDC frameworks for interbank settlement, any effort to launch a true retail CBDC would likely require new congressional legislation, and would almost certainly spark extensive legal and constitutional challenges concerning both privacy rights and the separation of monetary and fiscal powers.

Indeed, several bills introduced in Congress reflect these constraints. The “CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act,” advanced by House Republicans, explicitly seeks to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any form of retail CBDC without clear congressional authorization. Similar legislative efforts—including the “Digital Dollar Prevention Act” and “No CBDC Act” — seek to preserve private sector primacy in consumer financial services while preventing the federal government from directly administering retail monetary accounts.

This political stalemate has, until recently, been viewed as a near-insurmountable obstacle to any full-scale CBDC deployment in the United States. But the GENIUS Act's progress through the Senate demonstrates how an alternative path may be emerging: one in which retail digital dollar instruments functionally equivalent to a CBDC are issued, operated, and distributed by private banks — but with full federal supervision, dollar backing, and interoperability standards imposed by regulators. In effect, the GENIUS framework would delegate the issuance of digital liabilities functionally indistinguishable from a CBDC to the regulated banking sector, thus achieving many of the operational objectives of a retail CBDC without requiring the Fed to directly issue or manage public accounts.

From a technical perspective, stablecoins issued under the GENIUS Act would carry several of the defining features of a retail CBDC: instant settlement, programmability, tokenized dollar representation, and 1:1 parity with base money. The instruments could be integrated into payment systems, mobile wallets, and point-of-sale networks with minimal friction, essentially providing consumers with a CBDC-like experience, but mediated through their existing banking relationships rather than a central, government-proximate authority.

Importantly, by anchoring these stablecoins within the banking system, the GENIUS Act preserves much of the institutional architecture that policymakers fear would be disrupted by a Fed-issued retail CBDC. Banks would continue to intermediate credit, manage payment flows, and hold customer deposits, while stablecoin liabilities would exist as on-balance-sheet instruments subject to conventional reserve and liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve, in turn, would retain indirect control through its supervision of bank liquidity, capital adequacy, and systemic risk management.

From one perspective, it's an elegant compromise: one that threads the political needle between those concerned about government surveillance and privacy, but satiates those seeking to modernize the dollar's architecture for a digital payments era. The Senate's bipartisan approval suggests this compromise has found resonance across party lines. 

By empowering large banks to become exclusive issuers of digital dollars, the GENIUS framework may concentrate enormous market power in a small number of federally chartered institutions, reducing competition and raising barriers to entry for smaller fintech innovators. Moreover, the structure risks entrenching a bifurcated financial system in which access to cutting-edge digital payment instruments depends on bank relationships, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in financial inclusion. Additionally, in contrast to public CBDC proposals which often aim to provide universal access to safe, central bank liabilities, the GENIUS approach would likely preserve — and perhaps amplify — the commercial bank's role as gatekeeper to digital dollar usage.

A further complication involves potential cross-border ramifications. If stablecoins issued by US banks under the GENIUS Act achieve global usage, they may functionally export dollar-based CBDCs abroad, amplifying dollarization in emerging markets without direct Federal Reserve oversight or policy coordination. Such outcomes could trigger complex geopolitical and regulatory responses, particularly in regions where dollar liabilities already pose risks to domestic financial stability.

But most overlooked, indeed unmentioned previously, is that while the GENIUS Act would technically preserve the Federal Reserve's prohibition on retail issuance, it may in practical terms precipitate the dissipation of the distinction between public and private monetary instruments. A fully interoperable network of bank-issued, federally overseen stablecoins may ultimately serve as a political backdoor for those seeking to advance a retail CBDC agenda by other means.

In conclusion, while the GENIUS Act was not formally designed to enable a US retail CBDC, its provisions may, intentionally or otherwise, pave the way for the private sector to fulfill many of the same functions. The bill's successful passage through the Senate, despite ongoing debates about digital currency policy, suggests that this indirect approach to CBDC-like functionality may prove more politically viable than direct Federal Reserve issuance. In doing so, it illustrates the increasingly blurred lines between regulatory prudence, technological innovation, and monetary policy delegation. Whether this architecture proves to be a sustainable solution or a precarious halfway house remains to be seen, but with House consideration now pending, these questions may soon move from theoretical to practical. Policymakers and market participants alike would be wise to recognize that the battle over CBDC design may not be limited to public versus private issuance — but rather, how much “public” power can quietly migrate into regulated private hands.

 A newly unsealed complaint reveals DCG executives anticipated legal fallout and ignored risk warnings as Genesis spiraled toward collapse. 

A newly unsealed complaint from bankrupt crypto lender Genesis reveals internal communications at its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), suggested executives were aware of financial mismanagement and looming legal risks tied to their control over Genesis.

According to the Delaware Court of Chancery filing, DCG's chief financial officer, Michael Kraines, acknowledged the risk that Genesis could be deemed DCG's “alter ego.”

In a confidential memo shared with former Genesis CEO Michael Moro and others, Kraines laid out a “war-gaming exercise” preparing for legal arguments a future plaintiff might raise if Genesis collapsed. The memo, attached to the complaint, mirrors claims now central to the lawsuit.

“The question on my mind simply put is ‘if Genesis were to somehow blow itself up could that somehow tank DCG to the profound detriment of its board and shareholders?' My prefatory thinking here is as follows,” Kraines wrote to Moro, indicating they were preparing for an imminent legal fallout.

The filing further reveals that DCG hired third-party risk consultants who issued warnings that were either ignored or acted upon too late. Internal documents show DCG admitted Genesis was “flying blind” as its loan book ballooned from $4 billion to $12 billion.

External auditors had already flagged “significant deficiencies and material weaknesses” in Genesis's financial controls as early as 2020.

A so-called “contagion” risk committee was formed within Genesis to mitigate exposure. However, its first meeting did not occur until nine months after approval by the DCG board. Kraines reportedly joked that the delay “just made my future deposition a bit easier.”

The complaint also describes a toxic workplace culture where Genesis employees were expected to serve DCG's interests at the expense of proper governance.

One insider wrote that DCG kept Genesis alive “so [it] could pillage the balance sheet… prop [Genesis] up, give [the] impression of stability[,] then borrow while they c[ould] to get the cash out of it.” Genesis staff internally referred to the firm's environment as a “culture of submission.”

“These are not merely technical disputes over intercompany accounting,” said the Genesis Litigation Oversight Committee. “The Delaware Complaint exposes a deliberate scheme by DCG and Barry Silbert to pillage Genesis as it collapsed.”

Cointelegraph reached out to DCG for comment but had not received a response by publication.

The filing also alleges public deception. It claims Genesis staff were told to recite scripted messages after the Three Arrows Capital (3AC) collapse, while DCG executives, including Barry Silbert, retweeted posts that downplayed the crisis.

Furthermore, the complaint sheds light on two controversial transactions. These include the June 30, 2022, promissory note and the September 2022 “roundtrip” deal, both framed as attempts to conceal insolvency and mislead creditors.

Genesis is seeking to recover more than $3.3 billion from DCG, Silbert and other insiders.

              Highlights            



                        The Federal Reserve's removal of “reputational risk” from formal bank exams could potentially clear the way for banks to engage more openly with cryptocurrency and other previously controversial industries.                      


                        Legislation is advancing in Congress to regulate stablecoins and digital assets, aiming to clarify the roles of the SEC and CFTC, which could establish a formalized, compliant path for Wall Street institutions to enter the crypto space.                      


                        As zillennials — a microgeneration comprising older members of Generation Z and younger millennials — gravitate toward digital-first banking and FinTechs gain ground, traditional banks face questions around crypto integration and offerings.

When the Federal Reserve Board announced in a Monday (June 23) press release that it would no longer include “reputational risk” in its formal bank examinations and supervision programs, most consumers in the United States likely barely noticed.

However, in the corridors of compliance offices, FinTech startups, financial institutions and cryptocurrency-native firms, the reverberations were immediate.

On Capitol Hill, momentum is accelerating behind two legislative efforts: the GENIUS Act to bring stablecoins under federal oversight, which has passed the Senate and moved onto the House; and another which was unveiled by lawmakers Tuesday (June 24) and intends to create a framework for the development of legislation for digital assets.

The market structure bill seeks to clarify the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regarding regulating digital assets, delineate which tokens qualify as securities or commodities, and create a unified registration regime for crypto exchanges. Its framework could open the floodgates for Wall Street to enter crypto in a structured and compliant manner. That includes not just banks, but asset managers, broker-dealers and pension funds.

Together, these developments may mark a tipping point. Crypto, long considered an exotic and high-risk asset class by traditional financial institutions, is inching toward legitimacy. The question now looming large: Are banks ready?

Reputational risk has traditionally served as a catch-all justification for regulators to scrutinize, or even penalize, banks that dealt with industries deemed controversial. Historically, that has included everything from cannabis businesses to payday lenders to crypto firms. By removing this factor, the Fed signaled a shift from values-based supervision to risk-based supervision grounded in financial stability and consumer protection.

“This change does not alter the board's expectation that banks maintain strong risk management to ensure safety and soundness and compliance with law and regulation nor is it intended to impact whether and how board-supervised banks use the concept of reputational risk in their own risk management practices,” the Fed said in the press release.

“There's certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, told PYMNTS in April. “This is not a confrontational posture.”

But it's not just about removing a hurdle. The Fed's move coincides with a surge in interest among banks and credit unions to offer more digital-first financial products.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “How Zillennials Are Driving Innovation in Financial Services” found that 16% of zillennials — a microgeneration comprising older members of Generation Z and younger millennials — have their primary bank account with a digital-only bank. Only 11% of zillennials bank with a regional bank, less than the 22% who bank with a local bank or credit union.

Against this backdrop, the next wave of financial technology might just include crypto.

Today's end-users want faster payments, borderless money transfers and access to digital assets. Banks can either innovate or be disintermediated.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report “Credit Union Innovation Readiness Index: The Smallest Credit Unions Step It Up” found that when it comes to innovation, smaller lenders aren't standing still.

Still, the transition is not without peril. Crypto markets remain volatile, cyber threats are evolving and the regulatory landscape is still under construction. For banks, entering the space without a clear strategy could prove costly. Crypto in 2025, ultimately, isn't about hype; it's about infrastructure, compliance and risk management.

Banks will also need to reassess their internal capabilities. From hiring blockchain-savvy compliance officers to building secure custody solutions and forging partnerships with crypto-native firms, the cost of entry is high.

The flip side of the equation is the competitive landscape. Crypto-native firms and nimble FinTechs are already seizing market share. Companies like Coinbase, Circle, Fireblocks and Anchorage Digital have built robust infrastructure, compliant pathways and brand loyalty among digital-first users.

In this context, banks that hesitate risk being relegated to providing infrastructure but ceding customer relationships. The alternative is to lean into innovation, embrace partnerships and compete in trust, usability and security.

Last week the US Senate passed the Genius Act legislation which would bring stablecoins into the mainstream of the US financial system. This week the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) warned that stablecoins perform badly on the main tests for any form of money.

Stablecoins are a form of digital currency backed by a fiat currency, like the US dollar, or other safe assets that always match the value of the stablecoin. To date, they've been used almost exclusively within the speculative crypto world. The bill would enable them to become a medium for exchange within the traditional finance world.

They are touted as being a more efficient, lower cost and more timely form of payment than traditional bank-centred payment systems, with settlement of transactions clearing almost instantly. Until now, they have been largely, or at least very lightly, unregulated.

The US is about to change that by regulating them, but also by conferring the credibility of Congress, the White House and US law on their issuance and use.

Given that the crypto sector donated at least $US250 million ($385 million) to the election campaign of Donald Trump and other crypto supporters in Congress, it wasn't surprising that Trump has authorised the creation of a national digital currency reserve and declared that he wants to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Providing a legal framework for stablecoins would make them the centrepiece for bringing crypto into the mainstream of finance.

The Trump family, of course, now has a significant exposure to cryptocurrencies, with at least half a dozen crypto-related businesses, including the USD1 stablecoin issued by their World Liberty Financial group. The token has a market capitalisation of $US2.2 billion.

Under the bill that passed through the Senate, issuers of stablecoins would be required to hold at least one dollar of high-quality and liquid reserves – US Treasury bills, bank deposits, government money market funds and the like – for each $US1 of stablecoins. Issuers would have to post monthly statements of their assets and larger issuers would be audited annually.

There would new “know your customer” requirements,” although how well that would work and be regulated in the crypto world of anonymous transactions is an open question.

There are already about $US250 billion of stablecoins on issue but, assuming the House endorses the bill (it has previously passed a slightly different version, named the STABLE Act) the legislation is likely to encourage a flood of new issuers.

Amazon and Walmart and other retailers, large and small, are said to be preparing to issue their own tokens, along with other participants in payment chains. The major US banks have talked about creating one, the big tech companies would inevitably become involved and, as with the Trumps, there'd be a host of entrepreneurial types entering the sector.

A report by Citigroup earlier this year said there could be $US3.7 trillion of stablecoins on issue by 2030, while a US Treasury analysis estimated there'd be $US2 trillion on issue by 2028.

The potential benefits of wide use of stablecoins are obvious. They'd cut out the middlemen of finance – the crypto universe is a peer-to-peer one – making merchant fees, interchange fees and wire transfer fees increasingly redundant, along with the waiting for funds to be cleared.

That explains retailers' interest in them, and the threat they pose to the major credit and debit card operators.

US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is also enthusiastic about what they might mean for the US dollar and US Treasury market.

The dollar and US Treasury securities are already the most common assets used to back stablecoins and could be expected to be the assets of choice for tokens issued within the framework established by the Genius Act.

That would provide a massive new source of demand for the dollar and Treasury securities, buttressing the dollar's global dominance and lowering the US government's cost of funds, or at least that's Bessent's theory.

In practice, most of the funds to provide the dollar-for-dollar backing for the stablecoins would probably come from traditional finance sources – banks and money market funds being the most obvious. The flows of US dollar assets would be redirected, rather than new sources tapped.

That's an important point, because it means deposits could be withdrawn from highly-regulated and, for deposits of less than $US250,000 in the US, insured environments into one that is far less onerously regulated and where the funds would not be insured.

Unlike bank deposits, where the Federal Reserve Board backstops the system, there would be no lender of last resort (one of the BIS criticisms), fewer protections against the use of the tokens for illicit activities (another) and they don't have the capacity that banks have to create money (yet another weakness identified by the BIS).

Unlike a US dollar, which is trusted and accepted almost universally, there is no guarantee that a $US1 dollar stablecoin will actually be worth a dollar, or be accepted by everyone as a medium of exchange.

If the forecasts of the extent to which the stablecoin issuance could grow are correct, they could have an impact on the stability of the US and potentially other banking systems.

They would convert largely retail deposits, which are generally stable and are covered by federal insurance, into more volatile and uninsured wholesale deposits. The regional banking crisis in the US in 2023 was triggered by a run on Silicon Valley Bank's wholesale deposits.

Under the Genius Act, stablecoin issuers would be required to hold $US1 of easily cashable assets for each $US1 of stablecoins.

It's relatively easy for the issuers to acquire US Treasury bills, or repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities or cash to match new deposits.

If there were, however, a sudden flood of redemption requests and a need to cash out the underlying assets urgently – if the issuer had to dump assets to raise cash in the face of what, in a bank, would be a “run” – there would be a likelihood of losses on the face value of the Treasury bills and other assets in a forced sale.

Some existing stablecoins have traded well below par. With no guarantor or lender of last resort, any liquidity event in a stablecoin would spark a frenetic scramble for the exit by investors, exacerbating the losses and raising the spectre of contagion for the rest of the sector.

While the Genius Act makes it explicit that the stablecoins wouldn't be guaranteed by the government or have access to the Fed's facilities, if there were a sector-wide implosion and trillions of dollars of Treasury securities and bank deposits were being dumped into the markets, the pressure for the White House to intervene would be extreme.

It would be even more extreme if the president at that moment had a multi-billion exposure to the stablecoin market. The act prohibits members of Congress or the US executive branch from owning or issuing stablecoins, but an attempt by the Democrats to include the president and vice president in that prohibition failed.

US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is also enthusiastic about what stablecoins might mean for the US dollar and US Treasury market.Credit: AP

The other major criticism of the act is that it could create a “back to the future” moment, a return to a 19th century America where almost anyone could open a bank and issue their own currency as long as they had a dollar of collateral for each dollar they issued.

Unlike a US dollar, which is trusted and accepted almost universally, there is no guarantee that a $US1 dollar stablecoin will actually be worth a dollar, or be accepted by everyone as a medium of exchange.

Fiat currencies are fungible, crypto assets are not. Each stablecoin could be backed by a different mix of assets and therefore their vulnerability to an external event, or ability to respond to a run, will differ between issuers.

Short of real time continuous auditing of every stablecoin issuer, there can't be the same level of trust that there is in the traditional banking and payment systems.

By endorsing and providing credibility for stablecoins, however, the US lawmakers are bringing crypto into the mainstream of the US banking and payments systems, fragmenting them to at least some degree and introducing a potential new source of instability.

Only hindsight will tell whether that is such a good idea.

Aurora Mobile (JG), a Nasdaq-listed marketing technology provider, is the latest publicly traded company to plan a treasury strategy that includes cryptocurrency investments.

The Shenzhen, China-based company's board approved an initiative to convert up to 20% its cash and cash equivalents into BTC and other digital assets. The investments may include bitcoin BTC$107,359.60, ether ETH$2,422.16, Solana's sol SOL$143.85 and sui SUI$2.7525 among other tokens, it said Wednesday.

Aurora aims to ""preserve and enhance asset value while supporting its strategy to expand market coverage,"" it said in a statement.

In its latest quarterly earnings report, Aurora reported cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling 113.6 million yuan ($15.8 million), suggesting it could invest some $3 million in bitcoin and other crypto.

The strategy emulates that of multiple other companies that have revealed plans to acquire bitcoin in recent weeks.

The company's shares jumped in pre-market trading following the announcement, trading nearly 10% higher at $12.10.

Shiba inu SHIB$0.0₄1166 whales went bargain hunting early this week after prices dropped to a 16-month low of $0.00001005.

According to CoinDesk's AI research, whales purchased 10.4 trillion SHIB tokens, worth over $110 million, on Monday, marking the largest daily accumulation in five months.

The whale action has likely contributed to the cryptocurrency's 17% price bounce from the 16-month low reached Sunday. Note that the broader crypto market has stabilized following the initial knee-jerk reaction to the tensions in the Middle East. BTC, which fell below $100K over the weekend, last changed hands near $106,000.

Market data indicate that SHIB is maintaining a generally constructive posture, with higher lows forming a subtle uptrend channel. The token found significant volume support at the $0.00001158 level during the 24 hours from June 24, 09:00 to June 25, 08:00, with trading volume surging to 439 billion, well above the daily average.

This accumulation at support levels suggests the potential for continued upside momentum if the $0.00001175 resistance can be decisively cleared. As of writing, SHIB traded at around $0.00001162 on major exchanges, according to CoinDesk data.

SHIB's recovery has stalled since Tuesday, with prices trading in what appears to be a descending triangle, characterized by a falling trendline and a horizontal support line.

A price move through the descending trendline would signal a continuation of the recovery rally, exposing the June 16 resistance above $0.00001230. Conversely, a breakdown of the triangle would signal a bearish reversal lower.

Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) remains one of the most misunderstood companies in the digital assets space, Wall Street broker Bernstein said in a research report Wednesday.

Bernstein raised its Coinbase price target to $510 from $310, and reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. The shares Wednesday morning were more than 4% higher at around $360 in early trading.

While broader sentiment leans bearish, Coinbase is cementing its role as crypto's ""universal bank,"" and is bridging retail, institutional, and on-chain infrastructure at a scale unmatched by peers, the report said.

""Coinbase will be a beneficiary of the GENIUS Act and soon to follow CLARITY Act,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

Bernstein said the exchange is the only crypto-native firm in the S&P 500 and continues to dominate U.S. trading despite competitive pressure.

Coinbase's stablecoin business, responsible for roughly 15% of total revenue, is scaling rapidly with integrations like Shopify, the report noted.

On the institutional side, Coinbase powers custody for eight of the eleven Bitcoin ETF issuers, the broker noted.

With its recent acquisition of Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange globally, and the explosive growth of its Ethereum Layer 2 network, Base, which is already hosting tokenization pilots like JPMorgan's JPMD coin, Coinbase is quietly assembling the core infrastructure of the next financial system, the report added.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Imagine a ship caught in a fierce storm, battered by large waves and swaying wildly yet staying afloat. It indicates that beneath the turmoil, resilience persists, suggesting that smooth sailing will follow once the storm passes.

Similarly, when an asset's price refuses to decline despite bearish signals from key indicators, it suggests underlying strength and a potential bull run ahead.

That's the current situation in the XRP market and mirrors conditions in the bitcoin market that foreshadowed BTC's historic run higher from $70,000 to $100,000 late last year. Let's have a look at both.

XRP is the payments-focused cryptocurrency used by the Fintech company Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions. The two, however, are not interchangeable.

The underlying strength in XRP is evident from the way prices have been behaving relative to the MACD histogram in recent weeks.

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is an exponential moving average (EMA)--based trend-following indicator widely tracked by both institutions and retail investors to identify price trends and measure trend momentum.

The MACD bars crossing from negative to positive indicate a bullish shift in momentum, suggesting the start of an uptrend in the asset's price. A crossover below zero suggests otherwise, with consecutive deeper bars indicating a strengthening of the downward momentum.

XRP's weekly chart MACD, used by traders to gauge long-term trends, crossed below zero in the first week of March, signaling a renewed downtrend.

However, a pronounced downtrend has not yet materialized, with prices mainly trading back and forth between $2 and $2.60, barring occasional short-lived dips below $2.

The divergence, marked by persistently bearish MACD and largely directionless trading, hints at bullish vibes or resilience beneath the surface – bulls successfully absorbing supply.

This prolonged divergence means the potential for a sudden bull revival and price increases. The bull case is supported by the upward-sloping 50-, 100- and 200-week simple moving averages (SMA).

The above-discussed divergence in XRP is similar to the conditions in BTC last year when the weekly MACD kept flashing red throughout the Summer. At the same time, BTC traded range-bound, barring occasional short-lived dips below $60,000.

CoinDesk noted the divergence in mid-September last year when BTC changed hands at around $59,000. Weeks later, BTC rose to $70,000, eventually topping the same in November to hit record highs above $100,000.

Let's see if XRP follows the same path.

 As tensions escalate around the globe, Byte-Sized Insight explores how crypto behaves in crisis, from Bitcoin's market resilience to blockchain's role in preserving journalism and dispersing aid. 

As geopolitical tensions rise in the Middle East and global markets brace for volatility, Byte-Sized Insight's latest episode explores how crypto reacts under pressure and whether it can provide more than just price movement.

In the first half of the episode, host Savannah Fortis speaks with Cointelegraph's Ray Salmond and Marcel Pechman, who offer expert commentary and break down how Bitcoin (BTC) has performed amid growing fears of US involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict.  

“There's a lot of uncertainty… and we see this reflected in the price action of gold, silver, US Treasurys and Bitcoin,” Salmond explains. 

Pechman warns that while Bitcoin has rallied 25% in recent weeks, it's still perceived as a risk asset and could fall again if panic spreads. Still, both analysts point to long-term investor conviction and global liquidity trends as reasons Bitcoin continues to attract demand.

The episode also highlights how decentralized technologies are being used in the real world, beyond tradeable cryptocurrencies, especially in places where central systems break down. 

Megan Klimen, founding officer of the Filecoin Foundation, discusses the organization's work with Fasila, a group helping local journalists in conflict zones preserve their reporting on decentralized storage.

“This is journalism that often gets destroyed when there are regime changes… There's not always a long-term record,” Klimen says. 

In the episode, we also hear from Vivek Raman, CEO of Etherealize, who explains how Ethereum and stablecoins are becoming essential infrastructure for financial access. 

In times of crisis, crypto's real test isn't only about how fast it moves markets, but about what it enables. Whether preserving truth or providing access, this episode reminds listeners that the utility of decentralized tech may be its most important feature.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Michael Saylor's Strategy has 91% chance of joining S&P 500 in Q2: Analyst","https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-strategy-sp500-inclusion-odds-financial-analyst","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 06:04:04 GMT","

 Financial analyst Jeff Walton says Strategy's odds of S&P 500 eligibility hinge on Bitcoin's ability to remain above $95,240. 

Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR), which trades as Strategy, has a high chance of qualifying for the S&P 500 as long as Bitcoin doesn't drop more than 10% before the end of the second quarter, an analyst says.

“I believe there is about a 91% chance of MSTR qualifying for the S&P 500 in Q2,” financial analyst Jeff Walton said in a video on Tuesday.

Walton explained that for this to happen, Bitcoin (BTC) must not fall below $95,240 before June 30. He explained that if it drops below that, Strategy, which has the largest Bitcoin holdings among public companies at 592,345 Bitcoin, will not have “have the earnings in Q2 be more than the last three quarters combined.” 

Walton explained that to be eligible for S&P 500 inclusion, a company must post positive total earnings across the past four quarters. Strategy has posted net losses in the past three quarters.

The S&P 500 is an index that tracks the stock prices of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the US.

On Jan. 1, Strategy began applying accounting rule ASU 2023-08, which mandates that Bitcoin holdings be revalued at fair market value, with any gains or losses reflected in net income (or loss) each reporting period.

Walton bases his forecast on Bitcoin trading at $106,044 when he published his video and on the historical odds of a 10% Bitcoin drop over six days since Sept. 17, 2014. With the video released on Tuesday, six days remain in Q2, ending next Monday.

“Going back to September 17, 2014, over any 6-day period, the price of Bitcoin has dropped more than 10% 343 times; of those other 6-day periods, it has been 3,585 where it hasn't dropped below 10%,” he explained.

“So 8.7% of those 6-day periods have dropped more than 10%, the other 91% of those periods have not dropped 10%,” he added.

He said that as the end of June approaches, the probability of Bitcoin not dropping 10% increases. Over five days, there's a 92.4% chance it won't fall that much. That probability rises to 93.4% over four days, 94.5% over 3 days, 95.8% over two days, and 97.6% over one day.

However, recent rising geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel caused Bitcoin's price to drop below $100,000 on Sunday for the first time since early May. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $106,200.

If all this comes to fruition, Strategy would be the second crypto firm to join the S&P 500 this year. In May, crypto exchange Coinbase joined the S&P 500, and crypto executives said this marks a significant step toward broader acceptance of the industry.

Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace, told Cointelegraph, “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class.” 

In December 2024, Nasdaq announced that Strategy would be included in the Nasdaq-100 Index, which features the 100 largest stocks by market capitalization on Nasdaq.

 Bank of Korea governor Ryoo Sangdai reportedly said that banks should be the first to issue stablecoins, and they should do so slowly. 

Bank of Korea deputy governor Ryoo Sangdai reportedly wants banks to be the primary issuers of stablecoins in the country before gradually expanding to other sectors.

Yonhap News reported that during a Tuesday press conference, Ryoo said a won-denominated stablecoin should first be introduced at regulated commercial banks to ensure a safety net. 

“It would be desirable to initially allow stablecoin issuance primarily through banks, which are subject to higher levels of financial regulation, and gradually expand it to the non-banking sector,” he said.

However, the central bank still has some concerns about stablecoins. Ryoo said a stablecoin rollout could accelerate capital outflows and “shift the fundamental stance we have maintained on foreign exchange liberalization, and the internationalization of the Korean won.”

“We also need to consider the implications for financial sector restructuring, including the potential introduction of narrow banking,” he added.

Bank of Korea governor Rhee Chang-yong said at a press conference on June 18 that he didn't oppose a won-based stablecoin but was still concerned about managing the foreign exchange of the token.

On June 10, newly elected president Lee Jae-myung's ruling Democratic Party put forward the Digital Asset Basic Act, which would allow companies with a minimum equity capital of $368,000 to issue stablecoins.

Chosun Daily reported that Ryoo said during the same press conference that the central bank would continue to move forward with a central bank digital currency as a “countermeasure to stablecoins.”

On March 24, government agencies, including the BOK, the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service, announced a CBDC test that will conclude on June 30. Another test is reportedly in the works.

“However, since the government's position on stablecoins is not clearly established and there is significant uncertainty regarding related laws and policies, the timing for operating the second pilot test will be determined through consultation with banks,” Ryoo said.

South Korea isn't the only country considering stablecoin options. On June 19, Bloomberg reported that credit card giant Visa partnered with Yellow Card Financial, an African stablecoin payments provider, to accelerate adoption across the continent.

A Russian finance ministry official also floated a plan for the government to develop its own stablecoin in April. A trio of major Abu Dhabi institutions teamed up to create a new dirham-pegged stablecoin in the same month.

See Vaccine Recommendations Backed by Science in These Handy Charts

These graphics will guide you through science-based vaccine guidelines for children and adults

By Jen Christiansen & Meghan Bartels edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Jen Christiansen

Vaccines are a marvel of modern medicine: the carefully tested and regulated technologies teach people's immune systems how to fight off potentially fatal infections, saving both lives and health care costs.

But for as long as vaccines have existed, people have opposed them, and in recent years the antivaccine movement has gained visibility and power. Now the Department of Health and Human Services is led by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.—an environmental lawyer with no medical training and a history of antivaccine activism. And these lifesaving medical interventions are coming under threat.

Access to COVID vaccines this fall is already expected to be limited to people aged 65 years or older and to those with underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to severe disease. And in June Kennedy dismissed all 17 sitting members of a crucial vaccine oversight group, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which, in the past, has made independent, science-based recommendations on vaccine access for people in the U.S. The dismissals came just weeks before the panel's next scheduled meeting; Kennedy appointed eight new members in advance of the meeting, which is still set to begin on June 25.

As a public resource, Scientific American has created graphics outlining the vaccines recommended by ACIP as of its final meeting in 2024.

Vaccine recommendations have always been in flux as new products have been developed and continuing research has suggested better practices: The COVID pandemic required brand-new vaccines for a novel virus, for example. And in the U.S., the stunning success of the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine led to its recommendation for everyone aged 26 or younger, meanwhile the oral polio vaccine was discontinued in favor of the inactivated injected vaccine.

But traditionally, these decisions have been made by scientists based on solid research done within the confines of accepted ethical practices. These principles mean, for example, that a vaccine's side effects are carefully monitored and evaluated against its immune benefit and that potential replacement vaccines are tested against their predecessors, not—as Kennedy has proposed—an inert placebo that would leave people vulnerable to an infection that doctors already have the tools to combat.

Kennedy's decision to replace ACIP wholesale and the comments he has made about deviating from standard vaccine policymaking practice suggest that new recommendations won't be backed by established vaccine science—hence our reproduction of the vaccine recommendations as of the end of 2024.

Note that these are generalized recommendations; people should talk with their health care providers about individual risks and needs, as well as how to proceed after missing a dose. Pregnant people can consult additional resources from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for vaccines recommended during pregnancy. People planning to travel internationally should also check what vaccines are recommended for their destination and consult with a health care professional more than a month before departure.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): This respiratory virus hospitalizes an estimated 58,000 children and 177,000 older adults each year in the U.S. Annually in the country, it kills between 100 and 500 children under five years old and about 14,000 older adults.

Hepatitis A and B: Both of these viruses cause liver infections. Severe cases of hepatitis A can require liver transplants, while chronic cases of hepatitis B can lead to other liver problems, including liver cancer.

Rotavirus: This common gastrointestinal virus causes diarrhea that is sometimes severe enough to require hospitalization. Infections are most common in children under three years old, and the virus can withstand handwashing and common hand sanitizers.

Diphtheria: This bacterial infection has become rare in the U.S. through vaccination; before the vaccine was available, case rates could be as high as 200,000 annually. The infection can manifest in the respiratory system or the skin. Half of untreated people die; children under age five and adults more than 40 years old are most vulnerable.

Tetanus: Sometimes called lockjaw because an early symptom is muscle pain and spasms in the jaw, tetanus is caused by toxins from a bacterium. Doctors don't have a cure for tetanus, and the infection has become rare in the U.S. only through vaccination.

Pertussis/whooping cough: This bacterial infection is sometimes nicknamed the “100-day cough” for its most characteristic symptom. U.S. infection levels have generally run between 10,000 and 20,000 diagnosed cases per year; the disease hospitalizes more than one in five infected children under six months old.

Haemophilus influenzae type b infection: This bacterium—unrelated to the influenza virus—causes a host of infections, including mild cases in the ears and lungs but also severe cases in systems such as the bloodstream and central nervous system. Before the vaccine was developed, the U.S. saw 20,000 severe infections annually in children under five years of age, and one in 20 of these cases was fatal.

Pneumococcal disease: The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause a range of infections, including so-called invasive infections that tend to be more serious. Pneumococcal disease can include pneumonia—pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizes more than 150,000 people in the U.S. each year. But other types of pathogens also cause pneumonia, and pneumococcal disease can manifest anywhere in the body.

Polio: This virus most frequently causes asymptomatic infections, but symptomatic infections can have quite severe symptoms, including paralysis of one or more limbs or even of the muscles involved in breathing. Polio can also trigger new symptoms many years after the initial infection in what's called postpolio syndrome.

COVID: In the five years since COVID emerged, this disease has contributed to the deaths of more than 1.2 million people in the U.S.; weekly death tolls remain in the hundreds. The virus also causes lingering and sometimes debilitating systemic issues known as long COVID, including in children.

Influenza: This respiratory virus is most prevalent in North America between October and May. Although many cases can be treated at home, flu infections can be very serious, particularly in young children and adults aged 65 or older, as well as people with immune issues and other chronic conditions. During the 2023–2024 season, the CDC reported 34 million cases of flu, 380,000 hospitalizations and 17,000 deaths.

Chickenpox: The varicella-zoster virus causes a characteristic itchy rash of small blisters that appear in conjunction with a fever, headache and other mild symptoms. Severe cases can cause more systemic infections, pneumonia, brain swelling and toxic shock syndrome. Adults who did not have chickenpox as a child are more vulnerable to serious infection.

Measles: Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known to experts, and historically most children contracted it before the age of 15. Doctors have no cure for measles; they can only treat its symptoms. About one in 1,000 cases causes brain inflammation; even rarer complications can occur years after the initial infection. The measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine has dramatically reduced caseloads in the U.S. since the late 1960s, however.

Mumps: Mumps is a viral infection characterized by the swelling of certain salivary glands, but other organs can also be affected, including the testicles, ovaries, brain, spinal cord and pancreas. Mumps can also trigger miscarriage early in pregnancy.

Rubella: Sometimes called German measles, rubella is a viral infection that is unrelated to measles but also causes a rash. For most people, rubella is a mild illness, but it triggers serious birth defects in as many as 90 percent of cases in which the virus infects someone during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

Meningococcal disease: Infection of the blood or the membranes of the central nervous system by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis kills 10 to 15 percent of people who are treated; cases that aren't fatal can include a range of long-term issues.

Human papilloma virus (HPV): Infection with this virus leaves people susceptible to cancer, particularly cervical cancer; nearly 38,000 cancers per year are attributed to the virus.

Mpox: The virus that causes mpox was first identified in 1958 but more regularly infects animals than humans. In 2022 it began spreading in people worldwide, however. The infection is characterized by a painful rash and flulike symptoms. The vaccine is only recommended for people who are likely to be exposed to the virus.

Dengue: Dengue is a mosquito-borne illness that is most common in tropical regions. In severe cases, it can damage blood vessels and interfere with the blood's ability to clot. Vaccination is not available in the contiguous U.S., but it is available in U.S. territories and freely associated states for children aged nine to 16 who have had the disease before and live in a region where the infection is common.

Shingles: This infection is caused by the same virus as chickenpox, which remains in the body after a chickenpox infection. When the previously dormant virus reactivates, it can cause shingles, a painful localized rash that is most common in people aged 50 or older and can lead to ongoing pain, vision issues and neurological problems.

Trump Administration Ousts National Science Foundation from Headquarters Building

Employees at the National Science Foundation say they've been blindsided by a plan for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to take over their offices

By Robin Bravender & E&E News 

The headquarters of the U.S. National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia.

CLIMATEWIRE | The Department of Housing and Urban Development is expected to announce Wednesday that it's moving into the headquarters of the National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, according to the union representing NSF employees.

But as of Tuesday evening, staff at the science foundation hadn't been informed by management about their building's incoming occupants, leaving them feeling blindsided and unsure about where they're expected to work.

One NSF employee said that they had “literally zero idea” the move was coming until reports began circulating among staffers Tuesday evening. That person was granted anonymity because they fear retaliation.

Jesus Soriano, president of the union that represents NSF employees, said he was expecting a press conference Wednesday morning in the NSF lobby including HUD Secretary Scott Turner and Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Soriano said he was informed about the plans by NSF employees.

Soriano sent an alert to union members Tuesday evening informing them that NSF's management “learned this afternoon [from HUD]” that the Wednesday news conference would include an announcement that “HUD will take over the NSF building” and that the science agency was not involved in the decision.

The union, Soriano wrote, “understands that there is no planning except that the HUD secretary may take over the 18th and 19th floors” and start planning the HUD move over the next two years. “There is no planning for NSF, no identified future location, appropriation for a new building or a move,” he wrote.

HUD and the General Services Administration announced in April that HUD wanted to move out of its current location in the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building near L'Enfant Plaza in Washington. That building, which opened in 1968, faces over $500 million in deferred maintenance and modernization needs, GSA said. The building would be at half of its capacity with every HUD staffer at headquarters, according to GSA.

An NSF spokesperson directed a request for comment to GSA. GSA, the White House and a Youngkin spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It's unclear what happens to the staff at NSF, where more than 1,833 employees work in the building, according to the employee union. The science agency moved into the Alexandria office from Virginia's Ballston area in 2017.

“Is the government more interested in the technological and scientific leadership of this country or on using taxpayer dollars to offer luxury accommodations to government officials?” Soriano said.

The union said in a press release Tuesday that it was told that plans for NSF headquarters include a dedicated executive suite for the HUD secretary on the 19th floor, the construction of an executive dining room, reserved parking spaces for the secretary's cars, exclusive use of an elevator for the secretary and a space dedicated to hosting the secretary's executive assistants on the 18th floor.

When Does Consciousness Emerge in Babies?

Answering the question of when consciousness emerges is deeply tied to the mystery of what it actually is and how it can be measured

Jeffrey Lawson was born prematurely in February 1985. Shortly afterward, the newborn had to undergo heart surgery without anesthesia. He remained awake throughout the procedure, given only Pavulon, a muscle relaxant, to prevent movement. He died five weeks later.

After Jeffrey Lawson's death, his mother was told that her son had been too young to tolerate anesthesia. And the anesthesiologist had attempted to reassure her that there was no evidence premature babies felt any pain.

The Lawson family's story, famous in pain research, was not an anomaly. Until the 1980s, surgical procedures on infants were routinely performed with little or no anesthesia. Even clear defensive reactions to painful stimuli were considered to be mere reflexes.

But more than 20 years after Jeffrey Lawson's operation, an international research team found evidence that the brains of newborn premature babies react to pain stimuli in a very similar way to those of adults. More specifically, the researchers observed an increased oxygen supply in parts of the cerebral cortex that were associated with conscious experience. This evidence of increased neuronal activity indicated that premature babies do indeed feel pain.

Understanding the experiences of infants has presented a challenge to science. How do we know when infants consciously experience pain, for example, or a sense of self? When it comes to reporting subjective experience, “the gold standard proof is self-report,” says Lorina Naci, a psychologist and a neuroscientist at Trinity College Dublin. But that's not possible with babies.

Among the debates surrounding the developing mind is the question of when consciousness first emerges. And that question is tied to the scientific challenge of defining conscious experience. Various philosophical, psychological and neurobiological models have attempted to explain what it is and what underlies it. Investigating whether this phenomenon exists across early development may offer new insights and ways to assess theories of consciousness.

Many scientists now recognize multiple types of consciousness and suspect that certain forms exist earlier than others in development. That insight has helped address some issues but has left others unresolved. “The answer to the question of when children become conscious depends on what exactly is meant by consciousness,” says developmental psychologist Norbert Zmyj of TU Dortmund University in Germany.

Broadly speaking, there are two camps among researchers when it comes to consciousness in early development, Naci says. Some take a strict view that consciousness emerges in early childhood and that a being is only conscious once it reaches a stage where it can demonstrate abilities such as decision-making and self-reflection.

For example, one influential idea is that a mental state becomes conscious when a thought is directed toward it. So if you see a red apple and then think, “I see a red apple,” you are conscious of this sensation because you have a higher-order thought that represents it. With that definition, consciousness only arises in the course of childhood because it requires higher thought processes.

Another type to consider is the awareness of oneself as a distinct being, which emerges around 18 months. From about that age of one and a half, most toddlers who receive a dab of paint on their cheek without noticing it will, if then placed in front of a mirror, not only recognize themselves but also touch the affected area or point it out to others. “The children obviously have an idea of themselves and compare it with their reflection,” Zmyj says. “Younger children, on the other hand, see their reflection as a play partner or touch the spot in the mirror instead of their face.”

The second camp of researchers thinks of consciousness in a broader way that includes what is sometimes called primary, or core, consciousness. That's the awareness of the present moment and of sensations. And in that framing, consciousness could be present much earlier in life.

In a review paper published in 2023, Naci and her colleagues discussed behavioral evidence that infants experience some form of subjective sensation—or primary consciousness—shortly after birth. For example, newborns fixate on faces, contort their expression in response to pain and react to sounds in ways that indicate they distinguish their mother's voice from that of strangers. That last ability is notable because it implies learning and would require memory, which researchers also believe is critical to certain types of consciousness.

The catch is that these examples could be explained away as automatic. Observing these behaviors is not enough to be confident about an infant's experiences of the world. “We need better methods to study early consciousness, both to define it … and to detect it,” says neuroscientist Julia Moser of the University of Minnesota, who was a co-author of the 2023 review. To really understand conscious awareness, she and others argue, we need to look to the brain.

The relationship between consciousness and perception is complicated. As just one example, people affected by “blindsight” have sustained damage to their primary visual cortex, part of the brain's visual system. If you ask them whether they can recognize an object in their field of vision, they answer in the negative.

But if you ask people with blindsight to guess where an object is located, in many cases, they can reach for it or at least point in the right direction. That ability suggests the brain is processing visual stimuli unconsciously, even though the person does not have the impression of seeing anything.

Many experiments involve manipulating the visibility of an object with the hopes of identifying consistent patterns in brain activity that could be markers of conscious experience. For instance, in a typical experimental setup, people view two images in such rapid succession that the second effectively “covers” the first in their perception. As a result, people do not report seeing the first image.

In the first 200 to 300 milliseconds of visual processing, however, reactions do occur in sensory areas of the brain. Much like the blindsight cases, the brain is perceiving something that the person is not consciously aware of seeing.

By tweaking these experiments, scientists have confirmed that a visual must appear for at least 300 milliseconds for people to perceive it correctly. That experience is accompanied by a synchronized, widely distributed brain response in the frontal and parietal lobes. This peak in the brain's response, measured by tracking electrical activity known as the P300 wave, is considered a reliable indication of conscious perception.

A team of researchers based in France looked for such patterns in infants. The group included cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene of the College of France and pediatrician Ghislaine Dehaene-Lambertz of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research. In one study, the group used caps fitted with electrodes to record fluctuations in electrical brain activity in 80 children aged five months, 12 months or 15 months.

While wearing these caps, the young participants saw faces on a screen for different lengths of time. These images were embedded in visual patterns to make them more difficult to detect.

Using this setup, the researchers documented a slow brain wave in children aged one year and older that resembled the P300 brain response of adults—although it appeared much later than in adult participants. In five-month-old infants, the wave again appeared, albeit less pronounced and even more delayed than in the older babies.

Based on this brain activity, the team concluded, infants as young as five months could have conscious visual impressions.

Another way to explore the development of consciousness is to check for brain activity associated with this state in adulthood with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). For example, Naci and her colleagues have looked for the interplay of two brain networks: the frontoparietal and default mode networks.

The frontal and parietal regions are part of the brain's dorsal attention and executive control networks, which support our ability to plan and work toward goals. These networks are also important to theoretical models of consciousness, such as global neuronal workspace theory. The default mode network, so named because it is active when we are not doing anything in particular, supports activities such as thinking about oneself and allowing one's mind to wander.

In healthy adults, these areas have a complementary, coordinated relationship: one activates while the other is suppressed, and vice versa. By contrast, that back-and-forth does not play out as normal when people are under anesthesia or in a vegetative state.

In a study published in 2022, Naci and her colleagues looked at measurements of the spontaneous brain activity of newborns at rest, which allowed the scientists to record the communication between neurons in different areas of the brain. Not only did they see the frontoparietal and default mode networks; they also found that the brain regions already exhibited a pattern of complementary activation.

And in 2025 Naci and her colleagues published findings with another signature of brain activity linked to consciousness in adults. The team observed a pattern of brain connectivity associated with the efficient transfer of information called small-world architecture. They found that not only did full term newborns have this pattern of connectivity but that a majority of premature infants, born at 32 to 35 weeks, did as well—albeit in a less developed form.

Meanwhile Moser and her colleagues have designed experiments that combine imaging with a specific task to observe whether the brain's hardware in utero is engaged in the same kinds of processes that are present in later life. Specifically, they used a method called fetal magnetoencephalography to measure brain activity in 56 healthy fetuses between the 25th and 40th week of pregnancy with sensors on the pregnant person's abdomen.

The researchers then set up a classic experiment that was related to consciousness and involved rule violation: they played a repeating sequence of sounds, then altered this pattern to observe any changes in brain activity that might indicate awareness of that disruption. In their study, fetuses as young as 35 weeks showed changes in activity that suggest a recognition of the changed pattern. “This is, for us, a sign of this very primary, sensory form of consciousness, because basically your brain was able to cover a memory span of more than a minute,” Moser says. “Then your brain adapts its response to what has been learned.”

Other studies by researchers such as Franziska Schleger of the University of Tübingen in Germany point in a similar direction. Based on brain activity, they saw evidence that newborns and fetuses notice when the number of sounds played changes.

Still, Moser stresses that this work does not indicate that a fetus is conscious. “A lot of the things we've been studying are sensory awareness,” she explains. These capacities could be early pieces of what will become conscious experience.

There is also a notable anatomical boundary that limits when even the earliest forms of consciousness could arise. In 2020 Hugo Lagercrantz of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden observed that consciousness can only awaken when there are connections between brain areas called the thalamus and the cerebral cortex.

The thalamus acts as a control center and transmits sensory signals to various areas of the cerebral cortex. The corresponding nerve fiber connections develop around the 24th week of pregnancy. From then on, according to Lagercrantz, consciousness is at least theoretically possible. But, he says, “I'm not sure whether a fetus is really conscious yet. Most of the time, it sleeps, even if it reacts to pain, touch and the mother's voice.”

After birth, it is a different story, as a child's expanded behavioral repertoire makes clear. A newborn can imitate their parents and react more strongly to human conversation than to other sounds, for instance. These can all be taken as signs of minimal consciousness.

And Lagercrantz and Moser agree that consciousness does not emerge from one moment to the next but builds gradually. According to Moser, this fits in well with our understanding of development in other areas of cognition, such as memory.

“Most abilities grow gradually, even those that have little to do with cognition, such as the ability to see accurately or control muscles,” she says. Why would consciousness be an exception?

A Sodom and Gomorrah Story Shows Scientific Facts Aren't Settled by Public Opinion

Claims that an asteroid or comet airburst destroyed the biblical Sodom captured the public's imagination. Its retraction shows that scientific conclusions aren't decided by majority rule in the public square

By Mark Boslough 

The Destruction Of Sodom And Gomorrah, painting by John Martin, 1852.

In 2021 a multidisciplinary team of researchers claimed that a Tunguska-sized airburst, larger than any such airburst in human history, destroyed a Bronze Age city near the Dead Sea. The story went viral. This alleged destruction of Tall el-Hammam around 1650 BCE, with reports of melted pottery and mudbricks, pointed to the Bible, the team concluded in Scientific Reports, noting “what could be construed as the destruction of a city by an airburst/impact event.”

News outlets from Smithsonian to the Times in Britain covered the report. It had all the ingredients—with authors touting its connection to the biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah—to make it pure clickbait gold. On the day it was published, one of the co-authors posted links on his blog to their three press releases. A week later he asserted that it was “the most read scientific paper on Earth” based on 250,000 article accesses.

Science, however, is not a popularity contest, and the “cosmic outburst” story indeed holds a different lesson than the one first supposed, about how the public should hear incredible claims. In April, just before the study passed the 666,000 mark, Scientific Reports retracted the finding, writing that “claims that an airburst event destroyed the Middle Bronze Age city of Tall el-Hammam appear to not be sufficiently supported by the data in the Article,” and that “the Editors no longer have confidence that the conclusions presented are reliable.” Independent scientists (I was one of them) had alerted them to faulty methodology, errors of fact and inappropriate manipulation of digital image data. One study co-author responded to the retraction in an online post with claims that the editor had caved to harassment by skeptics, concluding that the “court of public opinion is much more powerful than a shadowy hatchetman spamming a corrupt editor's inbox.”

Public opinion does influence policy decisions and funding priorities in science. People are interested in new medical cures and new starry discoveries, which helps explain why we have a NASA and an NIH. That's why it is important for the public to be scientifically literate and well informed. But scientific facts are determined by the scientific method, logic and evidence, all presented in peer-reviewed publications that require reproducible results. Scientists don't vote on findings, but they do achieve consensus by convergence on understandings based on multiple studies across many fields.

The Sodom airburst paper instead represented the nadir of “science by press release,” in which sensational but thinly supported claims were pitched directly to the media and the public. Press releases, rife with references to Sodom and biblical implications, appeared to be focused as much on titillation as on science.

A meme, in its original definition, is a self-propagating unit of cultural information that is highly fit in the evolutionary sense. Like genes, memes can be engineered. Science by press release can be an effective first step in the creation and laundering of such memes into the public's collective consciousness. The authors of the Sodom airburst paper did this well. Their press releases were quickly picked up and repeated by both online clickbait media and mainstream media.

The Sodom airburst meme was so successful that it achieved pop culture status and public acceptance within a year of the paper's publication, in this “Final Jeopardy!” question: “A 2021 study suggested that an asteroid that struck the Jordan Valley c. 1650 B.C, gave rise to the story of this city in Genesis 19.” (Winning answer: “What is Sodom?”)

I am under no illusion that this myth will suddenly be rejected by the public just because the paper was retracted. It is a sticky and compelling idea that has been around since it was suggested by astronomer Gerald Hawkins in 1961. I think it is far more likely that it will join the large and growing pantheon of persistent false beliefs, folk facts and urban legends. Contrary to that bastion of error, scientists know that humans use more than 10 percent of their brains, vaccines don't cause autism, “detox diets” don't cleanse our bodies, toads don't give us warts, and bulls don't hate the color red.

Many of those myths are harmless. It won't hurt you to avoid kissing toads, for example. Belief in other scientifically incorrect claims can be extremely dangerous. Avoid vaccinating your children, and you subject them to the risk of serious illness or death.

What would it hurt if most people thought that God sent an asteroid to wipe out the people of Sodom, because of their wicked ways? That could go either way. The Old Testament, in Ezekial 16:49-50, says that they were punished because they were “arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.” Would it be a bad thing if fear of an asteroid makes us better people? But it could also generate opposition to planetary defense programs to plan for and prevent the impact of an asteroid if we discover one on a collision course. If the majority of people think it's God's will and that we've got it coming, then why shouldn't we just accept our fate?

Ultimately, science-informed choices are always the best ones, whether they involve personal decisions about vaccination or public policies for climate change mitigation. When faith inspires people to better themselves, I'm all for that, too. It shouldn't take irrational and unscientific fear of fire and brimstone from an asteroid airburst to make us want to be more humble, kind and generous than the people of Sodom supposedly were.

This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Named “Gwada negative,” it originated from a blood sample taken 15 years ago.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Most people are familiar with the four broad human blood types—A, B, AB, and O—and it's likely they may even know that they come in positive or negative varieties (an indicator of what's called an Rh factor) as well. However, that's really only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the complexity of human blood types. In fact, humans theoretically contain millions of different blood types, as there are more than 600 antigens that have been identified on human blood cells. Any combination of those antigens could be considered a new blood type. 

However, the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) only recognizes 47 distinct blood type groups, with the latest being added just last year after a 50-year-long mystery. Now, according to a press statement published on LinkedIn by the French Blood Establishment (EFS), a 48th member has officially joined the party. Some 15 years ago, researchers received blood from a French woman originating from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, colloquially referred to as “Gwada.” The patient drew blood while undergoing routine tests before surgery.

An unusual antibody associated with this blood was discovered in 2011, but it wasn't until 2019 that DNA sequencing found that a genetic mutation was responsible for the unique blood type, which was officially recognized by the ISBT this month. The researchers named the group “Gwada negative,” after the patient's homeland, and confirmed that the woman inherited the blood type from her parents, who each contained the mutated gene.

“[This] is undoubtedly the only known case in the world,” Thierry Peyrard, a medical biologist at EFS, told Agence France-Presse (AFP). “She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself.”

Its immensely important to know the antigen make-up of your blood before undergoing blood transfusions, as mismatch can trigger a life-threatening immune response. Essentially, your body thinks the antigens attached to the foreign blood cells are invaders. Although there are potentially millions of blood types, transfusions made with blood that matches your type according to the well-established ABO-Rh type system have a 99.8 percent chance of success. This is because your body's immune response doesn't attack all antigens equally, so even if there are some differences, the transfusion will likely be a success. 

However, it's still important to identify these ultra-rare blood types so that life-threatening immune responses can be avoided. “Discovering new blood groups means offering patients with rare blood a better level of care,” the EFS team said in a press statement.

Although the current number of blood groups sits at 48, that likely won't be the last count. Advancements in gene sequencing have supercharged the discovery of these blood groups. For example, the 44th member of this group, known simply as “Er,” was discovered in 2022, meaning that scientists are currently discovering more than one new blood group a year. 

2025 might hold one or two more blood-based surprises of its own.

This previously unknown symbiotic relationship helps keep methane—a major greenhouse gas—trapped in the ocean.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When you live in the ocean's aphotic zone, where absolute darkness reigns, you need some creative solutions to some pretty existential questions. Chief among them: what are you going to eat? 

For a variety of ocean floor-dwelling species, including mussels, worms, and sponges, that answer lies with chemosynthetic bacteria—organisms that flourish around methane seeps where the gas escapes the Earth's crust. A new study shows that three species of the sea spider genus  Sericosura also demonstrate a similar ability, which helps explain why these spindly-legged organisms are found in such abundance near methane seeps. The results of the study were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). 

Despite the name, sea spiders aren't actually spiders (though, that'll likely be of little comfort to an arachnophobe). Although they look remarkably similar, sea spiders have a thinner cephalothorax than their eight-legged land-based lookalikes, and their legs tend to have more joints. Oh, and they also live in the deep ocean—one of biology's true final frontiers of scientific inquiry. This hard-to-reach ecosystem is why many aspects of their lives remain a mystery.

“Our study aimed to examine the ways in which often overlooked animals might take advantage of novel energy sources, such as methane,” Shana Goffredi, the senior author of the study from the Occidental College of Los Angeles, said in a press statement. “While the deep sea feels far away, all organisms are interconnected, and the processes in one ecosystem affect another.”

In 2023, Goffredi—along with two students, including Bianca Dal Bó—embarked on a two-week research expedition on the R/V Atlantis to study these creatures in their deep-sea habitats. With the help of a piloted submersible named Alvin, they examined and collected sea spider specimens located 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) below the ocean surface from the Del Mar and Palos Verdes seeps in California and the Sanak seep in Alaska. Of the 36 specimens recovered, three of the spiders represented entirely new species. 

“I had seen animal samples in preservatives in the lab for so long, so it was beautiful to finally see them moving around in their natural habitat,” Dal Bó said in a press statement. “It made me feel all the more connected to my project and these fascinating ecosystems.”

While performing experiments on board, Goffredi and Dal Bó incubated the sea spiders in seawater with methanol and a heavy isotope of methane. Because this isotope is rare in nature, the researchers could track its impact on the sea spiders, including if it was ingested. They found that methylotrophic bacteria located on the sea spiders' exoskeletons served as a source of a food. 

“Evidence from tissue isotopic analysis, microbiome sequencing, and live-animal incubations followed by 13C-methane isotope probing confirms active incorporation of methane-derived carbon into spider tissues,” the authors wrote. “This research highlights a previously unknown interaction between an animal lineage and chemically fueled microbes, introducing another symbiotic pathway for direct microbial transfer of methane carbon into animal biomass in the deep sea.”

This transfer of methane carbon into animal biomass is particularly important for scientists to understand, as methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases. Sea spiders—with the help of other deep ocean-dwelling animals—are doing their part to keep these gases locked away in the ocean, so they don't reach the atmosphere and exacerbate the ongoing climate crisis. 

“While the deep sea feels really far away, all organisms are interconnected,” Goffredi told CNN. “Even though they're small, these animals have a big impact in that environment. We can't ever hope to sustainably (use) the oceans if we don't really understand the oceans.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Quantum computers just got an upgrade","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250625011632.htm","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 06:00:20 GMT","

Quantum computers can solve extraordinarily complex problems, unlocking new possibilities in fields such as drug development, encryption, AI, and logistics. Now, researchers at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have developed a highly efficient amplifier that activates only when reading information from qubits. Thanks to its smart design, it consumes just one-tenth of the power consumed by the best amplifiers available today. This reduces qubit decoherence and lays the foundation for more powerful quantum computers with significantly more qubits and enhanced performance.

Bits, which are the building blocks of a conventional computer, can only ever have the value of 1 or 0. By contrast, the common building blocks of a quantum computer, quantum bits or qubits, can exist in states having the value 1 and 0 simultaneously as well as all states in between in any combination. This means that a 20 qubit quantum computer can represent over a million different states simultaneously. This phenomenon, which is called superposition, is one of the key reasons that quantum computers can solve exceptionally complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of today's conventional supercomputers.

Amplifiers are essential - but cause decoherence

To be able to utilize a quantum computer's computational power, qubits must be measured and converted into interpretable information. This process requires extremely sensitive microwave amplifiers to ensure that these weak signals are accurately detected and read. However, reading quantum information is an extremely delicate business - even the slightest temperature fluctuation, noise, or electromagnetic interference can cause qubits to lose their integrity, their quantum state, rendering the information unusable. Because the amplifiers generate output in the form of heat, they also cause decoherence. As a result, researchers in this field are always in pursuit of more efficient qubit amplifiers. Now, Chalmers researchers have taken an important step forward with their new, highly efficient amplifier.

""This is the most sensitive amplifier that can be built today using transistors. We've now managed to reduce its power consumption to just one-tenth of that required by today's best amplifiers - without compromising performance. We hope and believe that this breakthrough will enable more accurate readout of qubits in the future,"" says Yin Zeng, a doctoral student in terahertz and millimeter wave technology at Chalmers, and the first author of the study published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques.

An essential breakthrough in scaling up quantum computers

This advance could be significant in scaling up quantum computers to accommodate significantly more qubits than today. Chalmers has been actively engaged in this field for many years through a national research program, the Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology. As the number of qubits increases, so does the computer's computational power and capacity to handle highly complex calculations. However, larger quantum systems also require more amplifiers, leading to greater overall power consumption, which can lead to decoherence of the qubits.

""This study offers a solution in future upscaling of quantum computers where the heat generated by these qubit amplifiers poses a major limiting factor,"" says Jan Grahn, professor of microwave electronics at Chalmers and Yin Zeng's principal supervisor.

Activated only when needed

Unlike other low-noise amplifiers, the new amplifier developed by the Chalmers researchers is pulse-operated, meaning that it is activated only when needed for qubit amplification rather than being always switched on.

""This is the first demonstration of low-noise semiconductor amplifiers for quantum readout in pulsed operation that does not affect performance and with drastically reduced power consumption compared to the current state of the art,"" says Jan Grahn.

Since quantum information is transmitted in pulses, one of the key challenges was to ensure that the amplifier was activated rapidly enough to keep pace with the qubit readout. The Chalmers team addressed this by designing a smart amplifier using an algorithm that improves the operation of the amplifier. To validate their approach, they also developed a novel technique for measuring the noise and amplification of a pulse-operated low-noise microwave amplifier.

""We used genetic programming to enable smart control of the amplifier. As a result, it responded much faster to the incoming qubit pulse, in just 35 nanoseconds,"" says Yin Zeng.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists reprogram ant behavior using brain molecules","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250625012443.htm","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 10:35:23 GMT","

From the bright lights of cities that don't sleep -- where people hustle and bustle through the night to keep subways, servers, and supply chains alive -- to the whisper-dark understory of tropical forests where ants hum in syncopated lines, the planet's most intricate societies hinge on round-the-clock cooperation and finely tuned roles.

Within Atta cephalotes, or leafcutter ants, every role is pre-written in morphology, from curves of the mandible (jaws) to body size, scripting a precise division of labor. The hulking Major ants serve as sentinels, patrolling doorways and repelling intruders; the slightly more diminutive Media ants harvest leaf confetti for nimble Minors, the colony custodians and caretakers; and, at the tiniest tier, pin-sized Minima ants groom fungal gardens and cradle the brood.

Now, researchers led by Shelley Berger of the University of Pennsylvania, have revealed key elements of the leafcutters' genetic code, pinpointing two signaling molecules that can be dialed up or down to reprogram ant duties. Crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), elevated in Media ants, promotes leaf-harvesting tasks and can induce similar behavior in other subcastes. Neuroparsin-A (NPA), abundant in Majors, however, suppresses brood care and is linked to defensive patrols, alternately lowering its levels of NPA prompts caregiving behavior.

Reporting their findings in Cell, the researchers also uncovered a striking parallel: gene-expression patterns that govern division of labor in leafcutter ants mirror those in eusocial naked mole-rats -- mammals that similarly abide by cooperative brood care -- hinting at a convergent molecular mechanism dating back over 600 million years.

""We were amazed to see the apparent similarity of gene regulation between nurses and foragers of ants compared to naked mole-rat mammals -- this was unexpected,"" says Berger the Daniel S. Och Penn Integrates Knowledge University Professor with appointments in the School of Arts & Sciences and the Perelman School of Medicine. ""Our results in ants reinforce how single neuropeptides can dramatically alter behavior, which may be applicable to human social behavior -- although humans of course are much more complex.""

From carpenters to leafcutters 

Building on previous research on the carpenter ants, which have a similar but simpler social organization consisting of two roles -- forager and soldier -- the team investigated several different neuropeptides in leafcutters to explore how these principles scaled up to the more nuanced four-subcaste structure of Major, Media, Minor, and Minim.

The researchers created 3D-printed behavioral chambers that allowed them to monitor how ants interacted with leaves, the brood, or fungus. These chambers enabled tracking and quantification of behavior through video analysis, demonstrating how altering CCAP and NPA levels in ants induced dramatic and reproducible shifts in their assigned tasks.

""Generally speaking, specific neuropeptides are more abundant in certain castes, so we looked at the levels of neuropeptides in the brains of each caste,"" explains Karl Glastad, assistant professor at the University of Rochester and former postdoctoral researcher in the Berger lab. ""In Majors, the neuropeptide that dictates leafcutter behavior is low and the neuropeptide that stops nursing is high, so if we increase the former, it leads to leafcutter behavior, and if we decrease the latter, it leads to nursing and caretaking of brood.""

Glastad adds that these neuropeptides, once bound to their matching receptors, spark an intricate signaling cascade that ripples through gene networks, like a molecular Rube Goldberg machine, that leads to ants shifting from one specialized task to another.

Molecular mechanisms across kingdoms 

To further explore the evolutionary depth and implications of this behavioral script, the team investigated naked mole-rats a distant evolutionary cousin whose subterranean colonies echo the caste-like harmony of leaf-cutter nests.

""At first, I thought incorporating naked mole-rats felt like a bit of a boondoggle,"" laughs Glastad. ""But we were amazed to discover that there's actually a lot of similarities in the molecular regulation of these kinds of foraging and caretaking castes between the brains of these two species.""

Despite naked mole-rats lacking the exact neuropeptides like NPA found in ants, the researchers hypothesized that these peptides might still activate ancient, conserved pathways common to both species due to promiscuity of certain, more conserved receptors.

""When we saw these intriguing neuropeptide results, we pursued the idea that maybe this neuropeptide is plugging into some conserved gene pathways that convergently evolved in these very different animals to manage distinct behaviors,"" Glastad explains. ""And remarkably, we found substantial overlap -- enough that the ant neuropeptide could even activate endogenous receptors in the naked mole-rat brain. Discovering that unexpected convergence was incredibly cool and, frankly, fortuitous.""

A novel role for insulin regulatory pathways? 

The findings also reveal intriguing connections to insulin regulation pathways, known for their important role in sugar metabolism.

Particularly, insulin-like peptides such as Ilp1 were prominently expressed alongside NPA, suggesting a previously unappreciated interplay between neuropeptide signaling and insulin pathways in behavioral regulation.

""By discovering, essentially, that there's this link between insulin and maternal caretaking behavior, both with naked mole-rats and then also with leafcutter ants, we speculate that this might open the door for potentially looking at how disorders in insulin regulation may affect these behaviors,"" says first author Maxxum Fioriti, a graduate researcher in the Berger Lab.

""This connection launches new avenues for research into how insulin might regulate caregiving behaviors in mammals, potentially even humans,"" Fioriti says, venturing that insulin resistance disorders like diabetes may affect maternal mental health and post-partum depression.

Extending to lifespan plasticity 

Looking ahead, Berger's team is keen to explore the persistence of biological plasticity as it relates to behaviors. They are also interested in extending their work to late life rejuvenation and lifespan plasticity because reproductive ant queens live much longer than workers that don't reproduce.

Berger believes that epigenetics, the study of how gene activity can be turned on or off without changing the underlying DNA, offers powerful ways to understand not only behavioral plasticity but lifespan plasticity too.

""We're really interested in how long the reprogrammed behavior persists, and what are the pathways for long-lived queens,"" she says. ""I think both phenomena are of enormous interest in mammalian and human biology -- the long-term effects of the plasticity of behavior and lifespan we're investigating.""

Speaking about future research on lifespan plasticity, Fioriti notes that one of the other ant species in the lab has amazing lifespan plasticity, ""where instead of having just different behaviors, they can also switch between a long-lived queen versus a short-lived worker.""

""We have these comparisons of the ant behavior model with the naked mole-rat, and we're also interested in seeing if we can couple understanding lifespan plasticity between ant and naked mole-rat as well,"" Fioriti says.

The question of whether Earth is alone in harboring life has captivated humanity for millennia. In recent years, scientists have turned to Earth-like planets in other solar systems that may show the most promise, but many revolve around stars that emit much stronger solar radiation than our own. Now, a new study offers evidence that life as we know it may be able to thrive on those Earth-like exoplanets.

Published June 12th in Astrobiology, the new research demonstrated that lichen found in the Mojave Desert survived for 3 months under levels of solar radiation previously considered lethal. The common lichen, Clavascidium lacinulatum, was injured, but able to recover and replicate. The results show that photosynthetic life may be possible on planets exposed to intense solar radiation.

""The study was motivated by a curious observation,"" said Henry Sun, Associate Research Professor of Microbiology at DRI and one of the lead authors of the study. ""I was just walking in the desert and I noticed that the lichens growing there aren't green, they're black. They are photosynthetic and contain chlorophyll, so you would think they'd be green. So I wondered, 'What is the pigment they're wearing?' And that pigment turned out to be the world's best sunscreen.""

Life on Earth has evolved to withstand solar radiation known as UVA and UVB rays, which encompass longer wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation. UVC rays represent the shorter, more damaging wavelengths; these are filtered by Earth's atmosphere and therefore do not reach the surface. UVC radiation is so lethal to life, in fact, that it is used to sterilize air, water, and surfaces of microorganisms like viruses and bacteria. Even a brief exposure to UVC radiation will damage an organism's DNA and prevent it from reproducing.

Scientists have wondered, then, whether many of the Earth-like planets discovered in recent years could possibly harbor life. Many of these planets revolve around stars known as M and F stars that emit intense UVC radiation, especially during solar flares.

""After the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, which can see extremely far into space, the excitement shifted from finding life on Mars to these exoplanets,"" Sun said. ""We're talking about planets that have liquid water and an atmosphere.""

Sun and his graduate student at the time, Tejinder Singh, collected the lichen from the Mojave Desert near their homes in Las Vegas. They then placed it next to a UVC lamp in a controlled laboratory setting for 3 months straight. Remarkably, half of the algal cells in the lichen remained viable and replicated when rehydrated.

""In order for a microorganism to persist on a planet, it has to last longer than a day,"" Sun said. ""So, our experiment had to be long enough to be ecologically significant. We also wanted to go beyond just activity and demonstrate viability.""

To explore how this was chemically possible, Sun teamed up with chemists from the University of Nevada, Reno. They conducted two experiments that demonstrated how lichen acids are the natural world's equivalent of the additives used to make plastics UV-resistant.

They investigated the lichen's protective layer by cutting a cross-section of it and found that the top layer was darker, like a human's suntan. Lichen is composed of algae or cyanobacteria living symbiotically with fungi; when the algal cells were separated from the fungi and protective layer, exposure to the same UVC radiation killed the cells in less than a minute.

The discovery that lichen has evolved this protective layer to UVC radiation was surprising, Sun said, because it isn't necessary for their survival. Earth's atmosphere was already filtering out UVC rays by the time lichen appeared, so the protection is a mere bonus thanks to their remarkable UVA and UVB protection.

Some of the damage that occurs from exposure to intense solar radiation is the result of chemical reactions with the atmosphere, particularly the production of ozone when oxygen, nitric oxide, and UV radiation interact. To test the lichen's protection under different atmospheric conditions, the researchers placed it in an oxygen-free box with the UVC light and found that the radiation damage was further reduced.

""We came to the conclusion that the lichen's top layer - a less than millimeter thick skin, if you will - assures that all the cells below are protected from radiation. This layer acts as a photo stabilizer and even protects the cells from harmful chemical reactions caused by the radiation, including reactive oxygen.""

The study offers evidence that planets beyond Earth, and beyond our solar system, may be inhabitable. In fact, ""they may be teeming with colonial microorganisms that, like the lichens in the Mojave Desert, are 'tanned' and virtually immune to UVC stress,"" the researchers write.

""This work reveals the extraordinary tenacity of life even under the harshest conditions, a reminder that life, once sparked, strives to endure,"" said Tejinder Singh, who led the study with Sun and is now at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. ""In exploring these limits, we inch closer to understanding where life might be possible beyond this planet we call home.""

Study authors include: Tejinder Singh (DRI), Christos Georgiou (U. of Patras), Christopher Jeffrey (UNR), Matthew J. Tucker (UNR), Casey S. Philbin (UNR), Tanzil Mahmud (UNR), Christopher P. McKay (NASA Ames), and Henry J. Sun (DRI)

A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis identifies a possible way to slow or block progression of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in people over age 50. The WashU Medicine researchers and their international collaborators implicated problems with cholesterol metabolism in this type of vision loss, perhaps helping to explain the links between macular degeneration and cardiovascular disease, which both worsen with age.

The new findings -- identified using human plasma samples and mouse models of macular degeneration -- suggest that increasing the amount of a molecule called apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the blood fixes problems in cholesterol processing that lead to cellular damage in the eyes and other organs. Various methods of dialing up ApoM could serve as new treatment strategies for age-related macular degeneration and perhaps some forms of heart failure triggered by similar dysfunctional cholesterol processing.

The study appears June 24 in the journal Nature Communications.

""Our study points to a possible way to address a major unmet clinical need,"" said senior author Rajendra S. Apte, MD, PhD, the Paul A. Cibis Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at WashU Medicine. ""Current therapies that reduce the chance of further vision loss are limited to only the most advanced stages of macular degeneration and do not reverse the disease. Our findings suggest that developing treatments that increase ApoM levels could treat or even prevent the disease and therefore preserve people's vision as they age.""

In macular degeneration, doctors can see cholesterol-rich deposits under the retina during an eye exam, according to Apte. In early stages, vision might still be normal, but the deposits increase inflammation and other damaging processes the lead to the gradual loss of central vision. In the most common type, ""dry"" macular degeneration, the cells in the central part of the retina can be damaged, causing a type of neurodegeneration called geographic atrophy, which is similar to what happens in the brain in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Dry macular degeneration can turn into ""wet"" macular degeneration, in which abnormal blood vessel growth damages vision.

Geographic atrophy and wet macular degeneration are advanced forms of the disease that are accompanied by vision loss. Although some approved therapies for advanced disease are available, the disease process itself is not reversible at that stage.

 A common culprit in eye disease and heart failure 

In recent years, evidence has emerged that ApoM can serve as a protective molecule with known anti-inflammatory effects and roles in maintaining healthy cholesterol metabolism. With that in mind, Apte and co-senior author Ali Javaheri, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, were interested assessing whether reduced ApoM levels, which fall with age, could be involved in the dysfunctional cholesterol metabolism that is at the root of multiple diseases of aging, including macular degeneration and heart disease. They showed that patients with macular degeneration have reduced levels of ApoM circulating in the blood compared with healthy controls. And past work by Javaheri, a WashU Medicine cardiologist, showed that patients with various forms of heart failure also had reduced levels of ApoM in the blood.

This study revealed that ApoM is a key component in the ""good cholesterol"" pathways that mop up excess cholesterol -- the bad kind that tends to drive inflammation -- and clear it from the body through the liver.

Apte and Javaheri's research suggests that when ApoM is low, cells in the retina and heart muscle can't correctly metabolize cholesterol deposits and have a hard time getting rid of these accumulating lipids. When these lipids build up, it leads to inflammation and cellular damage.

To see if they could reverse the harmful effects of low ApoM, the researchers increased ApoM levels in mouse models of macular degeneration, using genetic modification or plasma transfer from other mice. The mice showed evidence of improved retinal health, improved function of light-sensing cells in the retina and reduced accumulation of cholesterol deposits. The researchers further found evidence that ApoM triggers a signaling pathway that breaks down the cholesterol in cellular compartments called lysosomes, which are known for playing important roles in disposing of cellular waste.

The researchers also found that ApoM must be bound to a molecule called sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) to get the beneficial effects of ApoM treatment in the mice.

Apte and Javaheri are working with Mobius Scientific, a WashU startup company that is working to harness this knowledge of the role of ApoM in macular degeneration to develop new approaches to treating or preventing the disease. Apte and Javaheri worked with WashU's Office of Technology Management (OTM) to launch Mobius Scientific in 2022.

The findings also could have implications for future interventions that raise ApoM in patients with heart failure.

""One of the exciting things about this collaboration is realizing the links between retinal pigment epithelial cells and heart muscle cell, which are both vulnerable to low ApoM,"" Javeheri said. ""It is possible that the interaction between ApoM and S1P is regulating cholesterol metabolism in both cell types. We look forward to exploring strategies to increase ApoM in ways that could help the eye and the heart maintain healthy cholesterol metabolism over time and stave off two major diseases of aging.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Mammals didn't walk upright until late—here's what fossils reveal","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250625075018.htm","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:17:23 GMT","

For over a century, scientists have puzzled over a fundamental mystery in our evolutionary history: how did mammals go from sprawling like lizards to striding like cats and dogs? This transition -- from a sprawled stance (like a lizard) to an upright (parasagittal) posture -- marked a pivotal moment in mammal evolution. While the earliest non-mammalian synapsids, the ancestors of living mammals, had a sprawling posture, researchers debated when and how the upright postures of modern mammals evolved.

Now, a groundbreaking study in PLOS Biology led by Dr. Robert Brocklehurst, a former postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB) at Harvard University, offers a surprising answer: the path to upright posture wasn't linear, but full of unexpected detours, evolutionary experimentation, and dramatic anatomical upheaval.

""The evolution of mammals has previously been characterized as a series of steps from sprawling, to semi-sprawling, to upright,"" said Brocklehurst. ""However, what we discovered was a more nonlinear evolutionary progression throughout mammalian history.""

All mammals -- from bats and whales to moles and humans -- share a distinctive way of moving: they hold their limbs underneath their bodies, unlike the sprawling posture with limbs out to the side. This posture enables more efficient movement and is tied to mammals' ability to adapt to diverse lifestyles, from digging to flying. This dramatic transition was also accompanied by big changes in limb bone shape and mechanics. To assess these changes, the team analyzed the humerus (upper arm bone) of over 60 non-mammalian synapsid fossils and 140 living animals, including mammals, reptiles and amphibians.

Using a novel analytical technique, pioneered in senior author Professor Stephanie Pierce's lab (also in OEB), researchers mapped each bone's surface to measure traits like length, mass distribution, muscle leverage, and torsion (the degree to which the bone twists along its length). These traits correlate with specific modes of locomotion and allowed the researchers to reconstruct posture and locomotion in the fossils.

""By correlating bone shape and limb biomechanics with posture, we could test how well the fossil bones were optimized for specific functional tasks, like upright walking versus sprawled walking,"" Brocklehurst said. The researchers achieved this by mapping the fossil non-mammalian synapsids onto a functional adaptive landscape, similar to a topographic map, with peaks and valleys that relate to high and low performance of different locomotor postures.

""We expected to see a neat progression -- from sprawling pelycosaurs to a bit more upright therapsids, then cynodonts, then fully upright mammals,"" said Brocklehurst. ""Instead, we found bursts of innovation.""

The findings suggest that mammal evolution involved a series of adaptive radiations, with each major ancestral groups exploring a range of forelimb functions and postures -- some of which were closer to modern mammals, others not.

""The path to upright posture wasn't a straight line,"" says Pierce, ""the ancestors of mammals weren't steps on a ladder with modern mammals at the top. Mammals have been evolving and radiating into many different niches and habitats throughout their history, and their postures reflect that variation.""

One fossil, a close relative of today's marsupials and placentals, showed bone features consistent with a modern upright gait, suggesting that fully parasagittal postures evolved relatively late in mammalian history as opposed to previously held hypotheses. This result supports recent work from the same lab on the backbone and hindlimb.

""Our work challenges the idea that posture changed gradually and early on,"" said Pierce, ""instead, it shows that upright posture and locomotion were a late evolutionary innovation, not an early defining trait of the mammalian lineage.""

The researchers also challenge the long-held idea that the earliest non-mammalian synapsids sprawled in a similar way to living lizards or crocodiles. ""Our study showed that most synapsid limbs functioned differently than those of modern reptiles. They're not just copies of reptiles, but distinctive animals in their own right that are a little different from anything that's alive today,"" says co-author Kenneth Angielczyk of Chicago's Field Museum.

To compare such a wide range of bones -- spanning hundreds of species, including those hundreds of millions of years apart in age and wildly different in shape -- the team had to overcome major technical hurdles. Traditional methods that describe shape in similar structures didn't work. So, the team re-engineered an existing R software package designed for a different task, transforming it into a novel ""slice-based"" landmarking tool tailored for this study. Co-author Magdalen Mercado, former undergraduate student in the Integrative Biology program at Harvard, helped gather the extensive dataset as part of her senior thesis and research in the Pierce lab.

The study builds on a rich scientific legacy -- both at Harvard and in paleontology. Pierce, who is also Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology in the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), noted that, ""Researchers and former MCZ curators, like Alfred Sherwood Romer and Farish Jenkins, Jr., were grappling with these same questions a century ago. Now, with new tools and data, we can revisit those ideas and see the story more clearly.""

This study marks the first large-scale evolutionary analysis of mammalian posture using quantitative biomechanics. But that's just the beginning. The team is now building detailed models of forelimbs in select fossil species to understand how joints and muscles functioned in ancient animals, offering even deeper insights into the evolution of mammalian motion.

As Brocklehurst put it: ""Understanding how mammals came to walk upright isn't just about bones, it's about uncovering the dynamic history of life on Earth.""

Funding was provided by the US National Science Foundation (DEB1754459 and DEB1754502), by the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology and the Wetmore Colles Fund.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The pleasure prescription: Why more sex means less menopause pain","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250625011635.htm","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 09:35:23 GMT","

It's no secret that women often become less interested in sex with age. However, orgasm and satisfaction have been shown to not decline significantly with age. A new study suggests regular sexual activity may limit vulvar pain, irritation, and dryness, which are all common reasons women have less sex as they get older. Results of the study are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The Menopause Society.

Estrogen deficiency during and after menopause may reduce the life expectancy of women and impair their quality of life through a condition called genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). In 2014, GSM was defined as a collection of symptoms and signs associated with decreased estrogen and sex steroid levels. GSM includes genital, sexual and urinary symptoms -- all of which can affect the frequency of sexual activity for women aged in their 40s to 70s.

In this new study involving more than 900 women aged 40 to 79 years, researchers sought to examine the association between sexual regularity and vulvovaginal-related problematic menopause symptoms. The vulva refers to the external female genitalia, and the vagina to the internal anatomy. Common problems experienced with menopause include itching, burning, pain, decreased lubrication, and changes in skin appearance.

Engaging in sexual activity in the past 3 months was defined as regular sexual activity, whereas engaging in sexual activity in the past year (but not in the past 3 months) was considered lower sexual activity. Not surprisingly, the researchers confirmed that the proportion of women having regular sexual activity decreased significantly with age, which aligns with the fact that Female Sexual Function Index scores for sexual desire, arousal, and lubrication also significantly decreased with age. The Female Sexual Function Index consists of 19 questions on female sexual function under six domains. Noteworthy, however, was that the scores for orgasm and satisfaction did not change with age.

Based on the results of the study, the researchers determined that some sexual functions and symptoms change with age but may be maintained in women who engage in more regular sexual activity. This study also revealed that women with regular sexual activity showed a low prevalence of GSM-related symptoms.

Study results are published in the article ""Cross-sectional study of the association between regular sexual activity and sexual function and genitourinary syndrome of menopause-related symptoms.""

""The findings highlight the importance of diagnosing and treating GSM. Only 2.9% of the participants reported using hormone therapy. Local low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is safe and highly effective at alleviating bothersome vulvovaginal symptoms contributing to pain and avoidance of intercourse. And although optimal sexual health is integral to overall well-being, it is also imperative to recognize the effect these symptoms can have on women who aren't sexually active. Treatment should be offered to anyone with symptoms, whether engaging in sexual activity or not. Normalizing use of local low-dose estrogen therapy should be a thing,"" says Dr. Monica Christmas, associate medical director for The Menopause Society.

The skin acts as the body's first line of defense against external threats. However, as we age, the epidermis -- the outermost layer of skin -- gradually becomes thinner and loses its protective strength. About 90% of the cells in this layer are keratinocytes, which originate from deeper layers of the epidermis and migrate upward, ultimately forming the skin's protective barrier. To combat aging's impact on skin, numerous studies have emphasized the benefits of vitamin C (VC), a vitamin well known for its role in skin health and antioxidant properties.

Now, researchers in Japan have discovered that VC helps thicken the skin by directly activating genes that control skin cell growth and development. Their findings, published online in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology on April 20, 2025, suggest that VC may restore skin function by reactivating genes essential for epidermal renewal.

This study was led by Dr. Akihito Ishigami, Vice President of the Division of Biology and Medical Sciences at Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology (TMIG), Japan, in collaboration with Hokuriku University, and ROHTO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Associate Professor Ayami Sato from TMIG (currently at the Toyo University); Associate Professor Yasunori Sato, Professor Toshiyuki Kimura, and Mr. Hideki Tanaka (currently at the University of Fukui Hospital) from Hokuriku University; and Ms. Florence, Ms. Akari Kuwano, Mr. Yasunari Sato, and Mr. Tsuyoshi Ishii from ROHTO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd also co-authored the study.

""VC seems to influence the structure and function of epidermis, especially by controlling the growth of epidermal cells. In this study, we investigated whether it promotes cell proliferation and differentiation via epigenetic changes,"" explains Dr. Ishigami, while talking about this study.

To investigate how VC affects skin regeneration, the team used human epidermal equivalents, which are laboratory-grown models that closely mimic real human skin. In this model, skin cells are exposed to air on the surface while being nourished from underneath by a liquid nutrient medium, replicating the way human skin receives nutrients from underlying blood vessels while remaining exposed to the external environment.

The researchers used this model and applied VC at 1.0 and 0.1 mM -- concentrations comparable to those typically transported from the bloodstream into the epidermis. On assessing its effect, they found that VC-treated skin showed a thicker epidermal cell layer without significantly affecting the stratum corneum (the outer layer composed of dead cells) on day seven. By day 14, the inner layer was even thicker, and the outer layer was found to be thinner, suggesting that VC promotes the formation and division of keratinocytes. Samples treated with VC showed increased cell proliferation, demonstrated by a higher number of Ki-67-positive cells -- a protein marker present in the nucleus of actively dividing cells.

Importantly, the study revealed that VC helps skin cells grow by reactivating genes associated with cell proliferation. It does so by promoting the removal of methyl groups from DNA, in a process known as DNA demethylation. When DNA is methylated, methyl groups attach to cytosine bases, which can prevent the DNA from being transcribed or read, thereby suppressing gene activity. Conversely, by promoting DNA demethylation, VC promotes gene expression and helps cells to grow, multiply, and differentiate.

The study suggests that VC supports active DNA demethylation by sustaining the function of TET enzymes (ten-eleven translocation enzymes), which regulate gene activity. These enzymes convert 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), a process in which Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+. VC helps maintain TET enzyme activity by donating electrons to regenerate Fe2+ from Fe3+, enabling continued DNA demethylation.

The researchers further identified over 10,138 hypomethylated differentially methylated regions in VC-treated skin and observed a 1.6- to 75.2-fold increase in the expression of 12 key proliferation-related genes. When a TET enzyme inhibitor was applied, these effects were reversed, confirming that VC functions through TET-mediated DNA demethylation.

These findings reveal how VC promotes skin renewal by triggering genetic pathways involved in growth and repair. This suggests that VC may be particularly helpful for older adults or those with damaged or thinning skin, boosting the skin's natural capacity to regenerate and strengthen itself.

""We found that VC helps thicken the skin by encouraging keratinocyte proliferation through DNA demethylation, making it a promising treatment for thinning skin, especially in older adults,"" concludes Dr. Ishigami.

Planets are thought to form from dust and gas in protoplanetary disks, with debris disks being the remnants of planet formation. Aged a few million up to a few billion years, debris disks have lost their primordial gas, and their dust is produced by steady-state collisions between larger, rocky bodies1,2. Tens of debris disks, with sizes of tens, sometimes hundreds, of astronomical units have been resolved with high-spatial-resolution, high-contrast imagers at optical and near-infrared or (sub)millimetre interferometers3,4. They commonly show cavities, ring-like structures and gaps, which are often regarded as indirect signatures of the presence of planets that gravitationally interact with unseen planetesimals2,5. However, no planet responsible for these features has been detected yet, probably because of the limited sensitivity (typically 2–10 MJ) of high-contrast imaging instruments (see, for example, refs. 6,7,8,9) before the James Webb Space Telescope. Here we have used the unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument10,11 in the thermal infrared to search for such planets in the disk of the approximately 6.4-Myr-old star TWA 7. With its pole-on orientation, this three-ring debris disk is indeed ideally suited for such a detection. We unambiguously detected a source 1.5 arcsec from the star, which is best interpreted as a cold, sub-Jupiter-mass planet. Its estimated mass (about 0.3 MJ) and position (about 52 au, de-projected) can thoroughly account for the main disk structures.

The disk around TWA 7 is one of the youngest (6.4 ± 1 Myr old; ref. 12) debris disks known to date. TWA 7 is a close (about 34 pc; ref. 13), low-mass (0.46 M☉; ref. 14) member of the young TW Hydra association, sometimes classified as a weak-line, non-accreting T-Tauri star15. The disk, resolved by the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)16, is one of the rare ones resolved around M stars. It is seen almost pole-on17,18, a most favourable configuration to precisely estimate its radial distribution and to look for planets. The most recent modelling of the disk surface density deduced from polarimetric data from the Spectro-Polarimetic High Contrast Imager for Exoplanets Research (SPHERE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT)18 includes a ring peaking at 28 au and extending out to more than 100 au (R1), a narrow (less than 7 au full-width at half-maximum) ring at 52 au (R2) and a broader (more than 40 au full-width at half-maximum) structure (93 au; R3; Figs. 1 and 4 from ref. 18). No planet has been detected so far, with detection limits roughly estimated to 0.5–1 MJ beyond 50 au (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Information).

The coronagraphic images of TWA 7 taken with the F1140C filter (central wavelength = 11.3 μm, bandwidth = 0.8 μm) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)19 were obtained on 21 June 2024 during cycle 2 (ID 3662; principal investigator, A.-M.L.; Extended Data Table 1). The details on the data reduction procedure are described in the Methods. The main critical step is the subtraction of the residual diffracted light leaking from the MIRI coronagraph using a reference star observed with the same set-up. This process is necessary to bring the contrast ratio with respect to the star to a level of 10−5–10−4 beyond angular separations of about 0.5 arcsec. The final image, presented in Fig. 1, reveals three sources within 10 arcsec from TWA 7, the properties of which are listed in Extended Data Table 2. One source at about 4.7 arcsec from TWA 7 (position angle 107°) was classified as a stellar background source, already detected in ancillary optical data from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on the HST as well as near-infrared data from the NICMOS on the HST and the SPHERE on the VLT. The second one, located about 6.7 arcsec east of TWA 7, and spatially resolved, has no counterpart in the data from the SPHERE on the VLT, or in the data from the NICMOS or the STIS on the HST (taking into account TWA 7 proper motion (−118.751 ± 0.023 mas yr−1, −19.648 ± 0.026 mas yr−1; ref. 20)). Its location in the MIRI image is consistent with that of a bright source in Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) band 7 (346 GHz) data from 2016 (ref. 21), given the proper motion of the TWA 7 system between the ALMA and MIRI observations. This object therefore has the characteristics of a highly reddened background source. It is reminiscent of the JWST observations of the HR 8799 multi-planetary system, for which a z ≈ 1 galaxy was detected in the MIRI data taken at both 10 and 15 μm, and in ALMA band 7 data as well, but never identified in the near-infrared22. The third source, located about 1.5 arcsec northwest of TWA 7 (about 51 au, projected separation) is unique to these MIRI observations. Hence, this source (hereafter, CC#1) is extremely red, and is not compatible with any background or foreground star.

North is up, and east is left. The status of three identified sources is indicated. Note that the faint signal north of the background galaxy is an artefact. bgd, background.

No data are available to test whether this third source shares a common proper motion with the star. In this context, in the following, we discuss the possible nature of this object. The first origin that one can consider is a Solar System object. Yet, most Solar System objects have proper motion between 5 and 40 arcsec h−1 (ref. 23). Even very remote, low-proper-motion small Solar System objects such as the dwarf planets Eris (semi-major axis of about 68 au) and Sedna (semi-major axis of about 510 au) showed proper motion of 1.4 arcsec h−1 (ref. 24) and 1.7  arcsec h−1 (ref. 25), respectively, at the time of their discovery. No trail was observed during the 2-h-long exposures, and no apparent motion was observed between the two images recorded during the sequences taken 2 h apart, indicating that CC#1 has a proper motion of less of than about 0.05  arcsec h−1. A Solar System object with such a low proper motion would be located at more than 200 au. For such a cold object, reflected light would dominate in the MIRI F1140C filter and would require a Neptune-like size to fit the flux measured for CC#1 (for a geometric albedo of 0.1–0.3). It was checked whether such a scenario could be compatible with the hypothetical Planet Nine26. On the basis of the constraints from the planetary ephemeris27 and the predictions of the orbit of Planet Nine28, a Solar System origin for CC#1 can definitely be excluded.

The second possible origin is a background galaxy. Like the background galaxy seen east of TWA 7, CC#1 has no reported counterpart at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. However, in contrast to this galaxy, it has no detected counterpart in the ALMA band 7 data (see details in Supplementary Information). The detection of this unresolved source at 11.3 μm, its non-detection in ALMA band 7 and the measured upper limits at 1.6 μm in the data from the SPHERE on VLT (Supplementary Information) could still be compatible with intermediate-redshift star-forming galaxies. Using such galaxy templates at various redshifts and published galaxy counts in JWST fields of view, we estimated that the probability of finding one such galaxy in a region of 1.5 arcsec radius centred on TWA 7 is about 0.34% (Methods). This probability is low, albeit non-zero. The location of the source with respect to the disk structure, right in a circumstellar ring gap (see below), makes the galaxy hypothesis even more unlikely.

The third and last possible origin is a planet. A forward modelling approach is used to constrain the properties of this planet. Using the HADES model29, it is possible to find fits for the JWST photometric data point while accounting for the 5σ upper limits provided by the high-contrast images at 1.59 μm (H2) and 1.67 μm (H3) from the SPHERE on the VLT (Fig. 2). HADES considers the thermal evolution of the planet; it assumes that the planet and the stars are coeval. Atmospheric fits incorporating water clouds indicate a narrow range, regardless of other parameters, for the effective temperature between 305 and 335 K (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 3), and a mass of about 0.3 MJ. A metallicity range above solar is required. Additional data will be necessary to further constrain this parameter.

Modelled photometry is shown with crosses. The 1–15-μm spectra correspond to representative solutions that fit the observed flux of TWA 7b in the JWST F1140C filter (blue), with respect to the 5σ upper limits from the VLT SPHERE data in the H2 and H3 filters (red), and are consistent with an age of 6.4 ± 1 Myr. The bandwidths of H2 and H3 are 0.052 μm and 0.054 μm, respectively. A zoomed-in view around H2 and H3 highlights their bandwidths and the integrated model spectrum points below the upper limit. met, metallicity; Teff, effective temperature; fsed, sedimentation rate.

As a comparison and extra mass estimation, evolutionary models of cold, low-mass planets30 combined with our estimation of effective temperature are used; they lead to a comparable mass of close to 0.3 MJ (Extended Data Fig. 4) for metallicities less than 2.5, as available in their framework. These two consistent results indicate that the planet mass is substantially below 1 MJ. The current best estimate is around 0.3 MJ, and is only weakly dependent on the underlying details of the two models used. It, however, depends on the age of the planet, assumed here to be coeval with its parent star. A younger planet would lead to a smaller mass.

The observed source is located right on the R2 narrow ring, and, moreover, within a region identified by ref. 18 as underdense compared to the rest of the ring (Fig. 3a). This is very reminiscent of simulations of resonant rings predicted by early works31,32 for closer and less massive planets, which led to the proposal of such a possible situation for the TWA 7 system18.

a, Polarimetric image (in log scale) of the disk composed of the sum of three epochs (26 April 2016 presented in ref. 17, 20 March 2017 presented in ref. 18, and a new epoch, 8 February 2022, reduced as in ref. 18) from the SPHERE Infrared Dual-Band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS), with the MIRI image (resampled to the SPHERE pixel size) as an overlay with contours. The log of these data is provided in Supplementary Table 2. The peak densities of the rings are also indicated. The central hatched disk is a numerical mask to hide the stellar residuals. b, Disk simulations. Top view of a disk of massless planetesimals perturbed by a 0.34-MJ planet at 52 au, on a circular orbit, after 6 Myr (see details in text). The orbit of the perturbing planet is sketched in green and the location of the planet on its orbit is shown in red.

Dedicated N-body simulations were conducted for a planet with a mass of 0.34 MJ, located at 52 au around the 0.46 M☉ central star. This value is consistent with the measured projected separation, assuming that the planet and the ≈13°-inclined disk are coplanar. The simulation also included a disk of 200,000 planetesimals, distributed between 20 and 130 au. These parameters were selected to roughly match the boundaries of the observed disk. The planetesimal disk was assumed to be coplanar with the planet's orbit, with an initial surface density proportional to 1/r. The eccentricities of the planetesimals were chosen to range between 0 and 0.01, and the planet was assumed to evolve on a circular orbit. The simulations, which spanned 10 Myr, were performed using the symplectic N-body code swift_rmv3 (ref. 33), which provides a first-order treatment of close encounters.

A top view of the resulting distribution of planetesimals after 6 Myr is shown in Fig. 3b. Planetary perturbations efficiently carve the disk over about 30 au, but leave a narrow ring at 52 au, as well as a relative void (underdensity) around the planet. The latter structure is characteristic of a ring of co-orbital planetesimals with the planets, trapped in a 1:1 resonance with it. The similarity between the TWA 7 disk image and the simulation (Fig. 3a,b) is remarkable. In this context, the observed R2 ring would correspond to the ring of co-orbiters with the planet. We nevertheless expect some differences between both distributions owing to the radiation pressure acting on the grains. Additional information on the grain size distribution is needed to compute the effects of radiation pressure and refine the dynamical modelling.

The low likelihood of a background galaxy, the successful fit of the MIRI flux and SPHERE upper limits by a 0.3-MJ planet spectrum and the fact that an approximately 0.3-MJ planet at the observed position would naturally explain the structure of the R2 ring, its underdensity at the planet's position and the gaps provide compelling evidence supporting a planetary origin for the observed source. Like the planet β Pictoris b, which is responsible for an inner warp in a well-resolved—from optical to millimetre wavelengths—debris disk34, TWA 7b is very well suited for further detailed dynamical modelling of disk–planet interactions. To do so, deep disk images at short and millimetre wavelengths are needed to constrain the disk properties (grain sizes and so on). Refining the planet mass determination can be carried out with additional JWST photometry and possibly spectroscopy. Measuring the orbital parameters (eccentricity, in particular) is more challenging given the long orbital period (about 550 yr) of the planet. Yet, one notes that a planet on an eccentric orbit would rapidly destroy R2.

As it is angularly well resolved from the star, TWA 7b is suited for direct spectroscopic investigations, providing the opportunity to study the interior and the atmosphere of a non-irradiated sub-Jupiter-mass, cold (about 320 K) exoplanet, and start comparative studies with our much older and cooler Solar System giants, as well as with the recently imaged cold (about 275 K) but more massive (6 MJ) planet eps Ind Ab35. Improved estimations of its metallicity and temperature will further constrain its mass.

The present results show that the JWST MIRI has opened up a new window in the study of sub-Jupiter-mass planets using direct imaging. Indeed, TWA 7b (about 100 M⊕) is at least ten times lighter than the exoplanets directly imaged so far, and planets as light as 25–30 M⊕ could have been detected if present at 1.5 arcsec from the star or beyond.

Coronagraphic observations were performed with the 4QPM_1140 coronagraph paired with the F1140C filter. The details of the observations are given in Extended Data Table 1. We obtained two roll angles (difference of 7.835°) to mitigate the attenuation of the coronagraph in the field of view, in case an object falls close to one phase transition of the 4QPM. Each coronagraphic observation was 2 h long, hence a total of 4 h on the science target. Background observations were observed immediately after the science exposures in a two-point dithering mode, for a total of 4 h.

A reference star, CD-23-9765, was observed back-to-back with the target in the same configuration with the aim to subtract the starlight diffraction after the coronagraph. The reference shares similar brightness and spectral type with the target, and is angularly close. It was observed with nine-point small-grid dithering (SGD) to apply post-processing algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA)36. In total, the reference star was observed for about 1 h and comes with dedicated background observations.

Using comparison with simulated coronagraphic images, as in ref. 37, we were able to estimate a pointing accuracy on the 4QPM of about 2 mas per axis, significantly lower than the 10-mas step of the SGD. We also confirmed the detector coordinates of the 4QPM_1140 mask (119.758, 112.158 as provided in the JWST Calibration Reference Data System).

The data reduction follows the steps described in refs. 21,38. Level 1 data are retrieved from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST), processed with v1.14.0 of the pipeline together with Calibration Reference Data System file 1241. Images are registered to the coronagraph centre. Calibrated files (‘cal' files) are produced in-house with the JWST pipeline for each roll, by subtracting the background and converting the photometric units (data numbers per second to mega-janskys per steradian). The background is built from the minimum per pixel of the two dithers. We skipped the flat-field correction, which is not appropriate for the MIRI coronagraph22.

We took advantage of the diversity brought by the SGD mode to build a reference frame to subtract the stellar diffraction. We tested various algorithms and retained a linear combination (which uses the downhill simplex minimization) of the nine SGD reference star images, as well as the PCA, as the two algorithms providing the best detection of CC#1. To mitigate the over-subtraction effect, a numerical masking is implemented to ignore some parts of the image. We obtained the best compromise by selecting the annular region between 0.5 arcsec and 3 arcsec, and the three sources were masked with a 1 λ/D patch, with λ representing the observing wavelength and D the telescope diameter (we checked that the CC#1 flux measurements are similar with a different region: 2–3 arcsec). We proceeded similarly for the PCA, using eight components to build the final image that is subtracted to the data, in an annular region from 0.5 arcsec to 5 arcsec (point sources not masked). Despite the bad-pixel correction applied on the raw coronagraphic images, the subtracted images with the reference star are still affected by a few bad pixels, both with the linear combination and PCA. We further apply a σ-clipping function to correct for these remaining bad pixels. Finally, the images are rotated to align north up, considering the aperture position angles: 121.45° for roll 1 and 129.27° for roll 2, as well as the V3 axis orientation on the detector (4.835°).

Next, extracting the flux and position of the CC#1 requires modelling its point spread function (PSF), which can vary spatially and nonlinearly owing to the attenuation of the coronagraph for which the phase transitions extend across the whole field of view. We used both the diffraction code developed in refs. 39,40 and WebbPSF41 to simulate the MIRI PSF, taking into account the coronagraph, considering the configuration of mask, stop and filter (‘FQPM1140', ‘MASKFQPM' and ‘F1140C', according to the WebbPSF terminology). The position of CC#1 is approximated with a Gaussian fit, passing the sky coordinates to the former diffraction code and detector coordinates to WebbPSF to calculate the PSF of CC#1 accounting for the coronagraph attenuation. We measured the coronagraph transmission with both PSF estimates. The flux of the PSF model at the position of CC#1 is integrated in a 1.5 λ/D aperture (to match the aperture used for photometric measurements), and compared to that at 10 arcsec (far away from the coronagraph influence). The two approaches give similar transmissions: 0.66 and 0.62 in roll 1 and 0.31 and 0.28 in roll 2. Therefore, CC#1 is significantly closer to one 4QPM transition in roll 2 than in roll 1, so both its astrometry and photometry can be affected (Extended Data Fig. 1). We measured a signal-to-noise ratio of 30 and 18, respectively, for roll 1 and roll 2, using the linear combination method. In the roll 2 image, the PSF is more asymmetrical as the planet is closer to the quadrant edge in comparison to roll 1, so we decided to consider only roll 1 data for the photometric analysis.

On the basis of these CC#1 PSF models, we extracted the flux and the photometry of the object by minimizing the residuals between the reduced JWST data and a PSF model in a 1.5 λ/D area with three free parameters (positions and flux) and using either a downhill simplex algorithm or the Nelder–Mead algorithm42. For comparison, we also used aperture photometry, but this required implementation of an aperture correction based on simulated PSF (ratio of the total flux in the PSF to the flux integrated in the 1.5 λ/D aperture).

The flux extraction is applied both on the photometrically calibrated files (.cal), which directly provides CC#1 flux in mega-janskys per steradian, and on the uncalibrated files (.rate), which requires to measure a contrast with respect to the non-coronagraphic image of the star. As detailed previously22, the contrast measurement relies on commissioning data either on target acquisition images that come with the telescope pointing procedure but are obtained with a neutral density filter, or from images obtained on and off the coronagraph on another star. The method using target acquisition shows some net discrepancies, probably because the target acquisition filter is very broad (about 8–18 μm) and the targets have different spectral types (M3 for TWA 7 and K0 or K5 for the commissioning targets). Besides, the emission of the TWA 7 disk is expected to become significant beyond 15 μm. As a result, we did not use the target acquisition method in the following. The final photometric values are based on the linear combination and PCA technique to suppress the starlight. We averaged the values of the different methods (calibrated files and contrast, aperture and PSF model for the photometric extraction) and the error bar is built from the extreme values ((max − min)/2) for being conservative. We measured a flux density of 5.60 ± 0.97 × 10−19 W m−2 μm−1 for CC#1. The fluxes of the other sources are given in Extended Data Table 2. Note that we also tested the typical ‘injection–recovery' method directly in the raw data, but did not notice any significant differences for the extracted flux of the planet.

To estimate the probability that the source labelled CC#1 is a galaxy, we have taken into account the three constraints on the fluxes or upper limits at 1.6, 11 and 870 μm. The source has a flux of 22 μJy at 11 μm, and is not detected with ALMA at 870 μm, but with a tapered resolution of 2 arcsec. The measured 3σ upper limit for an unresolved source at the position of the MIRI source is 96 μJy (ref. 21). Combining all ALMA observations (see Extended Data Fig. 5), the 3σ upper limit is 76 μJy, in a beam of 0.29 arcsec × 0.24 arcsec (see a detailed analysis and estimation in the Supplementary Information). The third constraint is from the non-detection at 1.6 μm with VLT SPHERE, with an upper limit of approximately 0.6 μJy for a point source (about 60 mas in size). However, we have to take into account the fact that a low-z galaxy could be extended in the calculation of its maximum flux at 2 μm. Indeed, the size of a galaxy is expected to vary from one wavelength to the other: at 1.6 μm, the disk of old stars dominates, so the source is more extended, of the order of 10 kpc, whereas at 11 μm and 870 μm, the nuclear star-forming region dominates, and will appear more concentrated, of the order of 100–500 pc. We therefore considered the flux limit of an extended (0.6 arcsec) source in the SPHERE data (that is, 60 μJy).

Two types of galaxy might comply with these three constraints: star-forming galaxies or active nucleus (AGN) or a combination of both, with a redshift between z = 0.1 and 1. For such galaxies, at lower redshifts, where 1 arcsec is smaller than 2 kpc, the source would probably look extended (up to 5 arcsec) for wavelengths between 1 and 4 μm (ref. 43). At higher redshifts, the peak of the emission usually located at 100 μm will enter the ALMA domain at about 1 mm, and it should have been detected by ALMA44.

As the density of the cosmic star formation rate increases considerably with redshift between z = 0 and 1, starbursts at z = 0 are good templates for star-forming galaxies at z = 0.1 to 1. The starburst is in general nuclear. It can be highly peaked in the centre, or distributed in a ring of about 100-pc radius (like in M82), but the emitting size at 100-μm rest frame will be no more than typically 1 kpc. This corresponds to an angular size of about 0.55 arcsec at z = 0.1, about 0.16 arcsec at z = 0.5, and about 0.12 arcsec at z = 1. We also considered AGN templates. The nucleus is then a point source at long wavelengths, while the galaxy host is extended (about 10 kpc) at the shortest wavelengths.

The probability to find a z = 0.1 to 1 star-forming galaxy with a flux at 11 μm of 22 ± 3.8 μJy (hence, within a range of 7.6 μJy) in a field of view of 10 × 10 arcsec can be estimated readily through the source counts, from refs. 45,46,47,48. A probability of 50% is found in the redshift range z = 0.1 to 1.

To take into account the other constraints at 1.6 and 870 µm, we used the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) templates, from ref. 49, http://www.iasf-milano.inaf.it/~polletta/templates/swire_templates.html which include 14 templates of starbursts and AGN, representative of star-forming and active intermediate-redshift galaxies. These templates were computed for a half-dozen redshifts, and calibrated to have a flux of 22 μJy at 11 μm. An illustrative plot of their spectral energy distribution (SED) is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, in which the flux constraints at 1.6 and 870 µm are also indicated by black symbols (square and triangle).

We used the rest-frame 8-μm luminosity function of galaxies at redshifts between z = 0.1 and z = 1 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields50 to estimate the abundance of these star-forming galaxies. The 8-μm luminosity was deduced from the templates. This led to a probability of 12% to find such a galaxy in the right redshift range (z = 0.1 to 1) in the 10 × 10 arcsec field of view. We estimated that there are about 80% star-forming galaxies and 20% active nuclei, including low-luminosity ones such as Seyfert galaxies51,52. As can be seen in Extended Data Fig. 2, all templates comply with the three constraints below z = 0.5, and some starbursts are found brighter at 870 μm above this redshift. We therefore reduced the probability accordingly for z > 0.5, attributing each star-forming template equal probability, as shown by the observations53. The final probability to find such a galaxy in the 10 × 10 arcsec field of view is about 5%, with significant uncertainties: +3/−2%. Hence, in a radius of 1.5 arcsec around TWA 7, the probability to have such a galaxy is about 0.34% (+0.22/−0.14%). We note that the distribution of galaxies on the sky might be clustered in some rare places, and our error bars should be increased, but no more than 30% given the typical errors on luminosity function of galaxies45,47,50. Altogether, the probability of having a galaxy satisfying the various constraints within 1.5 arcsec would be 0.34% (+0.29/−0.18%). Note that the current calculation applies to these specific observational constraints. The probability for CC#1 to be a rare type of background galaxy compatible with the JWST, ALMA and SPHERE observational constraints is therefore low. Such a low-probability event can admittedly arise would a large number of independent datasets be analysed. However, this is not the case for this study. Indeed, only two datasets among about 30 JWST MIRI datasets dedicated to exoplanet searches are analysed. Moreover, most of the other datasets are not as deep as the present ones, and there are no corresponding 1.6- and 870-μm data available. Hence, the likelihood that any research group would have found such a peculiar background galaxy contaminant within the whole corpus of relevant JWST data is much lower than the simple 10.2% (30 × 0.34%) one could derive.

All observational data in this work are available through public data archives. The JWST data were collected through General Observer programme number 3662 (principal investigator A.-M.L.) and will be available through the MAST database (https://mast.stsci.edu) from 21 June 2025. The data described here are available via the MAST archive at https://doi.org/10.17909/4qvz-sw62. The present study made use of ALMA data collected during the 2015.1.01015.S programme (principal investigator A. Bayo). The present study made use of detection limits derived from SPHERE data collected during the programme 198.C-0209, and of SPHERE data collected during the programmes 097.C-0319(A), 105.209E.001 and 198.C-0209(F). The data are available at https://archive.eso.org.

JWST MIRI data reduction and analysis codes are available via GitHub at https://github.com/mathildemalin/ExoCAT. Data reduction was carried out using the publicly available JWST pipeline https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, and the stpf package https://stpsf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ to simulate PSFs for JWST. We used various functions of the following software packages to perform the analysis and create the figures: numpy, astropy, scipy, matplotlib and photutils.

Orientation of the 4QPM and its phase transitions in the sky plane for the two telescope rolls. North is up, East is left.

The curves are distinguished by their colors, and the corresponding labels, valid for all panels. All curves are calibrated to have a flux of 22 mJy at 11 μm. The two additional constraints are marked by black symbols (square and triangle): the flux should be lower than 60 mJy at 1.6 μm, and 96 mJy at 870 μm. The SED which are not consistent with the limits are plotted in dashed lines.

Corner plot of cloudy forward modeling using SPHERE upper limits and age constraints of 6.4+/− 1 Myr. The associated priors are listed in Extended Data Table 3. The mass found is 0.34+/− 0.06 MJ (considering errors from the MCMC only). Core given in Earth mass, Tint corresponds to the intrinsic temperature and fsed the sedimentation rate of the considered clouds.

Thermal evolution curves from ref. 30, showing the effective temperature evolution of cloudy planets with an [Fe/H] of 0.4 dex. The estimated age and effective temperature of TWA 7b supposing the planet and star are coeval is represented by the blue point. The effective temperature used is 316+19/−23K (derived from the forward modeling) and the age 6.4+/− 1 Myr.

Combined ALMA 0.88 mm image of the TWA 7 system obtained with Briggs 0.5 weighting, centered at the phase center of the April compact configuration observations. The background galaxy is clearly detected East of the expected stellar position, at a position consistent with the East source detected by MIRI (black and white circle). The stellar location at each of the 2016 ALMA epochs is shown by the green star (positions largely overlapping), whereas the stellar location at the 2024 MIRI observation is shown by the orange star. The position of the CC#1 source at the epoch of the 2024 MIRI observation is shown by the cyan circle.

Prevailing frameworks to address planetary environmental challenges tend to focus on setting goals, targets, or boundaries to limit human harm to ecosystems or species. Here we propose an aspirational approach aimed at empowering people to shape a better future for all of life on Earth. We do this by building on the human development approach and its supporting metrics, especially the Human Development Index (HDI), a broadly influential framework that has contributed to decades of human progress by measuring and promoting people's capabilities to lead the lives that they value. Rather than assessing the state or dynamics of the biosphere, we propose the Nature Relationship Index (NRI), which would focus on measuring the progress of nations towards delivering mutually beneficial relationships among people and the rest of the living world in terms that people widely understand and value. Through an open-ended process informed by expert consultation, international concept testing and indicator development, the NRI could help to incentivize progress towards a world in which humanity thrives together with the rest of life on Earth. We explore the challenges and opportunities of developing a robust NRI and invite broader participation to facilitate this development in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report.

Mitotic onset is a critical transition for eukaryotic cell proliferation. The commonly held view of mitotic control is that the master regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), is first activated in the cytoplasm, at the centrosome, initiating mitosis1,2,3. Bistability in CDK activation ensures that the transition is irreversible, but how this unfolds in a spatially compartmentalized cell is unknown4,5,6,7,8. Here, using fission yeast, we show that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, and that the bistable responses differ markedly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with a stronger response in the nucleus driving mitotic signal propagation from there to the cytoplasm. Abolishing cyclin–CDK localization to the centrosome led to activation occurring only in the nucleus, spatially uncoupling the nucleus and cytoplasm mitotically, suggesting that centrosomal cyclin–CDK acts as a ‘signal relayer'. We propose that the key mitotic regulatory system operates in the nucleus in proximity to DNA, which enables incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage to be effectively monitored to preserve genome integrity and to integrate ploidy within the CDK control network. This spatiotemporal regulatory framework establishes core principles for control of the onset of mitosis and highlights that the CDK control system operates within distinct regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm.

At mitotic onset, the cell undergoes many rapid changes across the cell, including modifications to the nuclear membrane, chromosome condensation, disassembly of cytoskeletal microtubules and formation of the mitotic spindle9. These changes are driven mainly by cyclin–CDK complexes10 through phosphorylation of hundreds of different substrates10,11,12. However, a full understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the CDK control network has been difficult to establish. This is in part owing to the existence of multiple different cyclin–CDK complexes and regulators in most eukaryotes, which have potential overlapping and redundant functions, making interpretation of experiments complex12,13,14,15. In addition, in vitro systems designed to investigate the dynamics of CDK activation that take account of cellular spatial compartmentation have been limited5,6,14. Finally, there is a lack of precise and simultaneous single-cell measurements of in vivo CDK activity and endogenous levels of CDK and its regulators16,17.

The Cdk1 kinase in complex with its regulatory subunit cyclin is the main driver triggering cellular changes at mitotic entry18. Its activity increases gradually during the cell cycle until late G2, when it increases more rapidly to bring about the onset of mitosis through a combination of cyclin accumulation and regulation of Cdk1 tyrosine residue phosphorylation (Y15 in most eukaryotes) near its ATP binding site4,5,6,19,20. The inhibitor Wee1 kinase family phosphorylates Y15 to inactivate Cdk1, while the activator Cdc25 family dephosphorylates this site21,22,23,24. Cdk1 also phosphorylates Wee1 and Cdc25, respectively inactivating and activating them25,26,27,28. Theoretical modelling and biochemical experiments of these positive (Cdk1 and Cdc25) and double-negative (Cdk1 and Wee1) feedback loops have shown they are able to abruptly increase Cdk1 activity at mitotic entry4,5,6. Furthermore, these feedback loops can lead to bistability and hysteresis, where for a given concentration of cyclin, CDK activity can either be high if the state of the system is mitotic or low if it is in interphase4,6,8. This ensures that the mitotic transition is irreversible and that the interphase and mitotic states are clearly distinguished, thus preventing cells from slipping back and forth between them4,5,6,29.

The eukaryotic cell contains multiple spatial compartments, the most prominent being the nucleus and cytoplasm. Such spatial complexity poses a challenge to understanding how a cell coordinates mitotic entry across the cell7,13,16,30,31. Previous studies have suggested that the initial mitotic CDK activation is triggered in the cytoplasm at the centrosome, the spindle pole body (SPB) in yeasts, which acts as a mitotic signalling hub that controls the timing of mitosis, from yeast to humans1,2,3,16,32. This view has been challenged by experiments using Xenopus egg extracts, which suggest that the nucleus might control the timing of mitosis33,34. Differential localization of mitotic regulators such as Wee1 (enriched in the nucleus)35 also raise the possibility of differences in the bistable responses between the nucleus and cytoplasm7.

Schizosaccharomcyes pombe (fission yeast) has been an excellent model system for understanding core principles in eukaryotic mitotic control36. This is partly owing to the relative simplicity of its cell cycle control architecture, with only one mitotic cyclin–CDK complex, the B-type cyclin Cdc13, complexed with the Cdk1 homologue Cdc237,38. Cell cycle control can be further simplified by engineering a Cdc13–wild-type Cdc2 (Cdc2(WT)) fusion, which can drive the entire cell cycle36. Here we use fission yeast to reveal the underlying spatiotemporal regulatory principles of how CDK orchestrates the onset of mitosis in vivo.

We explored whether there were differences in CDK substrate phosphorylation in different subcellular locations by reanalysing data from an earlier fission yeast phosphoproteomics experiment, to determine when CDK substrates are phosphorylated during the cell cycle11. We focused on sites that were phosphorylated in late G2 and mitosis using a localization annotation method39 to categorize phosphorylation sites on the basis of their cellular compartment11. Sites in the nucleus increased before the cytoplasm, cytoplasm periphery, the centrosome and SPB, and the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). There was no significant correlation between the sensitivity of the sites to CDK activity, as judged by half-maximal inhibition concentrations (IC50 values)11 and the timing of increases in phosphorylation at mitotic onset (Extended Data Fig. 1b). These results suggest that mitotic CDK activation occurs first in the nucleus before activation in other compartments, including the cytoplasm and SPB.

An unequal two-sample, left-tailed t-test was performed to test whether nuclear sites had an earlier rate change compared with sites in other compartments. P values: 2.92 × 10−25 (cytoplasm), 2.90 × 10−37 (cytoplasm periphery), 1.57 × 10−18 (nuclear envelope) and 2.09 × 10−37 (SPB). Error bars represent s.e.m. There was no variability with the estimated rate change points for cytoplasmic periphery and SPB sites. Red circles represent individual data points. c, Diagram of the minimal phosphorylation module used for construction of NucCDK.

Cells were imaged in Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) with 5-min time intervals.

Images were acquired every 10 min in YE4S medium at 36 °C.

To investigate this, new single-cell sensors were required to assay CDK activity in the nucleus and cytoplasm in unperturbed cells. To assay nuclear CDK activity, we developed the CDK sensor NucCDK, which resides in the nucleus but translocates to the cytoplasm upon phosphorylation by nuclear CDK (Fig. 1c,d and Methods). NucCDK sensor readout increased gradually throughout G2, switching to a rapid increase before stoppage of cell elongation, a feature of mitotic cells40 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d–f). We tested whether this switch occurred at mitotic onset using a temperature sensitive cdc25-22 mutant that blocks cells in late G2 (ref. 41) at 36 °C. Unlike wild-type cells, there was no rapid switch at 36 °C, confirming that the switch was associated with mitotic onset (Fig. 1e,f). Thus, this switch provides a readout of mitotic CDK activation.

SynCut3 is a CDK sensor that assays cytoplasmic CDK activity42. It is localized in the cytoplasm in interphase but translocates into the nucleus upon CDK phosphorylation42. We used this sensor (hereafter referred to as CytCDK) with NucCDK, and performed dual-colour imaging to determine the timing of CDK activation simultaneously in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2a,b).

DMSO was added after 11 time points of image acquisition as a control. A 3-min delay (shown with dashed lines) of when sensor readouts begin to decrease owing to normal cell cycle CDK inactivation. Mean Tdelay is shown below the graph, with s.d. in brackets. n = 30 cells; 1 of 2 biological repeats.

The readouts of NucCDK and CytCDK increased rapidly at the onset of mitosis, with the increase in NucCDK readout preceding that of CytCDK (Fig. 2c). We characterized the time delays between the lines as representing the rapid increase in sensor readouts at two points: near the beginning of the rapid increase of NucCDK and close to the peak (Methods). The time delays were about 12 min and 7 min near the beginning and near the peak, respectively, suggesting that nuclear CDK activation precedes cytoplasmic CDK activation (Extended Data Fig. 2a). To further investigate this delay, we systematically identified the initial point where the rate change occurs for each sensor readout, marking the change in CDK activity from a gradual to a rapid increase owing to mitotic CDK activation (Fig. 2c and Methods). We observed a time delay between nuclear and cytoplasmic activation of 5–10 min, similar to the previous estimate of approximately 12 min near the beginning of the increase in NucCDK readout (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2b). These experiments indicate that nuclear CDK activation occurs before cytoplasmic CDK activation, raising the possibility that the increase in nuclear CDK activity might bring about the subsequent increase in cytoplasmic CDK activity.

However, the time delay at mitotic onset between the NucCDK and CytCDK readouts could be due to a delay either in CDK phosphorylation of the sensors or to differences in sensor translocation kinetics. To distinguish these possibilities, we first acutely inhibited CDK activity after release from a G2 block during the rapid increase in CDK activity at mitotic onset, in a strain carrying an analogue-sensitive (As) version of the Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) fusion protein36 and both NucCDK and CytCDK (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 2c,d and Methods). Upon release from the G2 block, there was a delay of around 6 min in the increase of NucCDK and CytCDK, similar to our estimate of 5–10 min (Fig. 2e). However, when cells were blocked and released during mitosis, there was no detectable delay between the increases of NucCDK and CytCDK, suggesting that both sensors translocate rapidly after CDK phosphorylation, and that the approximately 6-min delay is due to differences in the timing of CDK activation between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2f). We also examined the response of the sensors after CDK inhibition. There was no delay between CDK inhibition and a change in NucCDK readout, but there was a delay of around 3 min in the change in CytCDK readout (Extended Data Fig. 2d). The decay half-lives for the sensors were both less than 5 min, indicating that the readouts of the sensors decay rapidly (Extended Data Fig. 2e).

We also characterized the in vivo sensitivities of NucCDK and CytCDK to CDK activity by determining the CDK inhibition dose–response curves for both sensors (Methods). This revealed that NucCDK is more sensitive to CDK activity than CytCDK (Extended Data Fig. 2f). To test whether this might affect our observation on the order of CDK activation, we developed a version of CytCDK that was more sensitive to CDK activity (CytCDK V2; Methods). CytCDK V2 had similar sensitivity to CDK activity as NucCDK (Extended Data Fig. 2g), so we repeated the dual sensor experiments. CytCDK V2 showed an earlier gradual increase in readout during G2, but the timing of the transition to a rapid increase representing CDK activation was the same as when using CytCDK (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2h), confirming our intepretation of the sequential order of nuclear and cytoplasmic CDK activation.

Overall, these experiments indicate that NucCDK readout increases before that of CytCDK at mitotic onset owing to differences in the timing of CDK activation between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We performed a further experiment to determine whether nuclear CDK activation occurs sequentially before cytoplasmic CDK activation by genetically bringing about a more gradual increase in CDK activity at mitotic onset, with the assumption that at mitotic onset a critical nuclear CDK activity threshold has to be reached to trigger the subsequent increase in cytoplasmic CDK activity17 (discussed further below). The more gradual increase in nuclear CDK activity would mean that it takes longer to reach this critical threshold, extending the delay in the increase of cytoplasmic CDK activity. We used a mutant strain carrying an analogue-sensitive version of the Cdc13–Cdc2(T14A/Y15F) fusion protein36 (Cdc13–Cdc2AF) that abolishes the CDK Y15 feedback loops thus making the increase in CDK activity more gradual. In the strain expressing the Cdc13–Cdc2AFAs fusion, the delay in the increase of NucCDK and CytCDK was extended to 13 min after release from G2 (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 2i,j). These results further support that there is a sequential order of nuclear and cytoplasmic CDK activation, and that nuclear CDK activity has a role in controlling the timing of the increase of mitotic cytoplasmic CDK activity.

The sensors are CDK substrates that are also phosphatase substrates, which may influence the timing of the switches in sensor readout43. Greatwall kinase links CDK activity to PP2A–B55 phosphatase activity, so that when CDK is activated at mitotic onset, PP2A–B55 is inactivated, resulting in a rapid increase in substrate phosphorylation43,44,45. Therefore, Greatwall might influence the delay between switches in sensor readout of NucCDK and CytCDK or CytCDK V2 through phosphatase regulation. However, deletion of ppk18, which encodes the main Greatwall kinase in fission yeast44, had no significant effect on the timing of the switches (Extended Data Fig. 2k).

We conclude from the sensor data and the phosphoproteomics analysis that there is a sequential temporal order in CDK activation at mitotic onset, with activation occurring first in the nucleus.

The translocation of cyclin B1 in human cells at the onset of mitosis is important for mitosis16,31, so we determined whether translocation of cyclin–CDK also occurs in fission yeast, coupling cytoplasmic activation to nuclear activation. We performed timelapse microscopy of Cdc13 levels using Cdc13 tagged with superfolder GFP (sfGFP) combined with a nuclear mask to segment the nucleus (Methods). We observed a decrease in nuclear intensity of Cdc13 just before SPB separation, with a corresponding increase in the cytoplasm, indicative of nuclear export at mitotic onset (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). This was followed by a decrease throughout the cell after spindle assembly due to Cdc13 degradation at mitotic exit (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). For subsequent experiments, we used the mean of the top 15% of pixels as an estimate of nuclear intensity, as nuclear area comprises approximately 15% of cell area46. This gave similar results to using a nuclear mask (Extended Data Fig. 3c), but avoided excessive light exposure. Timelapse imaging of Cdc2–mNeonGreen (mNG) indicated a similar nuclear export happening before spindle assembly, followed by further export after Cdc13 degradation (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 3d). We performed dual-colour imaging of Cdc13–sfGFP with NucCDK and CytCDK to identify when Cdc13 export occurs in relation to nuclear and cytoplasmic activation. We found that nuclear activation occurred about 5 min before export of Cdc13, whereas cytoplasmic activation occurred concurrently with export (Fig. 3c–e). A similar 5-min difference was observed for Cdc2–mNG with respect to nuclear activation, suggesting that Cdc13 and Cdc2 translocate as a complex (Extended Data Fig. 3e). When we calculated the nuclear and cytoplasmic mean Cdc13–sfGFP intensities at nuclear and cytoplasmic activation, we found the nucleus had a higher value, indicating differences in the cyclin threshold for CDK activation between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 3f). These differences are unlikely to be due to differences in sensor sensitivities, because the rate change point in sensor readout does not change with sensors that have different sensitivities (Fig. 2). This indicates that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, where there is a higher cyclin threshold, and this is followed by a fraction of the nuclear cyclin–CDK translocating to the cytoplasm, which overcomes the cyclin threshold in the cytoplasm to activate cytoplasmic CDK.

Bistability (multiple stable steady states of a system) and hysteresis (state of system dependent on its history) in Cdk1 activity has been shown in Xenopus egg extracts using steady-state measurements of Cdk1 activity on non-degradable cyclin6,8. However, to our knowledge, hysteresis in CDK activity has not been directly tested in vivo, and potential spatial differences have not been investigated in any system. Furthermore, hysteresis and positive feedback loops can be dispensable for stable oscillations in certain conditions5. Therefore, we determined the dynamic single-cell phase plots in the nucleus and cytoplasm in vivo, which represent the naturally occurring phase orbits in the dynamical system5, and investigated whether hysteresis would allow translocation of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) to the cytoplasm without collapse of the mitotic state in the nucleus. The phase plots enable us to visualize the different states of CDK activity for different concentrations of cyclin4,5,6.

The phase plots using data from Fig. 3c–f indicated a significant difference in the phase orbits between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Extended Data Fig. 3g). This was confirmed using the Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) fusion protein tagged with mNG, which confines analysis to a single cyclin–CDK complex36, together with NucCDK and CytCDK V2. The dynamics of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT)–mNG mimicked uncomplexed Cdc13 for both nuclear export and sensor readout profiles (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). The nuclear and cytoplasmic phase orbits were plotted on the same phase space, after normalization to minimum and maximum of sensor readouts (Fig. 4a). Notably, the nuclear phase orbit cycled around a much larger region of phase space than the cytoplasm. A high amount of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) accumulated in the nucleus before CDK activation to the high-activity mitotic state, with little increase in activity before that point. There was an approximately vertical line on the far right of the orbit at the point of CDK activation, consistent with an underlying bistable trigger. In the nucleus, once the system had reached the mitotic high CDK activity state, it was able to tolerate decreases in Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) without collapsing back to the low-activity state. By contrast, only a small amount of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) was needed in the cytoplasm for CDK activation, and a small decrease in Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) resulted in collapse out of the cytoplasmic mitotic state (Fig. 4a). Overall, the phase orbit in the cytoplasm was much narrower compared to the one in the nucleus. This suggests that CDK activity in the nucleus is much more stable with respect to cyclin–CDK fluctuations compared with CDK activity in the cytoplasm. The individual nuclear phase plots extended and shrunk significantly horizontally compared with the cytoplasm, also suggesting less sensitivity to cyclin–CDK concentrations (Fig. 4b).

Normalized to minimum and maximum values. f, Representative phase plot for the cytoplasm in the Cdc13–Cdc2AF–mNG background. Normalized to minimum and maximum values. Green dots represent individual time points, with distances separated by a time interval of 5 min.

Single-cell phase plots of the nucleus after normalization to minimum and maximum of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT)–mNG mean intensities indicated a considerable gap between the low-activity and high-activity states, and after nuclear export the system was not prone to collapse back to the low-activity state (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, the orbits were very similar in different single cells, suggesting the CDK regulatory system oscillates with robustness to biological noise. By contrast, the normalized cytoplasm phase plots showed that the gaps between the high-activity and low-activity states for the same Cdc13–Cdc2(WT)–mNG intensity were less pronounced, and the cytoplasm was more sensitive to Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) accumulation (Fig. 4d).

We repeated the experiments using Cdc13–Cdc2AF–mNG36. This tested whether CDK Y15 feedback loops are responsible for the stability in oscillations and for the distinction of the low and high CDK activity states in the nucleus and cytoplasm5. Nuclear export appeared less switch-like, suggesting that it is influenced by the altered CDK activity regulation (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). The sensors displayed a linear increase in sensor readout (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h), and the phase diagrams of both the nucleus and cytoplasm exhibited almost a complete collapse of their orbits, with approximately linear profiles (Fig. 4e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4i,j). Thus, the CDK Y15 feedback loops promote oscillations between different states in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the nucleus, when export occurs, the system is subsequently prone to collapse, indicating that in the Cdc13–Cdc2AF strain, translocation comes with the risk of the nucleus collapsing back to the interphase state (Fig. 4e). We conclude that the CDK Y15 feedback loops provide stable oscillations in the nucleus, facilitating translocation of cyclin–CDK from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and produce a weaker response in the cytoplasm. This is likely to reflect the underlying steady-state hysteretic responses that differ between the nucleus and cytoplasm5. Furthermore, our data suggest that at mitotic onset, the CDK Y15 feedback loops are major drivers in hysteresis and the increase in substrate phosphorylation, rather than phosphatase inactivation43.

Our results do not support the view that mitotic CDK activation is triggered first in the cytoplasm at the centrosome or SPB thereby dictating mitotic onset timing1,3,32. Therefore, we investigated the possible role of cyclin–CDK at the SPB at mitotic onset. In fission yeast, CDK activation at the SPB has been shown to act through a polo kinase (Plo1)-mediated feedback loop, dependent on Plo1 association with the SPB scaffold protein Cut12 (refs. 1,47,48,49,50) (Fig. 5a). The mutant cut12.s11 promotes earlier recruitment of Plo1 to the SPB and global Plo1 activation48,49, so we determined whether cut12.s11 advanced the timing of nuclear CDK activation (Fig. 5b). Cell length is a proxy for cell cycle position in fission yeast51. Length at nuclear CDK activation assayed using NucCDK (Fig. 5c, left) and cell length at cell division (Fig. 5c, right), were found to be the same in both cut12.s11 and wild-type cells. This indicates that promoting premature CDK activity at the SPB does not affect either nuclear CDK activation or the timing of cell division. This is in line with previous reports that promoting SPB feedback under a normal cell cycle context does not influence mitotic timing47.

The y axis of CytCDK sensor readout was scaled on the basis of minimum and maximum values for CytCDK in Cdc13 wild-type cells. h, Model of CDK activation. During interphase, cyclin B–CDK accumulates in the nucleus, and CDK activity increases gradually, with a high threshold for activation. In late G2, CDK activation occurs and is amplified by CDK-Y15-dependent feedback loops. Subsequently, cyclin B–CDK nuclear export (dependent on centrosomal cyclin B–CDK) and cyclin B degradation occur, and high CDK activity is maintained by CDK-Y15-dependent feedback loops. Thus, the nuclear CDK system undergoes stable oscillations with respect to cyclin B–CDK concentration. By contrast, in the cytoplasm, a lower threshold for activation enables cytoplasmic CDK to activate upon import of cyclin B–CDK from the nucleus. Degradation of cytoplasmic cyclin B results in an immediate drop in CDK activity. Therefore, the cytoplasmic CDK system oscillates in an unstable manner with respect to cyclin–CDK concentration.

We next investigated the role of cyclin–CDK localization at the SPB for mitotic control using the hydrophobic patch mutant of Cdc13 (Cdc13(HPM)), which does not localize to the SPB during G239 (Fig. 5d). This property is conserved with mammalian cyclin B1(HPM), which also does not localize to the centrosome39. Cells containing only Cdc13(HPM) do not display signs of mitotic entry, a phenotype partly rescued by tethering Cdc13(HPM) back to the SPB52. We performed timelapse microscopy of Cdc13(HPM)–sfGFP and wild-type Cdc13 (Cdc13(WT))–sfGFP using the CDK sensors (Methods) in a strain with other cyclins deleted. Cdc13(WT)–sfGFP displayed normal sensor readouts and Cdc13 dynamics (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). NucCDK in the Cdc13(HPM)–sfGFP mutant showed that activation in the nucleus still occurred, even though Cdc13(HPM)–sfGFP did not localize to the SPB (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). However, this nuclear CDK activation was not followed by a decrease in nuclear levels, indicating that export from the nucleus did not take place (Fig. 5f).

We repeated the timelapse experiments with Cdc13(HPM)–sfGFP and CytCDK and found that cytoplasmic CDK activation was also absent (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 5f). Therefore, although nuclear activation still occurs, cytoplasmic CDK activation is impaired, a probable consequence of Cdc13(HPM)–Cdc2(WT) not being exported from the nucleus.

We propose that Cdc13 localization to the SPB is not required for CDK activation in the nucleus, but is required for the translocation of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) to the cytoplasm and subsequent activation of cytoplasmic CDK. These results are consistent with previous phosphoproteomics data39, which showed phosphorylation of nuclear substrates with Cdc13(HPM) was similar to that with Cdc13(WT), whereas phosphorylation of SPB and cytoplasmic substrates was impaired. They also support the sequential ordering of nuclear activation and cytoplasmic activation, with Cdc13 SPB localization having an important role in bringing about this ordering of events.

Here we have revealed the underlying spatiotemporal regulatory framework in fission yeast that determines how CDK orchestrates the onset of mitosis in vivo (Fig. 5h), based on precise measurements of cyclin–CDK levels, the sensing of in vivo CDK activity and the generation of in vivo phase plots, to investigate the effects of cellular compartmentation in single unperturbed cells.

Our work has shown that CDK is first activated in the nucleus, thereby controlling the timing of mitotic onset. Promoting activity at the SPB had no effect on the timing of nuclear CDK activation or timing of cell division. However, in the absence of cyclin B–CDK localization to the SPB, CDK activation occurs only in the nucleus. This spatially uncouples the onset of mitosis, with the nucleus entering the mitotic state, whereas the cytoplasm remains in a G2-like state. We propose that this is owing to the absence of signal propagation brought about by nuclear export of cyclin B–CDK to the cytoplasm. This stresses the importance of signal propagation for spatially coherent mitotic onset, and supports the view that the SPB acts as a signalling hub, but as a signal-relaying hub rather than one that controls the timing of mitotic onset.

We also generated novel in vivo single-cell phase plots of CDK activity versus concentrations of cyclin B and of cyclin B–CDK complexes simultaneously in both nucleus and cytoplasm. These showed that the CDK oscillator operates in very different regulatory domains in the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the nucleus, there is a strong bistable or hysteretic response, which can buffer against fluctuations in cyclin B–CDK concentrations in both interphase and mitosis, resulting in stable oscillations of CDK activity. By contrast, the response in the cytoplasm is much weaker. The strong bistable response and higher cyclin B threshold for CDK activation in the nucleus reduces susceptibility to ‘noise' and to the risk of slipping in and out of mitosis, helping to maintain genomic stability5,29. This regulation could be owing to the higher concentrations of CDK regulators in the nucleus such as Wee1 and Cdc25 (refs. 7,35,46). By contrast, the less well stabilized CDK circuit and lower cyclin B threshold in the cytoplasm allows cytoplasmic CDK to respond rapidly to the translocation of cyclin B–CDK from the nucleus. Therefore, the cytoplasm may exist in a more fluid state, where the distinction between interphase and mitosis is reduced. The translocation of cyclin B–CDK links the different oscillatory orbits between the nucleus and cytoplasm, leading to coherent mitotic entry, with the nucleus enforcing control over the cytoplasm7. Theoretical modelling of the metazoan mitotic network7 has proposed differences between the nucleus and cytoplasm in bistable responses and cyclin B thresholds similar to those that have been shown here experimentally. Bistability is a common characteristic of biological signalling networks and cell transitions6,53,54, and we have shown that the responses can be very different between cellular compartments.

Modelling of the mammalian mitotic network has suggested that nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) creates a potential ‘stress' at mitotic entry55, owing to dispersion of cyclin B1–Cdk1 and Greatwall kinase, resulting in mitotic collapse—a collapse that is prevented by Cdk1 -Y15 feedback loops, which retain high CDK activity55. The nuclear export of cyclin B–CDK observed here in fission yeast can potentially lead to a similar stress in the nucleus. This is also prevented by CDK Y15 feedback loops which help to retain high CDK activity, ensuring that nuclear mitotic events such as chromosome condensation and mitotic spindle formation continue. By contrast, the cytoplasm is ill-suited for propagating CDK activity because of its weaker bistable response. We propose that the strong bistable response in the nucleus allows propagation of CDK activity from the nucleus to the cytoplasm without collapse of nuclear CDK activity. Although the fission yeast cyclin B–CDK(T14A/Y15F) (CDKAF) is viable, it exhibits sluggish mitotic progression and aberrant timing of mitotic entry, and generates a higher frequency of inviable cells36,42.

The fission yeast CDK regulatory framework can be expected to be relevant to other eukaryotes. The Xenopus extract studies proposing that the nucleus is the ‘pacemaker' for the cell cycle33,34 suggest that our observations are not simply due to differences between a closed versus open mitosis. In human cells, the mechanism behind cyclin B1 nuclear translocation before NEBD is thought to be due to either Cdk1 phosphorylation of transport machinery or through a spatial positive feedback mechanism based on cyclin B1 autophosphorylation whereby the nucleus promotes the translocation of cyclin B116,31. This translocation is thought to be important for triggering NEBD17. In fission yeast, the translocation of Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm could be functionally anagolous to translocation of cyclin B1–Cdk1 triggering NEBD. Therefore, although the precise mechanisms may lead to specific differences, the general concepts of the nucleus acting as the mitotic pacemaker and translocation being an important aspect for the onset of mitosis may be conserved16,33,34.

Why does the initial mitotic CDK activation and strong bistable or hysterisis response occur in the nucleus? A major vulnerability of the mitotic cell cycle is the risk of premature CDK activation and mitotic onset when DNA is incompletely replicated or has unrepaired damage56. Having the CDK regulatory system within the nucleus, positions the bistable circuit close to DNA, so incomplete DNA replication and DNA damage can be readily integrated with control of CDK activity57,58. Such a tight association between DNA and CDK activation would help to ensure genome integrity. It also enables genome content (ploidy) to be more easily monitored, which is necessary given that cell size at mitosis increases with ploidy42. Thus, DNA may serve as a platform for control of CDK activity and the initiation of mitotic entry42,57.

The principles we that have developed here will be a useful guide for future experiments in the more complex metazoan cells for investigating how CDK brings about cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the signalling network in the CDK oscillator system has been shown to have similar features to other biological oscillators, such as bistability and positive feedback loops59. Therefore, our work here should also be useful for understanding how other biological oscillators operate across space and time in vivo.

Sensors were expressed under the low expression constitutive calmodulin (cam1) promoter60. The sensors were tagged with either mNeonGreen or mScarletI61,62. NucCDK was derived from a minimal budding yeast CDK-dependent transport module, which was shown to be exported out of the nucleus after phosphorylation by Cdc28 (budding yeast Cdk1)63 (Fig. 1c). This sensor functions similarly to a CDK2 translocation-based sensor, based on a fragment of human DNA helicase B fragment (DHB), which translocates to the cytoplasm upon CDK2 phosphorylation64. The MCM2-3 sensor module displayed a readout patten that increased at S phase, similar to that of early CDK substrates, consistent with observations in budding yeast11,63 (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Although this version of the sensor is useful for the G1/S transition given its high sensitivity to CDK activity65, we aimed to reduce its sensitivity so that it can be used to read out activity at G2/M. The module contains a full CDK consensus site beginning with a serine, next to the Mcm3 NLS. Mutation of this residue to alanine (MCM2-3 Ala) reduced the readout of the sensor and rendered it prominently nuclear, albeit with a modest increase after stoppage of cell elongation (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Therefore, we hypothesized that mutating this serine to a threonine could alter the sensitivity of the sensor as it has been shown that CDK has a greater specificity towards serine residues than threonine residues, and, furthermore, that threonines are preferentially dephosphorylated by PP2A66,67. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e, this mutation markedly altered the profile of the sensor, and gave a readout of CDK activity throughout the cell cycle. We refer to this sensor as NucCDK. The profile was very similar to a recent CDK Forster resonance energy transfer sensor tagged with a NLS, developed in fission yeast, indicating that NucCDK is biased towards sensing nuclear CDK activity68. We did not notice a significant difference in the pattern when using a nuclear mask for determining the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio in mean intensities, as opposed to using the mean of top 15% of pixels and bottom 85% of pixels as estimates for nuclear and cytoplasmic mean intensities, respectively, as has been previously used in fission yeast46 (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Unless stated that a nuclear mask was used, the top 15% and bottom 85% method was used for sensor readout measurements.

Syncut3 (CytCDK) translocation into the nucleus is dependent on phosphorylation of T19 by CDK42. CytCDK V2 was developed in a similar manner to NucCDK except T19 was mutated to a serine, for increased sensitivity to CDK activity.

The timecourse analysed for Fig. 1a was from the Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) fusion experiment in which Cig1, Cig2 and Puc1 had been deleted (∆CCP), and cells grown in EMM4S + SILAC (stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture) medium at 32 °C (ref. 11). Localization annotation for CDK sites was implemented as previously described39. In brief, the order of determining the localization of a protein by priority based on existing literature was as follows: (1) direct visualization of fluorescently tagged proteins labelled at the endogenous locus; (2) fluorescently tagged proteins from exogenous nmt41 or nmt81 promoters; (3) indirect methods suchs as chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, fractionated western blotting and immunoprecipation experiments. Only sites annotated as being late sites as well as belonging to solely one spatial compartment were used for analysis.

Strains were grown, and cell cultures and media were prepared as described69. Strains were constructed either by transformation or genetic crossing, as described69. All experiments were done in exponentially growing cells at 2.5–4.0 × 106 cells per ml. Insertions were checked with colony PCR and sequencing in the case of deletions. All strains and plasmids used are listed in Supplementary Table 1. EMM powder (MP Biomedicals) with ammonium chloride and dextrose was used, supplemented with adenine at final concentrations of 0.15 g l−1 where required. Where yeast extract with adenine, leucine, histidine and uridine (YE4S) was used, supplements were added at 0.15 g l−1 final concentrations. The Cdc13 strain internally tagged with sfGFP is described in ref. 70.

Except for some data in Figs. 2 and 4, microscopy was done on 1% agarose pads, using GeneFrames, to prevent drying of pad during acquisition71 (125 μl, Thermofisher AB-0578). N-propyl gallate (Sigma, 02370) was added to the agarose pads at 0.1 mM final concentration to prevent photobleaching72.

A 1-ml culture of cells was spun down once at 2,000 rpm (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5424) for 30 s, to minimize stress. Approximately 50 μl of supernatant was left and mixed. Two microlitres of cell culture was spread across an agarose pad and left to dry for a few minutes. A coverslip (Epredia, 22 × 32 mm, no. 1.5) was placed onto the pad, but only pressure along the gene frame was applied to seal up the frame. Nail polish was added along the frame to ensure that the coverslip and frame were sealed.

Imaging was done on a Nikon Ti2 inverted microscope equipped with a perfect focus system (PFS), an Okolab environmental chamber, and a Prime BSI sCMOS camera (Photometrics). A Nikon 100x Plan Apo oil immersion lens with a NA of 1.45 was used for imaging. Image acquisition was controlled using µManager V2.0 software73. 2 × 2 pixel binning was done to improve fluorescence signal detection with a resulting pixel size of 130 nm × 130 nm. Unless stated otherwise, imaging was done at 25°. Except for data shown in Extended Data Fig. 2a, where 5 z-slices were collected, 7 slices were collected with 0.5-μm step sizes. Fluorescence excitation was done using a SpectraX LED light engine (Lumencor). Imaging for mNG-tagged proteins was done with the YFP channel (both in excitation and emission) to minimize the influence of cell autofluorescence74. We did not notice any issues with growth or cell length at division under the imaging conditions used.

Cells contained a copy of Cdc13WT or Cdc13HPM expressed under the native Cdc13 promoter and a second copy of Cdc13WT, expressed under the thiamine-repressible nmt41 promoter39. Cells were initially grown in EMM without thiamine but for experiments, cells were washed once in EMM + thiamine and placed on a 1% EMM + thiamine agarose pad. Thiamine was added to EMM at a final concentration of 30 μM. Only cells that were born around the beginning of acquisition and blocked at the end of acquisition were considered for analysis. The total acquisition was 80 time points with time intervals of 10 min, for around 13 h in total in acquisition.

Unless otherwise stated, all analysis was done using custom scripts written in Matlab R2022a.

For processing and analysis of fluorescence z-stacks, maximum intensity projections were used using Fiji75. Cells were segmented using a custom algorithm as described52. Nuclear masks were obtained with Fiji, using MCM2-3 Ala to identify the nucleus. Cells were tracked using LineageMapper76. With the exception of cases where mutants that block cells in G2 were used, only cells that were born and that divided within the timelapse acquisition period were used for analysis.

For histograms, the left edges of bins are inclusive, while the right edges are not inclusive except for the last bin. Bin widths were set to the time interval used for image acquisition, with the exception of Fig. 3e. Violin plots display distributions as kernel density estimates. The median value is plotted as a white circle. The black rectangle represents the IQR, and the black solid line represents 1.5× IQR.

For Extended Data Fig. 2a, the time delay between the lines in the rapid rise of the NucCDK and CytCDK readouts were measured at the point of nuclear CDK activation, indicated by a change in the rate of increase of the sensor readout, and around 75% of the activation peak.

For all other figures, points representing CDK activation were identified using an automated rate change analysis algorithm. Sensor traces were lightly smoothed using the Matlab function, smoothdata and the algorithm sgolay to assist in identifying change points. However, plots in figures represent the raw data. To confine analysis to the period in G2 where the rate change in sensor readout occurs, the trace was cropped to 10–15 time points before the maximum peak in sensor readout, up to the maximum peak. The abrupt changes in sensor readout were identified using a change point algorithm77,78 in Matlab called findchangepts, where abrupt changes in the slope were identified using the specifier ‘linear'. A similar process was followed to identify points of stoppage of cell elongation.

For the phosphoproteomics analysis to determine statistical significance of nuclear substrate phosphorylation compared to the other compartments, the rate change analysis was similarly performed on individual sites.

We used an analogue-sensitive sensitive version of Cdc2, Cdc2as, that renders it susceptible to inhibition by the ATP analogue 1-NmPP179, to determine how quickly the sensors respond to changes in CDK activity. Experiments were performed on soybean lectin-coated MatTec dishes in YE4S medium at 32 °C, with 3-min intervals42. Cells were blocked in G2 for 3 h using 1 μM 1-NmPP1 and released following 3× washes using YE4S medium. Subsequently, either 10 μM 1-NmPP1 was added to the dish to inhibit CDK activity or DMSO (control) was added. The mean decay curves were fitted using either a two-exponential model (NucCDK) or a one-exponential model (CytCDK) to determine the half-lives of decay.

Dose–response curves of NucCDK and CytCDK/CytCDK V2 to CDK inhibition were done similarly as described11,42. We used the Cdc13–Cdc2AFAs strain to remove potential non-linear responses in phosphorylation of the sensors due to CDKY 15 feedback loop activation. Cells were blocked at 32 °C in YE4S for 1.5 generations. They were washed (3×) and released into release medium containing varying concentrations of 1-NmPP1. Image acquisition was done after 12 min from the first wash on microscope slides.

The mNG tag was used at the C terminus of the Cdc13–Cdc2(WT) fusion, as it has better photophysical properties compared with sfGFP and allowed use of the YFP channel, which is less affected by cellular autofluorescence61,74. Experiments for Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 4 were done using the CellASIC ONIX V1 microfluidics platform with Y04C microfluidics plates (Merck) at 32 °C in YE4S, as they are the optimal conditions used for Cdc13–Cdc2AF80. All 4 experimental conditions—Cdc13–Cdc2(WT)–mNG + (NucCDK–mScarletI or CytCDK V2–mScarletI) and Cdc13–Cdc2AF–mNG + (NucCDK–mScarletI or CytCDK V2–mScarletI)—were done on the same plate using a flow rate of 2.5 pound per square inch (psi). Fifty microlitres of culture at an optical density of 0.2–0.3 was added to plate. Images were acquired every 5 min.

Phase plots shown in figures were plotted after lightly smoothing the raw data using the matlab function smoothdata with the algorithm sgolay to reduce noise and improve the quality of the phase plots.

Mantle upwellings drive large-scale surface volcanism and facilitate continental breakup and ocean basin formation. However, the spatial characteristics and internal composition of these upwellings alongside how they are modified by plate tectonics are poorly resolved. Afar, East Africa, is a classic triple junction comprising three rifts at various stages of evolution thought to be underlain by a mantle upwelling or plume, allowing examination of the controls on the mantle upwelling. Here we present geochemical data from >130 samples of ‘young' volcanoes spanning the rifts defining the triple junction to show that the underlying mantle comprises a single, asymmetric upwelling. Using statistical modelling to integrate our data with existing geochemical and geophysical constraints, we suggest that Afar is fed by a spatially and chemically heterogeneous upwelling, which controls the composition and relative abundance of melt in all three rift arms. We identify repetitive signatures in mantle compositions in rift regions, whose variability is a longer wavelength in faster-extending rift arms. This suggests more rapid channelized mantle flow occurs where rifting rates are higher and the plate is thinner, aiding flow of the upwelling towards the faster-spreading Red Sea Rift. Our findings demonstrate how the evolution of mantle upwellings is influenced by the dynamics of overriding plates.

The role of mantle upwellings, sometimes interpreted as mantle plumes, in driving volcanism during continental breakup has long been debated (for example, refs. 1,2,3,4). Moreover, our understanding of rift–plume interactions remains incomplete because only a small fraction of Earth's upwellings are situated under continents5, and there are a limited number of upwellings associated with ongoing continental rifting6. The Afar triple junction—where the Arabian, Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates intersect—is a ‘classic' example of magma-assisted continental rifting. Here rifting occurred diachronously with the onset of the Gulf of Aden Rift (GoA) at ~35 million years ago (Ma) (ref. 7), the Red Sea Rift (RSR) at ~23 Ma (ref. 8) and the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) at ~11 Ma (ref. 9). Both intraplate stresses tied to the slab pull effect of Neo-Tethys subduction10 and thermal weakening by a mantle upwelling are thought to have driven rifting11. The diachronous onset has led to each rift (GoA, RSR and MER) being in a different phase of maturity (ocean formation, proto-oceanic formation and mature continental rifting, respectively), and all three rifts are currently volcanically and tectonically active12, making it an ideal location to study the interactions between mantle upwelling and rifting and how these coevolve.

The driver of melt production in Afar is debated, with some models suggesting decompression melting with minimal plume involvement13, whereas others propose the upwelling of hot, deep mantle14,15,16,17 or, indeed, multiple upwellings18,19. While several discrete segments of the RSR have been studied in terms of magma petrogenesis (for example, refs. 16,20), a paucity of high-precision geochemical data has hampered evaluation of the spatial characteristics of upwelling across the broader region and rigorous testing of existing models of the links between tectonics and upwellings.

In this Article, we implement a comprehensive sampling strategy, targeting evolutionarily young volcanoes spanning the three rifts (Fig. 1). We analyse rocks that are Quaternary in age (less than 2.58 Myr old) and from volcanoes that have been active during the Holocene, which began 11.7 thousand years ago21. By targeting younger rocks, we make a direct comparison with geophysical data across the region, enabling an integrated exploration of mantle petrogenesis and dynamics. Our approach utilizes statistical methods, including semi-parametric regression using splines and K-means cluster analysis to integrate and analyse these geophysical and geochemical data to explore models of upwelling that can explain our data.

Source data

Mantle upwellings that originate between depths of 1,000 and 2,800 km are anomalously hot zones and/or zones of an enriched composition that reduce the solidus temperature of the mantle, enabling increased partial melting22. Mantle upwellings are widely accepted to contain a variety of domains of differing proportions (for example, high μ (HIMU, U/Pb), enriched mantle I (EMI), enriched mantle II (EMII), common component (C) and Focus Zone (FOZO) (for example, refs. 5,22,23,24,25)). Such domains typically exhibit an isotopically distinct and enriched composition (generally low 87Sr/86Sr, high 143Nd/144Nd and high 206Pb/204Pb24) relative to those of bulk silicate Earth (BSE)5. Trace-element ratios such as Ce/Pb and ∆Nb have previously been used to indicate enriched upwellings (>30 (ref. 26), >0 (ref. 27), respectively) and La/Sm to suggest the melt fraction relative to the study region, with a lower-than-average value suggesting an elevated melt fraction19. Mantle upwellings are also commonly associated with reduced (lower) seismic velocities (that is, shear-wave velocity (vs) and P-wave velocity)28,29. These reduced seismic velocities are caused by elevated temperatures and/or the presence of fluids and partial melt30.

Crustal assimilation, where crust components are incorporated into the magma, can obscure these geochemical indicators of a deep mantle plume. However, within the Afar region, crustal contamination has played a relatively minor role in recent magmatism14 compared with earlier stages of rifting14,26 due to the thinning of the present-day crust and because it has been extensively intruded by mafic melts along the length of the rift axes. Seismicity analysis indicates that recent magmatic activity beneath the rift axes in Afar is transient31 and, in turn, that magmas are unlikely to reside in crustal reservoirs long enough to extensively assimilate crustal lithologies. Nevertheless, we investigate this issue further in our analysis (‘Probing the presence of mantle upwelling(s) in Afar').

Our study includes over 130 rock samples, with many from previously unstudied volcanoes, roughly doubling the number of high-quality analyses from the area (Fig. 1). The 79 Afar samples included in our study were carefully selected from a repository covering the broader Afar region (details in Methods). These were supplemented by 52 additional samples collected during fieldwork in the MER. To examine spatial trends in the geochemistry of surface volcanism, we analysed all samples for major and trace elements alongside radiogenic isotopes (Sr, Nd, Pb; Methods). We also integrated existing data for 93 rock samples from the open-source GEOROC data repository32 (https://georoc.eu/; see Methods for selection criteria), as well as the classic GoA catalogue from ref. 19. In addition, we leveraged recent spatial compilations of geophysical variables, such as the depth of the Mohorovičić discontinuity (Moho)31 (Methods) and vs at regularly spaced depths (40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 km (ref. 30)) across the region. These variables provide well-established proxies for the boundary between the crust and mantle and for the presence and abundance of melt within the lithosphere and asthenosphere30. Collectively, this information allows us to infer details about the depth, compositional characteristics and relative abundance of partial melts distributed across all three rifts.

On the basis of these samples, we infer wide geochemical variability across the study region (Fig. 1). The ∆Nb ranges from −0.26 to 0.94 and the La/Sm ratio ranges from 0.4 to 4.6. The radiogenic isotopes 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb, 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd also display a large range (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1), with enrichments relative to BSE occurring in all three rifts. Local variability in these radiogenic isotopes is observed within some volcanoes, for example, Boset–Bericha; however, this variability is smaller than the regional range determined for Afar (Fig. 1).

a, 206Pb/204Pb versus 208Pb/204Pb. b, 143Nd/144Nd versus 87Sr/86Sr. Samples are classified by their rift position, indicated by their symbol colour and shape (RSR, blue circles; MER, green squares; GoA, yellow diamonds). Error bars show the uncertainty associated. Black error bars are the average uncertainty of the dataset; grey are the maximum uncertainty. Uncertainties for data points in a are smaller than the symbols. The global mantle endmember compositions (including depleted mid-ocean-ridge-basalt mantle (DMM) and prevalent mantle (PREMA)) are shown as fields behind from refs. 5,49. The histograms show the distribution of all data analysed in our study, including our >130 data points.

Across the study region, the depth of the Moho varies, being shallowest in the RSR (~16 km) and deepest in the MER (31 km). Like the geochemical data, the Vs at 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 km depths shows regional variability: 3.81–4.05, 4.06–4.17, 4.00–4.15, 3.97–4.10 and 4.02–4.10, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1). All rifts show zones of high and low Vs (relative to ref. 30) in the mantle that vary laterally and in depth.

To evaluate the potential influence of crustal assimilation—which again is considered minor in the Afar region14—on mantle composition and upwelling, we assess the correlation between key geochemical and geophysical indicators (see Fig. 4a) and the depth to the Moho. The Moho, the boundary between the crust and mantle, serves as a proxy for crustal thickness, which is widely thought to influence the degree of assimilation26 (Methods). We found that most indicators, including Pb isotopes—a reliable indicator of crustal assimilation33—exhibit only a weak, but statistically significant, correlation with Moho depth (see Fig. 4a). Further, Ce/Pb exhibits a strong negative correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient of −0.7), indicating that where the crust is thin, the Ce/Pb values are high, and vice versa. This trend can be attributed to minimal crustal assimilation across most of the Afar region, although the degree of assimilation increases as the crust thickens within the MER.

Overall, our dataset shows geochemical and geophysical variability across the study area. The observed variations are consistent with the presence of an upwelling across all three rifts. The spatial trends observed in all variables implicate an underlying complexity to the location of partial melts.

We used our data to test multiple conceptual models of mantle upwelling dynamics. The initial conceptual model we considered is a simple, homogeneous mantle upwelling at the triple junction (for example, ref. 19). This model expects variables (geochemical and geophysical) that indicate deep upwelling to change radially with distance from the upwelling centre (C1C—one centre, circular, concentric; Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 2). Therefore, this model assumes that variables change linearly from the upwelling centre due to lateral spreading. Extending this model, we then allow the upwelling to be spatially and temporally heterogeneous, as reported for the Hawaiian34 and Canary Island35 volcanoes. This mechanism yields a similar pattern to the linear C1C model but accommodates compositional fluctuations over the radial distance corresponding to a chemically pulsed upwelling (Fig. 3). This model fits a single spline per parameter for all data against distance from the upwelling centre (spline C1C). The optimum spline allows for regional variations to be accounted for while minimizing noise (optimal smoothing). This approach of both linear and spline fits is applied to all further models described in this section, allowing for homogeneous and heterogeneous upwelling(s), respectively. Note the starting composition of the upwelling is not constrained within the model parameters.

The upwelling scenarios for Afar tested in this study. The diagrams (left) are labelled with the code associated with each model (see Extended Data Table 2 and the ‘Statistical models considered' section within Methods for further details). The locations of the purported mantle upwellings are shown by the star symbol. The number of lines shown on the schematic graphs equals the number of models that must be fitted for that model variant (linear, dashed; spline, continuous). Note that each model variant has been illustrated with an indicator that decreases with a reduction in upwelling proportion. R, rift; U, upwelling.

We additionally tested whether the spatial geochemical and geophysical variations observed (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1) are best explained through the presence of three small-scale upwellings, which have been proposed on the basis of geophysics and numerical models (for example, ref. 36, C3C—three centres, circular, concentric; Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 1). We tested this model using three upwellings: one centred on the triple junction, one in the northern RSR and one in the southern MER, with the positions of these loci informed by previous models and observations (Methods). This model fits one linear/spline regression per variable (against distance) from the nearest upwelling centre and assumes that the upwellings are compositionally identical and from the same deep source.

It is plausible that the variable tectonic regime (for example, extension rate, crustal thickness) between the three rifts12 introduces further complexity to the geochemical and geophysical signals. Accordingly, we introduce three further models, C1D, C3D and C3X (Fig. 3, Extended Data Table 2 and Methods) to account for these regional differences. Models C1D (one centre, different spreading) and C3D (three centres, different spreading) consider one upwelling and three small-scale upwellings, respectively, while allowing for distinct distance-dependent patterns for each rift, thereby modelling the distribution of variables across each rift independently. Unlike the other models, C3X (three independent centres, different spreading) allows each small-scale upwelling to have a distinct signature, as well as permitting an independent distribution along each rift (Methods).

To test these models (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 2), we identify 14 key geochemical and geophysical variables (for descriptions, see Extended Data Table 2) and calculate the distance, using the spherical cosine law (Methods), between the purported upwelling centre15,19,37 and each observation site (Methods). We then apply two-deep cross-validation (100 iterations) to find the optimum linear fit (representing a homogeneous upwelling) and penalized B-spline fit (representing a heterogeneous upwelling) to each of the variables, using all data points, over a radial distance of 500 km—the radial limit of samples considered within our study (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 2). The predictive performance of each fit is then assessed by calculating the mean standardized root-mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP), where a value of 1 indicates a lack of predictive capability, and 0 indicates a perfect predictive ability (Fig. 4c).

Red squares indicate where the correlation is significant (P ≤ 0.05), and blue squares indicate that the correlations are not deemed significant (P > 0.05). b, Splines (a smooth, flexible polynomial curve) of the best overall model—that is, C1C—for selected variables. Symbols show the data within the study (locations denoted by symbols shown); 95% confidence intervals are indicated by the shaded background. The numbers of data observations (n) for La/Sm, 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb and vs at 100 km depth are 269, 218, 185 and 184, respectively. Uncertainties in data values are shown by error bars (average in black, maximum in grey). c, The mean standardized RMSEP for each of the models tested. Individual linear model results are shown by red squares, and the mean of those results is displayed by the dashed red line. Individual spline results are shown by blue circles, and the mean of those results is shown by a blue line. All models were run for 100 iterations to capture the probable uncertainty distribution, as shown by the data points. Mean (red and blue dotted lines) and 95% confidence interval (shaded) of results using perturbed data (within the uncertainty of each data point) are also shown (300 perturbation runs each using 100 iterations).

For all models, we observe the B-spline fit (a class of polynomial function; Methods) to have the best predictive performance, compared with a linear fit (Fig. 4c). This indicates that a compositionally heterogeneous upwelling in Afar is most probable (Fig. 4b,c).

The analysis indicates that the overall best predictive model is the B-spline fit of model C1D, wherein a single, heterogeneous mantle upwelling is present, albeit with differing distributions of geochemical and geophysical variables between rift arms (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 2). This model yields a mean standardized RMSEP of 0.59 (Fig. 4c), lower than that of the other models. To further validate our results, we carried out sensitivity analysis, varying the geochemical and geophysical data about their known uncertainties (Methods). The results confirm that model C1D remains the most accurate predictive model (see shaded areas in Fig. 4c).

While the RSR and MER have a high sample density, there is limited sample availability from the GoA due to poor access. When excluding the GoA from our analyses, the overall trend between the models remains effectively the same (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Although the three rifts share a single, compositionally heterogeneous upwelling, they appear to behave independently, implying that some feature of their tectonic regime modulates the observed signals.

Many of the optimum splines for each rift display distance-dependent sinusoidal patterns (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 2). Importantly, our analysis indicates that the variability observed for some variables within the MER exhibits greater amplitude and shorter periodicity with distance from the centre of the upwelling compared with those of the RSR (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 2). Further, the observed variation in Pb isotopes within the RSR suggests that the upwelling may be chemically heterogeneous for some elements, whereas others show a narrower range in composition (for example, 87Sr/86Sr is more heterogeneous than 143Nd/144Nd; Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). Although ∆Nb values are almost consistently positive (>0) across the region (except around Boset–Bericha Volcano), we identify small-scale differences in La/Sm and vs at 100 km depth, within the likely melt-rich zone of the asthenosphere26, with distance to upwelling centre in each rift (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 2). These small-scale differences indicate locally variable degrees of melting across the study region, agreeing with previous studies that reported low-velocity areas (for example, refs. 36,38). This raises the question of whether the zones of locally higher melt fraction, low vs and variable geochemistry observed in one rift correspond, spatially and compositionally, to those observed in the other two rifts. If so, this could indicate a shared melt source.

To address the spatial heterogeneity patterns observed and investigate the potential shared melt source, we carried out principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means cluster analysis using all variables post-standardization (Methods). Across all variables, the K-means cluster analysis algorithm seeks to group similar observations while minimizing the within-cluster total sum of squares for a pre-specified number of clusters. Our K-means cluster analysis shows a higher number of clusters that are smaller in geographic size for the MER (50–100 km length scale; four clusters) compared with the RSR (150–200 km length scale; three clusters) (Fig. 5 and Methods). Several clusters (clusters 1–3) are found to co-exist in different rift arms. For example, samples assigned to cluster 3 are observed in the distal section of the RSR, as well as in locations closer to the MER rift centre (Fig. 5). The three clusters (1–3) observed across the RSR match the initial ~200 km clustering sequence observed across the MER. This sequential repeated clustering may indicate that they are derived from a shared source melt. However, the sequence of these melts—as indicated by clusters—within the MER occurs over a shorter distance compared with that of the RSR.

a, Segments are shown in blue from north to south: Erta Ale Volcanic Segment (EAVS), Tat'Ale Volcanic Segment (TAVS), Alayta Volcanic Segment (AVS), Dabbahu Volcanic Segment (DVS), Gabillema Volcanic Segment (GVS), Adda'do Magmatic Segment (AMS), Fentale-Dofen Magmatic Segment (FDMS), Boset Magmatic Segment (BMS), Aluto-Gedemsa Magmatic Segment (AGMS) and Corbetti Magmatic Segment (CMS). Rift axis (dotted line) is shown. b,c, Enlarged maps of the boxes shown in a. d,e, PCA bi-plot (principal component 1 versus principal component 2) when considering the six isotopic systems (Extended Data Table 3) showing the samples and their component scores relative to those of the mantle endmembers. Values used for the mantle endmembers—Pan-African Lithosphere, EMI, EMII, DMM and HIMU—are shown in Extended Data Table 3. The topography shown is from the 1 arcsec (∼30 m resolution) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model48.

The spatial distribution of clusters reflects spatial variations in the composition and abundance of melt, which share some cursory similarities to the magmatic segments observed at the surface (Fig. 5). However, when inspecting in detail, we observe clear differences. For example, volcanic systems within both magmatic segments and the adjacent rift flanks are commonly allocated to single clusters, and the boundaries between clusters and known magmatic segments are typically mismatched (Fig. 5). In Afar, the length of the region containing clusters is longer than that of magmatic segments. We therefore infer that the compositional variability of mantle upwelling is unlikely to be related to the along-axis segmentation of crustal subvolcanic plumbing systems.

Taken together, our data can be explained through a single upwelling model with internal heterogeneity between rifts (for example, refs. 31,34,39,40), as shown by the spline model. Crucially, the K-means cluster analysis indicates the signatures of geochemical variability (clusters) are repeated across rifts, implicating pulses of upwelling from the same source, as inferred for other mantle plumes (for example, refs. 35,39,40). Rifts act as natural channels for upwelling melt from deeper mantle sources41. Considering the high extension rate in the RSR (10.5–19.5 mm yr–1 (ref. 42)) compared with that of the MER (∼5.2 mm yr–1 (ref. 42)), it is plausible that a mantle flow rate is impeded by the narrowing of the rift in the MER. This process would lead to a ‘bottleneck' effect41,43,44, which in turn may result in a different length scale of mantle heterogeneity (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2) between the RSR and MER (Fig. 5). Further, a contrast in crustal thickness is evident between the rifts, with the MER crust being thicker (25–33 km (ref. 45)) than that of RSR (16–25 km (ref. 46); Extended Data Fig. 1). Assuming a correlation between crustal and overall plate thickness, this effect is expected to introduce differences in mantle flow rate along each rift in Afar. A progressive thickening of the overlying lithosphere away from the upwelling centre in the MER should reduce the volume capacity for melt, impeding mantle flow. Consequently, the heterogeneous nature of the pulsed upwelling would exhibit a more condensed spatial pattern within the MER compared with RSR, as we observe (Fig. 5).

We conclude that variations in melt composition and abundance in and around Afar are best explained by a heterogeneous pulsing mantle upwelling that is not symmetrical (Fig. 5) but is instead shaped by both variable lithospheric thinning and extension rates within each rift (Fig. 6). While this model investigates principally the likelihood of a singular or three small-scale upwelling scenarios, our results demonstrate that for either option, a single heterogeneous upwelling provides the best match to observations in the region. The detected variations in melt composition and abundance between the MER and RSR imply that the length scale of heterogeneities within magma-assisted rifting environments may be controlled not only by the upwelling itself, but also by the extension rate and plate thickness. If this model is correct, it demonstrates that the evolution of a mantle upwelling can be influenced and shaped by the dynamics of the overriding plates.

All samples and previously published data used in this study must originate from a volcano that has been active within the Holocene21 (Fig. 1), with the sample estimated to be of Quaternary age (<2.58 Ma). An essential criterion was that all samples have a precisely known location with accurate coordinates.

Previously published geochemical data were obtained from GEOROC19,32. Once downloaded, the data files were filtered to include only data within Ethiopia (including the MER and Afar). These data were further filtered using the following criteria:

The values for the sample must relate to whole-rock geochemistry as opposed to mineral separates.

The individual sample must have major-element, trace-element, 87Sr/86Sr, 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb isotope values available.

The coordinates must be specific to the individual sample's location rather than providing an average coordinate for a broader study area.

Ninety-three lavas, 11 welded tuffs and one pumice sample, from various volcanoes in Afar (Erta Ale Volcanic Segment, Ayelu, Abida, Yangudi, Dama Ali, Kerub, Ela, Didoli, Abbahu, Afdera, Tat Ali and Manda Hararo), were selected for geochemical analysis50,51,52. The samples were collected during the CNR/CNRS projects in Afar during the 1960s53 and stored in the Afar Repository at the University of Pisa, Italy (http://repositories.dst.unipi.it/index.php/home-afar). A further 52 samples from the Boset–Bericha Volcanic Complex (BBVC) were collected during three field seasons54, in November 2012, April–May 201555 and February 201756.

Sample preparation, for major, trace and isotope analyses, was carried out at the University of Southampton. Samples were cut with a saw to remove any weathered sections, and cut surfaces were ground down to reduce any potential contamination by metals from the saw blade. Rock samples were then crushed using a fly press and placed in double-layered plastic bags before crushing to minimize metal contamination during the crushing process.

The crushed material was separated into three size fractions (>1 mm, 0.5–1 mm, <0.5 mm) using Teflon sieves, retaining the middle fraction (0.5–1 mm) for analysis. The selected fraction was cleaned by ultrasonicating in Milli-Q water then dried overnight in an oven at 85 °C. The cleaned rock chips were then hand-picked under a microscope to remove any extraneous (non-rock) material. An aliquot of cleaned chips was used for Pb isotope analysis. For major-element, trace-element, 143Nd/144Nd and 87Sr/86Sr isotope analysis, the remaining rock chips were ground to a fine powder using an agate mortar and pestle, again to minimize contamination with metals.

Samples were prepared for whole-rock trace-element analysis using 0.05 g (for BBVC samples) or 0.075 g (for all other samples) powdered sample. The powdered samples were digested in sealed Savillex Teflon vials with 15 drops concentrated HNO3 and 2 ml HF on a hotplate at 130 °C for 24 h (for all samples excluding those from the BBVC) or with 50 drops HF and 0.2 ml HNO3 on a hotplate at 130 °C for 24 h (for BBVC samples only). The HNO3/HF was evaporated off, and the samples were refluxed in 6 M HCl for another 24 h on a hotplate at 130 °C. The 6 M HCl was evaporated off, and the samples were redissolved in 6 M HCl. Mother solutions were prepared by adding 6 M HCl and Milli-Q water (total 30 ml) to the dissolved samples. Daughter solutions were prepared using 0.5 ml of mother solution, diluted to 5 ml with 3% HNO3 (containing the internal standards 5 ppb In/5 ppb Re/20 ppb Be), resulting in an overall dilution factor of ~4,000.

Trace-element analyses of the daughter samples were undertaken on the Thermo Scientific X Series 2 quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) at the University of Southampton. Samples and standards were spiked with internal standard elements and corrected for interferences and the blank and then calibrated using a suite of international rock standards. Accuracy was monitored using reference materials JA-2, BCR-2 and JB-2 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

For Pb isotope analysis, 0.3 g of cleaned, picked rock chips (0.5–1.0 mm) were weighed into Pb Savillex Teflon vials and leached on a hotplate with 4 ml 6 M HCl for 1 h (15 min for obsidian and pumice samples, to avoid full dissolution of the sample). Samples were rinsed several times in Milli-Q water then 0.5 ml concentrated HNO3 before adding 3–4 ml of concentrated HF. Samples were digested, following the same procedure as for trace elements, and refluxed on a hotplate at 130 °C for 24 h, before being evaporated to dryness. Then 0.5 ml concentrated HCl was added, and the sample was evaporated to dryness. Then 0.5 ml concentrated HNO3 was added and again evaporated to dryness. The final residue was reconstituted in 0.5 ml HBr and refluxed for 1 h. The samples were cooled and centrifuged for 5 min. Pb was isolated using a single-stage HCl anion-exchange chromatographic resin separation method57, with AGX-1×8, 200–400 mesh resin. Following this, the Pb isolate was dried down, redissolved in HNO3 and analysed using the double-spike method of ref. 58. The samples were subsequently analysed on a Thermo Scientific Neptune multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at the University of Southampton (UK), achieving an NBS SRM 981 reproducibility of 206Pb/204Pb = 16.9404 ± 24 (142 ppm), 207Pb/204Pb = 15.4969 ± 26 (168 ppm), 208Pb/204Pb = 36.7149 ± 66 (180 ppm) (2 s.d.; n = 44). Pb isotope measurements of the standard are within error of the accepted values (206Pb/204Pb = 16.9412, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.4988, 208Pb/204Pb = 36.7233). Accuracy was 47 ppm for 206Pb/204Pb, 123 ppm for 207Pb/204Pb and 174 ppm for 208Pb/204Pb.

For Sr and Nd analysis, the remaining mother solutions from the preparation of trace-element solutions (see the preceding) were used for all samples except those of the BBVC. An aliquot of each mother solution was used to give a volume of liquid containing at least 1 μg Sr and 200 ng Nd and evaporated to dryness in Savillex Teflon vials on a hotplate at 130 °C. Sample residues were reconstituted in 200 μl 1.75 M HCl. For the BBVC samples, rock chips were leached in 4 ml 6 M HCl for 30 min in Savillex Teflon vials (obsidian samples for only 15 min to avoid full dissolution of the sample). The samples were then rinsed with Milli-Q water and HNO3, and then the same digestion procedure as for the preceding trace-element analysis was followed. The final mother solutions were prepared using HCl and Milli-Q water to 30 ml for felsic samples and 20 ml for mafic samples.

All samples were then passed through ion-exchange column chemistry using an AG50-X8 200–400 mesh resin cation column to separate the Sr and Nd fractions. The sample fractions were subsequently evaporated to dryness, ready for further column chemistry.

Sr was further isolated through Sr-spec resin columns following the methodology of ref. 59. Samples were then evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 1.5 ml 1 M HCl and loaded onto outgassed tantalum filaments with 1 μl of Ta-activator. Sr isotopic analysis was performed on a thermal ionization mass spectrometer Thermo Scientific Triton Plus at the University of Southampton. Reference material SRM NIST987 (87Sr/86Sr = 0.710258; GeoREM) was used to monitor accuracy and gave average 87Sr/86Sr values of 0.710243. All samples were normalized to NBS SRM-987 87Sr/86Sr = 0.710248 (ref. 60), while reproducibility was ±0.000020 (28.2 ppm, 2 s.d.; n = 464). Accuracy was 21 ppm.

The Nd aliquot from the cation column was followed by an Ln-spec resin (50–100 μm) (ref. 59). The samples were then evaporated to dryness and 3% HNO3 was added to produce a solution of 50 ppb. 143Nd/144Nd analyses were undertaken on the ThermoScientific Neptune MC-ICP-MS at the University of Southampton. Corrected Nd isotopic compositions were obtained using a method based on ref. 61 through adjustment to a 146Nd/144Nd ratio of 0.7219 and a secondary normalization to 142Nd/144Nd = 1.141876. Reference material JNdi-1 was measured as an unknown (143Nd/144Nd of 0.512124, 2 s.d. (refs. 62,63)), achieving an average 143Nd/144Nd of 0.512115 with an external reproducibility of ±0.000008 (2 s.d., 15.2 ppm) across six analysis sessions over 2 years. The total column blanks (when blank acid is run through the column procedure) were negligible (<20 pg) compared with the total amounts analysed (1 μg and 200 μg) for Sr and Nd, respectively.

We use the vs model of ref. 30 for inclusion in our analysis. The three-dimensional velocity model is created through a joint inversion of Rayleigh-wave phase velocities from ambient noise and teleseisms30,64. The vs model is parameterized every 5 km vertically with 0.1° × 0.1° pixel size for the upper 50 km. For deeper depths, an irregular spacing was used, increasing from 10 to 50 km spacings to match that of ref. 38. For further details on the creation of the velocity model, the reader is directed to refs. 30,64 and references therein.

For the analysis in this Article, the vs model was interpolated to 1 km depth using a linear interpolation; we then extracted one-dimensional columns of velocity with depth at the same resolution as our pixel size (0.1° × 0.1°).

The gridded Moho depth map was produced from the vs maps of ref. 64, described in the preceding. The vs model was interpolated to a vertical grid spacing of 1 km. A velocity slice at the 3.75 km s–1 contour was extracted, which mapped best to previous receiver function measurements65,66,67,68,69, active source experiments (for example, ref. 45) and previous S-wave models (for example, ref. 70).

As described in the text, five models were considered (Extended Data Table 2), with each model being tested using a linear fit and a spline fit (Fig. 3). We note that a spline fit itself can be linear if that is the best-fitting line.

Empirical models are estimated for the variation of each of 14 geochemical quantities (each of which is represented generically by random variable Y) as a function of distance d ∈ [0, 1,800] km for the five different models. Models are specified that explore the variation of Y with d in increasing complexity. The simplest model (C1C) assumes the existence of a single upwelling centre (at 11.192° N, 41.784° E; Figs. 1 and 3), with respect to which d is defined for all three rifts. The variation of Y with d is assumed common to all rifts. Model C3C assumes the existence of three upwelling centres (at 11.192° N, 41.784° E; 14.008° N, 40.458° E; and 6.626° N, 37.948° E; Fig. 1) on the basis of ref. 36; observations are allocated to the nearest upwelling centre, facilitating calculation of a single d for each observation. Like model C1C, the variation of Y with d is assumed common to all rifts, regardless of upwelling allocation. Model C1D assumes one upwelling centre (like C1C) for calculation of d, but now the variation of Y with d is assumed to be different across rifts. Model C3D duplicates C3C for estimation of d, but variation of Y with d is assumed to be different across rifts. Finally, in model C3X, we consider the presence of three upwelling centres, with different variation of Y with d for each combination of upwelling and rift.

For models C1C and C1D, the distance between each sample and the upwelling locus centred on Lake Abhe (11.192170° N, 41.783750° E) is calculated. For models C3C, C3D and C3X, the distance between each sample and each of the three upwelling locations (Figs. 1 and 3) is measured, and then each sample is assigned to its nearest upwelling centre. The distance (d) between two locations (upwelling and sample) is calculated using the spherical cosine law:

where a is the angle (in radians) from the North Pole to the sample location, b is the angle (in radians) from the North Pole to the upwelling location, C is the difference (in radians) between the longitude values of the sample and upwelling, and R is the radius of the Earth in metres (6,371 × 103).

For each model, the variation of Y with d is described using a penalized B-spline (for example, refs. 71,72), the characteristics of which are selected to provide optimal predictive performance. First, for a large index set of locations equally spaced on the domain of distance, we calculate a B-spline basis matrix, B (for example, ref. 73) consisting of p equally spaced cubic spline basis functions. Then the value of Y on the index set is given by the vector Bβ for spline coefficient vector β to be estimated. The value of p is specified to be sufficiently large to provide a good description of a highly variable Y. For a given dataset, we penalize the difference between consecutive values in β using a roughness penalty, such that the penalized spline exhibits optimal roughness, providing optimal predictive performance.

For a sample of n1 training data, consisting of vectors of geochemical and geophysical quantities (y1) and distances (d1), we first allocate each element of d1 to its nearest neighbour in the index set and hence construct the appropriate spline basis matrix B1 for the sample. We then assume that \({\bf{y}_{1}}={B}_{1}\bf{\upbeta} +\bf{\upepsilon}\), where the elements of ε are independently and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian random variables. We penalize the roughness of β using a first-different penalty λβ'Pβ, where \(P=D{^\prime} D\) and D is a first-difference matrix (with elements \({D}_{{ij}}=-1\) if \(i=j\); \(=1\) if \(j=i+1\); and \(=0\) otherwise (for example, ref. 74). For a given choice of \(\lambda\), we then find the optimal value of β by minimizing lack of fit:

We can evaluate the predictive performance of the resulting spline description using a tuning set of n2 observations (independent of the training set) represented by vectors y2 and d2. We again start by finding the appropriate spline basis matrix B2 for this sample. Then we can calculate the predictive mean square error for the tuning sample:

for each of a set of representative choices of values for λ. We can then select the optimal value of λ using

The value \({\text{MSE}}_{{{\mathrm{Tune}}}}\left({\lambda }^{* }\right)\) is a biased estimate of predictive performance since the value of \({\lambda }^{* }\) was tuned to minimize its value. We can obtain an unbiased estimate for the predictive performance of the spline model using a test set of n3 observations (independent of the training and tuning sets) represented by vectors y3 and d3 (and corresponding spline basis matrix B3). Then the predictive performance is estimated using:

We exploit cross-validation to evaluate MSETest by partitioning the full sample of data into k > 2 groups at random, withholding one group for tuning and another group for testing and retaining the remaining k – 2 groups for training. We then loop exhaustively over all possible combinations of choice of train, tune and test groups, evaluating overall predictive performance on the test data over all iterations, noting that each observation occurs exactly once in the test set. For models requiring separate model fits to subsets of data (C1D, C3D, C3X), MSETest is estimated using predictions from optimal predictive models for each subset. Further, we can repeat the analysis for different initial random partitioning of observations into k groups to assess the sensitivity of overall predictive performance to this choice. We are careful to use the same cross-validation partitions to evaluate each of the five models so that predictive performances can be compared fairly.

To quantify model performance over all 14 geochemical quantities \((j=\mathrm{1,2},\ldots ,13)\), we define the overall standardized MSETest

where MSETest,j is the predictive performance for the jth geochemical indicator, and \(\,{s}_{j}^{2}\) is the sample estimate for the variance of that quantity. The estimation of the splines and the testing of their predictive performance was repeated over 100 iterations. Results from each iteration and the mean of the SMSE are shown in Fig. 4.

For comparison, we also evaluate linear regression models for the variation of Y with d. In the current notation, these can be thought of as simple models with basis matrix B = [1 d], where 1 is a vector of appropriate length with each element = 1. Β in this case is a 2-vector with elements corresponding to intercept and slope coefficients. Linear regression is approached using penalized B-spline models as the roughness coefficient λ → ∞. That is, linear regression corresponds to a penalized B-spline model with very large λ. Therefore, a penalized B-spline model is guaranteed to perform at least as well as linear regression.

To explore the effect of uncertainty on model performance, a perturbation analysis was undertaken. This analysis required the generation and modelling of nPert new data samples. Each of these data samples corresponded to a perturbation of the original data sample. A value of nPert = 300 was selected to ensure that 95% uncertainty bands for predictive performance on perturbed data could be estimated with confidence.

In perturbed sample q, \({q=1,2,\ldots ,n}_{{{\mathrm{Pert}}}}\), the value \({y}_{{ijq}}^{* }\) of the ith observation for variable j was obtained by perturbing the corresponding value \({y}_{{ij}}\) in the original data sample, using additive Gaussian noise \({e}_{{ijq}}\), the standard deviation \({\sigma }_{{ij}}\) of which was informed by the known value of measurement uncertainty for that observation of the variable. Mathematically:

The complete modelling procedure was then applied to each perturbed data sample in turn. The predictive performance of different models was assessed over the nPert perturbations, as illustrated in Fig. 4, in terms of 95% uncertainty bands. The figure indicates that model C1D provides the best predictive performance on perturbed data, as well as for the original unperturbed sample. Note that, since noise has been added to observations in the perturbation analysis, the overall performance of models on perturbed data is poorer than on the original sample, as expected.

We tested the influence of crustal assimilation further by excluding cases where Ce/Pb values fall below 20 and which could feasibly be associated with crustal assimilation26,33. Using additional analysis, we confirm that excluding cases in which Ce/Pb < 20 does not affect our overall results (Extended Data Fig. 3a), suggesting that primary mantle compositional fluctuations (relative proportions of compositional mantle endmembers) exert the first-order control on eruptive compositions at the surface.

PCA requires each sample or object to have the same number of values for each variable, so the dataset was reduced to 94 samples. PCA is carried out only on radiogenic isotope compositions of the samples where data are available for the mantle endmembers investigated (Afar plume, Pan-African Lithosphere, Depleted Mantle, EMI, EMII, HIMU; Fig. 5 and Extended Data Table 3; ref. 75). While other purely geochemical studies on Afar (for example, refs. 14,37) have included sub-crustal components such as the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, we decided not to include this endmember as it can sometimes be indistinguishable from certain mantle endmembers (EM1), especially in cases where the sub-continental lithospheric mantle is metasomatized. The preferred values used for the endmembers in our models are provided in Extended Data Table 3. Each object is standardized before being included in the PCA:

where \({\bar{y}}_{j}\) is the mean of variable j, and sj is the standard deviation of the variable j:

where Nj is the number of objects within variable j.

Approximately 90.5% of the variance is explained within the plane of the first two eigenvectors, increasing to 95.5% when including the third eigenvector. The first principal component (PC-1) is most influenced by 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb, whereas the second principal component (PC-2) is dominantly influenced by 206Pb/204Pb and 87Sr/86Sr. The third principal component (PC-3) is dominated by 207Pb/204Pb and 143Nd/144Nd (Supplementary Table 3).

K-means cluster analysis76 was carried out on the samples using the 13 standardized variables (excluding Moho depth; Extended Data Table 1; refs. 77,78,79,80,75). The K-means algorithm assigns each object to a singular cluster that does not overlap with another (partitional clustering), minimizing the total sum of squared errors from the centre point of each cluster, known as the centroid, to each data point.

To find the optimum number of clusters (k)—which reduces the within-cluster total sum of squared errors with the lowest number of clusters—we run the K-means algorithm specifying k to be 1/20 over 1,000 iterations for each k (Supplementary Fig. 1). We then select four clusters on the basis of k = 4, reducing the within-cluster total sum of squares by 60% from k = 1 and the range over the 1,000 iterations being minimized when k ≥ 4. The cluster assignments for each object, out of the 1,000 iterations, are selected by finding the iteration number that is closest to the mean within-cluster total sum of squares of that k value (shown by the blue line in Supplementary Fig. 1).

The dendritic cell (DC)-initiated and sustained cancer immunity cycle is indispensable for effective endogenous and therapeutically mobilized antitumour T cell responses1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. This necessitates the continuous migration of antigen-carrying DCs from the tumour microenvironment (TME) to the tumour draining lymph nodes (tdLNs)7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Here, through longitudinal analysis of human and mouse tumours, we observed a progressive decrease in migratory conventional DCs (mig-cDCs) in the tdLNs during tumour progression. This decline compromised tumour-specific T cell priming and subsequent T cell supply to the TME. Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) and its substrate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as key modulators of DC migration. Advanced tumours disrupted cGMP synthesis in DCs to decrease their motility, while PDE5 perturbation preserved the cGMP pool to restore DC migration. Mechanistically, cGMP enhanced myosin-II activity through Rho-associated factors, extending the paradigm of cGMP-regulated amoeboid migration from Dictyostelium to mammalian immune cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 using sildenafil restored mig-cDC homing to late-stage tdLNs and sustained antitumour immunity in a DC-dependent manner. Our findings bridge fundamental DC interstitial motility to antitumour immunity, revealing that its disruption in chaotic TME promotes immune evasion, and its enhancement offers a promising direction for DC-centric immunotherapy.

Single crystals and shape-controlled nanocrystals are well known to exhibit facet-dependent catalytic properties. However, few studies have investigated how those nanocrystals evolve and (de)activate during reactions, calling for the development of nanoscale time-resolved operando methods. In this context, we have designed Cu nanocubes as a model system to elucidate the underlying driving force of dynamic nanocatalyst reconstruction during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Operando electrochemical liquid-cell scanning transmission electron microscopy (EC-STEM) and synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy reveal the size- and potential-dependent complete transformation from (100)-oriented Cu@Cu2O nanocubes to polycrystalline metallic Cu nanograins under CO2RR conditions. In addition, machine learning-assisted operando four-dimensional STEM reveals that large Cu nanograins derived from nanocubes form mainly crystalline domains, while their smaller counterparts are more amorphous due to faster evolution kinetics. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations suggest that CO drives the ejection of single Cu atoms, resulting in few-nanometre Cu clusters and the surface migration of highly mobile copper carbonyl (Cu–CO) species. Combined, these multimodal operando methods and theoretical approaches pave the way for understanding the complex structural evolution of energy-related nanocatalysts under electrochemical conditions.

Operando EC-STEM images of 55-nm nanocubes surrounded by spongy shell after LSV to 0 V, under a mild potential at 0 V near the tip of the carbon WE with a much stronger electric field, showing the structural transformation of the Cu spongy shell followed by the cubic Cu core to polycrystalline Cu nanograins. Note that STEM videos were acquired without potential applied from −16 to 0 s to show no beam-induced damage at a dose rate of ~20 e nm−2 s−1. The image fluctuation at 8 s is likely due to the liquid flow commonly observed at the beginning of applied potentials. Corresponding selected EC-STEM images can be found in Supplementary Fig. 16.

Fibrosis is a major complication of Crohn's disease (CD) marked by excess deposition of extracellular matrix, leading to stricturing and functional impairment. As mechanistic characterization and therapeutic options are lacking, we paired single-cell and spatial transcriptomics in 61 samples from 21 patients with CD and 10 patients without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal strictures were characterized by increased immune cells, including IgG+ plasma cells, CCR7-hi CD4+ T cells and inflammatory fibroblasts. Spatial transcriptomics showed that key subsets colocalize within diseased tissues and identified additional populations such as interstitial cells of Cajal and enteric neurons. Furthermore, we mapped gene expression onto intestinal biogeography, finding that known genetic risk loci are enriched within discrete spatial modules, defined by the presence of inflammatory fibroblasts and lymphoid follicles. Altogether, our datasets chart the key transcriptomic and cellular networks in stricturing CD and highlight the spatial organization of multicellular genetic risk factors.

When you think of space exploration and watches, one name immediately comes to mind: Omega. Since its Speedmaster chronograph was selected by NASA half a century ago it has become synonymous with space travel. The timing of a 13-second engine burn to save Apollo 13 cemented its role in space history, and Omega has not missed a single opportunity to deepen the partnership, from officially naming it the Moonwatch to creating endless commemorative limited editions (even if it is by no means the only watch that's left our planet.)

Now, with private spaceflight proliferating and manned missions to the Moon back on NASA's agenda, a Californian start-up wants to establish a new standard for space watches. Barrelhand, whose watches draw on expertise in 3D printing and materials science, says that its Monolith will be the only watch purpose-built for space exploration.

“Space is the harshest environment we've ever gone to,” says founder Karel Bachand. “When we first did it 50 years ago, there were no tools for it. NASA just tried to find off-the-shelf watches that were the best available. When the Speedmaster was selected it was never designed with space in mind, it just happened to pass the tests better than others. There was still plenty of room for improvement.”

Bachand says that even during testing, NASA's engineers flagged that the Speedmaster's accuracy suffered under extreme temperatures or acceleration, and there were other known issues, too. “Lume was flaking off,” says Bachand, “or the strap was getting caked up with moon dust, because it's Velcro. There are tons of opportunities for improvements, but in the last 50 years, there's been no innovation, especially for such a key tool that's life or death in space exploration.”

Omega would say that its Speedmaster Skywalker X-33 model, which has been tested and qualified for use in space by the European Space Agency, is the modern answer to the Speedmaster. But it has some shortcomings—for instance, it is not certified for EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity).

“The X-33 was a great step forward”, says Bachand, “But is only rated for Intra-Vehicular Activity use due to the electronics on board. The liquid crystal display would essentially freeze up on a spacewalk. You need mechanical performance; something that can keep track of time when all other systems fail.”

Quartz watches such as the X-33 would also be vulnerable to the higher levels of radiation in outer space, which can damage various electronic components. A mechanical watch has no such trouble, but needs to be able to function in a more extreme range of temperatures than it would ever face on earth.

The Monolith case is 3D printed from an alloy of scandium, aluminum and magnesium usually used in aerospace components.

The Monolith, which is still in its prototype stage, uses a modified Sellita SW300-1b movement. Chosen for its rugged nature and ease of service, the movement has been upgraded by Barrelhand for improved magnetic resistance, shock resistance and daily accuracy of +/- four seconds.

Bachand, who has a degree in mechanical engineering as well as experience designing clinostat machinery (devices used to study the effects of microgravity on lifeforms) for NASA, founded Barrelhand in 2014. The company produced its first watch, the Project One, in 2020; listed as one of 20 semifinalists for the LVMH Watch Prize, it was a showcase for the 3D-printed construction that is at the heart of the Monolith design.

Bachand, who says that engineering for extreme temperature is the single hardest challenge to overcome, is evangelical about the potential for additive manufacturing to solve this, and other problems. By designing a case with an air pocket within its walls, Bachand was able to construct an insulating layer that allows the Monolith to work between the staggeringly inhospitable temperature range between -120°C (-184°F) and +120°C (248°F).

It has also allowed Barrelhand to work with high-performance materials: the Monolith case is printed from something called “scalmalloy”, an alloy of scandium, aluminum and magnesium that's usually used in small-scale aerospace components.

“We get the same strength specs as titanium for half the weight, which is insane” says Bachand, “The watch weighs around one ounce—about 32 to 33 grams. We're not designing it to be an ultralight watch, but for space exploration, every gram counts. To send one kilogram to the moon right now costs about $1.4m—so if you can shave a couple of grams off, it makes a difference.”

Barrelhand's first watch was the Project One, released in 2020

While EVA use might be the most extreme scenario, Bachand says there is also an enormous amount of innovation required to make a watch that's genuinely suited for use within the ISS or other spacecraft. He has given the Monolith a shatter-proof crystal that dents under impact, for example, to avoid “floating shrapnel.” The movement screws have been redesigned to make the watch serviceable with standard tools already found on the space station.

Bachand even threw out the industry-standard rubber gaskets used to seal a watch case against water. “That will start to degrade below -40°C,” he says. “We looked at the airlocks for the ISS and found a partner that can make an O-ring seal with a similar chemical makeup—an aerospace grade fluorosilicone that won't get brittle when it freezes.”

Every single component has been considered for properties that wouldn't even be considered on Earth—such as the phenomenon of “outgassing”, the emission of absorbed gases into the surrounding atmosphere. “If you've ever opened up a plastic product off Amazon you'll remember being greeted by a harsh chemical smell, commonly known as VOCs [volatile organic compounds]. On Earth, we can just crack open a window and air it out, but the ISS does not have that luxury,” says Bachand, explaining why the Monolith uses only materials that don't emit VOCs.

As well as reimagining the idea of a space-going watch, Barrelhand says that in the process (more or less by default) it will create a tool watch that can cope with anything on Earth. For instance, the Monolith is pressure-tested to depths of 580 meters. Bachand says that here, too, the use of 3D printing is key, and that, slowly, they are changing perceptions of a technology generally only associated with design prototyping.

“We used Project One as a research platform to test new metal 3D printing. For watches, it's kind of the holy grail of engineering: It's super small and super precise,” says Bachand. “If you can make a movement bridge, you've really shown the maturity of the technology. When I show that [to watchmakers], it's exciting for them.”

Nevertheless, the end goal is to see the Monolith used in space—and that may prove to be a challenge that goes beyond pure engineering ability. Bachand says that submitting equipment to NASA is a bureaucratic, timely process, and that Omega's half-century of investment will present its own obstacles. While he follows the official route, Barrelhand is simultaneously taking a “grass roots” approach, courting individual astronauts and scientists who can potentially be more easily convinced of its merits.

“Everyone that we've spoken to really understands the mission and sees the need for it, the need for innovation and to continue improving on any tool,” says Bachand. “A lot of astronauts are watch collectors, but they're also just interested in tools and innovation. They don't always care about history or the status quo; they just want whatever's the best. When people get it in their hands and understand the specs, and the thought behind it all, I think it's going to be a no-brainer.”

Once you notice it, it will ruin your life: Bubbles on the side of beer, cider, or even champagne glasses that haven't been properly cleaned. What starts out as a mild annoyance turns into massive frustration when you learn more about what it's taking from your beverage: improperly cleaned and rinsed glasses can affect carbonation, flavor, and—most importantly—head retention. That's right: Badly cleaned glasses rob you of precious foam!

As I became a beer writer and homebrewer (shout out to the Portland Brewers Collective), I learned how much dirty glasses were robbing me of precious liquid joy. When I stumble across a dirty glass at a local Portland bar, I immediately question the rest of the operation. I've even sadly begun bringing that professional judgment into my personal life. In the past several years, I can't tell you how many housewarmings, birthday parties, or other events I've attended that have gross-looking beer glasses.

The good news is that this is a solvable problem! With a couple simple products and a tiny amount of elbow grease, you can have “beer clean” glasses forever. I even have a couple tips for quickly sorting out any glasses you find gross at a pal's.

The issue is a buildup on the inside of the glass. Any kind of buildup, whether it be hard water residue, oils from lips, or not-quite-clean sponges and towels, can lead to bubbles on the side of your glass. When there is a disruption in the smooth surface area on a glass, bubbles begin to form there. That's why fancy beer glasses often have etching in the middle of the bottom, so that you get a cool cascade of bubbles coming up to the top and reinforcing the foam.

These bubbles and foam are vital to a proper drinking experience for many reasons, but the primary one is that they are a huge vehicle for aroma (which is itself a huge vehicle for perceived flavor). This is also why brewers nearly always recommend drinking beer out of a glass, rather than a can or bottle: Your sense of smell is a huge part of your sense of taste, and the more you can smell your beer the better it will taste. Many folks (guilty as charged) even have specific beer glasses for specific styles of beer, with tulip-shaped glasses ($21) becoming increasingly popular for catching aroma.

While Budweiser's training video shows a three-step process involving a sanitizing step, at home you really just need a sink, a good brush ($14), a proper drying rack ($28), and some lipid-free cleaner ($25) to ensure amazingly gorgeous beer glasses forever. Short of that, a brush and a couple drips of Dawn dish soap ($15) also do the trick. Some folks claim the lipids (fats) in normal dish soaps mean they won't work, and while it is true that it's easier to use lipid-free soap, I have found that regular Dawn and the like work fine too. The key is in the rinsing.

Step one is to use clean water to rinse any dust or other dry particles out of the glass. Then take a bottle brush with a little bit of detergent and water and give the glass a good scrub, being sure to coat all surfaces. From there, rinse the ever-loving crap out of the glass and place it on an elevated drying rack (like the one you'd use to cool cookies), so that it can drip-dry quickly and evenly. Once dry, the beer glass can be placed upside down in a cupboard, so as not to get more dust in it while being stored.

Before drinking, simply take out the glass, give it a quick rinse with water, and pour your beer. The final water rinse (you'll notice special sprayers in bars for this purpose) is key to ensuring nothing dried weirdly on the glass before you put it away, and it also cools the glass a bit before you pour the beer, which helps with over-foaming. As an aside: There is nothing wrong with chilled beer glasses for certain styles. (I love an ice-cold Japanese lager in a frozen pint glass as much as the next guy.) But you'll want to keep them as clean as possible and not pre-rinse them before pouring beer. It's harder to have a “beer clean” ice-cold glass than one you can rinse from the cupboard, and bear in mind what else you have in the freezer, lest you have weird-smelling glasses.

If you're lazy like me and tend toward washing things in the dishwasher in bulk, you can just do the entire “beer clean” glass process (including scrubbing and detergent) just before you pour your beer, then use a dish towel to dry the outside of the glass.

If washing beer glasses in the dishwasher (many folks say not to do this, but I do it with good results all the time), it's key to make sure that your rinse agent ($30) container is properly filled and your dishwasher's drain is running properly. Rinse agents do a great job of preventing hard-water buildup over time, and generally make it easier to get a clean glass. Also, be aware that logos and paint will eventually wear off in the dishwasher, so hand wash anything you really want to preserve.

If you have a glass you think is beyond saving, I've had good luck with a dedicated brush and barkeeper's friend, which also helps clean stainless steel appliances. You can also use vinegar (some folks use this instead of a rinse agent in the dishwasher), which dissolves those hard spots.

Once your glass is clean and rinsed, it's time for a beer: Sláinte, kanpai, na zdrowie, gun bae, prost, and bottom's up!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Snake Venom, Urine, and a Quest to Live Forever: Inside a Biohacking Conference Emboldened by MAHA","https://www.wired.com/story/biohackers-want-unorthodox-treatments-to-live-forever-maha-is-emboldening-them/","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

I have been to the undying convention.

I have been pressurized in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber and bathed in flickering gamma-wave light. I have had my electromagnetic field manipulated. I have taken an IV drip of green liquid that looked nearly radioactive. I have been frozen in a cryochamber (and felt amazing afterward) and baked in a one-man, zippable sauna (I didn't). I have eaten more consecutive meals of beef than ever in my life, grinding unrefined Kalahari desert salt over the slabs of fat and protein. I have been told, after a scan, that I have the liver of a newborn baby (this is a good thing). I have caused a woman's jaw to drop by telling her I once took antibiotics. I have pumped my vaccinated fist alongside RFK Jr. fans and stem cell enthusiasts and piss-injectors to the pounding beats of Steve Aoki.

Welcome to Dave Asprey's 2025 Biohacking Conference: a symposium of tech bros, wellness influencers, psychonauts, and scientists, all hoping to thwart the ravages of time with unorthodox—and often unproven—medical treatments. The conference was held over three days in late May at the Fairmont hotel in downtown Austin, Texas. It was a vast bazaar of speakers, ideologies, practices, and gadgets, all with the express goal to help attendees “Live Beyond 180,” as goes the conference slogan, without the pesky red tape of the Western medical industry. And, while biohacking isn't new, the rise of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, which champions alternative medicine and freedom of choice over proven interventions like vaccines, has given the concept renewed zeal.

The Human Regenerator Jet bed, which claims to promote cellular regeneration.

“We're tired of people saying we need permission,” Asprey, conference organizer and self-proclaimed father of biohacking, tells me on the first day of the gathering. Instead of blindly accepting pharmaceuticals, he says, this community marches to its own holistic drum.

“We take supplements that do the same thing. We figure out we don't need that drug because we got sunshine. Or maybe we just buy our pharmaceuticals from overseas without a permission slip, and we pay a tiny fraction of the outrageous things in the US.”

He claims that biohackers are at the forefront of MAHA—but that it's not about partisanship.

“We're leading the charge on making America healthy again and most biohackers are pretty much apolitical. Because having incredible energy in a sense of peace, in a sense of control of your own destiny, I don't think that's partisan.”

Biohacking is a big tent, combining Silicon Valley technology, Burning Man spirituality, and health libertarianism. If anything unites this crowd, it is a distrust of the medical status quo—particularly the pharmaceutical industry—and an appetite for tech-heavy alternatives. Think folk medicine powered by AI. The movement started gaining major traction around 13 years ago, when Asprey began organizing a loose-knit band of health fanatics at his annual conferences. But its roots arguably go back much further. “Where [biohacking] started 150 years ago,” says investor and so-called ambassador of biohacking Nick Zaldastani, “was the snake oil salespeople.” In the mid-1800s, Chinese laborers on the Transcontinental Railroad first introduced their white counterparts to the anti-inflammatory oils of the Chinese water snake. It was the inert tinctures sold by white copycats that gave rise to the pejorative “snake oil.” These charlatans, Zaldastani says, “would go around and move from city to city, because the minute people found out it did shit—sorry about the French—they were chasing after them.” The resultant struggle with medical authority, the sense of persecution, and doubts about legitimacy plague the biohackers to this day.

In these circles, autonomy is gospel. But if there is a preacher to this sermon, it is Asprey. Grinning cutouts of him greet you at the tops of escalators; his products stock the ad space in conference pamphlets. Patrons roam the halls in his signature anti-blue-light glasses, the auburn lenses making their eyes look like flies, trapped timelessly in amber. Asprey's personal goal is to live to 180 years old—“50 percent better than our current best,” he clarifies, referring to the oldest person ever recorded at 122. And he is working on it, hard. He claims to have spent $2.5 million of his multimillion dollar empire—generated largely by his Bulletproof coffee brand and diet plan—on reversing his age via a specialized diet, rigorous exercise, a torrent of supplements, countless stem cell treatments, baths in frigid ice water and shimmering red light, and injections of his own filtered urine as allergy therapy.

Whatever myriad of elixirs Asprey is using, it does, on a superficial level at least, appear to be working. At 52, he looks great, standing out in a conference awash with obvious botox and plastic surgery. In his slicked-back hair, punk leather outfits, and signature glasses, it's hard to believe the picture he paints of his former self, resembling “the 300-pound computer hacker from Jurassic Park.” He seems to have even achieved a younger man's temperament: rapping “I'm a Little Teapot” onstage; dancing shirtless and gawky before the masses during Aoki's set, surrounded by a coterie of women, one of whom attempted to flash him, unhooking her bra before being whisked offstage.

For a man desperately trying for timelessness, Asprey is certainly a man of the times—a wealthy entrepreneur at the head of a populist movement that vehemently opposes government regulation. He shares his de facto leadership of the biohacking sphere with a few other rich renegades, most notably Bryan Johnson, the venture capitalist whose Blueprint Protocol makes Asprey's centenarian goals look quaint. Johnson aims for immortality outright—“DON'T DIE” screams his own movement's slogan—and has even vampirically infused himself with his own son's blood in the quest for the fountain of youth.

Not everyone at the conference strives for Asprey-Johnsonian extremes. Then again, not everyone at the conference is in their tax bracket. Some simply want to age with grace and vim, not blunted by medication or hobbling through hospice. In a true embodiment of the conference's “Beyond” theme, some even have plans grander than this carnal plane. Attendee Joni Winston, who runs a wellness center in Costa Rica, tells me she is either 68 or 52, “depending on which calendar you use.” At age 60, she started counting backward, so that when she reaches her intended 120, she can claim the nirvanic age of 0. “I want to make as much progress in this life as I can,” Winston says, “so that when I die I can go to a different dimension and not have to deal with this 3D Matrix shit.” In the meantime, though, she'd still like to look good. “I'm not devoid of vanity. Spiritual evolution is my primary goal, but I'm still human, you know?” Others are simply afraid of the slow, painful crawl through old age and, of course, death itself. Melanie Avalon, 34, host of a biohacking podcast, tells me: “I've been haunted by the concept of aging since I was 12 ... And ever since then I've been searching for ways to stall the aging timeline ... I don't know if immortality is possible, but if there is a way to practically move toward that, it's biohacking.”

If the practice sounds inherently self-interested, that's because it is. By definition, biohacking requires profound interest—often supplemented by large investments of time, energy, and capital—in the self. A certain Ayn Randian individualism rang through the halls of the Fairmont. But there was also a highly communal, near-revolutionary air here: a fervor to spread the good word, to empower the masses, to enact a grand subversion.

“The biggest blessing of Covid might be an erosion of trust in corrupt authority,” Asprey tells me. “We have the highest health care costs in the world and one of the worst outcomes for any developed nation. So the only logical conclusion is that someone's stealing ... and we know who it is, right? It's the pharmaceutical companies.”

Since November, then, the biohackers have seen a bright new dawn. With President Donald Trump's re-election, RFK Jr.'s subsequent appointment as secretary of Health and Human Services—people here refer to him as “Bobby,” affectionately, like an old friend—and the initiation of MAHA, years of work have come to fruition. MAHA's agenda legitimizes the biohacking ethos: that we must curb the pharmaceutical industry's influence on public health policy and research, that we are all overmedicated as a result, that self-governance over health is paramount. RFK's antivax crusade has set off alarm bells across the scientific community—most recently, he gutted the Center for Disease Control's vaccine advisory committee and appointed several new vaccine skeptics, just as the US is seeing a resurgence of measles outbreaks. But for the biohackers, it is an almost mythical underdog moment. David, at last, has been armed with his sling across the pit from Goliath.

Despite the MAHA fandom, every biohacker I speak to, like Asprey, says they are apolitical. MAHA itself, they insist, is apolitical. What could possibly be partisan about wanting healthy kids? Having energy and vitality and a high quality of life? My only heated exchange over the conference's three days is with Siggi Clavien, founder of Equilibrium Labs, the company that scanned my newborn baby liver. “Preserving, progressing, and saving the health of the children of this nation—that's what MAHA is. And if you take a side on that either way politically, you don't understand what we're doing. And how dare you take that aspect, and challenge us trying to help children's health?” (Clavien asks me “how dare you” three times over the course of our short interview.)

For the biohackers, decentralization is a feature, not a bug. It's a safeguard against corruption. “The biohacking community,” Fabrizio “Fab” Mancini, a chiropractor and frequent flier of the daytime TV medical circuit, tells me, “is not owned by any one entity. It's actual individuals.” In a community for whom deregulation is entirely the point, though, how do you screen for bullshit?

I ask Asprey about the vetting process for the slew of vendors and speakers hawking treatments on his trade show floor, many of them expensive, few FDA-approved. “I don't look at anything as being fringe,” he tells me. “It's either known or unknown, and it has evidence or it doesn't.”

On the last day of the conference, I attend a talk on snake venom. A man named Sincere Seven is extolling the medicinal virtues of microdosing viper, cobra, and rattlesnake venoms directly into his patients' bloodstream.

“The snake heals its prey before it kills its prey,” he claims, before personifying the serpent. “I inject venom into you that will induce a rapid healing. Flood the body with white blood cells, kill off viruses, kill off bacteria, kill off tumors, kill off cancers—cause I don't wanna eat that.” (Trace amounts of venoms are currently used in FDA-approved drugs and have been found to be effective in stroke treatment.) Seven is asked by an audience member if snake venom could be used to treat autism. While he hadn't personally tested it yet, Seven stresses, “I'm willing to work with anybody ... Me and my colleagues, we are the clinical trials.”

“Oh, my gosh,” a woman breathes in the audience. Whether she is moved or horrified, I can't tell.

At the end of the day, I get it. It's not fair to say that I hate my body, exactly—the thing certainly has its merits, and what's more, biohackers talk constantly of the power of positive language in manifesting your reality—but we've never really hit it off. One of my earliest memories involves my parents calling 911 when I had breathing trouble, the paramedics looming over me so tall I swear they scraped the ceiling. In college I was walloped with Lyme disease, my wrists frozen stiff one morning to the point that I couldn't open my dorm room door. I've broken several bones, had a (non-cancerous) lesion removed from my scalp, passed a kidney stone. I have insomnia and depression and a perpetually swollen ankle. I've had Covid at least five times. As of this writing, I'm days away from an appointment with my dermatologist, who'll carve a portion from my back to determine whether or not I have skin cancer.

Part of me really wants to endorse a grand arsenal of magic bullets. I am sick, and I am tired, and I want answers. I, too, long to throw up my hands and write off Western medicine in all its byzantine expense, to embrace something different and eccentric and even expensive, as long as it means getting healed at last.

There are other, better ways to transform health care, of course—ways that could lastingly help the millions who can afford neither chemotherapy nor a cryochamber—like universal health care, stronger regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, and a system more focused on preventative medicine. But these reforms will take political courage and considerable time. Instead we find ourselves entrenched ever further in a culture war, with politicians placing science in its crosshairs.

This, at its core, is the biohackers' dilemma. Over and over at the Fairmont, I hear of the need for evidence-based science in medicine: for clinical trials and citations in the JAMA and double-blind placebo tests. In practically the same breath, I hear the vehement dismissal of evidence using those very safeguards—such as those used to develop vaccines—when it doesn't square with the biohackers' ideals. Though “Live Beyond 180” is a sleek-enough slogan for this crowd, another strikes me as equally fitting: “Science is dead, long live science.”

“The bottom line,” Dr. Fab says, “is that anybody can actually put up a booth and actually sell whatever they feel. That's where an informed consumer is the key.”

But that's a hell of an ask. Information, as we know all too well by now, ain't what it used to be.

Dating app Bumble announced on Wednesday that it's laying off 30% of its workforce, impacting around 240 positions. The company said in a securities filing that the cuts are part of its plans to realign its “operating structure to optimize execution on its strategic priorities.”

Bumble anticipates saving $40 million per year as a result of the workforce reduction and plans to reinvest most of this money into product and technology development.

The company said it will incur approximately $13 million to $18 million of non-recurring charges, mainly related to severance, benefits, and associated costs for affected employees in the third and fourth quarters of 2025. 

Bumble's shares are up around 20% following the news of the job cuts. 

The company's last round of layoffs was back in January 2024, when it cut 30% its workforce, impacting around 350 employees.

In addition to announcing the workforce reduction, Bumble shared that it's increasing its second-quarter revenue forecast to a range of $244 million to $249 million, up from the previously forecasted $235 million to $243 million range.

The cuts come as Bumble announced at the start of the year that founder Whitney Wolfe Herd was returning as CEO in March, after stepping down from the position in 2023. 

As Bumble last month reported weak first-quarter earnings that fell 7.7% year-over-year, Herd said in an interview with The New York Times that “Bumble needs me back. It's an extension of me to some degree, and watching it fall from its peak has been very hard.”

Match, which owns rival apps like Tinder and Hinge, has also been struggling to attract and retain users, particularly young ones. Match announced in May that it was laying off 13% of its staff to reduce costs and streamline its organizational structure.

Google is launching a new agentic AI tool that will put its Gemini AI models closer to where developers are already coding.

The company announced on Wednesday the launch of Gemini CLI, an agentic AI tool designed to run locally from your terminal. The new tool connects Google's Gemini AI models to local codebases, and it allows developers to make natural language requests, such as asking Gemini CLI to explain confusing sections of code, write new features, debug code, or run commands.

Gemini CLI is part of Google's efforts to get developers using its AI models in their coding workflows. Google now offers an array of AI coding tools, such as Gemini Code Assist and its asynchronous AI coding assistant, Jules. However, Gemini CLI competes directly with other command-line AI tools such as OpenAI's Codex CLI and Anthropic's Claude Code — tools that tend to be easier to integrate, faster, and more efficient than other AI coding tools.

Since Google launched Gemini 2.5 Pro in April, the company's AI models have become a favorite among developers. The popularity of Gemini 2.5 Pro has driven usage of third-party AI coding tools, such as Cursor and GitHub Copilot, which have become massive businesses. In response, Google has tried in recent months to build a direct relationship with these developers by offering in-house products.

While most people will use Gemini CLI for coding, the company says it designed the tool to handle other tasks as well. Developers can tap Gemini CLI to create videos with Google's Veo 3 model, generate research reports with the company's Deep Research agent, or access real-time information through Google Search. Google also says Gemini CLI can connect to MCP servers, allowing developers to connect to external databases.

To encourage adoption, Google is also open-sourcing Gemini CLI under the Apache 2.0 license, which is typically considered one of the most permissive. The company says it expects a network of developers to contribute to the project on GitHub.

Google is also offering generous usage limits to spur adoption of Gemini CLI. Free users can make 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day, which the company says is roughly double the average number of requests developers made when using the tool.

While AI coding tools are rising rapidly in popularity, using them comes with risks. According to a 2024 survey from Stack Overflow, just 43% of developers trust the accuracy of AI tools. Several studies have shown that code-generating AI models can occasionally introduce errors or fail to fix security vulnerabilities.

Wind power has run into some headwinds, and not the kind that spin its turbines. 

Recently, President Trump has decided to wage war against the technology, an unwelcome bit of friction that coincides with rising costs in recent years. Onshore wind power went for $61 per megawatt-hour last year, according to Lazard, bucking a decade-long downward trend.

“We have a lot of headwinds,” acknowledges Neal Rickner, CEO of wind startup Airloom Energy. But he also argues that his company, which takes a different tack, could emerge a winner if it can weather the next five years. 

“People are feeling the pain of $60 megawatt-hour pricing already,” he said. “Our modeling shows we can do that with a first-of-a-kind system. If we can be cost competitive at very low volume with our first system, that's an indicator of where we can go. We think disruptively low — even without subsidy.”

Most wind turbines look like space-age pinwheels, their blades sweeping a large circle. Airloom takes that classic turbine concept and deconstructs it. The startup swaps three long blades for an arbitrary number of much shorter ones, attaching them to a cable that runs along an oval track that can be as long or short as desired. The total height of the system is about 60 feet, far shorter than a typical wind turbine.

To prove that it can generate as much power as those tall boys, Airloom broke ground on its pilot site northwest of Laramie, Wyoming, on Wednesday, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.

“We've got it all in the simulation. Now we gotta go build it,” Rickner said.

The pilot system will generate around 150 kilowatts of electricity, though its parts will be the same as those in a megawatt-scale installation. The only difference, he said, is that the track will be shorter in the pilot — about the size of a high school running track with 100-meter straights. A future 3-megawatt system will have 500-meter straights. 

The space between the tracks can be used for solar panels or traditional farming — the blades are designed to allow farm equipment to easily pass beneath them.

Rickner said that AirLoom is looking to deploy its first commercial-scale system in 2027 or 2028, a year or two later than he originally predicted in 2023. The first site could be a data center or a military base, he said.

AirLoom has always been targeting the military as a possible customer — no surprise given Rickner's background as an F/A-18 pilot for the U.S. Marine Corps — but more recently, the company has been talking with data center developers. Many of them, Rickner said, have been struggling to secure wind turbines before 2030. 

“What we're showing is that we can deploy a system in '27, '28. It'll be an early-stage system, but I can get you those early-stage systems sooner. And then I can be on my third iteration of the AirLoom system by 2030,” Rickner said. That, he added, “got the attention of several of those developers.”

AI-native startups are rewriting the rules of what early traction looks like — and too often, investors are still playing by the old ones. At TechCrunch All Stage, happening in Boston on July 15, Kleida Martiro, partner at Glasswing Ventures, will lead a breakout that cuts straight to the core of this disconnect.

Her session, Winning Capital in a Competitive Market: How to Fund Your AI-Native Startup, on the Foundation Stage, explores how early-stage AI founders can frame their growth story in a way that resonates with forward-thinking investors — and filter out the ones still stuck in SaaS-era metrics.

Martiro brings the perfect blend of operator and investor experience to the table. Before joining Glasswing, she led machine learning efforts as Head of Data Science at SocialFlow and now serves on multiple AI startup boards. She's also been named one of Business Insider's “41 Most Important VCs in Boston” and a VentureBeat “Women in AI Rising Star.”

Expect a tactical conversation on aligning your vision, funding needs, and long-term opportunity with the capital partners who actually get what you're building. If you're building AI from the ground up, this is the room to be in. You'll have plenty of time during the session to ask your burning questions about launching and scaling an AI startup.

Get your pass to TechCrunch All Stage before prices rise at the door.

Nearly a year after raising a mega seed round of $50 million, e-commerce veteran Julie Bornstein's startup Daydream is releasing its AI-powered chatbot for shopping with a focus on fashion.

After testing the product with select users, the company is today releasing the chatbot to all users in a public beta. People can sign up for the chatbot, which will ask them their name, birthdate, price range they shop in, and brand preferences, if any. 

You can type a query like “I want a dress to wear to the wedding this summer in Paris” or upload an image and add more context through text to search for a clothing item. 

Users can save any item to a collection they create or refine their search by typing in the chatbot on the left-hand side. If they like an item but want to modify some aspects, like colors or style, they can tap on the “Say More” button visible on any of the items to edit the search.

Based on the parameters users provided during onboarding and feedback the app gets from them, it saves different items. Daydream creates a style passport for them that drives a lot of suggestions. The web app also shows you daily inspiration for items and accessories that possibly match your taste. 

Right now, Daydream doesn't have an integrated checkout flow, so when a user clicks on an item, they are redirected to a merchant's website to complete a transaction. The startup is taking a percentage cut out of each sale. Daydream said that at launch, it has more than 8,000 brands on the platform, with the company onboarding new merchants free of cost.  

Bornstein, who has held executive positions at companies like Nordstrom, Urban Outfitters, Sephora, and Stitch Fix, said that in the past year, the company was working on technology to bring a catalog of different brands to one place and revamp search to suit AI.

“Having worked in e-commerce my whole career, search has always been the forgotten child, and it never worked very well. In some ways, people were trained to just be very narrow in the way that they search for anything in the fashion world. And even with my prior startup, we couldn't get people to go beyond something like ‘a red dress, ‘” Bornstien told TechCrunch over a call.

“But once Chat GPT launched, you know, consumers started to get trained on how to think about the potential of prompting. And so what we're trying to do is help allow you to ask whatever it is you wanna ask, whether it's I have an occasion, or I have this need, or I'm looking for this very specific kind of thing,” she said.

Maria Belousova, who joined the company this year as CTO, said that Daydream did a lot of work on understanding the nuances of items in the catalog. She said that traditional search only showed shoppers items based on tags matching their keywords, which doesn't work in today's world, where customers are asking longer queries.

“We are doing quite a bit to understand the details of the product, such as knowing stylistic attributes like embellishments, silhouette, or even social attributes like who would wear this dress, such as a bride or a guest in a wedding. We are also using image visual recognition to satisfy detailed queries where a customer describes the exact product they want,” Belousova said.

Over the next year, Daydream will allow users to give the tool more explicit feedback, like “Don't show me any four-inch heels.” It also plans to experiment with a feature that will allow users to ask for a good match with an existing item with personalized suggestions. Plus, it wants to lean into the aspect of social sharing by letting users share their saved items with friends and family for suggestions to buy. Another feature that Daydream is thinking about is to take an existing collection of another user and modify it for their own needs using AI.

While Daydream's team has years of e-commerce experience and focuses on fashion, startups like Deft and Cherry are also building multimodal search for shopping. Meanwhile, tech giants like Amazon and Google are focusing on features that use AI to search multiple sites and find the right item for users.

Satellites can accomplish incredible tasks like provide internet, or help monitor wildfires. But many of them ultimately meet a fiery death burning up in the Earth's atmosphere. Others use their last bit of fuel to move to so-called “graveyard” orbits, where they circle the planet in a perpetual deep freeze.

A new startup called Lux Aeterna wants to change this. The Denver-based company, which is coming out of stealth today, has designed a reusable satellite called Delphi that it aims to launch — and land — in 2027.

If successful, it could help slash the cost to get satellite payloads into space. It would also make the process far more flexible than it is today, since satellites are designed to stay in orbit for years and essentially can't be modified for other uses.

These attributes have already piqued the interest of the Department of Defense, which has made low-Earth orbit an important part of the United States' military strategy. 

Venture capitalists have also taken notice — and written checks. The startup's pitch was attractive enough to generate $4 million in pre-seed funding, led by Space Capital and including other early-stage funds like Dynamo Ventures and Mission One Capital.

Founder and CEO Brian Taylor said the idea for Lux Aeterna came to him last year while he watched his former employer, SpaceX, launch one of its Starship test vehicles into space. 

“I want to fill Starship with something amazing, and something that changes the entire industry,” Taylor recalled thinking during an interview with TechCrunch. 

Starship is the biggest rocket ever built. As part of that, it has the potential to send larger payloads into space than was previously possible. Size matters for people who build satellites and other spacecraft, since they're often working backwards from the simple constraint of what can fit inside a rocket's cargo area. And Starship is not alone — there are other heavy-lift rockets in the works, too, like Blue Origin's New Glenn. 

It's hard to design a satellite that can survive the brutal forces of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere at high speeds. But with the extra space afforded by heavy-lift rockets, Taylor said it's possible to build one that can survive multiple re-entries without having to compromise on the technology because of cost or weight tradeoffs.

In the case of Lux Aeterna, that means using a heat shield. In the rendering the startup released Wednesday, the Delphi satellite's conical heat shield is reminiscent of the ones that protected some of NASA's most famous spacecraft.

There's a reason for that, according to Taylor: Those designs worked. 

“We definitely looked at what NASA had done in the past on exploratory missions [and] sample return missions, and that really helped justify the architecture that we've gone with,” he said. “I think it's very important, when you're doing something ambitious like this, that you're not reinventing the wheel on everything, right?”

Taylor declined to get into further specifics about how the Delphi satellite will work, or how Lux Aeterna will refurbish the craft between launches. (The design appears to involve the ability to fold the satellite bus structure so that it fits safely behind the heat shield.) 

To be sure, he has plenty of experience in the satellite world. In addition to working on Starlink at SpaceX, Taylor also worked on Amazon's Kuiper satellite program, and at space infrastructure startup Loft Orbital. 

The plan for Delphi is to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2027, perform a full orbital flight, and then come back down to Earth. Then Lux Aeterna wants to do that all over again to prove out Delphi's reusability.

From there, Taylor said his team is working on a larger production vehicle that will demonstrate far greater reusability. 

Despite decades of spaceflight innovation, Taylor said he believes the industry is still very young, which leaves plenty of opportunity for a company like Lux Aeterna to establish a long-running business. 

“It's not to the maturity level of [computer] chips. It's not at the maturity level of automotive,” he said. Satellite reusability will help change that. And while Taylor is committed to that cause, he said he's thrilled about all the things he can't imagine that will exist in a space-based economy. 

“We don't know what we don't know is going to come,” he said. “That's probably the most exciting part.”

""Assembly Theory"" is a sort of applying (kolmogorov-esque) complexity theory to physics and other natural sciences. I don't know much else beyond that it's a ""real thing"".So with that extra background, I give it a pass. I think it's an interesting idea at least.

First came AlphaFold. Now comes AlphaGenome for DNA.

When scientists first sequenced the human genome in 2003, they revealed the full set of DNA instructions that make a person. But we still didn't know what all those 3 billion genetic letters actually do. 

Now Google's DeepMind division says it's made a leap in trying to understand the code with AlphaGenome, an AI model that predicts what effects small changes in DNA will have on an array of molecular processes, such as whether a gene's activity will go up or down. It's just the sort of question biologists regularly assess in lab experiments.

“We have, for the first time, created a single model that unifies many different challenges that come with understanding the genome,” says Pushmeet Kohli, a vice president for research at DeepMind.

Five years ago, the Google AI division released AlphaFold, a technology for predicting the 3D shape of proteins. That work was honored with a Nobel Prize last year and spawned a drug-discovery spinout, Isomorphic Labs, and a boom of companies that hope AI will be able to propose new drugs.

AlphaGenome is an attempt to further smooth biologists' work by answering basic questions about how changing DNA letters alters gene activity and, eventually, how genetic mutations affect our health. 

“We have these 3 billion letters of DNA that make up a human genome, but every person is slightly different, and we don't fully understand what those differences do,” says Caleb Lareau, a computational biologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who has had early access to AlphaGenome. “This is the most powerful tool to date to model that.”

Google says AlphaGenome will be free for noncommercial users and plans to release full details of the model in the future. According to Kohli, the company is exploring ways to “enable use of this model by commercial entities” such as biotech companies. 

The research represents a shift in how we may predict the weather.

Lareau says AlphaGenome will allow certain types of experiments now done in the lab to be carried out virtually, on a computer. For instance, studies of people who've donated their DNA for research often turn up thousands of genetic differences, each slightly raising or lowering the chance a person gets a disease such as Alzheimer's.

Lareau says DeepMind's software could be used to quickly make predictions about how each of those variants works at a molecular level, something that would otherwise require time-consuming lab experiments. “You'll get this list of gene variants, but then I want to understand which of those are actually doing something, and where can I intervene,” he says. “This system pushes us closer to a good first guess about what any variant will be doing when we observe it in a human.”

Don't expect AlphaGenome to predict very much about individual people, however. It offers clues to nitty-gritty molecular details of gene activity, not 23andMe-type revelations of a person's traits or ancestry. 

“We haven't designed or validated AlphaGenome for personal genome prediction, a known challenge for AI models,” Google said in a statement.

Underlying the AI system is the so-called transformer architecture invented at Google that also powers large language models like GPT-4. This one was trained on troves of experimental data produced by public scientific projects.

Lareau says the system will not broadly change how his lab works day to day but could permit new types of research. For instance, sometimes doctors encounter patients with ultra-rare cancers, bristling with unfamiliar mutations. AlphaGenome could suggest which of those mutations are really causing the root problem, possibly pointing to a treatment.

“A hallmark of cancer is that specific mutations in DNA make the wrong genes express in the wrong context,” says Julien Gagneur, a professor of computational medicine at the Technical University of Munich. “This type of tool is instrumental in narrowing down which ones mess up proper gene expression.” 

The same approach could apply to patients with rare genetic disease, many of whom never learn the source of their condition, even if their DNA has been decoded. “We can obtain their genomes, but we are clueless as to which genetic alterations cause the disease,” says Gagneur. He thinks AlphaGenome could give medical scientists a new way to diagnose such cases. 

Eventually, some researchers aspire to use AI to design entire genomes from the ground up and create new life forms. Others think the models will be used to create a fully virtual laboratory for drug studies. “My dream would be to simulate a virtual cell,” Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, said this year. 

Kohli calls AlphaGenome a “milestone” on the road to that kind of system. “AlphaGenome may not model the whole cell in its entirety … but it's starting to sort of shed light on the broader semantics of DNA,” he says. 

Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

The multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI. 

The stigmatized idea could get a massive boost from “tech bros”—and some scientists are cheering them on.

MIT Technology Review's highly subjective take on the latest buzz about AI, including its role in layoffs and storm prediction.

Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn't always easy. That's why we've created the AI Hype Index—a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry.

AI agents might be the toast of the AI industry, but they're still not that reliable. That's why Yoshua Bengio, one of the world's leading AI experts, is creating his own nonprofit dedicated to guarding against deceptive agents. Not only can they mislead you, but new research suggests that the weaker an AI model powering an agent is, the less likely it is to be able to negotiate you a good deal online. Elsewhere, OpenAI has inked a deal with toymaker Mattel to develop “age-appropriate” AI-infused products. What could possibly go wrong?

 

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

AlphaEvolve uses large language models to find new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more.

Edward Coristine, the 19-year-old given unprecedented access to some of the most private information on Americans, has reportedly quit his role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency according to Wired. If you don't remember the name Coristine, you probably remember his nickname, the thing he reportedly told people to call him while he plundered the nation's data. He went by Big Balls.

Coristine had been working as a so-called Special Government Employee, which allows workers to skip the more strict financial disclosures required for government employees but prohibits work to just 130 days in a year. That changed last month, according to Wired. Coristine had been hired in May as a full-time employee at the General Services Administration, right around the same time that Musk formally exited DOGE, more or less accusing President Donald Trump of being a pedophile in the process.

Officially, Coristine was an employee of GSA but was working across multiple government agencies, according to Wired. Big Balls was reportedly rooting around in government systems for USAID, the Department of Education, and the Small Business Administration, among others. It's not clear how much data to which Coristine ultimately got access. Nor do we know what he, or anyone else affiliated with DOGE, has done with it.

Coristine made an infamous appearance on Fox News where he tried to strengthen Musk's case that the federal government was riddled with waste, fraud, and abuse. But he wound up accidentally revealing that he simply had no idea how anything works. Coristine and Musk seemed to believe that because they didn't know how various things in the government worked, some kind of nefarious activity had been exposed. But it did nothing of the sort.

“So you look at a specific line item, like $20 million. You're like, OK, well, what is this money going to? And for the majority of payment systems, it's like, well, we don't really know,” Coristine said during his Fox News appearance in early May.

Coristine had no work experience in forensic accounting and the DOGE dipshits were largely feeding massive quantities of data to AI systems in an effort to understand what they were looking at, according to multiple reports. But these guys seemed to truly believe that if they didn't understand something, it must be evidence of wrongdoing.

Coristine had previously been fired from a cybersecurity company for allegedly leaking company secrets and went to work for Musk's company Neuralink before joining the DOGE team.

Coristine's father, Charles Coristine, is the CEO of the snack food company LesserEvil, which was sued in 2023 for representing its snacks as “healthier” than other junk food. The brand tried to distance itself from Big Balls back in February, writing, the company “is in no way affiliated with any political figures, political policies or political groups.”

We're a month away from the arrival of the next Marvel movie in Fantastic Four: First Steps, and Marvel is reminding us in style with a brand new trailer—one that really wants you to feel the stakes that are riding on this movie, in more ways than one.

Prior looks at First Steps leaned into the Silver Age retro-kitsch of its world, and then the arrival of Julia Garner's Silver Surfer to herald the threat of the dread, Galactus. But now this final big trailer for the film really wants to remind us that we kind of already have an inkling how this might go down for the Fantastic Four. And that the arrival of Ralph Ineson's devourer of worlds is very grave news indeed.

Because yes, hanging over the threat of Galactus' arrival on this particular Earth in Marvel's multiverse, we know that, thanks to the set up at the end of Thunderbolts, at some point the Fantastic Four have to make their way from this reality to the prime reality of the MCU. Whether they'll have done so after beating back Galactus successfully, or whether they're looking to other realities in the hope they might be able to help find a new home, remains to be seen. Or maybe we should believe Kevin Feige and that ship is not at all related to this version of the Fantastic Four!

However it goes, things are going to get quite dire for Richards family and their friends before all that—we'll find out how dire when Fantastic Four: First Steps hits theaters in one month, on July 25.

Not soon after Lego confirmed the latest additions to its fan-designed Ideas line in the form of Godzilla stomping into brick-built reality, the company has announced two more big name franchises making their Lego debuts soon: the unlikely pairing of The X-Files and Wallace & Gromit.

What unites both of these franchises? Well, they were big in the '90s (never mind that A Grand Day Out released in 1989), and were thus two of the franchises used by fan designers in the Lego Ideas “Build Your Nostalgia: '90s Throwback” competition, which tasked fan designers from the Ideas community to create nostalgic Lego builds to win the chance of becoming new official sets. Lego broke the competition into two categories: larger sets that could be 1,000 to 5,000 pieces in size, and a smaller category for builds between 200 and 1,000 pieces, before selecting five entries in each category to go to a fan vote.

The winner of the larger category was Lego Ideas user WetWired's The X-Files: The Truth Is Out There, an amazing tribute to the legendary TV series that incorporates two vignettes stacked on top of one another: a forested UFO encounter, complete with a grey alien beaming down out of a ship, above a replica of Fox Mulder's FBI office (complete with, of course, the iconic “The Truth Is Out There” poster). On top of the clever vignettes, WetWired's build includes a bunch of minifigures drawing across X-Files history, including Mulder and Scully, as well as the aforementioned grey alien, Assistant Director Walter Skinner, Eugene Tooms, the Syndicate Leader, and even the Jersey Devil.

The Wallace & Gromit idea that one the smaller-scale category meanwhile takes a different track. Designed by Ideas user Pidelium, rather than a minifigure-scaled playset the build is a brick-built display piece of the legendary Aardman inventor and his trusty canine companion as they appeared in the third Wallace & Gromit short film, A Close Shave, riding their motorbike and side car for their window-cleaning business. The classic rounded style of Aardman's claymation designs are nicely recreated with sloped, smooth tiles, and although some Lego fans might be bummed that Pidelium's build doesn't include any minifigures, it's a fun replica of an iconic image from the series.

Of course, being Ideas submissions, things will inevitably change between these fan-made designs and the final official sets (neither of which have release windows or price points just yet). But for now, they join Godzilla and a whole host of other Ideas sets still in development, so your wallet remains safe… for now.

The level of secrecy on Disney's prized franchises is known to be on another level. Between Marvel and Star Wars, script and set leaks are something the studio wants to keep the spigot closed on. But it turns out that sometimes tight security makes the work challenging for its stars, including certain cast members of the hit Disney+ show Andor.

The nugget of behind the scenes lore was revealed while Andor star Diego Luna, who is currently doing a stint hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live, had own his Star Wars universe co-star Adria Arjona on to reminisce about shooting the Disney+ series. He brought up that production resorted to high-tech alternatives for its actors to learn their lines.

“They wouldn't print a script for you because you would lose it. So we would have iPads to work,” Luna explained of the protocol before asking Arjona how she fared under that decree.

“I didn't use it,” she admitted, “I took pictures of it and I printed the whole script.”

As in pictures of the screen, which Luna cracked was very much in line with the spies they played on the Tony Gilroy show. “You were so mad at me the first time in rehearsal. You looked at me like, ‘Adria, they're gonna find out!' You were so paranoid.” Arjona revealed, “And my answer was like, ‘Stellan [Skarsgård] did it too.' I just completely threw Stellan under the bus.”

“I remember that. Stellan didn't give an [expletive],” Luna said. “He was like, ‘Yes, I've been doing it.'”

Arjona continued, “I just kept doing it. Season two, I did it too.”

She explained, “I just need the paper. I need to write things down. [The iPad script] also has so many passwords and then I would have ADD and then do something else and then it would lock me out … it was so complicated. So I printed it.”

Since the ending of Andor featured Arjona's character holding a real hell of a twist in her arms, we'd say she was successful.

If you're looking for a premium laptop, this early Prime Day deal on the Dell Inspiron 15-inch touchscreen laptop is one you won't want to miss – and it's open to both Prime and non-Prime members.

Amazon has bundled this powerful (i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) machine with a set of high-value accessories including a lifetime subscription to Microsoft Office Pro, a USB drive, a mouse, and a 7-in-1 USB hub. The regular retail price is $2,599 but with this limited-time offer, you can have the laptop for just $879. That's already a massive $1,720 savings but here is the best part: with the free accessories tossed in, the effective price is even lower. Subtract the value of the included items ($299), and you're essentially paying $580 for the laptop itself.

See at Amazon

This is probably the most impressive part of this laptop: It comes with an Intel 10-core i7-1355U processor which features a clock speed of up to 5.00 GHz, 12 threads, and 12 MB cache. This powerhouse (never seen at such a price) provides effortless multitasking and lag-free performance for even the most demanding business applications.

The 15.6-inch FHD anti-glare touchscreen display offers sharp visuals at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 which is perfect for presentations, design work, and video playback. The anti-glare coating reduces eye strain during long working hours. It's definitely the most beautiful screen you can expect for such a price.

This Dell laptop is also equipped with 32 GB of DDR4 RAM and a spacious 1 TB SSD. This combination gives you ample storage for all your valuable files without needing to worry about falling short of storage. The high-speed SSD gives you faster booting and improved overall system performance. It also comes with a variety of ports including USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A and Type-C, USB 2.0, an SD card reader, HDMI 1.4, and a headset jack.

On the software side, the laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro. The incentive of a lifetime license of Microsoft Office Pro is a huge bonus and provides you with the essential productivity apps (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and more) right out of the box.

This deal is an opportunity to pick up a Dell at a price that makes last year's Prime Day offers pale in comparison.

Since it began its science operations in July 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has been probing the atmospheres of alien planets to study their potential for habitability. For the first time, however, Webb has discovered its own exoplanet, finding a young system hidden in a swirling cloud of dust and debris.

Webb has captured a previously unseen exoplanet, the lightest planet imaged so far—an accomplishment made possible by the space-based telescope's advanced capabilities. The recent discovery, detailed in a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, marks Webb's first discovery of an exoplanet and opens up a new window into hidden, Saturn-like worlds.

“The planets are much fainter by orders of magnitudes than their parent stars, and seen from Earth or from JWST, they are angularly very close to them,” Anne-Marie Lagrange, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and lead author of the paper, told Gizmodo. “Hence, when looking at a planet we see only the star.” In order to overcome this issue, the team behind the new discovery used a coronagraph—a telescopic attachment for Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument. The coronagraph recreates the effect of a solar eclipse, blocking the light from a star to make its surroundings more visible.

Using the coronagraph, the scientists spotted a young planetary system that's only a few million years old. The system, named TWA 7, has three distinct rings, one of which is especially narrow while being surrounded by two areas that hold almost no matter. In Webb's image, something lies within the heart of the narrow ring, which the scientists behind the study concluded is an exoplanet.

The newly discovered exoplanet, dubbed TWA 7b, is more massive than Neptune but around 30% less massive than Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system. TWA 7b, designated a sub-Jupiter, has a mass similar to that of Saturn's and orbits around a star that formed approximately 6.4 million years ago. The planet maintains a large distance of 52 astronomical units (in which 1 au is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun) from its star.

“It is also the first planet explaining gaps in a disk,” Lagrange said. “It is unique to explain disk-planet interactions during the early phases of planetary systems.” Planets form from the material leftover from the birth of a star, which create a swirling disk of matter. Previous observations of these protoplanetary disks has revealed ring-like structures and gaps, which were believed to be signatures of unseen planets. So far, there were no direct observations of those planets. The mass and orbital features of TWA 7b, however, match the predicted properties of an exoplanet that may have formed in the gap between the first and second ring of the disk.

By using Webb to observe young, faint planets, scientists have unlocked a new doorway into the discovery of alien worlds. “In terms of imaging, it opens the possibility to image Saturn-like planets. In further steps, it will allow us to characterize the atmosphere of Saturn-like, non irradiated planets,” Lagrange said. “It is a big step. It helps us knowing what is complicated when searching for very light planets.”

What would take 38GB of VRAM to hold now takes just a measly 52KB.

Measuring the VRAM impact of trees isn't something most people think about while gaming, but AMD researchers have figured out a way to reduce the VRAM footprint of 3D tree rendering by a whopping 666,352x. AMD researchers recently developed procedural tree generation with work graphs and mesh nodes to optimize tree rendering on video memory.

To demonstrate this, the AMD researchers showcased a 3D-rendered scene that requires only 51 KiB of data to generate. If the scene were rendered with conventional geometry, it would require 34.8 GiB to hold in video memory.

AMD researcher's real-time GPU tree generation system uses work graphs (w/ mesh nodes) for procedural tree generation. Without work graphs, the trees in the scene would have required 34.8 GiB of VRAM. With work graphs, only 51 KiBhttps://t.co/2YcWdOj5Lehttps://t.co/aDkZB08tksJune 23, 2025

This new VRAM-saving technique leverages a procedural generation technique that eliminates the need for a 3D geometry format altogether. The GPU utilizes work graphs and mesh nodes to produce 3D-rendered trees on the fly in the LOD (Level of Detail) required for the current frame.

With traditional techniques, video memory would be responsible for holding the geometry or polygon format of the trees themselves, which requires gigabytes of memory to store. By procedurally generating trees on the fly on the GPU, the only important data that needs to be held in VRAM is the generation code that tells the GPU how to generate trees in a scene. This code is only kilobytes in size by comparison.

This radically new rendering technique is yet another demonstration of the capabilities of work graphs. Work graphs enable the GPU to assign work to itself, significantly improving rendering efficiency in areas that previously relied on the CPU to do the heavy lifting. Work graphs are so flexible that 3D engines can run almost entirely on the GPU when used appropriately. Mesh nodes are an extension of work graphs that allow the GPU to issue draw calls to itself. Again, this shifts work from the CPU to the GPU.

Trees aren't the only objects that can be rendered with this paradigm. We can expect other objects, and possibly even textures, to be rendered this way in the future. Nvidia is already working on neural texture compression to reduce texture demands on video memory, but work graphs and mesh nodes provide another method of achieving the same goal (and will not be limited to Nvidia GPUs).

The axe swings.

Intel has begun cutting jobs in California as part of its cost-cutting and restructuring strategy introduced by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The move comes two months after Tan warned that staff reductions were unavoidable and that 15% - 20% of the company's staff would be laid off. Officially, Intel is eliminating excessive management layers, but a CRN report indicates that the company is surprisingly laying off chip design engineers and architects. Additionally, the company is shutting down its automotive chip division, according to Oregon Live.

Among the job categories being eliminated are 22 physical design engineers, three physical design engineering managers, and several logic and product development engineers. The company is also removing roles such as cloud software architects and engineering managers, in addition to positions tied to business and project management, including a vice president of IT and multiple technology strategy leads. Employees in California are engaged in the development of CPU and GPU products.

According to a notification submitted to the state, 107 employees based at Intel's Santa Clara headquarters will be laid off. The filing complies with California's WARN Act, which requires disclosure when 50 or more workers are affected within a 30-day period. The layoffs are scheduled to begin on July 15. Impacted employees have been given either a 60-day notice or a shorter four-week notice, paired with nine weeks of compensation and benefits. 

Intel is also exiting the automotive chip market. The division, which operated within the Client Computing Group, will be shut down. Intel's automotive business is based in Munich, Germany, leveraging its proximity to major European automakers and suppliers. As of 2024 – 2025, the unit is (or was?) led by Jack Weast, a longtime Intel veteran, Intel fellow, and former VP at Mobileye. To succeed in developing platforms for software-defined vehicles, Intel's automotive unit had autonomy over product strategy and customer engagement. Most employees in that unit are expected to lose their jobs as the company shifts focus to its core offerings in client and data center solutions. 

The cuts are part of Intel's larger effort to eliminate layers of bureaucracy and improve execution speed. In an internal communication from April, Tan highlighted a shift in performance measurement, criticizing a past practice where leadership success was tied to the size of one's team. He stated that going forward, efficiency and impact with smaller teams will be Intel's way of operation. 

""I have been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams,"" Lip-Bu Tan wrote in a letter to employees back in April. ""Going forward, this will not be the case. I am a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities."" 

Tan emphasized that leadership would be responsible for determining how best to align personnel changes with the company's strategic priorities, which include laying off 15% to 20% of its personnel. Earlier this month, it turned out that the company will lay off 15% to 20% of its fab staff as well as outsource a significant portion of marketing operations to Accenture, which is projected to use AI to communicate with Intel customers.

Dual-tower, quad-fan performance on a budget.

Chinese PC cooling solutions manufacturer Jiushark has come up with one of the beefiest CPU air coolers that we have seen in a long time. The latest JF15K Diamond incorporates a wide dual-tower heatsink design that can accommodate four cooling fans, six heat-pipes, and a cooling capability of up to 280W.

In case you haven't heard of the brand, we don't blame you. Jiushark is predominantly active in Asian countries and doesn't have a strong presence in the U.S. However, you may remember that the company launched the JF13K Diamond air cooler, which we tested a couple of years ago, featuring a one of a kind top-down airflow design with a 240mm heatsink and dual 120mm slims fans at just $40. This was soon followed by the JF13K Diamond Mini, a smaller version offering a similar design but with smaller 100mm fans with standard thickness.

The new JF15K Diamond turns the dial up a notch with a familiar tower cooler design but with a twist. The heatsinks are so wide that the cooler nearly spans the entire width of a standard motherboard. Think of it as two dual-tower air coolers fused into one massive unit. Notably, the cooler has a height of 153 mm, which means it should fit in most mid-tower and large sized cases without any issues. Additionally, the cooler offers up to 53mm of clearance for memory modules.

As mentioned, the cooler comes with four 100mm PWM fans that are said to operate at speeds ranging from 1,000 to 2,700 RPM ± 10% and 19.49 to 55.46CFM. The fans are also fairly quiet, as the company notes noise values of 19.3 to 30.4dBA. The cooler supports modern Intel and AMD sockets, and is being offered in white and black color variants. Additionally, the JF15K Diamond comes with two ARGB light bars integrated at the top, sitting right above the heatsinks. A standard variant in black will also be available for those who don't fancy ARGB lighting.

The Jiushark JF15K Diamond is currently available via various ecommerce platforms with the black ARGB and white ARGB versions having an MSRP of 280 Yuan ($39), with certain discounts bringing the price down to 260 Yuan ($36.25).

Full finalized spec released.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The HDMI Forum has officially finalized HDMI 2.2, the next generation of the video standard, rolling out to devices throughout the rest of this year. We already saw a bunch of key announcements at CES in January, but now that the full spec is here, it's confirmed that HDMI 2.2 will eclipse DisplayPort in maximum bandwidth support thanks to the new Ultra96 cables.

The key improvement with HDMI 2.2 over its predecessor, HDMI 2.1, is the bump in bandwidth from 48 GB/s to 96 GB/s. In order to ensure a consistent experience across all HDMI 2.2 devices, you'll be seeing new HDMI cables with an ""Ultra96"" label denoting the aforementioned transfer rate capability. These cables will be certified by the HDMI Forum with clear branding that should make them easy to identify.



This new bandwidth unlocks 16K resolution support at 60 Hz and 12K at 120 Hz, but with chroma subsampling. That being said, you can expect 4K 240 Hz at up to 12-bit color depth without any compression. DisplayPort 2.1b UHBR 20 was the first to do this with some monitors already available on the market, but that standard is limited to only 80 GB/s and HDMI 2.2 edges it by just a bit, which allows for even uncompressed 8K at 60 Hz.

It's important to keep in mind that only cables explicitly labeled Ultra96 can allow for all this video goodness. As always, the HDMI Forum will allow manufacturers to make the claim that their devices are HDMI 2.2 compliant, but without actually enforcing the bandwidth rule. Therefore, it's important to look for the Ultra96 label so you know you're getting the real deal.



Thankfully, though, if you don't care about the super high resolutions or frame rates, HDMI 2.2 will be backwards compatible. That means you can use the new cables with older ports (or new ports with older cables) and get the lowest common denominator experience. For instance, if you plug an HDMI 2.2 Ultra96 cable in a TV with only HDMI 2.1 support, you should still get HDMI 2.1 features and speeds without any issues.

Apart from backwards compatibility, HDMI 2.2 will bring another comfort feature called ""Latency Indication Protocol"" (LIP) that will help with syncing audio and video together. This only really matters for large, complicated home theater setups incorporating a lot of speaker channels with receivers and projectors (or screens). If you're part of the crowd, expect reduced lip-sync issues across the board.

The first HDMI 2.2 devices will likely start to roll around toward the last quarter of the year, with AMD's upcoming UDNA GPUs rumored to be among the first to adopt the standard. Little is known about the next-gen Radeon cards, but an earlier leak pointed to limited HDMI 2.2 support for UDNA that would restrict the maximum bandwidth on most models.

As it stands right now, AMD's Radeon Pro cards are the only ones that support the full DisplayPort 2.1b UHBR20 standard, with the RX 9000 series being limited to only 54 GB/s (down from the 80 GB/s maximum). It remains to be seen if AMD pulls something similar with UDNA and only offers the full HDMI 2.2 bandwidth with their workstation GPUs.

User interaction is required, but impact could be severe


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A significant security exploit in WinRAR, the popular file archiver software, was recently reported via Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative. The directory traversal vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-6218 is said to take advantage of how a file compression tool handles directory paths within archive files, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by creating and distributing malicious archives.

Discovered by independent researcher ‘whs3-detonator,' the vulnerability allows an attacker to run harmful code on a victim's computer. Although user interaction is necessary for the attack to be successful, the attacker can essentially manipulate the file paths handled by WinRAR during extraction. By doing so, they can trick the software to place files outside the intended folder, allowing potential access to restricted system directories.

The vulnerability gets a 7.8/10 score on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) which is a standardized framework for assessing and rating the severity of security vulnerabilities. Meaning this vulnerability poses a high risk to confidentiality, as it can expose sensitive data, manipulate system files, and even make a system completely unusable.

RARLAB, the company behind WinRAR and the RAR file format has thankfully patched the vulnerability in its latest beta release. According to the patch notes, WinRAR v7.11 (and earlier) as well as Windows versions of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code and UnRAR.dll are all at risk, while Unix versions of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code, UnRAR library, and RAR for Android, are unaffected. Users are strongly advised to manually update to the latest WinRAR 7.12 Beta 1 release to protect their systems against the CVE-2025-6218 vulnerability.

Given its massive user base of over 500 million users worldwide, WinRAR vulnerabilities are frequently targeted and exploited by a wide range of threat actors. Back in April, we reported an issue that enabled the software to execute without the Windows Mark of the Web (MotW) security pop-up. This is the same Windows alert that warns users against running untrusted software downloaded from the internet. Fortunately, this issue was addressed via the official release notes for WinRAR version 7.11 confirming a patch for the vulnerability and additional technical details about the fix.

DISCLOSURES |  June 25, 2025  

The FDA has extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for the topical formulation of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib as a treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in children aged 2-11 years, according to a press release from the manufacturer.

The new PDUFA date is September 19, 2025, according to the company, Incyte.

The review period for the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for ruxolitinib cream (Opzelura) was extended to provide time for the FDA to review additional data on chemistry, manufacturing, and controls related to the 0.75% formulation, according to the press release.

Topical ruxolitinib cream (1.5%) is approved by the FDA for short-term and noncontinuous chronic treatment of mild-to-moderate AD in patients aged 12 years or older who are not immunocompromised for whom topical prescription therapies are contraindicated or insufficient for disease control. Topical ruxolitinib also is approved for nonsegmental vitiligo in patients aged 12 years or older in the US.

The sNDA for the AD indication in younger children is based on data from a phase 3 study known as TRuE-AD3, in which children aged 2-12 years with mild-to-moderate AD were randomly assigned to 0.75% or 1.5% ruxolitinib cream or a vehicle. In the study, significantly more children treated with ruxolitinib compared with placebo met the primary endpoint of treatment success based on the Investigator's Global Assessment-Treatment Success measure.

Treatment was well-tolerated overall, consistent with previous studies of topical ruxolitinib, with no new safety signals noted. The most common treatment-related adverse event in ruxolitinib-treated patients was application site pain, but no treatment-related events prompted discontinuation, according to the press release.

The TRuE-AD3 study was funded by Incyte.

Music improves mood and memory to such an extent that treatment strategies for diseases like Alzheimer's or dementia sometimes incorporate music. But how music boosts memory remains unclear. In a new JNeurosci paper, Kayla Clark, from Rice University, and Stephanie Leal, from University of California, Los Angeles, explored what features of music improve memory in humans. 

After study participants viewed images of everyday experiences, the researchers played music and manipulated its features. Some features-like whether songs were happy or sad, or song familiarity-had no bearing on how well participants remembered the images. However, individual differences in the strength of emotional responses elicited from music did impact memory recall. Of note, this memory boosting effect was specific to different aspects of memory. Says Clark, ""The more emotional that people became from the music, the more they remembered the gist of a previous event. But people who had more moderate emotional responses to music remembered more details of previous events."" 

According to the authors, their work points to the specificity with which music boosts aspects of memory. The authors emphasize that musical interventions for improving memory in patients may need to be personalized since music does not uniformly enhance memory.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Working in people-contact roles increase risk of type 2 diabetes","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250625/Working-in-people-contact-roles-increase-risk-of-type-2-diabetes.aspx","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

The emotional demands and confrontation inherent in person-contact roles, involving direct face to face or voice to voice interaction with external parties, are linked to a heightened risk of type 2 diabetes, suggests research published online in Occupational & Environmental Medicine.

And inadequate social support from managers and colleagues at work seems to amplify the magnitude of these associations, the findings indicate.

Job strain, job insecurity, workplace violence and bullying, and effort–reward imbalance have all been linked to a heightened risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 

But the potential impact of person-contact roles, which include those requiring interactions with patients, customers, clients, passengers, and students, on this risk isn't known, explain the researchers. 

To explore this further, they extracted information from the Swedish Work, Illness, and labor-market Participation (SWIP) cohort which consists of around 5.4 million 16 to 65 year-olds, registered in Sweden in 2005. 

They confined their study to those aged 30–60 with information on the job they held in 2005, and no history of any type of diagnosed diabetes, or a prescription for antidiabetic drugs in or before 2005. In all, around 3 million people were included in the study.

They assessed 3 dimensions of person-contact roles-general contact with people, emotional demands as a result of dealing with people with serious health or other problems, and confrontation-and the degree of workplace social support using job exposure matrices, based on the Swedish Work Environment Surveys (1997-2013).

For the general contact with people dimension, the researchers calculated the proportion of survey respondents answering 'roughly ¾ of the time' or 'almost all the time'. For emotional demands and confrontation, they calculated the proportion of those answering 'a few days a week' or 'every day'. 

They included 20 job roles in sectors with the highest level of exposure to each of the 3 dimensions. These include healthcare, education, service industries, hospitality, social work, law, security, and transport.

Between 2006 and 2020, 216,640 people (60% men) developed type 2 diabetes. They tended to be older, more likely to be born outside Sweden, and to have a lower level of education and low job control than those who didn't develop the condition.

In both women and men, high levels of exposure to all 3 dimensions were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. But in women, the heightened risk associated with general contact with people disappeared after accounting for level of job control.

High levels of exposure to emotional demands and confrontation were, respectively, associated with 20% and 15% heightened risks of type 2 diabetes in men, and 24% and 20% heightened risks, respectively, in women.

The associations between these two dimensions and type 2 diabetes were stronger among those with low levels of workplace social support than they were among those with high levels, with the highest risk (47% greater) in women whose roles entailed high emotional demands, but who had low social support at work.

The findings support the notion that working in people-contact roles is stressful and that this can ultimately affect workers' metabolic health, say the researchers.

They acknowledge various limitations to their findings. For example, they used job exposure matrices which can't capture variations in individual experiences or feelings or work environment within a given occupation. And information on people's entire job history and potentially influential lifestyle behaviours wasn't available either.

Nevertheless, they explain: ""With regards to having contact with people at work, there are expectations for emotional management where workers are required to express or hide emotions according to societal, occupational and organisational norms. It is especially stressful when the displayed emotion and the genuinely felt emotion are not aligned."" 

They continue: ""Workers in human service occupations, such as healthcare professionals and social workers, take responsibility for the fundamental human needs of clients and witness human suffering, and in most cases, there is no reciprocity in relations with clients and patients. These are potential stressors that can result in compassion fatigue, burnout, and mental health problems among workers in such occupations."" 

The biological mechanisms underlying the associations found may involve chronic stress that affects the neuroendocrine system, leading to excessive cortisol production, increased insulin resistance, and decreased insulin secretion and sensitivity, they suggest.

And these biochemical reactions may be made worse by a lack of social support in the workplace, they add.

Major cuts to Medicaid funding could have rural communities across the country facing widespread hospital closures and reduced access to health care, says Michael Shepherd, a health policy researcher at the University of Michigan. 

Shepherd, assistant professor of health management and policy at the U-M School of Public Health, studies the politics and policies surrounding rural health disparities, including rural hospital closures, the opioid epidemic and Medicaid policy. His research focuses on what he calls the “rural health spiral,” how worsening health outcomes in rural areas can create a cycle where problems rarely get solved and support for government solutions decreases over time. 

He recently co-authored an op-ed examining how proposed budget cuts would disproportionately harm rural communities. Here, Shepherd discusses what these proposed changes could mean.

Medicaid is incredibly vital for rural people, not only those who benefit directly, but for the survival of rural health care institutions that serve everyone. Twenty-three percent of rural Americans are insured by Medicaid, compared to 19% nationally. About half of rural children are covered by Medicaid, and it pays for over half of rural births.

Rural hospitals, mental health clinics and doctors' offices depend heavily on Medicaid reimbursements. Cuts to Medicaid threaten institutions that serve the broader rural public, even those with employer-sponsored or private insurance.

Take McNairy County, Tennessee. In 2016, they lost their regional hospital, mostly because the state didn't expand Medicaid. When it closed, residents had to drive 45 minutes to an hour for care. If you're on Tennessee Medicaid, you can't cross the state border to Mississippi for covered care—you have to use in-state options that are even farther away.

Research shows that when a rural hospital closes, patients travel, on average, 20 miles farther for common care and 40 miles farther for specialized care. Every additional mile increases your health care risk for emergencies like strokes or heart attacks. Studies also show rural hospital closures lead to significant increases in mortality, and birthing outcomes and obstetric care suffer following closures.

Hospitals in rural communities are often the largest employers.The health care sector can supply as many as 10% of the jobs in a rural community. Most rural areas don't have large employers beyond their public schools or hospitals.

If a hospital closes, you're talking about increasing unemployment, lowering incomes and people leaving the community to find work elsewhere. It's not just that people on Medicaid may lose benefits—everybody may lose access to health care, and many people will lose their jobs.

Even community mental health providers are very Medicaid-dependent. If you withdraw Medicaid benefits, people won't be able to access their mental health providers because those clinics rely on federal funding and Medicaid clients to stay open.

States that expanded Medicaid saw rural hospital closures drop to close to zero, while non-expansion states experienced continued spikes. My research shows that roughly 80% of rural hospitals that closed since the Affordable Care Act have been in Republican states that failed to expand Medicaid.

According to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, over 300 rural hospitals currently face “immediate risk” of closure—and that's without these proposed cuts. Rural hospitals operate on shoestring budgets and stay open primarily because of Medicaid reimbursements. These cuts would dramatically increase closure rates.

This gets at what we call “accountability” in political science—whether voters can connect policy outcomes to the politicians responsible for them. There's a lot of research that shows voters often struggle to assign responsibility correctly, especially when policies have complex, delayed effects.

What I found in my research is that even when state Republicans chose not to expand Medicaid—which ultimately led to worse outcomes for rural hospitals—voters blamed Democrats and the Affordable Care Act for their experiences. This creates what I call the “rural health spiral,” the worse things get, the less rural people trust government solutions, which leads to support for politicians who are less likely to use government to fix problems.

My research shows this pattern where Republicans can actually benefit politically from decisions that make things worse for their voters, while Democrats get penalized despite passing policies that objectively help similar communities. It's a function of our federal system, where national policies can have very different outcomes depending on state-level decisions, but voters often assign credit or blame to the president's party regardless.

Even people who aren't on Medicaid should be alarmed. If you live in a rural community, you're likely to lose access to health care yourself if these cuts happen, regardless of whether you have Medicaid.

What's remarkable is that Medicaid is popular across party lines. Survey data shows that 61% of Republicans, 71% of Independents and 83% of Democrats see Medicaid as important to their communities. These cuts aren't what people are demanding.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New pretreatment method boosts islet transplant survival in diabetes","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250625/New-pretreatment-method-boosts-islet-transplant-survival-in-diabetes.aspx","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 07:32:00 GMT","

A pretreatment step could help transplanted pancreatic islets survive longer in patients with type 1 diabetes, according to a new preclinical study from Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. One combination of small molecules extended the cells' lives in female mice, and adding two molecules to the mixture boosted cell survival in male mice.

The findings, published on June 24 in Cell Stem Cell, could allow physicians to treat more patients with fewer cells.

In type 1 diabetes, autoimmune cells attack the pancreatic islets, destroying the insulin-producing beta cells and leaving patients dependent on insulin injections. The current FDA-approved transplant procedure replaces these cells with pancreatic islet cells from one or more deceased organ donors. It typically takes up to 48 hours to isolate islets from the donor for injection into a vein that carries them to the recipient's liver. Once in the liver, the islet cells begin producing insulin, just as they would in a healthy pancreas.

However, many transplanted cells die soon after the procedure, and complications can arise from targeting the liver. Transplanting the cells under the skin, an option with some potential advantages, also has challenges with dying cells. Dr. Shuibing Chen, the Kilts Family Professor of Surgery and director of the Center for Genomic Health at Weill Cornell Medicine, noted research by others showing that pretreating a type of cell used to replenish blood cell populations during a six-hour period improves their survival after a transplant, so she explored a similar approach for islet cells.

""With our new strategy, we should only need one donor per patient, or maybe one donor could contribute cells to two patients, lessening the waiting time for patients to receive the therapy,"" said Dr. Chen, who is also a member of the Hartman Institute for Therapeutic Organ Regeneration at Weill Cornell Medicine.

Determining the best pretreatment approach typically requires several expensive and labor-intensive drug screens, but J. Jeya Vandana, graduate student in the Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology and first author of the paper, had an idea. ""Jeya combined chemical screens with single cell RNA-sequencing technology so that we could check multiple readouts in one experiment,"" said Dr. Chen.

With their system, which they call ChemPerturb-Seq, each cell in an experiment receives a unique barcode and is treated for 48 hours with a unique small molecule drug. After the treatment, the team pools the cells and sequences the RNA. The barcode tells the researchers which cells responded well to a certain molecule. All the data are made publicly available through a website called ChemPerturbDB, which is powered by an artificial intelligence assistant that is similar to ChatGPT.

Performing ChemPerturb-Seq with a human beta cell line led to discovery of a pretreatment they called LIP. This combination of beta-lipotropin, insulin growth factor-1 and prostaglandin E2 boosted the survival of beta cells and human islets from donors when transplanted subcutaneously in a type-1 diabetes mouse model compared to controls. But there was a catch.

Jeya first transplanted everything into female mice, and the approach worked very well, but when she transplanted the pretreated cells into male mice, it failed.""

Going back to the drawing board, the team used ChemPerturb-Seq to predict other small molecules that could help the cells live longer in males. The result was a cocktail called LIPHS, which included the three LIP molecules plus histamine and serotonin, that was successful in males.

Armed with their new technique, Dr. Chen's group will conduct more studies to see whether the results hold for additional preclinical models. The team is also adding even more small-molecule data to the website.

As we age, extreme heat causes many heat-related illnesses that can lead to serious health issues. A new study from the University of California, Irvine's Joe C. Wen School of Population & Public Health adds to that list.

The UC Irvine researchers have discovered that the combined effects of aging and heat waves are putting people's health at greater risk by weakening gut and immune system function, which heightens our risk of infection from a deadly, waterborne bacterium called Vibrio vulnificus that is increasingly found in warmer ocean waters.

With more frequent and intense heat waves and the population continuing to age, this research, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, offers insight into how these two factors work together to weaken the immune system, damage the gut, and elevate the risk of severe infection. The work was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

As many around the world experience record-breaking June heat waves, the study arrives at a crucial moment in the ongoing effort to understand how rising temperatures affect human health.

While Vibrio vulnificus infections are already a growing concern in warming coastal regions, our findings show that extreme heat, especially with older individuals, may further compromise the immune system and gut microbiome in ways that make people more susceptible. It's a double hit: Aging weakens immune defenses, and heat stress accelerates that decline.""

Saurabh Chatterjee, corresponding author, professor of environmental & occupational health, and medicine

As V. vulnificus infections and extreme heat events increase, key scientific gaps have made it difficult to assess infection risk. Until now, researchers have lacked a clear understanding of how prolonged heat affects the gut microbiome, immune response and infection vulnerability in older people.

To address this, the UC Irvine team exposed both young and aged mice to climate-relevant heat and conducted microbiome sequencing along with tests for gut integrity and immune function. The aged mice showed significantly more damage to the intestinal barrier, systemic inflammation, immune dysfunction and antibiotic-resistant genes in the gut microbiome than their younger counterparts.

This work is the first to connect climate-driven heat stress with gut and immune disruption that raises susceptibility to V. vulnificus. It also identifies a potential avenue for treatment: Aged mice treated with a beneficial gut microbe (Roseburia intestinalis) demonstrated restored immune cell function and reduced signs of infection. Reintroducing key probiotics helped improve intestinal health and regulate the immune system. The results suggest that supporting gut health may be key to boosting immune resilience during heat exposure.

New research reveals how junk food during adolescence rewires critical brain regions, increasing the risk for poor decision-making and obesity well into adulthood.

Study: Adolescent nutritional influences on the brain: implications for eating behaviors. Image Credit: Yuriy Golub / Shutterstock

Researchers have recently reviewed the existing literature to understand how an adolescent's eating behavior affects the development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC), as well as overall health. This narrative review synthesizes both animal and human studies to clarify these relationships and current knowledge gaps. The research is published in the journal Neuropharmacology.

The transition from childhood to adolescence also involves a shift from dependence on direct control mechanisms linked to food and sensory receptors to an increasing reliance on indirect control mechanisms that facilitate adjustments in one's eating behavior.

In contrast to children whose eating behavior is primarily determined by hunger and fullness cues, adolescents' eating behavior is significantly influenced by multiple external factors, including personal beliefs, media, food preferences, and peer pressure. The modern food environment features easy-to-access, highly palatable foods with high levels of fat, sugar, and salt, often directly marketed to adolescents. These ingredients typically increase food cravings by bypassing the normal regulatory controls.

Multiple studies have shown that compared to children, adolescents are more commonly inclined towards consuming hyper-palatable and ultra-processed foods (UPF), which are widely available in Western countries. These studies have also pointed out that adolescents are the highest consumers of high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) foods, which cause obesity and metabolic disease. According to U.S. data, ultra-processed foods account for approximately 65% of total energy intake among adolescents, who also have the highest intake of added sugars. In the last three decades, a rapid increase in the prevalence of adolescent obesity has been recorded, with rates having quadrupled during this period.

The PFC region of the brain is involved in executive functions, including sustained attention, higher-order cognition, planning, decision-making, and inhibitory control. This part of the brain is not fully developed in humans until around the age of twenty-four. The PFC involves the integration of sensory signals to discriminate food palatability, responses to food cues, and discriminate food palatability. It also weighs the rewarding aspects of hyperpalatable foods against potential consequences as part of the brain's reward system.

The HPC is another region of the developing adolescent brain linked to feeding behavior. It regulates the episodic meal-related memories and conditional learned associations between food-related stimuli and post-ingestive signals. Impaired hippocampal activity leads to decreased memory of meals and increased response to food cues, resulting in elevated meal frequency, total energy intake, and weight gain. Animal studies suggest that the hippocampus' structural and functional development during adolescence is especially sensitive to diet quality, with human research showing correlations between poor dietary habits and memory impairments.

Excessive consumption of calorically dense yet nutrient-poor foods throughout adolescence impacts the neurocognitive development of the PFC. Much of the mechanistic evidence for this comes from animal studies, with human evidence being largely correlational (e.g., brain imaging studies linking diet, PFC volume, and cognitive performance). This impaired development has a long-lasting impact on eating behavior, contributing to diet-induced obesity in adulthood.

Adolescent rats fed an HFHS diet for just a month exhibited a reduced number of fast-acting parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which disrupts neuroplasticity. Notably, adolescent rodents exposed to a Western diet for as little as one week exhibited rapid onset of anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, a vulnerability not observed in adults.

HFHS foods were found to promote impulsivity, especially during adolescence. For example, animal studies have shown that adolescent rodents exposed to these diets exhibit increased impulsivity and reduced inhibitory control, and that baseline sex differences in these effects may exist, although further research is needed to confirm this in humans. The review highlights that males may experience greater and more persistent impulsivity, while females show a gradual emergence of these behaviors. Many animal-based studies have shown that GABAergic communication in the PFC is influenced by diet. For instance, adolescent rodents fed a high-fat and sucrose diet independently for two months showed a decreased GABA concentration and a reduced number of iGABAergic PV+ interneurons in the PFC and hippocampus. These changes in the brain regions are associated with impaired cognition and behavioral control.

Hyperpalatable foods activate the mesocorticolimbic pathway, encouraging further reward-seeking behavior. Experimental studies have shown that in comparison to control-fed rodents, those under a high-fat diet exhibited upregulation in D1 dopamine receptors and increased neuronal activation in the PFC, which increases reward-seeking behavior. In humans, elevated reward responsivity to food has been associated with increased body mass index. The review notes that over-engagement with such foods during adolescence may cause lasting changes in reward signaling, with some animal studies showing epigenetic changes that persist into adulthood.

Rodents fed with high-fat food demonstrated increased oxidative stress in the hippocampus, higher memory impairments, anxiety, and decreased social interaction. Similarly, rodents fed high-fructose corn syrup, a key ingredient in most soda drinks, exhibited impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory in both male and female rats.

A previous study has also shown that the size and volume of the hippocampus are impacted by HFHS food consumption. Specifically, fat intake is associated with reductions in left hippocampal volume (linked to verbal memory), whereas increased dietary fructose is linked to increases in the right hippocampus (associated with spatial memory), reflecting possible lateralized hippocampal functions. Besides fat, higher dietary intake of fructose is associated with an increase in the volume of the right hippocampus, which could be due to delayed synaptic pruning or inflammation. However, the review cautions that the significance and consequences of such volume changes are not fully understood, and findings are sometimes contradictory (e.g., some studies find reduced hippocampal volume with fat intake, others see increases with fructose).

Many studies have confirmed that early life HFHS diet impairs the structural and functional signaling of the hippocampus, which negatively impacts hippocampal-dependent memory and learning. In comparison to control-fed rats, the HFHS diet increases hippocampal lesions, which in turn elevate meal frequency and appetitive responding, ultimately leading to obesity. Additionally, animal research indicates that a Western diet during adolescence can increase blood-brain barrier permeability in the hippocampus, thereby further impairing cognitive function.

Importantly, some of these diet-induced effects may not be fully reversible even after a healthy dietary intervention in adulthood, particularly when exposure occurs during critical periods of brain development in adolescence.

Taken together, the habitual feeding behaviors developed during adolescence may trigger long-lasting alterations in brain circuitry that could influence health throughout the lifespan. While much of the mechanistic evidence is derived from animal studies, human epidemiological and neuroimaging data are generally consistent with these findings; however, direct causal pathways require further investigation.

Despite environmental promise, insect-based foods remain a niche as taste, price, and tradition keep meat and plant-based options on top. Can bugs ever break through to the mainstream?

Review: Beyond the buzz: insect-based foods are unlikely to significantly reduce meat consumption. Image Credit: Charoen Krung Photography / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the journal npj Sustainable Agriculture, a group of authors determined whether insect-derived protein products can realistically replace conventional meat in everyday Western diets.

Would you swap your burger for bugs? As the environmental impact of livestock farming grows, with meat consumption predicted to be responsible for 37% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions permissible under a 2°C climate target by 2030, pressure to curb meat intake is rising. Insects promise high protein with a lighter environmental footprint, attracting startup funding and policy enthusiasm. Y

et acceptance across Europe and North America rarely exceeds 30% of consumers, and most would pay less, not more, for insect products. Environmental campaigns alone have not changed taste-driven habits grounded in culture, price, and convenience.

Further research is needed to clarify whether insects can overcome these still truly complex social and market obstacles.

Taste, tradition, and perceived health status keep steak at the center of many plates. Mouth-coating fats deliver a savory punch that insect flours struggle to mimic. Meat also signals prosperity and family identity at barbecues, holiday feasts, and business dinners. Price drives choices as well; powerful lobbying and scale efficiencies keep beef and poultry inexpensive relative to novel proteins.

In the EU, for instance, livestock farmers have received 1200 times more public funding than alternative protein groups, and lobbying from the meat industry has even influenced reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Convenience matters, too: supermarkets, fast-food chains, and meal-kit apps place animal products within easy reach, while insects remain online novelties or limited-edition snacks. Any alternative must satisfy this sensory, cultural, and economic bundle to win repeat purchases.

Online delivery widens the gap: a single tap summons chicken wings, while insect products often require specialty websites and week-long shipping, eroding instant-gratification expectations.

Surveys conducted across the United States (US), Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), and Italy reveal that fewer than 30% of adults would consider trying insect dishes, and even fewer would serve them at home. Disgust (a protective emotion linked to disease avoidance) surfaces when people picture antennae or feel the sensation of crunchy legs.

In Western cultures, insects are often associated with disease, dirt, and decay, and their consumption is sometimes perceived as a marker of a “primitive” lifestyle. This is compounded by the potential use of food scraps as insect feed, a practice that Western consumers may not be receptive to.

Food neophobia, the reluctance to taste unfamiliar items, amplifies this reaction, especially in older consumers. Social cues deepen the gap: Western media frame insect eating as a reality-show stunt, and dinner companions signal hesitancy with a single eyebrow raise.

These intangible forces create a wall higher than any nutritional chart can climb. Children form taste memories early, and schools rarely feature insect dishes, so generational turnover alone cannot guarantee acceptance within crucial climate timelines.

Overview of factors required to switch from conventional meat to insect-based meat substitutes.

Entrepreneurs grind crickets into powders and bake them into protein bars, hoping invisibility will bypass disgust. While the tactic lifts willingness to sample, it rarely sustains weekly demand. Crucially, approximately 90% of the current insect-based food market consists of products, such as snacks, pasta, or bars, that do not directly compete with meat.

Shoppers still compare the bar to a plant-based counterpart that is cheaper, sweeter, and free of crunch memories. Since insects generally have a higher environmental impact than plants, incorporating them into these items is likely detrimental from a sustainability perspective.

Eco-labels touting lower GHG emissions add marginal appeal, but everyday eaters prioritize taste and habit over distant climate metrics.

Educational tastings at museums generate social-media buzz yet falter at the checkout line; repeated exposure helps some adventurous groups, but scaling that immersive experience to millions would drain marketing budgets faster than venture capital arrives.

Scarce shelf space compounds the mindset problem. Few large grocers allocate chilled sections to insect analogues, so interested consumers cannot build a reliable routine.

Production costs remain high because farms must maintain strict daily temperature and humidity controls, as well as feed controls, to prevent pathogens, which contrasts with soybeans that grow in open fields.

Investment patterns reinforce these challenges: in 2022, the vast majority of funding for insect farming, approximately 95%, or 1.2 billion USD, was directed toward animal feed and pet food, with less than 1% supporting insect-based products for human consumption.

Regulators add another layer, as the European Union (EU) now allows specific species in baked goods and pasta, but novel food approvals remain slow, and labeling disputes over words like ""burger"" or ""sausage"" mirror earlier battles faced by oat and almond beverages.

Plant-based meat alternatives such as soy or pea burgers already occupy mainstream menus, from Burger King to grocery freezer aisles, and taste tests show steady improvements in juiciness and grill marks. Their environmental profiles surpass those of poultry and rival insect protein, while avoiding perceived health risks such as allergy concerns and visual stigma.

Crucially, supply chains for legumes have enjoyed decades of agronomic optimization, allowing unit costs to decrease. As a result, shoppers seeking lower-impact proteins can satisfy ethical goals without confronting bug-related unease.

If insects cannot deliver a clear sensory or price advantage, they risk fragmenting attention and investment that could accelerate broader dietary shifts toward plants.

Existing studies focus heavily on hypothetical willingness to try insects rather than real cash transactions. Few studies track long-term consumption patterns or examine how community identity shapes food loyalty.

Sensory science must still decode how to replicate the Maillard-rich (the chemical reaction responsible for browning and flavor) aroma of seared meat using insect oils or pastes, and economists need transparent cost curves from pilot to industrial scale.

Comparative life-cycle assessments should include realistic scenarios where insects replace plant snacks, not beef steaks, to gauge net climate outcomes.

Finally, sociologists could explore whether targeted niches such as high-protein sports powders or emergency rations offer footholds that do not compete head-on with beloved comfort foods.

Current evidence shows that insect-based foods must overcome significant barriers before they can reduce meat consumption. They currently fall short in terms of taste familiarity, price, availability, and social acceptance, while competing directly with increasingly popular plant-derived substitutes.

Investment patterns, regulatory caution, and consumer psychology all reinforce a cycle of limited scale. Because plant-based alternatives are more advanced and accepted, insects risk diverting resources away from more effective climate solutions. Unless future research uncovers niche uses that deliver clear sensory or economic gains, insects may remain peripheral in Western diets.

Policymakers and entrepreneurs may therefore achieve faster climate and health benefits by prioritizing plant-based innovation and addressing the cultural roots of meat attachment, while longitudinal trials could test targeted interventions.

Fusion genes, arising from abnormal chromosomal rearrangements, are gaining recognition as pivotal players in cancer development. These genetic alterations result in the creation of hybrid genes with altered functions, often driving tumor progression. The latest review highlights their significant role across various cancers, including hematological malignancies, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and prostate cancer. As researchers deepen their understanding of these genetic mechanisms, new avenues for precision cancer therapies are emerging.

The review underscores the biological impact of fusion genes on tumor formation. By disrupting normal cellular processes, these genetic alterations lead to uncontrolled proliferation, evasion of cell death, and enhanced metastatic potential. BCR-ABL, EML4-ALK, and PML-RARα are among the most studied fusion genes, each playing a crucial role in specific cancer types. The presence of these genes has revolutionized cancer diagnostics, allowing for more precise classification and prognostic assessments.

From a therapeutic standpoint, fusion genes represent valuable targets for drug development. The introduction of targeted therapies has transformed treatment outcomes, particularly in cancers such as chronic myeloid leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs designed to inhibit aberrant fusion proteins have significantly improved survival rates and reduced side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. However, challenges remain, including the emergence of resistance mechanisms that can diminish drug efficacy.

Advancements in genomic sequencing technologies have accelerated the detection of fusion genes, enabling the identification of previously unknown genetic alterations. Techniques such as RNA sequencing and liquid biopsy provide non-invasive methods for detecting these genes, paving the way for real-time monitoring of tumor evolution. Such innovations enhance the potential for early intervention and personalized treatment strategies.

Despite these breakthroughs, researchers emphasize the need to overcome key challenges in fusion gene research. Understanding the functional diversity of fusion genes, their interactions with tumor microenvironments, and their role in treatment resistance remains crucial. Future efforts aim to refine therapeutic strategies by developing next-generation inhibitors and combination therapies tailored to specific genetic alterations.

As the landscape of cancer treatment evolves, fusion genes stand at the forefront of precision medicine, offering new hope for patients. With continuous advancements in genomic research and targeted drug development, the potential to turn these genetic anomalies into therapeutic opportunities is greater than ever.

Omega-3 fatty acids, popularly believed to reduce inflammation in the body, appear to increase certain inflammatory markers, researchers have found.

Dr. Daisy Crick from The University of Queensland's Institute of Molecular Bioscience looked at the role of omega-3 and omega-6 in the body as part of her PhD studies at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol and said the findings challenge commonly held views.

We tend to regard omega-3 as anti-inflammatory and omega-6 as pro-inflammatory, but the relationship of these polyunsaturated fatty acids is more complex.

Surprisingly, we found omega-3 fats could increase certain markers of inflammation in the body"".

This result was maintained even when we accounted for other possible influences such as triglycerides, a type of fat found in the blood, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol known as 'bad' cholesterol.''

Dr. Daisy Crick, The University of Queensland's Institute of Molecular Bioscience

The research used the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children which collected data from people at birth through to adulthood over the past 30 years. 

Researchers measured inflammation using biomarkers in the blood and found higher levels of omega-3 fats – naturally occurring in oily fish and commonly taken in supplements for anti-inflammatory benefits – were actually associated with increased levels of inflammation.

 Additionally, a larger omega-6-to-omega-3 ratio was also consistently associated with higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers found in the body.

In other words, too much omega-6 relative to omega-3 may increase inflammation.

Dr. Crick said the results were confirmed using another large dataset, the UK Biobank, which includes information from almost 500,000 people.

The team then applied Mendelian randomisation, a scientific technique that uses genetics to help understand cause-and-effect relationships by mimicking a randomised control trial.

Again, they found omega-3 and omega-6 increased levels of some biomarkers of inflammation.

""The belief that omega-3 fats lower inflammation and mitigates the risk of non-communicable diseases has led to popular diets like the Mediterranean diet and the use of supplements,'' Dr Crick said.

""But the previously believed relationship that omega-3 reduces levels of inflammation, may not be always correct. 

""Our findings suggest that the dietary fatty acids and inflammation relationship is more complex than previously thought and it might be more useful to look at the balance (or ratio) between omega-6 and omega-3 in the diet.''

Study senior author Dr. Hannah Jones of the (MRC) Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol and senior author of the study, said the relationship between fatty acids and inflammation is complex and the findings may only tell part of the story.

""Although our findings show that omega-3 fats are associated with increases of some biomarkers of inflammation, they don't rule out other potential beneficial effects of these fatty acids in the diet,'' Dr Jones said.

""Inflammation is complex, and further research using additional biomarkers is needed before drawing firm conclusions about dietary omega-3 fats."" 

The research is published in International Journal of Epidemiology.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Men face silent threat of weak bones and fractures","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250625/Men-face-silent-threat-of-weak-bones-and-fractures.aspx","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 16:51:00 GMT","

Weak bones can have deadly consequences. Women often get bone density tests to screen for osteoporosis, yet many men don't even realize they are at risk until they suffer a major fracture. 

June is Men's Health Awareness Month, with a focus on raising awareness about osteoporosis in men.

A new survey commissioned by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center among U.S. adults finds that only 1% of men are concerned about bone density. 

This concerns Paul Lewis, MD, an interventional radiologist at Ohio State Wexner Medical Center. 

""It's a silent disease, and it's silent until it makes some noise, and how it makes noise is with a fracture,"" said Lewis, who often treats patients with spinal and pelvic fractures. 

The National Spine Health Foundation estimates that 2 million men have osteoporosis, while another 16 million men have low bone mass known as osteopenia. 

The Ohio State survey found cancer (32%) is the number one concern when it comes to men's health, followed closely by heart disease (30%). Other top concerns include obesity (18%) and sexual health (8%).

With so many other pressing medical concerns, men often are surprised to learn they have osteoporosis. The disease, which means porous bones, causes a gradual loss of bone density and strength, which puts individuals at higher risk for broken bones, even from minor falls.

A fracture for an older adult can be deadly, which is why prevention is key, Lewis said.

 ""If you don't participate in resistance training as early as 30 years old, 40 years old, you can start losing up to 3% of your bone mass per year,"" said Lewis, who also is an associate professor in The Ohio State University College of Medicine.

It is possible to build back bone density with exercise, nutrition and by not smoking or drinking alcohol excessively. 

If we maintain more active lifestyles longer in life, we do anticipate less bone loss.""

Paul Lewis, MD, interventional radiologist, Ohio State Wexner Medical Center

In addition, once someone develops spinal fractures due to osteoporosis, interventional radiologists can treat them with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty procedures.

During kyphoplasty, a small balloon is inserted into the fractured vertebra and inflated to create a cavity. Bone cement (a synthetic material made of polymethyl methacrylate) is then injected into the cavity to stabilize the fracture and treat the pain. 

Vertebroplasty involves injecting bone cement directly into the fractured vertebra without using a balloon, providing immediate stabilization and pain relief.

""Both procedures aim to relieve pain, restore vertebral height and enhance spinal stability, allowing patients to regain function and mobility. They are performed under a twilight sedation and fluoroscopic imaging guidance. Patients experience minimal downtime and faster recovery compared to open surgery,"" Lewis said.

The loss of the hormone testosterone also contributes to weak bones, which is why men need to be more mindful of osteoporosis as they age. Lewis recommends that men should start this conversation with their doctor at age 30, giving themselves plenty of time to prevent weak and porous bones. 

Lewis explains the consequences of not treating osteoporosis early.

""We're treating more than just a fracture; we're treating the whole person,"" Lewis said. ""They'll be more active and they'll be more independent. They won't be as isolated because of this pain and staying at home or staying in a chair.""

This study was conducted by SSRS on its Opinion Panel Omnibus platform. The SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus is a national, twice-per-month, probability-based survey. Data collection was conducted from May 2 – May 5, 2025, among a sample of 1,008 respondents. The survey was conducted via web (n=978) and telephone (n=30) and administered in English. The margin of error for total respondents is +/-3.6 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus data are weighted to represent the target population of U.S. adults ages 18 or older.

For the first time in the world, a Korean research team discovered how cellular aging can spread systemically through the bloodstream-offering new insights and a potential therapeutic strategy to combat aging-related decline.

Professor Ok Hee Jeon's research group at the Department of Convergence Medicine, Korea University's College of Medicine, discovered that High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1),a key extracellular senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factor, plays a critical role in transmitting senescence from aging cells to distant tissues.

Senescent cells are known to secrete pro-inflammatory factors and signaling molecules-collectively known as SASP-which induce paracrine senescence in surrounding cells. Over time, these senescent cells accumulate in various tissues, impairing regenerative capacity and contributing to tissue dysfunction. However, the mechanism by which senescence spreads systemically remained unclear.

In their latest study published in Metabolism – Clinical and Experimental (Impact Factor 10.9, top 4.6% in endocrinology and metabolism), Professor Jeon's team provides the first evidence that reduced HMGB1 (ReHMGB1), a redox-sensitive isoform of HMGB1, circulates through the bloodstream and induces senescence in remote tissues.

Using both in vitro and in vivo models, the researchers demonstrated that extracellular ReHMGB1, but not its oxidized form (OxHMGB1), robustly induces senescence-like features in multiple human cell types-including fibroblasts, renal epithelial cells, and skeletal muscle cells. Mice systemically treated with ReHMGB1 exhibited elevated senescence markers (p21, p16), increased SASP factor expression, and impaired muscle function.

Furthermore, in a muscle injury model in middle-aged mice, administration of anti-HMGB1 antibodies not only reduced senescence markers but also enhanced muscle regeneration and improved physical performance. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting extracellular HMGB1 to reverse or mitigate age-related tissue dysfunction.

This study reveals that aging signals are not confined to individual cells but can be systemically transmitted via the blood, with ReHMGB1 acting as a key driver. By blocking this pathway, we were able to restore tissue regenerative capacity, suggesting a promising strategy to treat aging-related diseases.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Artificial intelligence advances early detection and management of myopia","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250625/Artificial-intelligence-advances-early-detection-and-management-of-myopia.aspx","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 16:43:00 GMT","

The increasing prevalence of myopia is a global health concern, with high myopia increasing the risk of vision damage. This necessitates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for early diagnosis, prevention, and management of myopia. Now, a Pediatric Investigation review sheds light on potential applications of AI in the early identification, risk assessment, and prevention of myopia. It further highlights the challenges and current development status of AI technology in the field of myopia.

Myopia, or nearsightedness, affects two billion people worldwide. Uncorrected myopia can impair vision, disrupting education, career prospects, and quality of life. By 2050, nearly half of the global population is estimated to become myopic. High myopia is often associated with complications that can lead to visual impairment, affecting patients' quality of life and increasing the global medical and economic burden. Therefore, early diagnosis of myopia is important for the prevention of vision damage in patients with myopia.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has opened up new frontiers in the medical field and may be a solution to this global health concern. The subsets of AI, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can help analyze data to diagnose diseases and predict risk factors, biomarkers, and outcomes.

In a new literature review, Dr. Li Li, Dr. Jifeng Yu, and Dr. Nan Liu, all from the Department of Ophthalmology, Capital Medical University, China, have summarized the applications and challenges of AI in myopia, including detection, risk factor assessment, and prediction models. This study was published in the journal of Pediatric Investigation on 18 March 2025.

Interestingly, AI models can be trained using ML/DL to detect myopia from fundus photos and optical coherence tomography images. By feeding a model with a large quantity of fundus images from myopic patients, the AI can be taught to discern minute changes in color and pattern in the retina that are associated with myopia. This allows the model to diagnose future patients from their fundus photos.

In addition, self-monitoring equipment such as SVOne, a handheld device that uses a wavefront sensor to measure eye defects, can use AI algorithms to detect refractive errors in the eyes. The device could access an online database of images, which the AI can use as a reference to diagnose myopia. Moreover, AI can be trained to detect behavioral changes associated with the onset of myopia. Such detection is especially useful for the early detection of myopia in children, which is often ignored otherwise. For example, the Vivior monitor uses ML algorithms to note changes in visual behaviors, such as time spent on near vision activities, in children aged 6-16 years.

Furthermore, ML methods like support vector machine, logistic regression, and XGBoost can be employed to identify risk factors of myopia. ""An XGBoost-based model can be fed large quantities of longitudinal data, allowing it to learn the outcomes and associated risk factors of myopia in numerous patients. This, in turn, allows the model to assess the risk factors of new patients based on their genetics, family history, environment, and physiological parameters,"" explains Dr. Li Li.

Predicting the progression and outcome of myopia can help doctors adjust their clinical approach. Taken on a large scale, it can shape clinical practice and policymaking that help in myopia control. By feeding an AI model large quantities of biometric data, refractive data, treatment responses, and ocular images from numerous myopia patients, the AI can be taught to predict outcomes of myopia in new patients.

Despite the great potential of AI in myopia, several challenges need to be overcome. Firstly, it is important to ensure that the dataset used to train an AI model is correct and of high quality. Bias, false negatives/positives, and poor data quality can negatively impact the diagnostic and prediction accuracy of the model. Secondly, most AI models are trained using data from large hospitals, which may not be representative of patients going to smaller clinics. This creates a discrepancy between real-world and training populations. Thirdly, an AI model is not a trained doctor and may not be able to provide a clinical basis for its diagnosis, which can cause the diagnosis to be rejected by medical professionals. Finally, with such vast quantities of patient data used to train AI models, it is important to ensure the privacy of patients' medical records.

""While our study highlights the remarkable progress made in the clinical application of AI in myopia, further studies are needed to overcome the technological challenges. By building high-quality datasets, improving the model's capacity to process multimodal image data, and improving human-computer interaction capability, the AI models can be further improved for widespread clinical application,"" concludes Dr. Jifeng Yu.

Recent findings shed new light on the critical role of TET1, a pivotal player in epigenetic regulation, in the development and progression of various clinical diseases. As an enzyme responsible for DNA demethylation, TET1 influences gene expression by modifying methylcytosine levels, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function.

A deeper understanding of TET1's function has unveiled its dual role in disease progression. In certain cancers, TET1 acts as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting malignant cell growth by preventing the hypermethylation of crucial regulatory genes. Conversely, in other cancer types, TET1 upregulation has been linked to tumor progression, driving oncogenic pathways that enhance cell proliferation, invasion, and survival. The complexity of TET1's behavior highlights its interaction with multiple signaling pathways, making it both a target for therapeutic intervention and a marker for disease prognosis.

Beyond cancer, TET1 plays an integral role in neurological disorders, metabolic diseases, and autoimmune conditions. In the brain, TET1 contributes to neural plasticity and cognitive function, with dysregulation implicated in disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and bipolar disorder. Studies suggest that abnormal TET1 activity can disrupt critical epigenetic mechanisms, affecting gene expression patterns related to neurodevelopment and synaptic function.

In the realm of metabolic diseases, TET1 has been found to regulate fat metabolism and glucose homeostasis, influencing the onset of conditions such as obesity and diabetes. By controlling the expression of metabolic regulators, TET1 appears to be a crucial player in maintaining energy balance and preventing metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, its role in inflammatory diseases and immune system regulation underscores its potential impact on disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis, where abnormal epigenetic modifications contribute to immune dysregulation.

Given its broad influence across various diseases, TET1 is emerging as a compelling target for novel therapeutic strategies. Scientists are actively exploring TET1 inhibitors and activators to manipulate its epigenetic functions for potential clinical applications. While challenges remain in developing targeted therapies, advancements in epigenetic research are paving the way for precision medicine approaches that harness TET1's unique regulatory capabilities.

A sweeping analysis of over 100 studies reveals aspartame is unlikely to alter glucose or hormone levels, challenging claims about its metabolic risks.

Review:  The Effects of Aspartame on Glucose, Insulin, and Appetite-Regulating Hormone Responses in Humans: Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses. Image Credit: Monika Wisniewska / Shutterstock

A recent study published in the journal Advances in Nutrition investigated the effects of aspartame on insulin, glucose, and appetite-related hormone responses. High free sugar consumption is associated with elevated energy intake, increasing the risk for obesity, overweight, and chronic conditions. Therefore, the World Health Organization recommends limiting free sugar intake to 10% of total energy intake. One strategy to curb free sugar intake is to reformulate foods and drinks by reducing their sugar content. Many manufacturers achieve this using low-calorie sweeteners (LCSs).

LCSs are considered safe, with studies suggesting benefits for decreasing body weight and energy intake compared to sugar intake. However, the benefits of LCSs are less clear for chronic conditions and over the long term. For instance, LCS intake has been associated with a higher risk of obesity and various metabolic conditions, albeit the evidence remains limited. Aspartame is among the most common LCSs that are completely metabolized by the human digestive system.

Aspartame is recognized as safe for use in foods and beverages. Aspartame is converted into aspartic acid, methanol, and phenylalanine. Given this breakdown of metabolites found in dietary sources, the metabolic effects of aspartame may appear unlikely. However, some studies suggest differing effects for diverse health outcomes from aspartame intake. Controversy over aspartame's health effects continues, in part because some studies have suggested different outcomes when compared to other LCSs.

In the present study, researchers investigated the effects of aspartame on insulin, glucose, and appetite-regulating hormone responses. PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases, as well as four trial registries, were searched for studies examining the effects of aspartame on insulin, appetite-regulating hormones, and glucose responses.

Any controlled intervention study design was eligible for inclusion, regardless of location and setting. Observational, animal, and in vitro studies were excluded from the analysis. Data on methodological aspects and risk of bias (RoB) were extracted from each study. The Cochrane Collaboration RoB-2 tool was used for RoB assessment.

A narrative synthesis of suitable experiments was performed based on the study design type, aspartame exposure, study duration, comparator, and outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed where at least 10 studies of the same design, exposure pattern, and outcome were available. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The GRADE approach rated certainty as “very low” due to limitations in study design, inconsistency and heterogeneity among studies, indirectness, and possible publication bias.

The review included studies in a range of populations, such as healthy adults, individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, phenylketonuria (PKU), and those with self-reported aspartame sensitivity.

Database search identified 11,796 records. After de-duplication and title/abstract screening, full texts of 417 articles were screened. Overall, 101 articles were included, which reported on the effects of aspartame alone or in combination with other substances. Furthermore, 73 studies reported on 77 crossover experiments, while 28 studies reported on 23 parallel-group experiments. Thirty-four studies examined the effects of aspartame alone on glucose responses with different comparators.

Aspartame had no effects on blood glucose compared to vehicle or other LCSs. However, blood glucose levels were significantly lower following aspartame intake compared to sweet sugars, non-sweet-tasting carbohydrates, or other nutritive components. Notably, these reductions were most evident in acute, short-term studies. Further, 19 studies provided aspartame with a nutritive component, and no effects of aspartame were noted. For insulin responses, 31 studies examined the effects of aspartame individually.

Aspartame had no effect on blood insulin levels compared to the vehicle; however, blood insulin levels were significantly lower after aspartame intake compared to non-sweet-tasting carbohydrates, sweet sugars, or other nutritive components. Further, blood insulin was significantly elevated with aspartame compared to other LCSs. Again, these significant differences were observed primarily in short-term experimental settings, not in medium- or long-term studies. Few effects were found with appetite-regulating hormones.

When appetite and energy intake were evaluated, the effects mimicked those of blood insulin and glucose. Few adverse events were reported across studies. Four crossover studies, which lasted up to 30 days (medium-term), found that high or low doses of aspartame did not affect blood glucose or insulin levels compared to sucrose or a placebo. Three crossover studies, which lasted more than 30 days (long-term), yielded results similar to those of medium-term studies.

In parallel-group acute studies, aspartame was found to reduce blood glucose levels compared to sucrose or glucose, when provided alone or in combination with nutritive components or LCSs. Four parallel-group, medium-term studies yielded results that mirrored those in short-term studies to some degree, with aspartame reducing blood insulin and glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity compared to sugars. Ten parallel-group studies were performed over the long term.

No differences were found between aspartame and the comparator(s) in any biochemical measure. Nine studies provided data on energy intake and reported no differences or lower energy intake and density with aspartame compared to sucrose. Likewise, nine studies examined appetite and found no differences between groups. The RoB assessment raised concerns for most studies. The certainty of evidence was “very low” for all primary outcomes. The review also emphasized substantial heterogeneity in methodologies and outcomes across the included studies, further limiting interpretability. The diversity of included populations (such as individuals with diabetes, PKU, or aspartame sensitivity) likely contributed to this heterogeneity.

In sum, most studies investigated blood insulin and glucose levels over the short term, and the meta-analyses revealed no effects of aspartame compared to vehicle or other LCSs. However, lower blood insulin and glucose levels were found with aspartame compared to sugars and other nutritive components, mainly in acute interventions. Long- and medium-term studies had few effects of aspartame intake.

Few studies have assessed appetite-regulating hormones other than insulin, and few effects have been found in these studies. There was high heterogeneity across studies and populations. The inclusion of varied participant groups (e.g., those with metabolic diseases or sensitivities) was an additional factor influencing the overall certainty and generalizability of findings. Together, the findings reveal little to no impact of aspartame intake on glucose metabolism, either in the short term or the long term. Further long-term studies are needed to compare aspartame with other LCSs and assess various appetite-regulating hormones. The certainty of these findings is limited by study quality, heterogeneity, and the risk of bias.

Jeff Kassouf and Cristina Alexander discuss Emma Hayes' squad for the upcoming friendlies against Ireland and Canada. (0:53)

Since last year's Olympic gold medal triumph, U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes has been handing out international debuts like Oprah Winfrey's Ultimate Car Giveaway: ""You get a cap! You get a cap!""

Four players joined their first senior USWNT training camp this week, bringing Hayes' tally to 27 first-time call-ups since arriving on the sidelines just over a year ago. Nineteen players to date have earned their first USWNT caps under Hayes.

All of which has amounted to the most drastic overhaul in the 40-year history of the world's most successful international women's soccer team. Recent USWNT lineups have been the youngest and least experienced in over two decades.

However, this phase of drastic experimentation is ending soon.

Hayes recently told ESPN that, after this window, which includes a pair of games against Ireland and a friendly against Canada over the next seven days, she expects to have narrowed down her roster to the core of players she will lean on at World Cup qualifying next year, and at the 2027 Women's World Cup.

Effectively, that makes this week a final in-person audition for some hopefuls trying to break through and climb the U.S. depth chart. There will be no more chances for players to prove they belong before FIFA's international calendar keeps the team apart until October.

This is an inflection point for the USWNT pool, which expanded over the past year but will soon become focused on a core group of players again soon. As Hayes raved about some of the newcomers to the USWNT roster last week, she said she made those personnel decisions ""knowing that this is probably the last moment we will be considering players from outside that net with the volume that we are.""

Hayes has assembled a roster of almost entirely NWSL-based players as she analyzes who can make an impact internationally and who is just an exceptional league player -- an important distinction that the coach recently highlighted. The coach's task will be to evaluate how players do in this ongoing camp in addition to the previous four training camps this year.

As such, there is undoubtedly an urgency for some players to impress the USWNT coach right now. This week is their last shot to make their case to Hayes while she's standing a few feet away on the training field or in the meeting room -- integral parts of team selection that are almost entirely shielded from the public eye.

USWNT manager Emma Hayes joins ""Futbol W"" to reveal why certain players have been left out of the roster for their upcoming international fixtures.

Goalkeeper is the position where the most urgency is needed. Angelina Anderson, Claudia Dickey and Mandy McGlynn have a combined three caps (all for McGlynn, and all from the past seven months). They've all had strong moments (and some low points) in NWSL play, but they haven't had much face time with Hayes.

All three goalkeepers will be under increased scrutiny at this camp with more experienced players missing -- and they might be fighting to join Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who looks like the favored No. 1 based on recent lineups.

A large group of mostly inexperienced defenders, along with the three goalkeepers in camp, will have another chance to build rapport with all-world defender Naomi Girma, the only European-based player on the most recent USWNT roster. Remove the experience of Girma and Emily Sonnett, and the other eight defenders combined have 18 caps.

Tara McKeown and Emily Sams appear to have established themselves as the next center backs in line on the depth chart. They've each been solid in the NWSL and Sams already has an Olympic gold medal (earned before her first cap, uniquely) after surfacing on Hayes' radar last year.

But the fullback position outside of Emily Fox (who got the camp off to rest) is still anyone's guess. Hayes is still looking for answers -- and she's using this final experimentation window to widen her search. Kerry Abello just earned her first cap there earlier this month, Avery Patterson debuted earlier this year, and Izzy Rodriguez and Lilly Reale (whom Hayes called ""outstanding"" and ""top class"" for NJ/NY Gotham FC this season) are two of the first-time call-ups on this roster.

All four players have been standouts in the NWSL, and this is their last chance for a while to earn an in-person evaluation by Hayes and her staff. It is also the chance to leave a strong in-person impression for some of the newer regulars (relatively speaking) like forwards Michelle Cooper, Yazmeen Ryan and Emma Sears, to make a breakthrough.

There are wrinkles to this squad selection process, however, and Hayes was quick to point out that what's best for each player will not look like linear progress to the public. The absence of a player from the team in the future doesn't rule her out of Hayes' plans entirely.

Eighteen-year-old Jordyn Bugg, for example, joined the USWNT for the first time this week, but Hayes said she expects to have Bugg play for the U-23s and in the U-20 World Cup in the future ""because that's in the best interest of her long-term development strategy."" Hayes used Bugg as an example of how the team also needs to prepare for the 2028 Olympics and 2031 World Cup, which will each be played on home soil.

Attacking midfielder Jaedyn Shaw is the present-day example of this fluidity. Shaw has struggled to fit in with the North Carolina Courage after an offseason trade, and she has spent the most recent two international windows with the U-23s. Hayes has repeatedly lauded Shaw and said that the talented playmaker will be a big part of the USWNT going forward. If she can find her feet in the league -- she just scored her first goal for the Courage in a crucial win on Saturday -- she should be in Hayes' mix come October.

Hayes is a studious coach who says she watches everything, whether in person or on late-night streams from her home in England. Recent history supports the notion that she will call up players based on their league form, but Hayes keeps reminding everyone that she ""can only pick the players that are available"" rather than ""the very best 23, 26 players.""

Except for one game, Hayes has not had her entire starting forward line of Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson or Sophia Wilson available since the Olympics last August.

""I think anybody that's called up at any given time -- I want everybody to know that we'll watch every game, and if there is a drop in form or there is a drop in consistency, it doesn't necessarily mean that players leave that pool,"" Hayes told ESPN. ""But we expect you to keep pushing all the time because we know what the quality is like worldwide.""

Come October, Hayes will assemble a roster that will largely consist of the players tasked with qualifying for and winning the 2027 World Cup. There will be plenty of personnel and lineup changes over the next two years along that journey to Brazil, but this week is the last opportunity for many players to insert themselves directly into Hayes' vision for success at the 2027 World Cup.

Failure to do so won't necessarily mark the end of the USWNT dream for players, but it will make it more difficult to get back into the mix. Hayes wants to have a core group set ahead of the USWNT's games in October, and Hayes has already accrued a decent sample size of evidence over the past six to eight months of extended auditions.

Against Ireland and Canada -- and in the trainings in between -- players will have one more golden chance to show they can contribute on the big stage.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","FOX makes Carli Lloyd decision after Alexi Lalas forced into action","https://www.themirror.com/sport/soccer/fox-carli-lloyd-alexi-lalas-1228284","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 16:40:00 GMT","

U.S. Women's National Team icon Carli Lloyd's no-nonsense takes will soon be returning to FOX and FS1 airwaves, after it was announced that she would form part of the network's studio team covering the upcoming UEFA Women's Euros and CONCACAF Gold Cups.

Lloyd's third straight summer working in-house with the network, having previously covered the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in 2023, and the CONMEBOL Copa America in 2024, the National Soccer Hall of Famer said she was “thrilled” to be returning for another summer.

“With the UEFA Women's Euro starting up and the U.S. off to a good start in the Gold Cup, I'm thrilled to be back with FOX Sports for what promises to be an incredible next few months of soccer,” said the USWNT legend, who apologized to her former teammates earlier this year for how she treated them, in a statement.

“I can't wait to cover all the storylines across both tournaments and especially with the UEFA Women's Euro, continuing to be a part of growing the women's game on FOX with a really impressive schedule that puts the tournament and players center stage.”

Lloyd's return to action with FOX could ruffle some feathers, however, with the 42-year-old having previously caused controversy with her occasionally blunt and unfiltered takes.

Most notably, during the 2023 Women's World Cup, the two-time champion tore into the state of the USWNT during what was the team's worst-ever performance in the competition.

Having entered the competition as the reigning back-to-back champions, then head coach Vlatko Andonovski led his side to a second-place finish in the group stage before unceremoniously exiting in the Round of 16 at the hands of Sweden.

Critical of the players' attitude during the competition, Lloyd also went viral for her criticism of Andonovski, believing that the team was “spiralling out of control” under the head coach.

“This isn't a surprise to me,” Lloyd admitted, as per Awful Announcing. “I voiced my concern several years ago, I voiced my concerns when I left the team, I voiced my concern to the team when I was at the Olympics, when we were competing for that Bronze Medal game. And I haven't seen much that has changed.

“From a tactical perspective, it's been the same. It's been very predictable. Players don't seem to be cohesive on the field, don't seem to be playing in synchronicity.""

Lloyd went on to claim that “There's something not right,” adding: “And it's not one thing, there's multiple things that have just been spiraling out of control, and now it's being revealed on the world's biggest stage. You can't get away with doing all of these things for so many years.”

Lloyd's comments drew plenty of criticism, including from Andonovski, who called her comments “insane.”

However, the likes of USMNT legend Alexi Lalas, who works with Lloyd at FOX, backed her amid a barrage of criticism, describing her as “wonderful” following her viral rant.

""While we're not all wired the same, I think we do share that when we are talking about our national teams, because we're talking about our country and we want this to go well. We also want to have pride in terms of what is going on on the field,"" Lalas said.

“And yes, it's a whole new day here in terms of getting out of the group. They've got to fix some things going forward, the criticism they got I think is warranted, and fair. But there also is a belief that maybe there is another team hiding behind this one, maybe, big maybe, that can do better. Because if not, they're going to go home quick.”

Now two years removed from the USWNT's disastrous World Cup defense, Lloyd will return to the FOX studio starting with the Euros, which kicks off on July 2.

World Cup

Just under one year out from the first men's World Cup to be held in the United States since 1994, there is no shortage of challenges for the organizers of the competition and the U.S. government as they prepare to share the tournament with Canada and Mexico next summer.

The build-up to the world's most popular sporting event has already been overshadowed, at times, by trade wars between the U.S. and other countries, tensions over President Donald Trump administration's policies towards immigration and lengthy visa wait times for foreign visitors who may wish to attend the tournament. There have also been tensions with co-hosts Canada and Mexico, with the start of Trump's second term dominated by tariffs and his suggestions that Canada should become part of the U.S. He also renamed the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.

U.S. Congressman Darin LaHood, a Republican who serves the constituents of the 16th District of Illinois, is one of the keenest advocates of soccer within U.S. politics, co-chairing the bipartisan congressional soccer caucus. He has also been present at events organized by the White House Task Force on the FIFA World Cup 2026, which is dedicated to leading and coordinating federal efforts in support of the event.

He has recently called for Trump to enact an executive order to protect the American skies from the threat of drones during the World Cup, and he spoke to The Athletic about:

Below are his answers, lightly edited for length and clarity. This interview took place prior to the U.S. airstrikes on Iran – a nation that has already qualified for the World Cup.

The Athletic: One year out from the World Cup, what are the political priorities for you between now and the tournament?

Rep. LaHood: From a practical standpoint, I view this through the lens of what the government needs to do and what we need to do to make this a successful World Cup. To create the (White House World Cup) task force was a monumental step. This put staff in place that understand the ramifications of what needs to get done; people who are attentive at the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, Department of Justice and at the FBI. We now have people engaged. They know there are asks that need to be fulfilled.

A lot of work still needs to be done on the processing of visas, as well as on the security apparatus, and particularly on drones. Then we have the logistics of getting people here and coordinating with Mexico, Canada and the 11 U.S. host cities.

World Cup organizer FIFA claims the combined impact of the Club World Cup and World Cup will be $47 billion to the U.S. economy, but this is surely very dependent on foreign travel. Are you at all concerned that perceptions of the United States at the moment may dissuade people from coming to the country?

Of course, I'm concerned. I just saw some data that showed tourism from Canada to the United States is down 40 percent. We've seen in a number of tourist destinations in the United States this year that tourism is down: in Las Vegas, New York and Florida.

We're aware of where some of that comes from because of some of the immigration policies and other things. However, I wouldn't rush to judgment that it is going to affect the World Cup. Soccer and sport transcend in many ways politics and geopolitics. There's plenty of opportunity to roll out a good PR welcoming message from the United States, and there will be people in the administration who will be engaged.

There are a number of people that FIFA and the White House want to engage with: partnering with footballers from Europe, Africa or South America. There is a plan in place to make sure that we are welcoming and that we attract people from all over the world, so we are sending the right message, particularly for the World Cup.

The White House recognizes that we have to get it right with the World Cup in 2026, because there's a legacy of events that are going to occur in the United States: the Olympics in 2028, the Women's World Cup in 2031, the Winter Olympics in 2034, the Rugby World Cups in 2031 and 2033. It's important to set the precedent here by getting it right.

The president has said this will have a $40 billion economic impact on the U.S. But that is contingent on having visitors who want to come here, enjoy the United States, spend their money and watch a world-class sporting event.

Andrew Giuliani, son of Trump's former lawyer and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, is leading the White House's Task Force. Do you think he was the best person for that job? 

Andrew Giuliani is the executive director but he's also co-equals with Carlos Cordeiro, who is with FIFA (Cordeiro is a senior advisor to FIFA president Gianni Infantino and a former U.S. Soccer president). That combination is positive moving forward.

Andrew has enthusiastically embraced the job. He's brought a lot of energy. He's been very attentive to the issues that have been raised. He's put together a good team around him. He asks all the important questions. He understands the enormity of the job and what it entails. So far, he's doing everything that he's been asked to do. He has the ear of the president. He understands the whole of government approach that this is going to take to get implemented. There are learning aspects of this job, but so far he's tackling those head-on.

FIFA has adopted a dynamic pricing model for the Club World Cup. From a Congressional Soccer Caucus perspective, as someone trying to grow this sport, are you at all worried that ordinary people might be priced out of the World Cup? 

Well, I hope not. We'll see what happens next year when the pricing comes out for the World Cup.

Do you think FIFA should give something back to local communities by ringfencing some ticketing to make it accessible? 

There's a lot of discretion there and a lot of flexibility with how they want to handle that. There's going to be a real emphasis on youth soccer, young people and getting them engaged with the fan zones.

Advertisement

Does that mean everybody's going to get into a stadium to watch a game? Maybe not, but my own experience from being at the World Cup or Euros (European Championships) is that these fan zones with big TVs outside of the stadium are very enjoyable for fans to partake in. If we do it the right way, we are going to enhance the game tremendously and continue to grow the game here. We can't lose sight of that from a congressional soccer standpoint. We're keenly aware of that. If and when we need to push FIFA in a particular direction, we're prepared to do that.

Before the Club World Cup, the CBP in Florida was posting on Facebook about how it was going to be “suited and booted” to support FIFA during the first round of games. United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) subsequently confirmed they may attend games. Are you concerned about the message that sends?

I'm not concerned about that, I've been in touch with FIFA people. Some of that is more of a reflection on some of the protests we've seen in Los Angeles and related to that spillover. I don't think it has anything to do with people wanting to check the immigration status of people coming in. That's not something that's been on my radar screen.

Visa wait times have improved considerably over the past year. But there have now been cuts made to the State Department, so is there a concern they may lengthen again?

Colombia was at 700 days and they've been reduced to 400 days. It's coming down. I think seeing the progress being made there, that's going to be replicated in other areas where it needs to get done. I'm not concerned about cuts in the State Department… There's not going to be cuts on the folks that are going to make the World Cup a success.

We have to have people who feel comfortable and can come here under the visa regime that we have in place and have proper security protocols in place. So my sense is there's going to be adequate and appropriate funding through the State Department to effectuate that.

Focusing on the soccer, is the USMNT going to hit form? And what have you made of some players electing not to go to the Gold Cup this summer, as well as Mauricio Pochettino's first few months in charge?

Well, to be honest with you, I almost wish we had to qualify for the World Cup because that level of competition would have been better. On paper, I like our new coach. He brings a lot to the table, but there seems to be a lackadaisical approach with our players.

These were two friendlies and I shouldn't put much stock into friendlies, but people are getting worried. There's a nervousness about the current team and the level of commitment. But right now, it's not there.

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew discuss the USMNT's 2-1 win over Haiti that granted it a place in the Gold Cup knockout stages. (1:32)

Atlético Madrid have reached a verbal agreement with Real Betis to sign United States men's national team midfielder Johnny Cardoso, sources have told ESPN.

ESPN reported last month that Cardoso was Diego Simeone's top target to strengthen Atleti's midfield for the upcoming season.

A source told ESPN that Cardoso, 23, has already agreed to personal terms with Atlético, and the team has agreed a transfer fee exceeding €30 million ($34.8m).

Cardoso has an €80m release clause in his contract.

Sources told ESPN that Atlético see Cardoso as an ideal player because, despite his age, he already has experience in LaLiga. The New Jersey-born midfielder, who also has an Italian passport, arrived at Betis in January 2024 from Brazilian club Internacional.

His solid performances for Betis earned him a contract extension with the Seville-based club until June 2030.

Last summer, Betis signed midfielder Giovani Lo Celso from Tottenham Hotspur just minutes before the end of LaLiga's summer transfer window for a reported transfer fee of €5m, and in doing so gave Tottenham a priority option to sign Cardoso for a reported fee of €25m ($28.9m).

Spurs have until the end of June to exercise this option but the arrival of Thomas Frank as their new head coach, replacing Ange Postecoglou, complicated a move to north London.

The St. Louis soccer scene produced five of the starting XI that upset England - and their legacy has not been forgotten

Harry Keough had a photographic memory.

The one-time U.S. international could tell you pretty much everything about every single soccer game he played in. He knew who scored first, what color socks the opponent was wearing, the weather, even the minute statistical details.

But he wasn't actually a soccer player - not full time, at least. Keough was a postman who played the game part-time. On June 29, 1950, he and his U.S. teammates shocked the best team in the world, beating England in the World Cup in what was an unfathomable upset. And in truth, he felt bad about it.

“It's funny,” Keough's son Ty told GOAL. “He had mentioned to me and my sisters more than once that he said he almost felt sorry for the English players, because he knew what they would have to face up to when they got back.”","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The USMNT Transfer Notebook tracks American player movements, with latest developments for those in the U.S. national team pool

With most European summer transfer windows opening next week, the buildup to several major moves is accelerating, including for players on the U.S. men's national team.

There are moves that have been speculated for weeks inching toward the finish line, such as Johnny Cardoso's long-awaited move to Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid. And then there are deals that have seemingly emerged out of nowhere, such as Malik Tillman being linked with Bayer Leverkusen.

And other moves hang in the balance, such as Matt Turner's reported transfter to Lyon - especially as the seven-time Ligue 1 champions have been shockingly relegated to Ligue 2.

The most exciting part? There's more to come. The window opens July 1, and several World Cup hopefuls are looking for moves to boost their chances of making Mauricio Pochettino's 26-man roster for the 2026 tournament being held in North America.

Chelsea are through to the FIFA Club World Cup round of 16 thanks to Tosin Adarabioyo, Liam Delap and Tyrique George. All three players scored on the night against ES Tunis with Delap finding the back of the net for the first time for the London club.

Enzo Maresca's men needed just a draw on the night to advance given Flamengo and LAFC were already confirmed as first place and one of two eliminated teams respectively. After struggling for much of the first half to find an opener, Chelsea scored two goals in first half stoppage time to bury ES Tunis's hopes of advancing. 

Given Chelsea's loss to Flamengo, they were resigned to finishing as high as second. But, there's been a twist in Group C. Fans expected a difficult journey after losing to the Brazilian side last time out, but the final Group C game altered the bracket.

Chelsea will face Portugal's Benfica in the round of 16. Many expected Chelsea would face Bayern Munich given their wins against Boca Juniors and Auckland City. Benfica spoiled the party defeating the Bavarian giants in their final group game to snatch away the top spot. As such, Chelsea avoid Vincent Kompany's side and the top scoring team in the competition so far.

Benfica aren't a walk in the park by any means, but both groups didn't finish as many might've expected coming into the tournament. 

Chelsea will be without Nicolas Jackson against Benfica after the striker picked up a straight red card in their loss to Flamengo. Delap is expected to lead the line once again in Jackson's absence. 

The Blues face Benfica on Saturday, June 28 at 4 p.m. ET (9 p.m. BST).

You'll be sad to read that's all from us tonight after Group C reaches its conclusion in the Club World Cup.

Benfica join Bayern in the last-16 but the story of the night was Auckland's point against Boca Juniors.

We'll be back again tomorrow for more. See you then.

We're two minutes into six added on by the way.

Not long left for Auckland to hold on.

We're into the 90th minute and another Boca cross comes to nothing as the clock ticks down.

Into the final five minutes now and it's still all square.

Auckland are well and truly digging in here.

Around 20 minuets remaining for Auckland to hold on and earn their first point of the competition.

It would be a huge achievement for the only amateur club in the Club World Cup. 

FT: Benfica 1-0 Bayern Munich

Benfica

Benfica boss Bruno Lage, speaking to DAZN: ""We came to this game with the big confidence and we were very good in the first half. Maybe Bayern deserved one goal. We were more aggressive and it means a lot for us. 

""We finish first and it means a lot for us.

People need to believe more in the work we are doing. The work from our president, the sports directors and also me as a manager. 

""They were speaking about Boca needing to win by a lot of goals and they forgot about this game. They need to believe in our work.""

FT: Benfica 1-0 Bayern Munich

Bayern Munich

Bayern boss Vincent Kompany, speaking to DAZN: ""I think our first half wasn't good at all. With the pitch and the heat, I just feared this wouldn't go as fluid as normal but went hen I was still confident for the second half. We created so much and played really well. It's football. If you have chances and don't take them, you pay the price. 

On half-time subs: ""It was the plan. I'd rather finish strong because I knew it would start slow. I was definitely confident this is what we needed to do. I can't take anything from this game. 

On Flamengo in Miami on Sunday: ""It was either Flamengo or Chelsea. It's going to be a tough game. We know we can create the chances. We don't have to play in Charlotte anymore. 

""Anyway, we were dominant, we created more chances, we didn't win. We can't afford for this to happen but we still take momentum into the next game.""

Auckland City 1-1 Boca Juniors

Lifeline for Auckland as the goal is chalked off for Boca.

Kevin Zenon used his bicep to control the ball before finding Miguel Merentiel.

Auckland City 1-2 Boca Juniors

Looks handball to me...

Miguel Merentiel

Boca retake the lead!

A real shame for Auckland as the ball is fumbled into the box and Miguel Merentiel slots home.

Wait a minute though, VAR is being called into play...

Benfica came second in the Primeira Liga in 2024-25 and are managed by former Wolves boss Bruno Lage

Benfica beat Bayern Munich to progress into the Club World Cup last 16 as Group C winners amid sweltering temperatures in the United States.

The match began at 3pm local time (20:00 BST) at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina with the temperature at 36C - and both sides were far from their best in the tough conditions.

Andreas Schjelderup scored the only goal in the 13th minute, with a low finish from 15 yards out after Fredrik Aursnes had done well and pulled the ball back into his path.

Victory means Portugal's Benfica will play the Group D runners-up Chelsea.

Bayern had already qualified and boss Vincent Kompany made seven changes from the side that beat Argentina's Boca Juniors 2-1 on Friday.

However, he brought on England captain Harry Kane, ex-Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise and Germany international Joshua Kimmich in a triple substitution at half-time in an attempt to get back into the match.

Kimmich thought he had equalised for the German side with a low 25-yard strike, but the goal was ruled out for offside, with Kane deemed to be obstructing the view of goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin.

Bayern were the better team in the second half as Aleksandar Pavlovic had an effort saved and Leroy Sane missed two late opportunities, but they could not find an equaliser and had to settle for second place in the group.

Bayern Munich's Sacha Boey during the cooling break in the first half

One of the main issues facing the month-long tournament has been the temperatures the players are having to play in.

At the 30-minute mark, there was a near-three-minute cooling break, with players from both sides heading to the dugouts to get some shade, while some wrapped a cold towel around their heads and others poured water on themselves.

There was a second cooling break after 23 minutes of the second half and Kompany said he had been worried about the conditions.

""With the heat I feared it would not go as fluid as normal and sometimes with the heat it is like this,"" said the former Manchester City defender. ""I can't take anything from the game apart from our performance in the second half. Maybe one positive is we don't have to play in Charlotte anymore.""

Trubin was excellent in the second half and was a large reason Benfica held on for the win. 

He made a superb reflex save from Pavlovic and then denied Sane when the Germany forward had been through with only the goalkeper to beat.

Former Manchester United midfielder Angel di Maria will be leaving Benfica at the end of this tournament and will return to his boyhood club Rosario Central in Argentina. 

But the 37-year-old was a key figure for Benfica, starting the move which resulted in their goal and he received a superb reception from his side's fans when he came off late on in the second half.

Bayern lost for only the fourth time in 29 matches in all competitions in 2025, while Benfica beat them for the first time in a competitive game.

Benfica will stay in Charlotte for their next match, against either Chelsea in the last 16 on Saturday, 28 June (21:00 BST).

Bayern face Group D winners Flamengo of Brazil at 21:00 BST on Sunday, 29 June.

Boca Juniors fans get ready for the Club World Cup with chants and drums on Miami beach. (2:07)

Christian Gray, a 28-year-old physical education teacher from New Zealand, scored against Argentine powerhouse Boca Juniors at the Club World Cup on Tuesday, offering the amateur side a fleeting moment of jubilation to make their participation in the elite tournament worthwhile.

Gray's strike secured a 1-1 draw that sparkled like gold amid the rubble of Auckland City's tournament, a campaign that had seen the amateur side brutally exposed by a 10-0 hammering from Bayern Munich and a 6-0 defeat to Benfica.

""I'm from a small town, a long way from here and a lot different to this environment. So it is somewhat of a dream,"" Gray said after the match, in which Boca outshot Auckland 41-3.

Auckland City's squad -- comprising teachers, delivery drivers and tradesmen -- had paid a heavy price for their footballing ambitions, quite literally.

Many fund their own participation while juggling day jobs, a stark contrast to the millionaire professionals they faced on the pitch.

The New Zealand club finished bottom of their group with just one point, but for coach Paul Posa, that single point represented a victory against overwhelming odds.

""You can't begin to explain the odds that we're up against,"" Posa said. ""Our club is tiny with the hugest heart. We got something today from the tournament, which was a just reward for everybody that's been working behind the scenes.""

The manager never lost faith despite the lopsided scorelines earlier in the tournament. ""I always thought we had to score a goal. We've just worked so hard. Got a bit lucky in the first half, but I just knew we had to score.""

For Gray, the tournament caps what he described as ""a long four years"" of preparation with a club that relies primarily on volunteers.

""That's been a tough trip. We've had some tough results, but I'm just happy for the team and the boys. I think we deserve it,"" he said.

Now, Gray must swap the international spotlight for a pile of unmarked assignments accumulated during his school holidays, perhaps the most extraordinary ordinary transition in world football after the greatest tie in the history of the amateur club.

SEATTLE — As the final FIFA Club World Cup match kicks off Wednesday night in Seattle, local officials are already turning their attention to next summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup—an event expected to bring at least twice as many visitors to the city.

Transportation officials say the Club World Cup has served as a valuable test run. The Seattle Department of Transportation and King County Metro closely monitored traffic patterns and crowd movement throughout the tournament, particularly near the stadiums in SODO.

“For many who work downtown, the influx of fans has presented challenges,” said employees at local businesses, including the Starbucks Headquarters and Amtrak, who told KING 5 that commuting during games was difficult.

Fans, however, appeared to take the congestion in stride. 

“Downtown, a little bit of a jam,” said River Plate fan Marc Herzfeld, who flew in from Buenos Aires. “The rest, very fluid.”

Gaston and Tommy Levy, who traveled from Miami for Wednesday's match, said the trip was about honoring family tradition. “My dad was from River Plate, he made me from River Plate,” said Tommy.

Herzfeld, who took three connecting flights to get to Seattle, called it a “very friendly city.”

“I would love to come back,” he said when asked by KING 5.

That's welcome news for Seattle economists, who estimate the combined economic impact of the Club World Cup and next year's World Cup could near $1 billion.

From a traffic perspective, SDOT says the city performed well. 

“We didn't see major congestion or unusual delays in SODO—traffic levels were typical for a game day,” said Mariam Ali, deputy press secretary for SDOT. She noted the department is refining its approach for 2026 using strategies like pedestrian-focused street management and real-time traffic monitoring.

Officials continue to urge visitors to use public transportation when possible.

Luis Rubiales, the former president of Spain's football federation, has lost an appeal against his sexual assault conviction.  

Rubiales was fined €10,800 (£9,206) in February for kissing captain Jenni Hermoso without her consent after Spain's women's team won the 2023 World Cup.

A Spanish appeals court upheld the fine, and also dismissed a separate appeal from prosecutors, who had sought a retrial and pushed for a jail sentence.

The incident - in which Rubiales grabbed Hermoso's head and kissed her on the lips - triggered protests and calls for his resignation. 

He denied the sexual assault charge, describing the kiss as an ""act of affection"" and ""completely spontaneous"". 

On Wednesday, the Audencia Nacional said it did not consider the kiss consensual, and said Hermoso had objected to it from the outset.

It found that Rubiales ""restrained himself"" when interacting with other players and ""could also have done so, without too much effort, with the captain"".

At the original trial, Hermoso said she had not given permission for the kiss, which she felt ""disrespected"" her and ""stained one of the happiest days"" of her life.

The court upheld the sentence handed down in February, which included a ban on Rubiales going within a 200m radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year.

The court also upheld the decision not to convict Rubiales of coercion. 

Prosecutors had alleged he pressured Hermoso into publicly saying the kiss was consensual, which Rubiales denied.

Three other former Spanish football federation employees - coach Jorge Vila, marketing executive Rubén Rivera and sporting director Albert Luque - were previously cleared of coercion, a decision which was upheld on Wednesday.

Just under a year from now, Kansas City plans to welcome hundreds of thousands of soccer fans from all over the world for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The most televised sporting event on the planet, the World Cup will put Kansas City on the international mainstage like never before, showcasing a vibrant soccer city on the level of Mexico City, Los Angeles, Toronto and New York.

""We're really excited about the opportunity that gives us to really rise on the world stage, and demonstrate why Kansas City is a great place to live and come to visit for these kinds of events,"" says Lindsey Douglas who is the COO of KC2026 — the nonprofit responsible for event preparation.

Kansas City is the smallest host city in North America to participate, and it's been building up to this moment for decades.

The metro is home to professional teams like Sporting KC and the Current, which is the first professional women's team in the world to get their own stadium. Fans can join epic watch parties in the Power & Light District, and find games of all experience levels around the region.

But Kansas City may not have embraced this sport at all, if it hadn't been for the immigrants who first advocated for and educated people about the beautiful game — back before the city even had soccer fields to play on.

“Soccer is still what you would call an underdog sport,” says G.E. White, author of the book, “Soccer in American Culture: The Beautiful Game's Struggle For Status.”

By most accounts, the game we've come to know today as soccer came from the United Kingdom in the 1800s. Schools across the country played their own versions of the sport, but the rules could differ widely: Can you touch the ball with your hands, or tackle other players?

According to White, a group of players in 1863 established “association football” with its own set of regulations separate from sports like rugby. “They decided to have a completely foot-oriented game,” White says.

Now with its own governing body, association football spread to British colonies, throughout the rest of Europe, and into the New World.

(As for why the United States mostly calls the sport “soccer,” White says that's actually a British nickname, a contraction of the word “association.”)

During the late 19th century, the United States underwent an industrial boom, as a large number of immigrants from Great Britain, Ireland, Portugal and other European countries moved here to work manufacturing jobs. Those workers brought soccer with them to cities on the East Coast and Midwest.

It's actually St. Louis, on the other side of Missouri, that's considered the first soccer capitol in the U.S. Between hosting the 1904 Olympics and World's Fair, this multinational manufacturing hub did a lot to establish some of the early national soccer infrastructure.

“It was always these immigrant enclaves within these cities that you'd find the soccer teams,” says Cris Medina, who is a descendant of one of these early trailblazers in Kansas City.

Teams formed out of businesses, athletic clubs and churches, since the sport offered a way to decompress and socialize. But both soccer and the immigrants who played it got labeled as outsiders.

“There's a certain amount of stereotyping, negative stereotyping of immigrant groups, and all of this results in soccer being identified as an immigrant sport,” White says.



It's hard to paint a full picture of how soccer first started in Kansas City, because there was so little being written about immigrant communities, in addition to the significant language barrier.

But old newspapers clippings, from The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times, offer glimpses at different pieces of the puzzle.

One of the first people to start a soccer team in Kansas City was J.T. Gallagher in December 1906. A former St. Louis player, Gallagher had moved to Kansas City and was “looking for more recruits” to meet him at Association Park (once located at 20th Street and Prospect Avenue) to try out. His team would later be dubbed “J.T. Gallagher's Regulars.”

Into the 1920s through the 40s, other makeshift teams get mentioned as playing matches around the city: The Thistles, Shmelzers, Tigers, St. George, the Shamrocks, Hutchison Electric, German Turners, Hibernians, Victorians, McFarland Upholsterers, Heine's Kickers.

The Kansas City Athletic Club had a team, as did the Young Men's Hebrew Association. There was a Catholic Youth Council team and members of a group called the Kansas City Soccer Club. They carved out makeshift places to play at 39th and Gillham, Westport high school, Swope Park and Parade Park.

But soccer remained, for the most part, out of the mainstream.

In schools, kids were mostly taught American-made sports. And when soccer did get played, as in Kansas City, its season fell typically in the worst slot of the year — the winter — between the football and baseball schedules.

“You can't really play soccer in the Midwest or northeast in the winter unless you want to play on a field that's covered with snow or ice and that's difficult,” White says.

Even those conditions, however, couldn't stop Kansas City's soccer lovers — such as José Portuguez, a Costa Rican immigrant, and my grandfather.

For my senior project in college — two decades ago now — my family and I traveled to Costa Rica with my grandpa. I documented our journey, and the stories my family told.

My grandpa José was funny. He loved to dance and laugh, and he adored soccer.

“He said he was born with a soccer ball,” said my mom, Vallie Portuguez Hogan.

José Portuguez died back in 2021, when he was 97 years old. And I always knew vaguely that he was also a part of the reason Kansas City became a soccer town.

He arrived in Lawrence, Kansas, in the 1940s to study engineering at the University of Kansas. There, José helped organize an intramural soccer league of international students, and even coordinated tournaments with nearby schools — driving hours to games around Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.

“They'd have a barbecue, they'd cook out,” describes Jim Portuguez, my uncle and José Portuguez's son. “Drink beer, eat steak, talk about their homes, talk about how well they played.”

Soccer players were hungry for community, because it could be lonely outside of that world. They faced cultural and language barriers, as well as outright discrimination, and often struggled to fit in.

Jim says players were constantly fighting for respect, and field space.

“They would tease them and say, ‘Oh, that's an easy game, anybody can play that. It's not like a real game, you know, a hardy game like American football,'” Jim Portuguez recounts. Even though that attitude would irritate him, José would stay cool, and use the opportunity to teach them more about the game.

After José graduated from KU, he married his college girlfriend — my grandmother — and in the 1950s moved to Kansas City. They started a family while José worked as an engineer, but my grandpa looked for any chance he could to play soccer.

My family says he found remnants of those early immigrant teams around the city and region, in Parkville, Leavenworth and St. Joseph.

But to get soccer taken seriously in Kansas City, he would need a friend. And he found one in Augustin “Chino” Medina.

“Chino” Medina was a professional soccer player in Mexico, and he was a star. As a player for Atlas and other bigtime teams, Medina was twice the national scoring champion. (“Pelo chino,” means curly hair in Spanish.)

Towards the end of his career, Chino met his wife: a woman from Kansas City's Westside, who would come to Mexico to see her family.

When his wife got too homesick, in the 1950s Chino followed her to the Westside. But the transition was hard for him. He had never lived in the United States, and didn't speak English.

“He would cry, he would tell me he'd pick radishes and nopales and work in the fields just to have some work, because he didn't have skills at the time that were applicable where he could find a job to maintain his family,” Cris Medina says of his father.

It was at church that Chino Medina found support. Specifically, at Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish, and the Guadalupe Center — of which Cris Medina is the former director.

The Guadalupe Center was formed in the 1910s, a time when the construction of the railroad and the Mexican Revolution brought a large wave of Mexican immigrants to the Westside, and around the tracks in Kansas City, Kansas.

Its mission today is to help improve the lives of Latinos in Kansas City, but the center was originally created to offer services and help “Americanize” these new arrivals. The organization provided health care and educational opportunities like English lessons, and it promoted American activities.

“They wanted the immigrants to play American sports,” Cris Medina explains. “So baseball, basketball… and they had football, six man tackle and stuff like that.”

By the time Chino Medina had arrived, though, the Guadalupe Center had been taken over by Mexicans, who instead focused on Mexican pride rather than assimilation to white culture.

An associate priest from Spain named Ignacio Orozco, who worked at the church, formed a recreational soccer team called Guadalupe. And they were more than happy to welcome Chino Medina to play with them.

“They were just like, ‘Man, this can't be true. This guy's a star soccer player in Mexico and he's going to come play with us?'” Cris Medina recalls.



Kansas City's soccer players eventually grew tired of holding games and practices on baseball or football fields. They had outgrown park fields with DIY goals.

So according to Jim Portuguez Chino Medina and my grandpa arranged a meeting with the mayor of Kansas City, Harold Roe Bartle. 

Known by his nickname “The Chief,” Bartle loved sports and eventually played a big role in convincing the Dallas Texans football team to move to Kansas City.

Medina and Portuguez made the case to Bartle: Their sport was growing, it didn't need a lot of equipment, but they did need soccer fields of their own. No more competing with other sports for space.

Plus, soccer was a healthy activity, and good for the kids. “I think that's what got the mayor's interest,” says Jim Portuguez.

They got the greenlight to install official soccer fields at city parks like Gilham and Swope with goals and bleachers. To guys like my grandpa, this was a big deal, because it showed these players that they had buy-in from the city.

Armando Diaz and Salvador Gomez remember playing on those fields with Chino and José. Both men are from Mexico, and joined the team “Los Latinos,” which evolved out of that earlier Guadalupe team.

According to Diaz, securing the fields at Swope helped Los Latinos become a more formalized team in the late 1950s. Of course, it was still hard to find some of the other basics like balls and uniforms, so team members like Diaz went down to Mexico to retrieve some.

“There was nothing here, nothing,” Diaz recalled in a 2018 interview.

Diaz said that other teams formed in time. One of Los Latinos' friendly rivals was “Los Internationales,” a group of immigrants from Hungary, Croatia, France, Germany and other parts of Europe.

Despite their language and cultural differences, these soccer-playing immigrants formed deep connections.

“And the Europeans didn't speak English either,” Diaz told me with a laugh. “And we didn't speak English. So the only thing that keep us together was the little ball right there… because that's the only language that we knew.”

Cris Medina and his siblings remember attending some of those games when they were little. It was a central part of their social lives.

“Making sandwiches and food … tortas to go to the game. That was an all day deal,” Medina recalls.

It seems fitting how much of this soccer scene revolved around feeding people, since feeding the greater soccer family was also part of their mission. Their dad Chino Medina later opened the restaurant La Fonda El Taquito, which has become a staple soccer watching joint on Kansas City's Westside.

These soccer families hosted out of town teams, had parties afterwards, and went to exhibition matches outside of the city. Cris Medina recalls a Polish team in Des Moines, a German team in Omaha, Italians in St. Louis, other Mexicans in Wichita.

This was all being organized by working people, some with kids, in their spare time, all for the love of the game.

Kansas City has come a long way since then. If you go to Swope Park these days, you'll find a hive of soccer activity. The Swope Park Soccer Village, managed by Sporting KC, now boasts six full sized fields, constantly bustling with practices and matches.

An even larger soccer complex now exists in Overland Park, and more pitches have been built in parks and schools across the metro.

Without those critical first pioneers, though, soccer might still have been mostly relegated to backyards or DIY pitches.

Building a home for soccer in Kansas City was a team effort, just like the game itself.

This episode of A People's History of Kansas City was reported, produced, and mixed by Suzanne Hogan with editing by Mackenzie Martin and Gabe Rosenberg.

This is the first installment of a series leading up to the 2026 World Cup in collaboration with the Great Game Lab at Arizona State University, which explores how sport connects U.S. to the rest of the world.

Over the next year, we'll hear about the time Kansas City attracted the biggest soccer star in the world, and the founding of our very first professional team. We'll learn about the sport's ongoing fight for recognition, how women's soccer emerged and then dominated. And we'll find out how Kansas City grew into an international hot bed for both athletes and fans.

Ryan Smart

Eight countries are unable to compete in qualification for the World Cup as FIFA does not recognise them as official nations.

A total of 210 nations were permitted to enter the qualifying stages for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Out of those nations, Congo withdrew from their remaining fixtures earlier this year after their football association, FECAFOOT, was briefly suspended by FIFA.

Advert

And Eritrea - who haven't played a competitive match in five years - pulled out of qualification before it began, with The Guardian claiming its governing body are concerned that players will seek political asylum in opposing nations due to the conditions in the country.

The African nation are still recognised by FIFA so can return to competitive international football at any point.

But there are eight countries who are still not recognised by football's governing body:

Football has been played in the Vatican City since the 16th century, but the papal residence is still not an official part of UEFA.

Advert

Men's and women's sides often play friendlies against Italian clubs, and football has been popular among several popes.

Pope Francis supported Argentine giants San Lorenzo and reportedly held talks with UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin about potential Vatican City membership ahead of the Euro 2020 final.

The current pope, Pope Leo, is also connected to sport. He is a big fan of baseball, has been described as 'quite the amateur tennis player', and appeared to indicate his support for Serie A side Roma last month. 

Micronesia's football association, along with the British writer Paul Watson, administered a futsal competition in 2023 in an attempt to push them closer to FIFA membership or recognition. 

Advert

Their uphill battle, though, is highlighted by a pure lack of resources.

In 2015, their under-23 team was entered into the Pacific Games, being drawn against Tahiti, Fiji and Vanuatu.

They subsequently conceded 114 goals across their three games without scoring, with their biggest defeat being 46-0 to Vanuatu. One opposition player scored 16 goals.

Nauru are perhaps the closest team on this list to gaining membership of a continental governing body.

Advert

Plans are in place to rebuild the nation's grassroots schemes, and they would have players with Nauru heritage living in Australia to call upon if they were admitted to the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC).

Backed by Reading icon Dave Kitson, the nation invited a Royals XI team to face them in a one-off match, though the fixture has not yet taken place.

The principality is the jewel of the crown in several sports, such as Formula 1, while AS Monaco are one of France's top football clubs.

Advert

At international level, however, the Monegasque Football Federation is not a member of UEFA or FIFA and therefore Monaco cannot play in World Cups.

Most of the men's team is made up of local workers, with a minority of those having professional experience.

Were Monaco ever to be admitted to UEFA, the likes of PSV star Olivier Boscagli - who was born in the principality state - could play for them.

Palau are the 16th smallest country in the world, with the ELO Ratings ranking them as the second-worst football nation at present.

The Palau Soccer League - the nation's only football division - was due to be relaunched in October 2024 on their only football-specific pitch.

There are records of Kiribati playing football as far back as 1979, while they were formerly regulars at the Pacific Games.

But there is no record of any competitive match since 2011 for the men's team, and 2003 for the women's team.

They were due to enter the Confederation of Island Football Associations (CONIFA) World Football Cup in 2018, but withdrew due to financial reasons. 

Tuvalu are in a different position to some nations on this list as they have a men's and women's domestic structure.

They are already part of CONIFA and are regular competitors at the Pacific Games.

Some of their players have competed for Australian A-League sides, while their top scorer, Alopou Petoa, formerly played in the top amateur division in New Zealand.

He recently remarked that the 27-man roster that Manchester City have taken to the Club World Cup is ""too big"", with by far the most crowded area within the squad being in attack. The embarrassment of riches at Guardiola's disposal was illustrated by the fact the coach changed his entire starting XI from their opening win over Wydad AC for their second fixture, against Al Ain, which they won 6-0.

Even after leaving Jack Grealish and James McAtee at home, Guardiola came to the United States armed with 17 players who can play as midfielders or forwards. And while the massive numbers have proved to be a luxury so far as they have allowed the City to keep his players as fresh as possible, the rotation will have to slow down as the team go deeper into the tournament and the opposition gets stronger, beginning with Thursday's clash against Juventus.

City have to win their final Group G clash with the Bianconeri to finish top and likely avoid a last-16 meeting with Real Madrid. So how exactly does Guardiola fit all his wonderfully talented players into his team and pick his most formidable starting XI?","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Tennis

The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) has submitted an updated complaint in its antitrust lawsuit against tennis' governing bodies.

The organization, which was co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2020, has taken out critiques of the tour schedule from players who are not named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, including French Open champions Coco Gauff and Carlos Alcaraz.

It has also removed two defendants from a group it characterized as a “cartel” in its initial action, which was filed in London, New York City and Brussels. The International Tennis Federation is off the suit filed in New York City, as is the tennis anti-doping and anti-corruption body, the International Tennis Integrity Agency.

A source briefed on the PTPA's legal proceedings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships in tennis, said that the ITF and the ITIA had been removed to focus on the alleged antitrust violations by the men's (ATP) and women's (WTA) tennis tours.

The PTPA filed its initial lawsuit in March. That filing described the biggest governing bodies in tennis as a “cartel,” which suppresses wages, player opportunity and rival tournaments “to the harm of players and fans alike.” The PTPA alleged numerous antitrust violations, all of which have been denied by the accused governing bodies, who last month filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.

The men's and women's tours argue that their bylaws require players to settle disputes through arbitration, rather than in court. In May, they and the ITF and ITIA filed a joint motion to dismiss the PTPA as a plaintiff, on the grounds that it cannot orchestrate such an action because it does not have a formal membership. A judge has yet to rule on that motion.

The original lawsuit listed 12 player plaintiffs, including co-founder Vasek Pospisil, and Reilly Opelka and Sorana Cirstea, who are active players. Djokovic was not a named plaintiff. There are now 14, with the addition of Sachia Vickery and Nicolas Zanellato, though there are still no top-tier stars among the named complainants, giving the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the PTPA's lawsuit does not have the support of most of the most powerful voices in the game.

A spokesperson for the PTPA said at the time that more than 250 professional players across all tiers of the sport, as well as the organization's executive committee, which includes Djokovic, supported the action.

Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Djokovic said in a news conference at the Miami Open: “To be quite frank with you, there are things that I agree with in the lawsuit and there are also things that I don't agree with.

“I found that maybe some wording was quite strong in there.”

The updated complaint, filed in New York Tuesday evening, has changed some wording. The original was written with the kind of confrontational language that is typical of U.S. lawsuits, with the four Grand Slams — Wimbledon and the Australian, French and U.S. Opens — described as “co-conspirators” alongside the defendants' alleged “cartel”.

Some of that language is still there, including in the opening salvo:

“Professional tennis players are stuck in a rigged game. Not on the court, where fierce competition between players delights millions of fans worldwide, but off of it, where players are forced to endure grueling schedules, capped earnings, abusive and invasive investigations and discipline, and have limited control over their own careers and brands. This is because a cartel of professional tennis tour organizers and tournament operators have conspired to avoid competition amongst themselves and to shut out outside tournaments, affording them complete control over the players' pay and working conditions.”

The four Grand Slams will not be named as defendants for at least another 90 days, amid settlement discussions between them and the PTPA, according to a filing lodged this week.

The updated complaint focuses more closely on alleged violations of antitrust law by the two tours, while countering the arguments that they have made to convince the court to dismiss the case.  It also focuses more heavily on the governance structures of the tours, outlining how the players are not equal partners in the operations, as the tours' leaders have claimed.  The original, which included reference to complaints by Alcaraz, Gauff and five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Świątek, has omitted those complaints. It had used quotes from those players in news conferences and interviews in which they criticized how tennis is scheduled. Since the initial complaint was filed, a group of top-10 ranked male and female players has held meetings with the four Grand Slams to discuss an increased proportion of their revenues being shared with players as prize money.

This is one of the goals of the PTPA lawsuit, and the PTPA has also held meetings with leaders of the Grand Slams. In the past, those leaders have expressed a desire to restructure tennis, creating a streamlined event calendar that revolves around their events and the 1,000-level ATP and WTA events, which are one rung below their tournaments.

The discussions between the Grand Slams and PTPA aim to develop a framework for a new structure for professional tennis. That structure would then be circulated to the ATP, WTA, and ITF for their input.

The Grand Slams and other governing bodies, however, have been doing this dance since last year, when the Grand Slams presented the tours with a plan for a so-called “premium tour,” with fewer events and a pooling of their lucrative media rights.

That plan never went beyond discussions, and earlier this year, the ATP and WTA presented the Grand Slams with their own plan to reform tennis, which the Grand Slams rejected out of hand. The PTPA believes that the spectre of lengthy and expensive antitrust litigation will create more urgency for change. Thus far, this has not been the case.

While their complaints have been eliminated from the formal PTPA complaint, top players on the ATP and WTA Tours remain in discussions about the schedule and revenue sharing in their sport.

To achieve a high ranking, players typically need to participate in around 20 tournaments each year worldwide. The top players, who regularly go deep in those tournaments, have said that they don't receive necessary rest and that the sport's roughly four-week off-season is far too short.

They are also subject to financial penalties and other punishments if they skip mandatory tournaments.

The players — and the PTPA — also want the Grand Slams and ATP and WTA tournaments to share a higher proportion of revenue with players. They could offer to share more than the roughly 20 percent of their revenues with players by significantly increasing prize money.

Major American sports leagues, such as the NBA and NFL, share approximately 50 percent of their revenues with players. Grand Slam prize money typically amounts to between 13 and 18 percent of each tournament's annual revenue, while for ATP and WTA events, that figure rises closer to 25 or 30 percent.

The courts will next address the defendants' motions to dismiss the case or to move it to arbitration.

Few players on the ATP Tour use the underarm serve as creatively — and effectively — as Corentin Moutet.

During his second-round win against Daniel Altmaier at the Mallorca Championships presented by ecotrans Group on Wednesday, the Frenchman hit six, winning three of those points. It's a shot that Moutet, now into his first quarter-final of 2025, has become known for. But there is an underlying logic.



“It depends on the position of the opponent,” Moutet said when asked about the shot at Roland Garros last month. “Some opponents are very close to the baseline. In this case, it's not the best shot to use. I don't go on the court with any tactic, because everybody's different. I'm trying to adapt.”

Watch Moutet Hit Six Underarm Serves in Mallorca:

After improving to 2-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Altmaier, Moutet will now face #NextGenATP Learner Tien in the quarter-finals. Moutet is riding high after scoring the biggest win of his career over Taylor Fritz at Queen's Club last week.

The No. 83 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Moutet owns a 6-2 Mallorca record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, having reached the quarter-finals in 2023.

Carlos Alcaraz is back at Wimbledon and back with a familiar face in his surroundings.

Three days on from winning his second title at Queen's Club, Alcaraz reunited with coach Juan Carlos Ferrero on Wednesday at Aorangi Park. During the Spaniard's run at the ATP 500 event in west London, Samuel Lopez was present as the main coach.



The two-time defending champion at SW19, Alcaraz is riding an 18-match winning streak — the longest of his career — after capturing titles in Rome and at Roland Garros, where he defeated rival Jannik Sinner in the final. The 22-year-old is aiming to join Bjorn Borg (1978-80) as the only men in the Open Era to achieve the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive years.

Although he can't catch Sinner for the World No. 1 spot during the Wimbledon fortnight, Alcaraz is aiming to extend his 2,240-point lead atop the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, which serves as an indicator as to who will claim the coveted ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours.

Boisson stunned the tennis world as a 361st-ranked wildcard to reach a home semi-final at Roland Garros

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Roland Garros surprise package Lois Boisson will not get the chance to emulate her heroics at Wimbledon after seeing her hopes of a first main-draw appearance end abruptly in qualifying.

Boisson, 22, stunned the world in a storybook run to the French Open semi-finals, doing so as a 361st-ranked wildcard.

Her journey in Paris ended at the hands of eventual champion Coco Gauff in the last four, but her sensational campaign nevertheless shot her up the rankings to 65 in the world.

However, Boisson's shock rise to prominence came past the cut-off to enter the Wimbledon main draw, having been ranked outside the top 400 when that deadline rolled around five or so weeks ago.

That forced her to go through qualifying, a campaign which ended on Tuesday as she lost 6-2, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4 to Canada's Carlson Branstine.

Branstine will face former US champion and compatriot Bianca Andreescu next with two more rounds of qualifying to go.

Boisson also gained notoriety in the tennis world this year following comments from Harriet Dart in April, which saw the Brit complain about her smell and say she needs to “wear deodorant” mid-match. 

Wimbledon begins on June 30, kicking off the third grand slam of the year.

Roger Federer believes there was one particular moment that stood out from Rafael Nadal's farewell ceremony at the French Open as he feels his long-term rival's reaction said it all.

Roland Garros waved goodbye to their favourite son at the start of this year's tournament as the King of Clay was honoured during an emotional ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

Nadal bowed out from tennis last November and he finished his career with 22 Grand Slams titles with 14 coming at his beloved French Open.

The Spaniard won his maiden trophy in Paris as a 19-year-old on his debut at the tournament in 2005 and he went on to dominate the event with his last title coming in 2022.

He finished an astonishing 112–4 win-loss record and it was only right that his four biggest rivals during his playing career attended his farewell.

Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray joined Nadal on Philippe-Chatrier during the tribute ceremony.

In an interview with TNT Sports, 20-time Grand Slam winner Federer said: “It was amazing. I think everyone loved the tribute, especially Rafa, who is the one who had to love it. I have heard him in several interviews talking about how he felt, that makes me very happy.

“They were moments of great emotion, gratitude, it was incredible to see his reaction when they showed the plaque with his name on it.”

And it was the unveiling of the plaque that really captured the imagination not just on the day, but in the days after the ceremony as several players took selfies after their matches during this year's French Open.

Rafael Nadal's full message to ‘Big 4' rivals amid emotional French Open farewell

Federer added: “For me it was the most exciting thing, that plaque will be there forever, all the players who step on the court will see it, they will surely be inspired and motivated thanks to him.

“Sincerely, he had the farewell and the tribute he deserved. I am happy for him, grateful for allowing me to live it from there with them. It had been many months since I had seen them.

The stars of the WTA Tour are ramping up their Wimbledon preparations as they get ready for the third Grand Slam of the year.

There are few events more difficult to predict than Wimbledon, as the last eight tournaments have yielded different winners.

In 2024, Barbora Krejcikova won Wimbledon as the number 31 seed, one year after her countrywoman Marketa Vondrousova became the first unseeded player to win at the All England Club.

This time around, many are predicting Grand Slam winners Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff, and Madison Keys to make deep runs at SW19.

One former Grand Slam winner won't be joining the field, however, following her shock defeat in the second round of Wimbledon qualifying.

Returning to the WTA Tour at the beginning of the 2025 clay-court season, 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu quickly found her footing, embarking on an impressive run to the last 16 in Rome.

Failing to make the cut for Roland Garros, Andreescu entered Grand Slam qualifying for the first time in seven years.

After winning her opening match in straight sets 6-0, 6-0, Andreescu lost in the second round of French Open qualifying, 6-2, 6-7, 4-6.

Missing out on an appearance in the main draw of the French Open, the 25-year-old was no doubt determined to make amends on grass.

Just as she did in Paris, Andreescu started strongly, winning her opening match in Wimbledon qualifying against Brazil's Laura Pigossi, 6-2, 6-1.

Next up was a tough test against her fellow Canadian, Carson Branstine, who beat two seeded players at the Libema Open earlier this month.

Losing out in three sets, Andreescu fell to Branstine 6-7, 6-4, 1-6, as she missed out on the main draw of a Grand Slam for the second time this year.

The world number 147 will now have to reset, as she looks to find some form before the US Open, an event for which she will likely be given a Wild Card.

Andreescu shocked the world at the 2019 US Open, winning the title on her Flushing Meadows debut.

Finishing the year ranked fourth in the world, the sky was the limit for Andreescu, as many predicted she would win more Grand Slams in the future.

Unfortunately for the youngster, a knee injury, combined with the global pandemic, all but wrote off her 2020 season, as she made her return ahead of the 2021 Australian Open.

It didn't take her long to return to the top, qualifying for the final of the 2021 Miami Open, where she came up short against Ashleigh Barty, retiring due to injury in the second set.

Failing to build any momentum from her run in Miami, Andreescu finished the year as the world number 46.

Things got worse in 2022, as she struggled for form, except for a run to the final in Bad Homburg and a WTA 1000 quarterfinal appearance in Madrid.

Andreescu chose to take a hiatus from tennis mid-way through 2023 as results continued to disappoint, returning to the WTA Tour in June 2024. 

The return was largely unsuccessful, reaching just one semi-final at the Libema Open, taking down Naomi Osaka en route to the last four.

One year on, Andreescu finds herself at a career crossroads, as her ranking continues to fall year after year, and her Grand Slam victory now seems a distant memory.

Only time will tell if Andreescu can rediscover the form that saw her beat Serena Williams in a Grand Slam final, but it will certainly be something to look out for as the season progresses.

Andreescu is not currently scheduled to appear at any WTA Tour events over the next few weeks, as fans will have to wait and see where she returns to action.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

...

While winning any Grand Slam is a monumental accomplishment in tennis, winning Wimbledon remains the peak of the sport. Since the tournament started in 1877, it's remained tennis' most prestigious event. When you think of tennis, Wimbledon immediately comes to mind.

The 2025 tournament is set to kick off soon, and plenty of the big names will be looking to win it all. On the men's side, Carlos Alcaraz will look to carry his French Open momentum forward. Alcaraz will head into Wimbledon as the No. 2 ranked men's player, behind Jannik Sinner, who Alcaraz defeated to win the French Open. Alcarez has won Wimbledon the last two years, so he's no stranger to success at the event.

On the women's side, Barbora Krejcikova will look to defend her crown after taking down some tough competition last year. But a number of higher-ranked women will look to prove themselves after disappointing performances at Wimbledon in 2024. Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek both suffered early losses at the tournament. Women's No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka had to withdraw from the event due to a shoulder injury. That should give Krejcikova plenty of competition as she looks to repeat.

With Wimbledon 2025 just around the corner, here's everything you need to know about the prestigious event, including the dates, schedule and draw for the tournament.

Wimbledon 2025 will begin Monday, June 30. The event will progress until the middle of July, with the women's final being held Saturday, July 12. The men's final will occur the following day.

That's fairly standard for the event, which normally begins at the end of June and ends in mid-July.

Below is a full schedule for Wimbledon 2025:

Monday, June 30: First round singles play begins

Tuesday, July 1: First round singles play continues

Wednesday, July 2: Second round singles play begins

Thursday, July 3: Second round singles play continues

Friday, July 4: Third round singles play begins

Saturday, July 5: Third round singles play continues

Sunday, July 6: Fourth round singles play begins

Monday, July 7: Fourth round singles play continues

Tuesday, July 8: Singles quarterfinals play begins

Wednesday, July 9: Singles quarterfinals play continues

Thursday, July 10: Women's singles semifinals

Friday, July 11: Men's singles semifinals

Saturday, July 12: Women's singles final

Sunday, July 13: Men's singles final

Draws have not been completed for Wimbledon 2025 at this time. Both the men's and women's draw will occur Friday, June 27. This section will be updated once draws are completed.

Wimbledon seeds will mostly follow the ATP and WTA rankings. Wimbledon already released a seeding announcement for the 2025 tournament ahead of its draw.

Much like the ATP rankings, Jannik Sinner is the top-seeded male competitor at the tournament. He'll be followed by Carlos Alcaraz.

Here's how the rest of the top 10 shake out on the men's side:

Jannik Sinner (ITA)

Carlos Alcaraz (ESP)

Alexander Zverev (GER)

Jack Draper (GBR)

Taylor Fritz (USA)

Novak Djokovic (SRB)

Lorenzo Musetti (ITA)

Holger Rune (DEN)

Daniil Medvedev (RUS)

Ben Shelton (USA)

And here's how the top 10 looks on the women's side:

Aryna Sabalenka (BYS)

Coco Gauff (USA)

Jessica Pegula (USA)

Jasmine Paolini (ITA)

Qinwen Zheng (CHN)

Madison Keys (USA)

Mirra Andreeva (RUS)

Iga Swiatek (POL)

Paula Badosa (ESP)

Emma Navarro (USA)

The winners of Wimbledon in 2025 will receive £3,000,000. That's an increase of 11.1 percent compared to last year's prize pool. That converts to $4,092,600.

Every participant in the event receives money for making it in. The total prize pool for 2025 Wimbledon singles players is £38,828,000. That's an 8.2 percent increase compared to 2024.

Wimbledon 2025 will air on ESPN in the United States. The network has broadcast Wimbledon since 2003, and has held exclusive rights in the U.S. since 2013. Coverage will be shown on ESPN, ABC, ESPN2 and ESPN Deportes. Every match is available to be streamed with ESPN+.

Disney+ subscribers will be able to watch the first day of the tournament on the Disney+ app. Individuals who have the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle will be able to stream the entire tournament.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"

Dan Evans assessed Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper's chances of lifting the Wimbledon title in their careers.

Andy Murray ended Britain's 77-year wait for a male Wimbledon winner in 2013 and claimed the title again three years later.

On the other hand, no British woman has lifted the Venus Rosewater dish since Virginia Wade defeated Betty Stöve in 1977. 

As the current British number ones, both Draper and Raducanu are best positioned to bring success to the home fans, but with stiff competition on both the ATP and WTA Tour, it will not be easy.

🔥 “Jack Draper has the ability to win Wimbledon. No doubt about that.” 💪🎾Dan Evans backs Jack Draper — and maybe Emma Raducanu too — to finally end the British wait.#BBCTennis #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/OXd3q5SVAt

The British winners of the Wimbledon Championships have been few and far between.

Murray was the first British man since Fred Perry in the 1930s to win the title, while no woman has tasted victory at Wimbledon for 48 years.

In the current game, Jack Draper has positioned himself as the world number four and he already has a Grand Slam semi-final at the US Open to his name.

Emma Raducanu knows what it takes to win a major after her success at Flushing Meadows in 2021. That being said, Dan Evans thinks both players have the ability to succeed at Wimbledon and make more British tennis history.

“Winning Wimbledon took 77 years. Jack Draper has the ability to win Wimbledon, there's no doubt about that. He has the serve and he has the game. Will he do it? It's impossible to answer that at the minute,” Evans told BBC Sounds.

“But he has the biggest chance out of any of the Brits right now obviously. I can see Emma maybe winning it. I think she is starting to get there on the grass.”

Evans is now 35 years of age and he is the one of elder statesmen in British tennis.

Therefore he is keen to see the next generation of players carry British tennis forward, and he shared his thoughts on those players, including British number two Jacob Fearnley.

“Fearnley has a quarter in him quite easily and if the draw is right you never know what can happen once you're in the quarters,” Evans said. “Henry Searle has a long way to go but he has a dangerous game. The women are on a really good track at the minute I feel.

“Mimi Xu was just on court and does not look out of place at these events and that is pretty impressive. She looks really comfortable. The team she has around her. She has Nigel Sears in her box, which is a top, top women's coach who has coached many top 10 players.

“Hannah Klugman, Mika [Stojsavljevic] has won the US Open juniors. That is a group of three who should be really excited about, which the LTA are, but they have to keep on the right path. 

“It's not about this moment, it's about four or five years time and keep improving, keep doing the stuff you need to do and I think you could easily see one of those three in the semi of Wimbledon in a few years. They are on the right track.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Roger Federer hinted that he could be reunited with Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray at Wimbledon, but was left in the dark over whether his rival-turned-friend Rafael Nadal would make the trip to SW19. Federer is considered royalty in south-west London and is given the red-carpet treatment when he returns to the site of his eight Grand Slam titles.

Federer sat in the royal box next to Princess Kate in 2023 as he was honoured on Centre Court, before returning the very next year to watch Murray play before his farewell at the All England Club. The Swiss legend's trips to England for Wimbledon have become annual and he hinted that he will likely make the same journey again for the 2025 edition.

""I probably will go to Wimbledon, but I don't know if Rafa will be there during the tournament,” he told TNT Sports.

Federer also shared that he would likely catch up with Djokovic, as he is scheduled to play at the tournament, while Murray is expected to be in the vicinity also.

""We will see Novak in the draw, while Andy will probably be at the facilities,” Federer added.

He also revealed that he is trying to tempt the ‘Big Four' to reunite once again at the Laver Cup, which this year takes place in San Francisco.

Federer continued: ""Then there is the Laver Cup, another very special week, I will try to recruit them for the occasion. I don't know what other dates we have ahead of us, I'm sure we'll be in touch, although it might be easier for us to coincide on the golf course than on the tennis court.""

The 43-year-old had been discussing Nadal's goodbye ceremony at the French Open, when the four tennis icons all joined together on the Roland Garros clay to pay tribute to the 14-time winner in Paris.

""It was amazing,"" Federer said about the tribute, when Nadal was surprised with a permanent plaque on Court Philippe-Chatrier with his footprint etched.

""I think everyone loved the tribute, especially Rafa, who is the one who had to love it. I have heard him in several interviews talking about how he felt, that makes me very happy.

""They were moments of great emotion, gratitude, it was incredible to see his reaction when they showed the plaque with his name on it.

""For me it was the most exciting thing, that plaque will be there forever, all the players who step on the court will see it, they will surely be inspired and motivated thanks to him.

""Sincerely, he had the farewell and the tribute he deserved. I am happy for him, grateful for allowing me to live it from there with them. It had been many months since I had seen them.

""It is always a pleasure to meet all Rafa's family and friends, I am lucky to know them and I was delighted to see them all smiling.”

Hey everyone, 

• A quick mailbag before Wimbledon. We'll do Sports Illustrated's Wimbledon seed reports when the draw comes out on Friday. 

• Here's the most recent installment of Served … Andy and I will do a draw preview crash-and-burn on Friday.

• Immodestly, thanks to all of you who wrote about Surviving Ohio State. The documentary game is a team sport. But make no mistake, the real MVPs here are the subjects who had the courage to go public. A few of you asked how to watch. I don't know about international rights, but it's streaming on HBO Max here.

• Good soldiering: Tennis Channel will do pregaming and postgaming from Wimbledon when ESPN goes off the air. Steve Weissman, Martina Navratilova and I will be at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. Prakash Amritraj, Brett Haber, Lindsay Davenport and Jim Courier will be in the studio.

Onward …

Remember that one time [Carlos] Alcaraz had a slump?

Yeah, he doesn't either.

Chris B.

• Remember that one time when Netflix aired a documentary about Alcaraz, themed around his wavering commitment to true greatness?

Hi Jon,

I was thrilled to be included in your mailbag a few weeks back. Pretty cool you (or someone on your team) are actually reading all these messages and taking the time to respond to fellow tennis nerds. Much appreciated. 

I was excited to see the mixed doubles lineup that the U.S. Open put out this week. Wouldn't it be incredible if we could find a way to get more top players in doubles action? No offense to M. Arevalo or M. Pavić (yes I had to look up the two top ranked men's doubles players), but wouldn't it be more exciting to see Alcaraz, [Jannik] Sinner or [Daniil] Medvedev on court more often? Occasionally, we see the top women teaming up and I find myself actually checking the scores and highlights to see who won. 

I love the moving of mixed doubles to the week before the main action, but what about narrowing the doubles fields to 32 pairs and starting it in the final week of the slam? That way players who get knocked out early have a reason to hang around and compete. Instead of having insanely busy courts during the opening rounds, more courts stay in use throughout the tournament and fans might have more reason to go watch doubles. 

I'm sure there's a reason this hasn't been tried before, but what is it?

Robert Henry Tavira, Portugal

• Here's where I stand on the U.S. Open bombshell mixed doubles announcement …

A) We often talk about how tennis needs to do a better job innovating, cultivating stars, rethinking old models, building casual fans, etc. When folks make an attempt like this, well, they aren't entitled to a free pass—look, this could be an abject disaster—but they do deserve the benefit of the doubt.

B) We need to be realistic about the current status of mixed doubles. Here's the field from Roland Garros. Without disparaging anyone, can we agree there is a marked difference in draw power and star power between this and the U.S. Open?

C) Not unrelated, we also need to be realistic about where mixed doubles figures into the tapestry of majors these days. In Paris, even the finals were played (on a Thursday) before a modest crowd and with no television coverage. The idea that we are trivializing a grand tradition is not an accurate reflection of the situation. Let's not over-romanticize an event that even hard-core fans barely acknowledge.

D) Note that the brains and driving force behind this is Eric Butorac, one of the tennis forces for good, but, perhaps ironically, a former doubles player, precisely the kind of player who would have been excluded from this kind of star-driven event. 

E) I don't buy the argument: These players don't need the money. They shouldn't be taking from the doubles players. This isn't the Brooklyn food co-op. This is a competition. If you want the prize, go win it. We would never say, Why is this team sport athlete taking an All-Star game position from another player who could benefit from the slot?

F) Note that there's a difference between a tentative list issued in mid-June and the actual list of players who will play that week.

G) There has been so much chatter just based on the listed pairings. What do Sinner and Emma Navarro have in common? Why does Naomi Osaka insist on burning reputational capital on Nick Kyrgios? Where's Coco Gauff, who actually excels at doubles? Doesn't this level of interest, in itself, suggest a win?

H) If this is remotely successful, there's no way other events don't “copy” the concept. If it fails or comes across more as a gimmick than a legit title, put it in the category of the missed underarm serve. Good effort. Good attempt at a disruption. Now let's go back to the conventional method.

Hey Jon!

I enjoyed today's (6/18) mailbag discussion about possibilities for leveraging the recent televised success of Roland Garros for the betterment of our game. 

At the same time, this NYT article seemed like a sobering glimpse into the future of sports fandom across major sports.

What's your take on the likelihood of television rights for major sports events being swallowed up by the wealthy few?

Jim Lenker, Buffalo, NY

• I was a bit torn by this op-ed. It's a fair point: It's never been more expensive to be a sports fan. But, I thought it also had the ring of old tennis players lamenting that today's stars are so wealthy they have entourages! My response: Yes, perhaps it would be nicer if there were more collegiality. But if players were still carpooling to events and sharing hotel rooms, something would be profoundly wrong. Entourages and private air travel and “teams” are an offshoot of the sport's growth and success. Which was always the goal.

Likewise, yes, it would be nice if the U.S. Open grounds passes weren't $250 … if we didn't need subscriptions to watch our favorite sports and teams … if bottled water weren't $8 at the concussion stand … if the Los Angeles Lakers were a civic trust and not a $10 billion business. But the market is the market. Supply doesn't intersect with demand by accident.

As for tennis media rights, my guess is that they won't be swallowed up. On the contrary, they will be parsed, not unlike the NFL and NBA media rights deals, and not unlike how tennis is split today. TNT might add to its Roland Garros package. ESPN is broadcasting three weeks per major at three majors. Tennis Channel has rights throughout the year. Amazon or another streamer might take another gander at tennis. 

As long as there are multiple parties willing to pay, and as long as there is so much inventory, why commit to one outlet? Unfortunately, this means more subscriptions for us. But until/unless we opt out and the market changes, the media outlets will charge what they can.

Hello Jon, 

Thank you for sending me your mailbag every week. Your writing and insights are always amazing and appreciated.  I have a request. Once you printed an observation another player made about Rafa [Nadal]. The player talked about how Rafa always says hi to other players even if he had just lost a match. Can you either reprint or send me this tribute? I remember it as remarkable worthy of a life lesson I would like to share with others. 

With appreciation,  Rashmi

• Thanks. Honestly, I'm not sure what you're referring to, but it sounds on-brand for Nadal. It could be any of 100 players. (I would add: I've heard the same for Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Federer used to do a video for ITF juniors making the jump to the pros. He essentially played the role of the senior welcoming the freshmen. He even said words to the effect of, “If you have questions, don't be shy, seek me out!”) 

Here's one story I like to tell. I always like talking to tournament drivers about their experiences. A few years ago, I asked a driver who was the nicest player she had shuttled to and from the venue.

“Federer or Nadal,” she responded.

“Okay,” I said. “But not just the stars. Of ALL the players, who treated you the best?”

“Federer or Nadal,” she said.

Hi Jon

Thanks for the Mailbag and 50 Parting shots. Always such a good read. In response to a letter from JB, PDX about the match tiebreak you wrote, “it spares us the absurdity of winning by a two-game margin.” While I'm happy to admit that I'm a traditionalist and a fan of the two game margin I don't see how deciding a set by a two-game margin can be considered “absurd” when that is the standard way most sets are won? If anything is absurd it is arguably deciding a grand slam championship based on only a two point margin. A champion is the player who can break and hold.  Great players can break. Great players win grand slam tournaments.

David, Adelaide, Australia

• “If anything is absurd, it is arguably deciding a grand slam championship based on only a two-point margin.” In the Roland Garros final, Sinner won 193 points and Alcaraz 192! It was a one-point margin. And the winning player had fewer total points!

Seriously, I appreciate your, well, point. I guess I should have said “potential absurdity.” When players win divisive sets 70–68—or even 16–14; or in a best-to-seven shootout at 12–12—it makes tennis look unserious. At 6–6, a 10-pointer versus a seven-pointer bakes in a bigger sample size.

Hi Jon,

What are tennis players looking for when they examine multiple balls from the ball crew before a serve? They even do it with new balls. I could see on clay that there may be some dirt on a ball and a player would not want to serve that ball. But most players do it on all surfaces, indoor and outdoor.

Serena Williams and Roger Federer never examined the balls; they just served the one given to them.

I do not recall ever seeing this addressed in your mailbag.

Jim Yrkoski, Silver Creek, Neb.

• It varies. Sometimes, certain balls are genuinely fluffy (or less fluffy) than others. After winning a point, some players superstitiously demand to play with the same ball. My theory: Some players might look as though they're inspecting the ball as assiduously as a grandma examining fruit at the market, but in actuality, they're just clearing their head. 

I've noticed you correctly use the term “major” whenever you're speaking about one title at a grand slam event. Andy (and many many others) use “major” interchangeably with “grand slam,” and that seems to short-change the achievement of winning all four majors (whether in a calendar year or over a career, either of which can be called a grand slam). After all, the term comes from baseball where not every home run is a slam. You need to drive in four runs (bases loaded plus yourself) to get a slam. You should need to win four different majors before you have a “grand slam.” 

Novak has 24 majors. Rafa has 22 majors. Roger has 20 majors. All of them have a career grand slam. None won a calendar slam. Alcaraz has 5 majors, no slam (yet). 

Zach 

• You know how it is with Roddick. Can you trust anything that guy says? As it is written, a major is one of the four biggest tennis events. A Grand Slam is a Denny's breakfast comprising two fluffy buttermilk pancakes served with two eggs made your way, two Applewood-smoked bacon strips and two all-pork sausage links.

Emma Raducanu's ""coy smile"" and ""hair-preen gestures"" while talking about about her new doubles partner Carlos Alcaraz indicate a romance is brewing courtside, a body language expert says.

Raducanu, 22, was spotted cheering for the Spaniard at the Queen's Club Championship in West Kensington, London, on Thursday and Saturday - the day before he won the competition after beating Jiri Lehecka. The victory came after it was announced Alcaraz, also 22, and Raducanu will team up for the revamped US Open mixed doubles event in August.

Speaking about her ""genuine connection"" with the two-time Wimbledon champ did little to quash speculation ""there is something going on between them,"" according to body language expert Judi James. She noted Raducanu's ""coy smile"" and ""hair-preen gestures"" during this interview, signs Ms James believes suggest a new tennis love match is on the cards.

The expert said: ""The fans love a whiff of a romance and it has to be said that her body language might be a bit of a thirst-trap for audiences starved of a love-all relationship since Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert hooked up back in the Seventies."" The American former tennis players' ""fairytale romance"" also began at the Queen's Club.

Speaking to Mail Online, Ms James added Emma appeared to ""stall for time"" by repeating the interviewer's question about Alcaraz but ""the way the coy smile spread across her face as she rattled off their history together"" - coupled with the way she played with her hair - was akin to a ""fan-girl reaction"".

Raducanu and Alcaraz's chemistry led to fans chattering about a potential romance. Raducanu gushed in the TV interview at Eastbourne, ahead of her first-round match against Ann Li on Sunday, adding fuel to the fire.

And Raducanu's features ""softened"" and ""gaze became evasive"" as she reflected on her friendship with the Spanish ace, Ms James continued, also pointing out the Londoner's ""pouting and posing"" in the interview.

But Raducanu has remained coy in the conversations themselves about Alcaraz, firm favourite to win Wimbledon, explaining they became friends at Wimbledon 2021. She said: ""He's so nice, very happy, amazing values and just a really positive light to be around.

""I've known him for years. Wimbledon 2021 was the first time I started getting to know him. He was always playing the day before me, I would see him win and then I would have motivation to win and get myself into that position too. It was really cool to go through that tournament together and then I kept going through the US Open, we were staying in touch for the whole time and, yeah, it's nice.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","U.S. Open winner breaks down in tears after 'difficult' pre-Wimbledon moment","https://www.themirror.com/sport/tennis/us-open-winner-breaks-down-1227741","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 12:31:00 GMT","

Emma Raducanu fought through the challenging winds and lingering back pain to secure a resilient comeback victory over Ann Li at Eastbourne on Tuesday.

The British tennis player is now anxiously waiting to assess her physical condition ahead of her next match, scheduled for Wednesday. Raducanu, ranked 38 globally, had been forced to skip the previous week's Berlin Open due to persistent back spasms.

Raducanu shot to fame in 2021 by winning the U.S. Open as a qualifier. The 22-year-old, who has been targeted by a stalker in recent months, will return to Flushing Meadows later this year to partner Carlos Alcaraz in the mixed doubles.

Raducanu's lingering back issue was evident at various points during her match against Li. Nonetheless, she rebounded admirably after conceding a closely contested first set and was visibly emotional upon wrapping up a 6-7, 6-3, 6-1 win, celebrated in the presence of her coach Mark Petchey, and an honored guest in her corner, British No. 5 Fran Jones.

Post-match, Raducanu reflected: ""It was a physically demanding match. I think it was pretty difficult and in the wind, you're constantly trying to adjust. We had some long rallies, you're running a lot. So I feel okay, I mean, a little bit of fatigue and a bit of stiffness, but I need to just see how I pull up tomorrow.""

The British No. 1's emotional display on court, as she clinched her second-round spot, was accompanied by gratitude for the crowd's support. She further elaborated: ""I received some pretty bad news, so I would like to keep it personal if that's okay, but it was difficult and very emotional at the end and probably just a release of different emotions.""

Raducanu also found solace in having fellow tennis player Jones lending support from her corner. Currently ranked 125 globally, Jones is also participating in Eastbourne this week and is set for her second-round match on Wednesday. On her day off, she slipped into the role of coach, joining Raducanu's support box with Mark Petchey and rooting for her loud and clear.

""I was at her match in Madrid, and it's nice whenever the schedule works, you know, we like to be there for each other. And today, obviously she's a close friend of mine, so she kind of knew what was going on behind the scenes and to have her support there on a day like today meant so much to me,"" Raducanu expressed about Jones' presence.

""She's someone who is so intelligent about tennis and about life as well, but, you know, she did so good and the best aim of the coach is, you know, to coach yourself out of a job. And when she left in the third set, I seemed to win through 6-1.

""So, yeah, I give her a lot of credit for that, and it's nice to just see her on the side of the court, giving me a lot of support. But honestly, speaking about tennis, she's someone I could also speak to for hours about picking apart tactics and technique and players and everything. It's a really great sounding board.""

Amidst the blustery conditions in Eastbourne which posed challenges for all players, Raducanu found value in overcoming the obstacles. She further explained: ""It's not easy to drop the first in a tiebreak and you to come back and regroup and also breakdown in the second set, I'm really, really proud of myself, how I kind of fought back.

""Then in the third set, really found an extra level and also got over the conditions today, which were really windy, and it's not something I've necessarily been good at in the past. So yeah, adding to that bank of experience too.""

Raducanu is set to go head-to-head with Australian teen Maya Joint once again, following their intense match at the Italian Open in May, where the British star emerged victorious with scores of 7-5, 6-7, 6-3. Reflecting on their upcoming rematch, Raducanu remarked: ""I remember our match in Rome, I came off and I was like 'Wow, I had to play really, really well to win that match.'

""I think I played some really great tennis that day in Rome and she's obviously since has won her first WTA title and has really kind of taken off and it's kind of in a way good to see that when you come off playing someone, you're like, 'Wow, they played like really well' and then they actually like win it's good to see.

""But I know I'm expecting a really tough match, and she obviously beat Ons in the first round, which is really, really difficult. She's had a lot of success on grass. So, yeah, I'm expecting a battle.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Carlos Alcaraz slammed for 'embarrassing' U.S. Open comments","https://www.yardbarker.com/tennis/articles/carlos_alcaraz_slammed_for_embarrassing_us_open_comments/s1_13132_42372421","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 15:57:10 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz showed a different side to himself when he appeared alongside Emma Raducanu, his new mixed doubles partner, to promote the inaugural U.S. Open mixed doubles event. 

The Spaniard called Raducanu ""the boss"" of their team and said he was excited to have ""fun"" on the court with his partner. 

The lighthearted nature of Alcaraz's comments has irked former singles World No. 10 Kristina Mladenovic, a winner of nine major doubles and three mixed doubles titles. 

“When you hear Alcaraz or others say they're going to have fun while preparing for the U.S. Open, it's embarrassing,"" she told EuroSport France. ""A Grand Slam is neither preparation nor fun. It's years of sacrifice. When you're young, you dream of winning one, even in doubles. You don't want to see your sport turn into a gigantic spectacle, even if it will indeed bring in a lot of money.""

The criticism seems entirely unwarranted. Alcaraz and Raducanu were filming promotional content to generate interest in a new concept introduced by the USTA, which could gain popularity and spread to other majors in the coming years. 

As former World No. 1 Andy Roddick noted, the event is an exhibition one, akin to the NBA All-Star Game, and aims to generate fan interest in the main event — the singles U.S. Open draw. As such, there's nothing preposterous about players having ""fun"" the weekend before the real tennis begins. 

Also, Alcaraz, a five-time major winner at 22, has more than earned the right to let his hair down once in a while. If he wins the upcoming Wimbledon, he'll become just the fourth player to achieve a three-peat at the grass-court major, and the youngest ever to win six Grand Slam titles, surpassing Bjorn Borg and Rafael Nadal.

Roger Federer won 1,251 tour-level matches across his iconic career, but which matches were his favourite?

The tennis icon is one of the most successful players in the history of the sport, with a staggering 20 Grand Slam singles titles to his name – so he has plenty of matches to choose from.

However, in an interview with Eurosport Spain, the Swiss star has now revealed the three favourite wins of his two-decade-long career.

The 43-year-old selected his 2001 Wimbledon win over Pete Sampras, his 2009 French Open final win over Robin Soderling, and his classic 2017 Australian Open final triumph over Rafael Nadal.

Roger Federer reveals ‘most exciting thing' about Rafael Nadal farewell

“The first one I would like to remember is clear: Wimbledon 2001 and my match against Pete Sampras,” said Federer.

“That match was facing the hero of a whole generation, my first time on Wimbledon's centre court, without knowing everything that tournament would bring me in my career.

“Second, I would choose the 2009 Roland Garros final. I chased that tournament for a long time, until this season when the floodgates opened with Rafa's elimination.

“I felt like everyone was behind me; they really wanted me to win; it made me feel very special.

“Finally, I will stick to the 2017 Australian Open final, right after my knee problems. It was a complete match, it had everything. I would like to relive all those emotions.”

Federer's fourth-round victory over Sampras proved to be his breakthrough match, with a then 19-year-old Federer handing his idol a first defeat at Wimbledon since 1996.

Though the Swiss did not win the title that year, he did go on to win a record eight men's singles titles at the All England Club, eclipsing Sampras' previous milestone of seven.

The 2009 French Open final victory over Soderling not only saw Federer tie Sampras' then-Open Era record of 14 Grand Slam men's singles titles, but also complete the Career Grand Slam.

Roland Garros success had eluded the Swiss up until that point, with Rafael Nadal beating him in three straight finals from 2006 to 2008.

Victory over Soderling, who had beaten Nadal earlier in the event, sealed what proved to be the only French Open title of Federer's career.

Federer's 2017 Australian Open final over Nadal remains one of the most celebrated Grand Slam finals of recent times, and a key match in his iconic rivalry with the Spaniard.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion was the 17th seed in Melbourne, having struggled with injury throughout 2016, and had not won a major title in four-and-a-half years.

Nadal had also not won a major for over two years and held a 3-1 lead in the deciding set, before Federer stormed back to win his 18th Grand Slam title, and fifth Australian Open title.

                Can the American capture his first Eastbourne crown?            

No. 2 seed Tommy Paul features in his first tournament since Roland Garros, as he battles home favourite Dan Evans at the 2025 ATP Lexus Eastbourne Open on Wednesday. This Round of 16 tie will be the third meeting between these two stars. Paul will be looking to capture his first title at the British town, having finished as the runner-up here in 2023.

World No. 13 Tommy Paul was beaten by Argentine Francisco Cerundolo in the Eastbourne International final two years ago. The American is enjoying a high moment in his career of late. However, he is yet to pick up a title in 2025 – and turns to Eastbourne for a change in fortune. The 28-year-old comes into this match with a 25-9 record this year – including semifinal runs in Adelaide, Dallas, Houston and Rome.

A former Top-25 player and a proven match winner, Dan Evans has dropped to No. 170 in the ATP Rankings. The British veteran is one of the ‘last of the Mohicans' and continues to dazzle at the age of 35. Mostly taking part in ATP Challengers, he has struggled to get past the qualifiers in most events. Evans produced a phenomenal display against Kecmanovic in the Round of 32 to improve his 2025 record to 3-3 and book his place in Wednesday's marquee clash.

The head-to-head between Tommy Paul and Dan Evans currently stands at 1-1. This will be their first meeting since 2022, when both matches took place.

Paul and Evans have faced each other twice on hard courts. The first of these was at the Canada Masters in Toronto, where the Brit made a comeback after getting dragged through the mud in the opening set. However, Paul drew level in this duel when he helped Team USA earn a point in the Davis Cup by beating his lower ranked opponent. Interestingly, there has never been a straight sets finish when these two stars have faced one another.

Over time, the American has crafted a potent grass court game for himself. He has reached two finals on this surface, including a title charge at Queen's Club last year. Paul will make full use of the tired legs of Evans that had to endure a three set battle on Monday. With an 85% service game win percentage and 50% break point conversion rate on grass, Tommy Paul is the firm favourite.

Prediction: Tommy Paul in straight sets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Who's built to win Wimbledon? Here are Martina Navratilova's eight players to watch","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4296238/whos-built-to-win-wimbledon-here-are-martina-navratilovas-eight-players-to-watch","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 11:17:57 GMT","

With nine Wimbledon titles to her name, Martina Navratilova knows a thing or two about grass-court tennis. Here are the eight players she believes are best positioned to make a deep run this year.

No one in tennis history had a better track record at the All England Club than Martina Navratilova. The synergy between athlete and that living, breathing surface was something to behold.

Navratilova won nine Wimbledon singles titles -- one more than Roger Federer -- and 120 matches there, the most of any player at a Grand Slam in the Open Era and eight more than Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros. From 1982 to 1988, she rattled off a sublime 47-match winning streak on those hallowed lawns.

With that resume in mind, we asked Navratilova to weigh in on the current field. Who stands out to her? Who does she think is built for a deep run on grass this year?

Here are the eight players she'll be watching most closely (players with at least five career Wimbledon match-wins) and what she sees as their best path to going deep next week:

Wimbledon W-L: 11-5

Notable performances: Semifinalist 2021, 2023, did not play 2022, 2024

2025 on grass: Defeated Elena Rybakina in the Berlin quarterfinals before losing to eventual champion Marketa Vondrousova in the semifinals.

Navratilova: Looking at her record, it's hard to think she's not the favorite this year. She's a complete player and has a good game for grass. It's hard to find a weakness or an opening against her. I'm wondering if losing the French Open final will actually help motivate her. I think she finds herself in a good spot.

Wimbledon W-L: 11-5

Notable performances: Round of 16 2019, 2021, 2024

2025 on grass: Lost her first (and only) match on grass in Berlin 6-3, 6-3 to eventual finalist Wang Xinyu.

Navratilova: I think I'd put Coco as the second favorite. The great athletes always shine on grass. She's the best athlete in the women's game. That should pay off for her, and she's flying high after winning the French Open. It's just about managing her game, managing her body, her emotions. She's found the happy medium, the equilibrium between being focused and fired up.

Wimbledon W-L: 8-5

Notable performances: Quarterfinalist 2023

2025 on grass: Lost her first match in Berlin to Liudmila Samsonova 7-6 (8), 7-5, 7-6 (5). Playing Bad Homburg.

Navratilova: I think her weapon is consistency -- and a good volley because she's played a lot of doubles. I would love to see her come forward more often and finish points at net. If the draw is even slightly friendly, she could get to the semis and then she's going to be confident, maybe more aggressive. 

Wimbledon W-L: 6-4

Notable performances: Finalist 2024

2025 on grass: Lost her first match in Berlin to two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur. Playing Bad Homburg.

Navratilova: It was fun to see her run last year, beating Madison Keys and Emma Navarro back-to-back and taking Barbora Krejcikova to three sets in the final. She won Rome and is still a force to be reckoned with. I definitely see her living up to the seeding.

Wimbledon W-L: 25-10

Notable performances: Quarterfinalist 2015, 2023

2025 on grass: Reached the semifinals at Queen's Club, losing to eventual champion Tatjana Maria; fell 7-5, 7-6 (6) to Marketa Vondrousova in Berlin.

Navratilova: After winning Australia, there's a huge weight off her shoulders. Weapons are what win on grass and she's got them. I think she's the third favorite to win the tournament, after Sabalenka and not far behind Gauff.

Wimbledon W-L: 11-5

Notable performances: Quarterfinalist 2023

2025 on grass: Playing Bad Homburg.

Navratilova: Just the fact that she hits the ball so well gives her a chance. Backhand, solid as a rock. Forehand is good enough, even though it doesn't pay off as much on the grass as it does on clay. We haven't seen the draw, but hopefully, she won't be in Sabalenka's quarter.

Wimbledon W-L: 10-5

Notable performances: Round of 16 2021, 2022, 2024

2025 on grass: Won first two matches Berlin, over wild card Eva Lys and Emma Navarro, before retiring (right hip injury) against Wang.

Navratilova: It was tough to watch her struggle with the back injury. It's good to see her relatively healthy again, playing well in Berlin. Three Round of 16s … she's got a game that plays well on grass.  If I were a betting person -- which I am not -- I would be putting money on Keys and Badosa to go deep.

Wimbledon W-L: 19-3

Notable performances: Winner 2022, semifinalist 2024, quarterfinalist 2023

2025 on grass: Lost to Tatjana Maria in the Queen's Club and Aryna Sabalenka in Berlin, both in the quarterfinals.

Navratilova: No weaknesses, good athlete. Not afraid to go forward and knock off the volley. She's got soft enough hands to hit drop shots and plays really smart, high-percentage tennis. She reminds me of Lindsay Davenport, the effortless way she hits the ball. She's not swinging hard, but it's a heavy ball.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.& LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- WTA Ventures and Tennis Channel agreed to a new six-year media rights deal ensuring that Tennis Channel platforms will continue to be the exclusive home of WTA tennis in the United States through 2032.

As a result of the significant new commitment, the drama and entertainment of the Hologic WTA Tour will be available to tennis fans across the United States through Tennis Channel, its streaming network TennisChannel 2, its app and website, TennisChannel.com. The deal covers all WTA 1000, 500 and 250 events (except tournaments in the United States) through to the season-closing WTA Finals, where the world's best singles players and doubles teams battle to be crowned as year-end champions. (The network covers women's events in the United States through other rights contracts.)





 WTA
                        

Following the new agreement, WTA Ventures and Tennis Channel will work together to continue to enhance and innovate coverage of women's tennis, engaging fans and promoting the game to new audiences. These combined efforts will build on the launch of the WTA's bold new brand identity and the strong growth of women's tennis in the United States, where live WTA viewership on Tennis Channel continues to grow in 2025 on top of the prior increase in 2024. This positive trend includes spectacular growth among younger audiences, with live WTA viewership among 18-34s up annually since 2023.

With four U.S. players currently in the Top 10 of the PIF WTA Singles Rankings, including 2024 WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF champion Coco Gauff, the profile of women's tennis has benefited from Tennis Channel's Women's Day programming since June 2024, with every Tuesday dedicated exclusively to women's competition on TennisChannel 2, which is widely available throughout the United States for free. Under the new deal, Tennis Channel will continue to broaden exposure and ensure parity of coverage between the women's and men's tours, as well as increase distribution as part of its strategic growth and expansion across digital and streaming platforms, led by its new Chairman and CEO Jeff Blackburn.





 WTA
                        

Marina Storti, CEO of WTA Ventures, said: “The U.S. is a hugely significant market for the WTA and we are excited to be partnering with Tennis Channel to bring six more seasons of brilliant tennis to fans across all its platforms. Tennis Channel has shown a strong commitment to the WTA through this agreement, and we have a shared ambition to continue to deepen audience engagement and grow the impact of women's tennis. By securing a multi-year investment from a valued strategic partner, this deal is a significant milestone for WTA Ventures as we continue to execute our strategy to achieve a step change in the commercial value of women's tennis.”

Said Blackburn: “The WTA has been an important part of Tennis Channel since our first days on air.  We couldn't be happier to extend this partnership into the next decade. Women's tennis is one of the most thrilling products in sports and the tour has never been stronger than it is right now. Tennis Channel looks forward to developing innovative ways to attract and entertain new fans -- and to keep building on this momentum with Marina and her team.”

F1 The Movie London premiere interview highlights

Brad Pitt has described his involvement in F1 The Movie as “one of the most extraordinary experiences” of his illustrious career.

Brad Pitt has described being involved in Apple Original Films' new movie about F1 as “one of the most extraordinary experiences” of his illustrious career, while paying tribute to the entire paddock for their help and support.

Titled F1, the movie is being directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun: Maverick), Oscar-winning actor Pitt and seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, among other respected names.

Pitt stars as former F1 driver Sonny Hayes, who returns to the sport to partner rookie team mate Joshua Pearce, played by Damson Idris, at the fictional APXGP team – who slot alongside the existing 10 outfits up and down the pit lane.

Filming of F1 has taken place at real events, including at 2024's season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with attention now turning toward its international release on June 25, 2025, and North America debut on June 27, 2025.

Taking some time to discuss the project at the Yas Marina Circuit during filming in Abu Dhabi, Pitt told F1 TV's Will Buxton where his passion for the sport came from, how the movie came about and what viewers can expect when it hits cinemas.

“I've always loved racing,” Pitt begins. “I grew up with Jackie Stewart [racing in F1 as] some of my earliest memories. In the '90s I really got heavily into MotoGP. Then I started veering into F1, and here we are.”

He continues: “I've been trying to get a racing movie done for 20 years. I've tried bikes, I've tried cars, I've tried different disciplines, and for whatever reason they never came to fruition.

“We got a great push behind us [for this film], people were more and more interested [in F1], so we could get [a company] like Apple to come in and really support us.

“It was Joe Kosinski and Jerry Bruckheimer, just coming off [filming] Maverick, who said, ‘[We] want to make the most realistic racing movie we've seen to date', and I think that's what we've done.”

Central to that goal is Pitt and co-star Idris getting behind the wheel of racing cars themselves, with the pair taking to the track at circuits across the F1 calendar alongside experienced, professional drivers.

“I think by the time we get to the movie, it's undeniable [that we are driving the cars],” smiles Pitt, with his actions captured by cutting-edge camera technology. “We're not sitting on a sound stage with wind machines…

“I don't know where I go from here. You can't compete with this experience. It's almost like when we get to the acting scenes, you kind of go, ‘Oh, okay, no driving today!' It's really been amazing.”

Hamilton offered a valuable, helping hand in this area, while also keeping track of the entire filming process to ensure that events and scenes were captured as accurately as possible.

“Everyone has had a hand honing this thing, then Lewis coming in for the ultimate ‘smell test',” says Pitt. “I think we've got something. It's really fun, it's exciting, it's adventurous, and you feel it. I do. I hope others do too.

“Lewis' knowledge has been so immensely helpful. He's been keeping us straight, going, ‘No, that doesn't fly,' right down to the sound. He can actually pick it out and go, ‘No, that's Turn 12, not Turn 16. You need more reverb on the straight' – he's that specific.”

Finally, Pitt paid tribute to the drivers, teams and wider staff members involved in F1 who all embraced the movie and accommodated the “imaginary 11th team” from race weekend to race weekend.

“I've got to thank them all [in F1],” he comments. “The teams have been so generous with us, so welcoming, and they play a part in this film. The drivers, F1 has opened all doors for us…

“It's unbelievable the way they've let us embed into their season. We've tried not to get in the way and they've been really cool with us – I can't thank them enough.”

Pitt signs off: “It's been one of the most extraordinary experiences I've had. I think it shows. At the end of the day, if the guys down pit lane say, ‘Job well done', then we've done it.”

Watch the full video interview with Pitt at the top of this article as he shares more about the thrill of filming, the cars and tracks involved and what it felt like to jump into the cockpit.

Could Sebastian Vettel potentially succeed Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko at some stage in the future?

Sebastian Vettel has revealed that he has spoken with Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko about potentially succeeding the Austrian in his position at some point in the future.

Vettel enjoyed the peak success of his Formula 1 career with Red Bull, bringing the team their first four Drivers' and Teams' titles in a dominant run between 2010 and 2013.

After leaving the squad at the end of 2014, the German went on to race for Ferrari and Aston Martin before departing the grid following the 2022 season, bowing out of F1 with a total of 53 wins, 122 podiums and 57 pole positions under his belt.

Since then the four-time World Champion has made appearances at several races; this has seen him lead tributes to Ayrton Senna in Imola and Sao Paulo, while he hosted a Race4Women event in Saudi Arabia to further develop grassroots karting in the country.

But now Vettel has acknowledged that he could potentially return in another role one day, having had early talks with Marko about the possibility of succeeding him when the 82-year-old decides to retire.

Speaking to ORF TV's Sport am Sonntag podcast, Vettel explained: “There have been a few headlines recently. I still get along great with Helmut, and we're in contact regarding the topic.

“[Talks are] not yet that intensive or in-depth, it's perhaps something that could play a role. In what form remains to be seen.”

The 37-year-old also suggested that it would be impossible to “replace” Marko, as well as voicing his hope that the Austrian remains in his role for some time yet.

“He's irreplaceable. Let's just leave it at that,” Vettel added. “His character alone... and he's made a very, very significant contribution to what the entire team has achieved over the years since 2005. And perhaps it wouldn't even be the goal to have someone replace him.

""He's said a few times that he's going to quit, but he's still here. I hope he stays with us for a long time. But of course, at some point, things will inevitably move on, and he knows that. He's a brutal realist and can assess things quite well. He'll sense when the time is right.

""I have to admit, though, that I haven't been that close in recent years. But I do think I know what he's doing. And no matter what happens, there's still a lot to learn from him.""

From Brad Pitt, to Damson Idris, F1 The Movie has a star-studded cast perfect for any summer blockbuster.

Whether it's the Oscar-winning legend Brad Pitt or rising star Damson Idris, F1 The Movie has a stellar cast fit for any blockbuster.

With the film out now following it's international release on June 25, and a North American launch on June 27, the public can now view the final product after years of hard work on and off track.

Set in the thrilling world of Formula 1 – with Pitt playing Sonny Hayes, a former F1 driver who makes his comeback at the fictional APXGP team – here are the key cast members that star in the blockbuster film and the characters they portray.

From Fight Club to F1, Brad Pitt has been one of Hollywood's leading men for almost four decades.

F1 The Movie isn't Pitt's first rodeo in sports films either; in 2011, he produced and starred in the Oscar-nominated drama Moneyball, which saw immense success and critical acclaim.

Pitt has had his fair share of playing the underdog, as he now dons the veil of Sonny Hayes, a retired F1 driver given the chance to make a comeback.

Decades after a devastating crash ruined his dreams of becoming an F1 World Champion, F1 The Movie showcases Hayes' journey back in the sport alongside his rookie team mate Joshua Pearce at APXGP.

British actor Damson Idris made his way to Hollywood from the success of his recurring role in the crime drama Snowfall.

Idris has worked on a range of projects from theatre to indie films, and has proved his talents belong with the likes of seasoned stars such as Brad Pitt.

In F1 The Movie he portrays Joshua Pearce, a rookie F1 driver who partners with Pitt's Sonny Hayes in the struggling APXGP team.

The film showcases the relationship between the two eager drivers as their team looks to fight for victories throughout the season.

Former Marvel voice actress Kerry Condon is set to play the role of the APXGP Technical Director, who strikes up a romance with Pitt's Sonny Hayes.

The Irish actress began her career in theatre, earning awards for her Shakespearean performances before jumping into Irish indie films.

With an Oscar nomination and a BAFTA win for her role in The Banshees of Inisherin, Condon's range shows that the role of Kate is in great hands.

With an Oscar, BAFTA, SAG Award, and a Golden Globe on his mantlepiece, Javier Bardem is one of those actors who is used to critical acclaim.

He began his career 30 years ago in the Spanish film industry, before going on to work with directors like Woody Allen and featuring in blockbusters like the James Bond film Skyfall.

Bardem plays a crucial role in F1 The Movie, bringing Pitt's Sonny Hayes back to the forefront of F1 through his role as the APXGP team owner.

Ruben Cervantes is Hayes' friend and former team mate, who employs two fresh faces to rescue his struggling F1 team.

Danish actor Kim Bodnia joins the crew as Kaspar Molinski, the APXGP Team Principal, who once worked for Ferrari.

Bodnia has picked up several television awards for his performances in The Bridge and other Danish shows, as well as a BAFTA for his role in Killing Eve.

The F1 Movie will be his first role in a blockbuster film, with Molinski pushing Sonny Hayes to the limit.

The Crown actor Tobias Menzies is set to play Peter Banning, an APXGP board member, who is intent on pushing Javier Bardem's character, Ruben Cervantes, to sell the struggling team.

Menzies is an accomplished British television actor who has picked up an Emmy, as well as Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for roles in Outlander, Rome, and Game of Thrones.

Menzies joined the F1 project after completing his award-winning run as Lucas in the play The Hunt, returning to film after a two-year break.

British actress Sarah Niles stars in F1 The Movie as Bernadette, the mother of rookie Joshua Pearce (played by Damson Idris).

Niles has a long list of credits to her name across television and film, having appeared in series including Catastrophe, Riches and the acclaimed I May Destroy You.

But the actress is perhaps best known for her role as Dr Sharon Fieldstone in the hit sports comedy-drama Ted Lasso, for which she has previously been nominated for an Emmy award.

APXGP's Chief Mechanic, Dodge, is played by Abdul Salis, a key member of the squad's line-up as the team pair up with the returning Sonny Hayes.

The British actor has appeared in a range of TV shows, including long-running roles in the British television drama Casualty and more recently in American fantasy series The Wheel of Time.

Salis has also starred on the big screen previously in movies such as Love Actually and Sahara.

Callie Cooke joins the cast as Jodie, an APXGP pit crew mechanic.

Away from the screen, Cooke was nominated for the Emerging Talent Award at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards in 2015.

Since then the British actress has also garnered several television credits, having appeared in the likes of Doctor Who and Cheaters.

Before Sonny Hayes makes his comeback to Formula 1, the racer is competing in the Daytona 24 Hours for Chip Hart, played by Shea Whigham.

F1 The Movie follows on from some other high-octane big screen appearances for Whigham, the American actor having previously starred in films from the Mission Impossible and Fast & Furious franchises.

As well as featuring in Oscar-nominated movies such as The Wolf of Wall Street and Joker, Whigham holds various television credits, most notably in the American drama series Boardwalk Empire.

In the role of Sonny Hayes' race engineer, Nickleby, is British actor Will Merrick.

After appearing on the stage in theatre productions, Merrick made his television debut in the British drama series Skins in 2011, a role that earned him a Royal Television Society award for Best Actor.

He has since starred in various other TV shows as well as featuring in films such as About Time and Barbie.

Joseph Kosinski made a stellar directorial debut with Disney's Tron Legacy and has since fine-tuned a very specific and successful filmmaking style.

What shot him to the top of the ranks was the hugely popular Top Gun: Maverick, which redefined blockbusters and gave him the chance to create a truly unique F1 movie.

Kosinski brought together his award-winning Top Gun: Maverick team and, with the script written by Ehren Kruger, made F1 a reality.

The American film and television producer has an endless list of hits in his portfolio; from Pirates of the Caribbean to Bad Boys, Jerry Bruckheimer knows what film-goers want.

Bruckheimer began his endeavour into big-budget films in the 1990s with Paramount, working with directors like Michael Bay on some of the biggest box office hits of the decade.

He then branched out into television, before becoming an independent producer in the 2010s, and he was also one of the main factors in the success of Top Gun: Maverick, catapulting the film to stardom, which was an ethos he followed through to F1.

The seven-time Formula 1 World Champion knows a thing or two about the sport and took on a producing role on the F1 movie to help ensure the authenticity of the production.

Hamilton's role on the film places him in the realm of a consultant, helping actors Brad Pitt and Damson Idris hone their driving skills as well as scriptwriters fine-tune dialogue.

With a Formula 1 driver on board, Hamilton also helped give the movie a level of detail that has garnered praise from everyone who worked with him.

The weather forecast is in ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix from the Red Bull Ring.

Austria plays host to the 11th race weekend of the year, but what weather will the teams and drivers have to contend with when F1 returns to Europe?

June in Austria should be dry and sunny, and on paper that looks likely with the whole weekend possibly scorching hot – which some teams might prefer more than others.

Mercedes are one team who have tended not to go well in the heat, and yet they managed pretty well in Montreal last time out, with fairly toasty track temperatures featuring in the Canadian Grand Prix.

But it remains to be seen if that was a one off, or if the Silver Arrows have managed to get on top of their cooling issues that have plagued them in the past.

McLaren will be looking to bounce back in Spielberg, and they are a team who do tend to go well in the higher temperatures – often kinder on their tyres than their rivals.

Scroll down for a more detailed look at the forecast for the weekend.

FRIDAY, JUNE 27 – FP1 AND FP2
Conditions:  Mix between clouds and large sunny spells in the morning. Slight chance of few drops in the early morning. Arrival of high level clouds in the afternoon with a decreasing chance of rain. Light westerly wind with gusts up to 30 kph in the afternoon. FP1: 28°C // FP2: 28°C
Maximum temperature expected: 28 Celsius
Minimum temperature expected: 15 Celsius
Chance of rain: 20%

SATURDAY, JUNE 28 – FP3 AND QUALIFYING
Conditions:  Low level clouds at dawn. Then improvement in the morning with a mainly sunny weather. Dry day expected. Light northwesterly wind. FP3: 28°C // Q: 29°C
Maximum temperature expected: 29 Celsius
Minimum temperature expected: 15 Celsius
Chance of rain: 0%

SUNDAY, JUNE 29 – RACE
Conditions: Sunny at first. Developing cumulus clouds in the afternoon but likely dry. Very slight chance of one light shower in the late afternoon. To be confirmed. Light easterly wind. Race start: 30°C

Violet McGraw also returns as the orphaned niece of a roboticist whose rogue automaton companion must be reassembled to bring down an even deadlier doll.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	The campy sense of mischief that made Gerard Johnstone's 2023 hit M3GAN so enjoyable asserts itself intermittently in M3GAN 2.0, a logical title for a follow-up to the thriller about a murderous robot. But the humor is forced to compete with seriously overcomplicated plotting in a sequel that entangles its horror comedy roots with uninspired espionage elements, becoming a convoluted mishmash with shades of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Mission: Impossible and the Austin Powers franchise. There are amusing moments reminiscent of the original, but in terms of tone and coherence, the movie loses its way.

					Allison Williams Has ""Been Dreaming of"" a 'M3GAN' Trilogy		
			









	The sequel works best when its focus remains on the central family unit — robotics scientist Gemma (Allison Williams), her orphaned niece Cady (Violet McGraw) and M3GAN (played physically by dancer Amie Donald in a mask and voiced by Jenna Davis), the android intended as Cady's companion and protector, who went rogue in the last movie and had to be destroyed.

The Bottom Line

	
	Bigger is not necessarily better.
	



Release date: Friday, June 27Cast: Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, Brian Jordan Alvarez, Jen Van Epps, Amie Donald, Jenna Davis, Aristotle Athani, Timm Sharp, Ivanna Sakhno, Jemaine ClementDirector-screenwriter: Gerard Johnstone

									Rated PG-13,
								1 hour 59 minutes			






	Johnstone takes on solo script duties from a story he developed with M3GAN screenwriter Akela Cooper, based on characters she created with James Wan. The director makes it clear from the opening that this will be a very different film — less interested in the domestic dysfunction and corporate mayhem of its predecessor and more concerned with arms-dealers, duplicitous techies and an industrial military complex with a shiny new toy. None of which, sad to say, is terribly fresh or exciting.

	











	Much has changed on the artificial intelligence front in the two-and-a-half years since M3GAN was released, as AI has rapidly become more prevalent in contemporary life, both online and off-. The new movie states the obvious when it talks up the need for humans to co-exist with robotics technology, albeit with legal safeguards in place. But it's too silly to have much bearing on the real world.


	The tagline for the sequel is “I'm Still That B.” But M3GAN 2.0 is too infrequently allowed to be that B. Instead, she starts acquiring empathy and morality, which we all know are no fun.


	That's not to say she has lost her snarky delivery, her mean-girl death stare or her passive-aggressive manipulation skills. “You killed four people and a dog!” Gemma reminds her. “I was a kid when it happened, doing what I thought was right,” replies M3GAN with dubious contrition. She then gives Gemma a comforting peptalk about the challenges of being a mom before launching into a truly hilarious Kate Bush homage.


	While M3GAN's humanoid casing was destroyed when she got out of control last time around, her codes survived in not-quite-sleep mode. She's been an unseen but all-seeing presence in Gemma and Cady's home, which also serves as the lab where Gemma and her colleagues Cole (Brian Jordan Alvarez) and Tess (Jen Van Epps) continue their robotics work. 


	M3GAN has way too much intimate knowledge of her inventor for Gemma's comfort, but when their lives are endangered, the robot makes a convincing case that only she can help them take down a new robo-threat. All she needs is a new body and a few upgrades.

	











	That threat goes by the name Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno), the T-1000 to M3GAN's 101 model. Developed from the M3GAN template by the U.S. Army's Defense Innovation Unit in Palo Alto and overseen by Colonel Sattler (Timm Sharp), Amelia is introduced on a test mission near the Turkish Iranian border, where she ignores her orders to rescue a kidnapped scientist, instead killing him and wiping out an entire research facility.


	Once Amelia has eliminated almost everyone involved in her creation, Gemma and Cady seem likely to be next on her list. But there's an awful lot of plot to trudge through before Amelia's inevitable encounter with the rebirthed M3GAN.


	Some of that involves Gemma's advocacy for stricter AI control measures; her quasi-romance with fellow cautionary tech activist Christian (Aristotle Athani); her secret development with Cole and Tess of an AI-free mecha-suit that will equip humans with robot strength and stamina; the industrial espionage of tech billionaire Alton Appleton (Jemaine Clement), who believes that Gemma's new exosuit could be a game-changer with the addition of his neuro-chips; and the discovery of a killer robot dating back to 1984, dubbed Project Black Box, which has been locked in a vault, continuing to develop for decades. The ultimate fear is that Amelia will harness that mother-bot's power and unleash global chaos.


	Naturally, there's also friction between rebellious Cady and her aunt, whose alarmism after the renegade M3GAN disaster in the first movie means computer science enthusiast Cady has to keep her own robotics projects hidden. Not that this thread is given the space to acquire much weight.

	











	It's delightful to see M3GAN 2.0 sashay back to life and reappear in her customary retro-preppy look, just as it is to watch her bust her signature dance moves at an AI convention, wearing a cyber-babe disguise. But too often, the star attraction takes a back seat to the much less entertaining Amelia, an icy blonde killing machine like so many icy blonde killing machines before her, with none of M3GAN's sardonic wit. I got more laughs out of Gemma's smart-home system outmaneuvering a team of FBI agents.


	Sure, Amelia gets to do some cool stuff like scamper on all fours toward a target, scramble down a wall like a spider, rip the head off one poor unfortunate and neutralize entire tactical units with her dazzling fight skills. But the action mostly feels rote and lacking in suspense. 


	While it's unfair to criticize Johnstone for wanting to change things up, it's disappointing that he's made a Blumhouse–Atomic Monster production that has almost no connection to horror. The creepiness that offset the camp in the first movie is undetectable.


	McGraw and Williams (who's also a producer here) are no less appealing than they were in the original, and Gemma gets to step into the fray with gusto once M3GAN slips inside her head via a neuro-chip. Clement is a droll presence who seems to have wandered in from the set of a James Bond spoof (“Ooh, you're a naughty one,” Alton tells Amelia, his interest further aroused when she wallops him across the face). But he doesn't stick around long enough to help get through the messy patches. And Athani signals Christian's shadiness almost from his first appearance, which removes any surprise from the busy narrative contortions of the protracted climax.

	











	The movie looks polished, thanks to Get Out cinematographer Toby Oliver's sleek widescreen visuals. But it becomes a drag as confusion spirals around who's controlling Amelia and how to stop her. M3GAN herself remains a fabulous creation with a wicked sense of humor (“Hold onto your vaginas,” she warns Gemma and Cole as she takes control of a sportscar), and the character's canny mix of sweetness and menace is by no means tapped out. But if the franchise is to continue, she needs to go back to the lab for reprogramming.

Jensen Ackles, Eric Dane and Jessica Camacho lead Derek Haas' 13-episode race to save L.A. from a nuclear attack.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	The 10th and last episode of Countdown that Amazon sent to critics is head-scratchingly bad — a cavalcade of anticlimaxes and improbable choices so tone-deaf on every level that I was convinced the show was about to unleash a doozy of a twist as part of what I assumed to be its season finale.


	Were the characters in this mediocre 24 knockoff that might have run on TNT circa 2007 actually going to turn out to be ghosts? Or aliens? Or poorly programmed artificial intelligence navigating a politically denuded simulacrum of 21st-century Los Angeles? Would the twist be that this race-against-the-clock drama without any clocks to race against was taking place in the mind of a small child with no nuanced understanding of human behavior? Or perhaps in the mind of a large manatee with no understanding of human behavior?

The Bottom Line

	
	Prepare to count down from ""entertainingly dumb"" to ""just dumb"" in record time.

	Alas, no.

	The twist of the 10th episode of Countdown turned out to be that this was not, in fact, the finale of the first season of Countdown. There are, in fact, three additional episodes that weren't sent to critics, at least one of which could still utilize one of my predicted twists. I'll never know.


	The truth is that if Amazon had only given critics up until the eighth Countdown episode, which ends on a cliffhanger that the ninth episode resolves fairly stupidly, my review would have been tepid but probably not negative. Until that point, Countdown was generic and blandly reactionary, but not flagrantly so. And, although it made me appreciate the taut proficiency of even third-tier 24 anew, I was never bored and I was willing to give the show credit for its effective use of varied L.A. neighborhoods. I couldn't ignore, though, how dumb the ninth episode was and how much worse and more peculiar the 10th episode turned out to be.

	











	Some viewers will absolutely be able to. In addition to capitalizing on the ample fandom for several of the show's stars — Jensen Ackles, mostly — Countdown could practically be retitled “Thing to Watch on Amazon Before New Seasons of Reacher, Alex Cross, Terminal List and the Next Bosch Spinoff Premiere.” After all, as I already said, it isn't like there's any actual counting down going on in Countdown.


	Created and written in its entirety by One Chicago mastermind Derek Haas, Countdown begins entertainingly with a recognizable television favorite discovering something at the Port of Los Angeles. Soon, a race through Downtown L.A. ensues. The character, who works for the Department of Homeland Security, doesn't last long, raising the dual questions: Who killed this short-lived character and what did he learn that necessitated having him killed?


	These questions must be answered by Nathan Blythe (Eric Dane), a law enforcement and task force veteran who has pulled together, for very specific reasons, this team: Meachum (Ackles) is LAPD, coming off of nine months undercover at a prison in Palmdale and harboring a secret. Oliveras (Jessica Camacho) is DEA, coming off of several undercover stints with various cartels and maybe harboring a secret. Bell (Elliot Knight) is an FBI counterterrorism expert, while Shepherd (Violett Beane) is an FBI cyber-investigations expert, but neither has a secret. Finau (Uli Latukefu) has been working gangs and narcotics for the LAPD for 18 years, and while it's initially suggested he has some history of involvement in police violence, it's never mentioned again. There's also Drew (Jonathan Togo), from Homeland Security, who has one character detail and no secrets.

	











	Within the confines of the pilot, we learn that the season-opening murder was related to some quantity of nuclear material transported through the docks, an arsenal that could turn L.A. into Hiroshima or Chernobyl (a comparison made by one character, even though those two circumstances are not actually analogous).


	By the start of the second episode, we learn that the man behind the conspiracy is Boris (Bogdan Yasinski), a wannabe Belarusian oligarch with the most nebulous all-purpose grudge ever devised for television. Shows like 24 and Homeland have proudly boasted about the research that allowed them to create villains who gave the impression that the series had their finger on the geopolitical pulse. Boris appears to have been created to remain as far away from any sort of geopolitical pulse as possible. At no point did I find him scary or intriguing or well-played.


	For nearly eight hours, Blythe and his task force go around L.A. following up on leads, almost always a name that Shepherd is able to find in some database. They go to almost every neighborhood in Los Angeles County and the surrounding environs, generally preceded by a gigantic chyron telling us that we're in Inglewood or Culver City or Pacoima or High Desert. 


	It is my highest praise for the city that, for the most part, Countdown gives the impression of shooting in every neighborhood that they name-check, occasionally even capturing hints of the personality of those neighborhoods. There are times that those neighborhood references and acknowledgements of local freeways turn Countdown into the action-thriller equivalent of the SNL sketch “The Californians,” which would have made more sense as a title than Countdown.

	











	Somebody in Los Angeles has the makings of a nuclear weapon that could obliterate the city. That's established immediately. But the “where” doesn't become clear until the ninth episode and the “when” is never a part of the equation, which means that you have a show called Countdown that even includes the sound effect of a ticking clock without the necessary urgency of a specifically upcoming attack. Haas and the team of veteran directors just assume that because they've said something bad is possible, that's as concrete as viewers will require to experience building tension.


	It's not! At no point in the episodes I've seen do any of the characters seem to experience urgency themselves. They're just puttering around Los Angeles like heavily armed Uber drivers, or like they're playing a game of Where in L.A. Is Carmen Sandiego. But I can't tell you how much time passes in the first season. Nor can I explain why there's a whole episode in which, with a pending threat of nuclear attack, two characters have an ongoing debate about whether to get a third character cake or cupcakes for a surprise birthday. Nor why, when one character is seriously wounded, every member of the task force goes to sit in a hospital waiting room looking glum, rather than continuing the job of SAVING LOS ANGELES FROM A NUCLEAR ATTACK.


	In line with the series' lackadaisical approach, every piece of information has to be repeated multiple times for the benefit of distracted viewers — a response to second-screen viewing that is infiltrating television in general, but Amazon shows especially egregiously. Fully half of Blythe's dialogue is sending different permutations of characters to these different locations, so that the rhythm of the show goes like: “I think Boris might be in Azusa!” “Oliveras, you and Meachum go to Azusa!” “TITLE CARD: AZUSA.” “So this is Azusa?”

	











	None of the characters is all that interesting, though the cast is up to the general task. Dane conveys gruff, admirable authority with every barked command. Ackles, who spent 300+ episodes making glib smartassery likable on Supernatural, is impressively able to win affection for a character who, if you stop and think about it for even a second, is closer to dangerously narcissistic than rascally heroic. Ackles and Camacho have a combustible chemistry that the show steers into to the detriment of every other member of the ensemble, rendering Beane, Latukefu and Knight decidedly secondary pieces of the cast. They're all still better than Merrick McCartha's smarmy Los Angeles DA Valwell, who shows up every episode to make trouble for our team as a one-dimensional adversary.


	Still, at least for some of the time, there's a muscularity to the series' direction, which pairs one chase after another with punk or metal needle-drops. I'm not so emotionally callused that I can't enjoy a pursuit set to Motörhead's “Ace of Spades.” There's nothing to the aesthetic that you haven't seen in dozens of broadcast police/SWAT/alphabet agency procedurals (and that shows like Southland didn't do better), but it's mostly taut and occasionally breathless.


	The last two episodes I've seen are, unfortunately, neither taut nor breathless. They're dumb and illogical, and while I'm sure a twist could have spackled over the abrupt unraveling, I'm doubtful it would have made Countdown good. Where things concluded after the tenth episode was not a place I'm interested in going.

The ruling in a case involving Amazon-backed Anthropic lends credibility to the notion that AI video generators that could one day compete with studios are doing something transformative.


							By 

	Winston Cho



Transformative.


	That's how a federal court characterized Amazon-backed Anthropic‘s use of millions of books across the web to teach its artificial intelligence system. It's the first decision to consider the issue and will serve as a template for other courts overseeing similar cases. And studios, now that some have entered the fight over the industry-defining technology, should be uneasy about the ruling.




	The thrust of these cases will be decided by one question: Are AI companies covered by fair use, the legal doctrine in intellectual property law that allows creators to build upon copyrighted works without a license? On that issue, a court found that Anthropic is on solid legal ground, at least with respect to training.

					Anthropic Wins First Round In Lawsuit From Music Publishers Over Song Lyrics		
			









	The technology is “among the most transformative many of us will see in our lifetimes,” wrote U.S. District Judge William Alsup.


	Still, Anthropic will face a trial over illegally downloading seven millions books to create a library that was used for training. That it later purchased copies of those books it stole off the internet earlier to cover its tracks doesn't absolve it of liability, the court concluded. The company faces potential damages of hundreds of millions of dollars stemming from the decision that could lead to Disney and Universal getting a similar payout depending on what they unearth in discovery over how Midjourney allegedly obtained copies of thousands of films that were repurposed to teach its image generator.

	











	Last year, authors filed a lawsuit against Anthropic accusing it of illegally downloading and copying their books to power its AI chatbot Claude. The company chose not to move to dismiss the complaint and instead skipped straight for a decision on fair use.


	In the ruling, the court found that authors don't have the right to exclude Anthropic from using their works to train its technology, much in the same way they don't have the right to exclude any person from reading their books to learn how to write.


	“Everyone reads texts, too, then writes new texts,” reads the order. “They may need to pay for getting their hands on a text in the first instance. But to make anyone pay specifically for the use of a book each time they read it, each time they recall it from memory, each time they later draw upon it when writing new things in new ways would be unthinkable.”


	If someone were to read all the modern-day classics, memorize them and emulate a blend of their writing, that wouldn't constitute copyright infringement, the court concluded. Like any reader who wants to be a writer, Anthropic's technology draws upon works not to replicate or supplant them but to create something entirely different, according to the order.


	Those aren't the findings that Disney or Universal — both of whom are suing Midjourney for copyright infringement — wanted or expected. For them, there's reason to worry that Alsup's analysis will shape the way in which the judge overseeing their case considers undermining development of a technology that was found by another court to be revolutionary (or something close to it). More broadly, it could be found that AI video generators, like Sora, are simply distilling every movie ever made to create completely new works.

	











	“This Anthropic decision will likely be cited by all creators of AI models to support the argument that fair use applies to the use of massive datasets to train foundational models,” says Daniel Barsky, an intellectual property lawyer at Holland & Knight.


	Important to note: The authors didn't allege that responses generated by Anthropic infringed upon their works. And if they had, they would've lost that argument under the court's finding that guardrails are in place to ensure that no infringing ever reached users. Alsup compared it to Google imposing limits on how many snippets of text from any one book could be seen by a user through its Google Book service, preventing its search function from being misused as a way to access full books for free.


	“Here, if the outputs seen by users had been infringing, Authors would have a different case,” Alsup writes. “And, if the outputs were ever to become infringing, Authors could bring such a case. But that is not this case.”


	But that could be the case for Midjourney, which returns nearly exact replicas of frames from films in some instances.


When prompted with “Thanos Infinity War,” Midjourney — an AI program that translates text into hyper-realistic graphics — replied with an image of the purple-skinned villain in a frame that appears to be taken from the Marvel movie or promotional materials, with few to no alterations made. A shot of Tom Cruise in the cockpit of a fighter jet, from Top Gun: Maverick, is produced when the tool was asked for a frame from the film. The chatbots can seemingly replicate almost any animation style, generating startlingly accurate characters from titles ranging from DreamWorks' Shrek to Pixar's Ratatouille to Warner Bros.' The Lego Movie.

	











	“The fact that Midjourney generates copies and derivatives of” films from Disney and Universal proves that the company, without their knowledge or permission, “copied plaintiffs' copyrighted works to train and develop” its technology, states the complaint.


	Also at play: The possibility that Midjourney pirated the studios' movies. In the June 23 ruling, Alsup found that Anthropic illegally downloading seven million books to build a library to be used for training isn't covered by fair use. He said that the company could've instead paid for the copies. Such piracy, the court concluded, is “inherently, irredeemably infringing.”


	With statutory damages for willful copyright infringement reaching up to $150,000 per work, massive payouts are a possibility.

“Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won,” Cuomo told supporters on Tuesday.


							By 

	The Associated Press



Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday night after Andrew Cuomo conceded the race in a stunning upset, as the young, progressive upstart who was virtually unknown when the contest began built a substantial lead over the more experienced but scandal-scarred former governor.


	Though the race's ultimate outcome will still be decided by a ranked choice count, Mamdani took a commanding position just hours after the polls closed.




	With victory all but assured, Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist who ran an energetic campaign centered on the cost of living, told supporters, “I will be your Democratic nominee for the mayor of New York City.”

	“I will be the mayor for every New Yorker, whether you voted for me, for Governor Cuomo, or felt too disillusioned by a long-broken political system to vote at all,” he said. “I will work to be a mayor you will be proud to call your own.”




			Related Video		







	Cuomo, who had been the front-runner throughout a race that was his comeback bid from a sexual harassment scandal, conceded the election, telling a crowd that he had called Mamdani to congratulate him.


	“Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won,” Cuomo told supporters.


	Cuomo trailed Mamdani by a significant margin in the first choice ballots and faced an exceedingly difficult pathway to catching up when ballots are redistributed in New York City's ranked choice voting process.

	











	Mamdani, a member of the state Assembly since 2021, would be the city's first Muslim and Indian American mayor if elected. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams skipped the primary. He's running as an independent in the general election. Cuomo also has the option of running in the general election.


	“We are going to take a look and make some decisions,” Cuomo said.


	Cuomo and Mamdani were a study in political contrasts and could have played stand-ins for the larger Democratic Party's ideological divide, with one candidate a fresh-faced progressive and the other an older moderate.


	Cuomo characterized the city as a threatening, out-of-control place desperate for an experienced leader who could restore order. He brought the power of a political dynasty to the race, securing an impressive array of endorsements from important local leaders and labor groups, all while political action committees created to support his campaign pulled in staggering sums of cash.


	Mamdani, meanwhile, offered an optimistic message that life in the city could improve under his agenda, which was laser-focused on the idea that a mayor has the power to do things that lower the cost of living. The party's progressive wing coalesced behind him and he secured endorsements from two of the country's foremost progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.


	Unofficial results from the New York City's Board of Elections showed that Mamdani was ranked on more ballots than Cuomo. Mamdani was listed as the second choice by tens of thousands of more voters than Cuomo. And the number of votes that will factor into ranked choice voting is sure to shrink. More than 200,000 voters only listed a first choice, the Board of Elections results show, meaning that Mamdani's performance in the first round may ultimately be enough to clear the 50% threshold.

	











	The race's ultimate outcome could say something about what kind of leader Democrats are looking for during President Donald Trump's second term.


	The primary winner will go on to face incumbent Adams, a Democrat who decided to run as an independent amid a public uproar over his indictment on corruption charges and the subsequent abandonment of the case by Trump's Justice Department. Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, will be on the ballot in the fall's general election.


	The rest of the pack has struggled to gain recognition in a race where nearly every candidate has cast themselves as the person best positioned to challenge Trump's agenda.


	Comptroller Brad Lander, a liberal city government stalwart, made a splash last week when he was arrested after linking arms with a man federal agents were trying to detain at an immigration court in Manhattan. In the final weeks of the race, Lander and Mamdani cross endorsed one another in an attempt to boost their collective support and damage Cuomo's bid under the ranked choice voting system.


	Among the other candidates are City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer.


	Mamdani's grassroots run has been hard not to notice.


	His army of young canvassers relentlessly knocked on doors throughout the city seeking support. Posters of his grinning mug were up on shop windows. You couldn't get on social media without seeing one of his well-produced videos pitching his vision — free buses, free child care, new apartments, a higher minimum wage and more, paid for by new taxes on rich people.

	











	That youthful energy was apparent Tuesday evening, as both cautiously optimistic canvassers and ecstatic supporters lined the streets of Central Brooklyn on a sizzling hot summer day, creating a party-like atmosphere that spread from poll sites into the surrounding neighborhoods.


	Outside his family's Caribbean apothecary, Amani Kojo, a 23-year-old first-time voter, passed out iced tea to Mamdani canvassers, encouraging them to stay hydrated.


	“It's 100 degrees outside and it's a vibe. New York City feels alive again,” Kojo said, raising a pile of Mamdani pamphlets. “It feels very electric seeing all the people around, the flyers, all the posts on my Instagram all day.”


	Cuomo and some other Democrats have cast Mamdani as unqualified. They say he doesn't have the management chops to wrangle the city's sprawling bureaucracy or handle crises. Critics have also taken aim at Mamdani's support for Palestinian human rights.


	In response, Mamdani has slammed Cuomo over his sexual harassment scandal and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.


	Cuomo resigned in 2021 after a report commissioned by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women. He has always maintained that he didn't intentionally harass the women, saying he had simply fallen behind what was considered appropriate workplace conduct.

The ""Manchild"" singer also has a new collab beverage to help people cool down.


													By
												

	Stephen Daw


Pride Editor


	After translating the success of her mega-hit “Espresso” into a custom Dunkin' iced coffee last year, Sabrina Carpenter is teaming up with the coffee chain once more to help her fans beat the summer heat. 


	On Wednesday morning (June 25), Dunkin' unveiled its 2025 summer menu, including its latest collaboration with the pop singer. The newest beverage to join the menu — called Sabrina's Strawberry Daydream Refresher — is a sweet strawberry and oat milk drink, topped with “a cloud of velvety cold foam.”

	











	To celebrate the partnership, Carpenter stars in the chain's new ad for the Strawberry Daydream drink. The clip shows the singer answering calls for the “Dunkin' Daydream Hotline,” where she interfaces with a late-night caller looking for something refreshing. “Oh, you're hot … I see. I think I know what you're really craving,” she coos into a microphone, introducing her creamy new beverage. After a beat, though, she scrunches up her face and says, “I'm sorry, did you—” before getting cut off.

	Carpenter, in the meantime, is coming off the breakthrough success of her latest single “Manchild,” which became the singer's first-ever No. 1 debut on the Billboard Hot 100 last week. On the latest chart, “Manchild” falls to No. 2, as Alex Warren's “Ordinary” earns its third week at the chart's summit.

""It is not how people in this country treat each other when facing hard times,"" the open letter reads.

	Anna Chan



	Zayn Malik, Sheryl Crow, Scarlett Johansson and many other stars are asking Congress for just “One Thing”: Don't cut funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or Medicaid in the federal budget bill, which the Senate is expected to vote on as soon as this week.


	Celebrities from various fields joined non-profit group Feeding America — which runs a network of food banks to help those in need access healthy food with the goal of ending food insecurity — to sign an open letter published Wednesday (June 25), urging politicians to reject the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid that are currently included in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” According to CBS News, the new work requirements in the House Republicans' bill would mean that an estimated 16 million people may become uninsured by 2034.

	











	The bill had also proposed shifting some costs of food stamps from the federal government to the states, but according to the Associated Press, the Senate parliamentarian said that such a move would violate the chamber's rules; these rulings are not often ignored. NPR reports that the bill would also cut more than $290 million from SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that should the bill pass, the poorest families would see a decrease in resources by about $1,600 a year, while the richest would gain about $12,000.

It's a fundamental part of the human experience and a basic right we all deserve,” the open letter from Feeding America and endorsed by celebrities notes, adding that millions of Americans rely on SNAP and Medicaid to help make ends meet. “Congress is now considering a bill that would make some of the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in U.S. history – taking 9.5 billions of meals a year through SNAP off the table and pushing hundreds of thousands of people off Medicaid and into food insecurity.”


	“This is unacceptable and wrong. It is not how people in this country treat each other when facing hard times,” the letter continues. 


	In addition to the former One Direction member, “All I Wanna Do” singer and Oscar-nominated actress, stars of stage, screen and music including Alan Cumming, Matt Damon, Michelle Williams, David Arquette, Chrishell Stause, Paul Scheer and Danai Gurira signed the open letter to Congress. 


	Read the letter in full below:


Dear Members of Congress,


We all have powerful memories of sharing meals with friends, with family and even with strangers in moments of celebration, grief or everything in between. Food is a beautiful way humans show care, compassion and love to those around us. It's a fundamental part of the human experience and a basic right we all deserve.


Ongoing high grocery costs mean food is out of reach for so many families, and many of our neighbors simply do not have enough to eat. They don't know where their next meal is coming from or if that meal will be enough to nourish and sustain them.


Millions of people in this country, including an estimated 15.5 million children and 7.2 million seniors, rely on programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid to make ends meet. These programs make it possible for them to live more healthily and with dignity, in turn helping communities across America to thrive.












Congress is now considering a bill that would make some of the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in U.S. history – taking 9.5 billions of meals a year through SNAP off the table and pushing hundreds of thousands of people off Medicaid and into food insecurity.


This is unacceptable and wrong. It is not how people in this country treat each other when facing hard times.


We call on Congress to reject cuts to these vital programs that help millions put food on their tables and provide access to health care.

For The Wizard of Oz at Sphere, the Vegas venue navigated challenges and opportunities to deliver a new audio experience that's both strikingly familiar — and boldly different.


													By
												

	Eric Renner Brown



One day several months ago in Culver City, California, orchestral musicians filed into the Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage at Sony Pictures Studios unsure of what awaited them on their music stands.


	“They come in, and they see the Wizard of Oz sheet music,” recalls Grammy Award-winning music supervisor Julianne Jordan. “They were all freaking out. They all came up to me and were like, ‘We never thought we'd ever be playing this — let alone playing this here.'”


	The Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage is hallowed ground in the world of film scoring. Countless soundtracks have been recorded there — beginning with The Wizard Of Oz, in 1939. Now, nearly a century later, another orchestra was re-recording the score, for a film experience that aims to be as groundbreaking as the original movie once was.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Jordan supervised music for The Wizard of Oz at Sphere, the Las Vegas venue's ambitious first foray into licensing — and modernizing — an existing film property for Sphere's towering screen and cutting-edge audio system. Along with a team comprised of some of contemporary Hollywood's best musical minds — including Oscar-nominated composer David Newman and Oscar-winning engineer Shawn Murphy — Jordan was instrumental in figuring out how, exactly, to bring Oz‘s score to life in a venue that its original creators could've never dreamed of.


	For the same reason an old cassette tape might sound bad on high-end home audio equipment, Sphere, with its advanced technology, couldn't simply press play on the original version of Oz. That meant augmenting the original visual component (including with the use of AI), but also reconstructing the film's audio for Sphere Immersive Sound, in some cases from the ground up.


	“It would be a huge miss to do this film as a 1939 optical audio track,” says Paul Freeman, who as vp and principal audio artist at Sphere Studios, the division overseeing the Oz project, touches “everything that makes noise in the venue.”


	When it came to the score, the solution — re-record it — was deceptively complex. About a year and a half ago, when the project began gathering steam, Sphere's team brought orchestras of different sizes to the venue, arranging them in various physical formats simply to see how orchestras sounded within its dimensions. Then, as recording commenced, the team divided the ensemble into component sections — “not unheard-of” in today's filmmaking, Jordan says, but not common either — to record them separately, which would make the audio easier to manipulate in Sphere later. “When everybody's in the room playing together, there's a fluidity that you don't get when you're just playing in sections,” Freeman says, though Jordan notes that because Murphy “has done it before, he knew how to put it all together.”


	This separation didn't only allow the Sphere team to render the score in unprecedented clarity — it also provided narrative benefits. “An example is when the Tin Man sways back and forth,” says Freeman. “We're taking the strings that are orchestrationally augmenting that, and we're positionally augmenting that with him. The strings are playing, mimicking his movement [musically], but now we're physically moving it in space [throughout the venue] at the same time. We do that several times in the film.”


	When re-recording the score — originally captured in mono — musicians played in the era's style of film music, using then-common techniques such as pizzicato and vibrato; the ocarina used for the original “If I Only Had a Brain” recording was used again this time around.


	Sphere licensed the orchestral compositions from Sony Music Publishing, as opposed to the original vocal parts, for which it licensed the original masters from Warner Bros. Those vocals — not to mention all the other sounds heard in the film — presented both challenges and opportunities for Sphere's team.


	When remastering classic albums, audio professionals often face a dilemma: modernizing a recording too thoroughly can make it sound conspicuously, even distractingly, different from the original. This held true for Oz, which is at times defined by the era's audio primitiveness. “You're used to hearing the [Wicked] Witch sound bad,” Freeman says. “If you try and fix that too much, it doesn't sound like the film anymore. It sounds correct sonically, but it doesn't sound like The Wizard of Oz. We've all heard this film so often that you have to be true to that.”


	The answer, he explains, was “just a bunch of smart guys with really good ears trying to get this stuff in the venue to sound correct.”


	But fidelity concerns aside, Sphere's team had the freedom to conceptualize what Oz‘s original creators might have done with the audio if they'd had access to Sphere. It's not just the orchestra following the Tin Man across the venue as he sways back and forth — it's the way dialogue follows characters as they move across the screen, or how amidst the tornado's swirl, the main orchestra remains centered while audio motifs move in tandem with the objects and people in the gale-force wind. “Point blank, when you walk into this venue and minutes into the film the tornado happens, hold on to your wig, because you're in it,” Freeman says.


	Sphere's capacity for immersive, 4D experiences have been a selling point — the venue hasn't elaborated further, but promises “environmental effects and custom scents” during the Oz show — and that extends to the infrasound system running through the venue's seats, which Freeman points out are actually speakers that activate when the seats are down. 


	“One of the things that our chairman [James Dolan] has wanted to do with our infrasound system since the beginning was make it emotional,” he says. “So, there are certain identifiable things that we're doing, not necessarily to grab your attention to it, but to make certain components more special.” For instance, the Sphere team applied backward reverb to the Wicked Witch's dialogue to create an almost imperceptible but unsettling feeling; it's just one of the subtle ways they're manipulating dialogue to elicit emotional responses from fans, and the first time Sphere has used its seats not only to vibrate, but to emit tones.


	On paper, all this change might make an Oz superfan a little trepidatious — something the Sphere team and its colleagues at Warner Bros. Post Production Creative Services considered at every turn. For both the audio and visual aspects of the film, they combed through footage and archival materials and notes to understand where the original filmmakers were coming from.


	“We all approached it with a lot of reverence,” says Sphere Studios head Carolyn Blackwood, who joined the company about a year ago, after nearly 25 years as an executive at Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema. “The choices we made were done with the idea of the purity of the original film — always with the intention to get to the clarity and the original intent of what existed there, but couldn't have been done back then, because the technology didn't exist.”


	In fact, modern audio advancements — from the techniques employed to Sphere's audio system — have also helped to clarify certain aspects of the original film. “Most people are used to hearing this on their TV,” says Jordan, who recounts sitting in recording sessions and hearing cues she never knew existed in the score, including a snippet of Mussorgsky's Night On Bald Mountain that's woven into scenes at the Wicked Witch's castle.


	As for Oz‘s most well-known musical moment, Judy Garland‘s performance of “Over The Rainbow,” Freeman says, “This is the definitive, all-time, greatest version that you will ever, ever hear. The track is all around you. It's a perfect piece of audio.”


	To Blackwood, the project is in keeping with Oz‘s broader cultural legacy. When she arrived at Sphere, the project was already in development, and naturally she asked why the team had settled on Oz, rather than another classic film. The answer she received was twofold: The cultural ubiquity was a factor, sure, but so was Oz's spot in the evolution of cinema. “When Wizard of Oz was done in 1939, it was a technological marvel,” she says. “It made sense that, once again, this 1939 movie would break new ground.”

	The pop superstar joined boyfriend Travis Kelce at the annual three-day training summit, which he co-founded with NFL peers George Kittle and Greg Olsen in 2021. The event, held at Vanderbilt University, was originally designed for tight ends across the league to train, network, and share techniques, but this year, it also doubled as a moment of Swiftie history.

	In a fan-recorded video that quickly went viral on X (formerly Twitter), Swift is seen onstage at the event's opening night afterparty, performing her Billboard No. 1 hit “Shake It Off” live with her acoustic guitar. Dressed in a short black dress and heels, she strums and sings to a crowd that erupts in cheers as Kelce watches on from backstage during the performance. Watch it here.

	Swift's appearance wasn't officially announced, making the moment even more memorable for TEU attendees. According to DJ Mike Fresh, who helmed the night's music, the energy shifted when Swift entered the building. “There are Monday fun days, and then there are Monday fun days when Taylor Swift is in the building partying to your set,” he wrote on Instagram.


	While Swift has wrapped her Eras Tour, the appearance marked one of her first semi-public performances since finishing the historic run. Tight End University marked another crossover in Swift's increasingly visible support of Kelce's career, from celebrating his Super Bowl win to attending multiple Chiefs games during the NFL season.


	The couple also made waves at the kickoff event for another reason: it marked their first official “red carpet” moment together. The duo walked into the venue hand in hand, smiling for the cameras — Swift in her green-and-white checkered ensemble, which sold out online in just hours, and Kelce in a coordinating white-and-yellow outfit.


	But for many fans, the real highlight was the stripped-back, joyful “Shake It Off” performance — a reminder that Swift can command any room, football-themed or not.

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: After a competitive bidding battle, Amazon MGM Studios has landed the package for a live-action movie revolving around the Bratz doll line with Kim Kardashian and Picturestart on board to produce. Charlie Polinger and Lucy McKendrick are writing the script, and while a deal is not closed, sources say Kardashian is being eyed to play the villain in the project.


	Erik Feig and Julia Hammer will produce for Picturestart with Kardashian, and Jason and Jasmin Larian producing for MGA. MGA's Isaac Larian will executive produce.


	Given all the parties involved, along with the global popularity of the toy line, the package saw plenty of interest. But given the strong ties Kardashian and the studio already have, it makes sense the project ended up at Amazon MGM. Last year, the studio won an auction for an untitled thriller with Kardashian attached to star.

	











	Following the success of the Barbie movie in 2023, studios have been on the lookout for iconic toys that could have a similar pop on the big screen, and Bratz falls right in line as something that could play well at a global level. The Bratz toy line has sold more than 200 million dolls to date globally and has the highest social media engagement across all platforms of any toy brand in the world.

	As for the film, plot details are unknown at this time.

On the TV front, she is set to star in Hulu's Ryan Murphy drama series All Is Fair and is also producing and appearing in the Hulu series Group Chat. That series stars La La Anthony and shoots this fall.


	Polinger's directorial and writing debut The Plague, produced by Lucy McKendrick and starring Joel Edgerton, recently premiered to praise in Cannes' Un Certain Regard. He now is set to write and direct The Masque of the Red Death with A24 and Picturestart, which he and McKendrick will produce. McKendrick is in pre-production on Fangs, which she wrote, is directing and will star in alongside Toni Collette and Edgerton, with Polinger producing.

EXCLUSIVE: British actress Jessica Madsen (Bridgerton) has landed the female lead opposite Xavier Molyneux In Bloodaxe, Prime Video‘s historical drama series created, written, and exec produced by Vikings creator Michael Hirst and his son, Horatio Hirst.


	Madsen will play Gunnhild, the wife of Erik Bloodaxe (Molyneux), also known as the Mother of Kings. We were first to report on Molyneux's casting yesterday.


	The show chronicles the rise of one of history's most famous Norse raiders, Erik Bloodaxe, and his formidable wife, Gunnhild. As they fight for the throne of Norway, the land is torn apart by fierce rivals, shifting loyalties, and bloody betrayals. With war looming and chaos consuming the kingdom, drawing in the ruthless Kings of other Scandinavian countries, and even a powerful English ruler, the stage is set for a thundering, cataclysmic, compelling and utterly magical new Norse Saga.

	











	Officially ordered in March, the show will be produced by MGM Television, a division of Amazon MGM Studios, with production beginning in Ireland and Iceland later this summer. Michael and Horatio Hirst will showrun and write, exec producing alongside Morgan O'Sullivan under his O'Sullivan Productions label, Steve Stark under his Toluca Pictures label, Arturo Interian, John Weber, Sheila Hockin, and Fred Toye.

	While the show shares creative lineage with the 2013-20 History series Vikings and the 2022-25 Netflix follow-up Vikings: Valhalla — all three are based on historical figures and produced by MGM Television — Bloodaxe is not directly related to those efforts. The new Norse saga takes place decades after the original series and decades before Valhalla. 

	











	Madsen is best known for playing fan favorite mean girl Cressida Cowper in Bridgerton, one of the Top 10 most watched series in Netflix history, since Season 1. She's earned two SAG Award nominations as part of the ensemble and is repped by the UK's United Agents and Ethos Entertainment.

	When it comes to Apple Original Films sixth wide theatrical motion picture release, F1, you may want to get out of the way.


	Sources tell us that the Warner Bros. released Brad Pitt PG-13 movie, has stateside pre-sales that have been heating up, gassed up from 88% certified fresh Rotten Tomatoes reviews. Currently, we hear that U.S./Canada presales for F1 are ahead of Gladiator 2 ($55M), way ahead of Pitt's Bullet Train ($30M) and 4x that of pre-Covid 2019's Ford v. Ferrari ($31.4M). While overseas, given the popularity of the sport, the movie was always intended to make bank for this $200M production from Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski with $75M+, F1 looks to pick up speed in the states. Sources tell us that a $40M-$50M+ opening is par for the course at 3,800 theaters stateside. This despite the fact that box office tracking firm NRG took their estimate down to around $38M. Currently, there's a lot of Imax sales in North American for Thursday and Friday.

	Should F1 overperform, not only is it a plus for the racing car genre, which has had a wonky time historically at the box office, but it will be a big breakthrough for Apple Original Films which has largely struggled in its wide theatrical release stateside following its very big budget theatrical, the disastrous Argylle ($96.2M WW), the retrenched Pitt and George Clooney noir Wolfs and Killers of the Flower Moon ($158.7M domestic off a $200M production cost). F1 could provide a lot of hope, and turn a new page for the streamer as it flirts with the big screen. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Warners has a hold on Imax screens for two weeks on F1. The movie will also play in Dolby Cinema, PLFs, motion seats, Drive-Ins and Dine-Ins.


	Racing movies have had a wonky time at the box office, and that's why there are far and few in between. Universal‘s Formula One movie, Rush starring Chris Hemsworth, Olivia Wilde and Daniel Bruhl and directed by Ron Howard in 2013, crashed stateside with $26.9M, 28% of its near $97M global box office. It was a little dark and moody in hindsight. 


	James Mangold's Ford v. Ferrari did better with a $31.4M opening, $117.6M domestic, $226.2M global take, four Oscar noms including Best Picture and two wins for editing and sound editing. Looking back, Tom Cruise's Days of Thunder in 1990 was iconic, but only made $82.6M domestic, $157.9M WW (unadjusted for inflation); the 12th highest grossing movie for that year, but no where near the highs of Top Gun or Mission: Impossible movies. Going deep, Six Pack starring Kenny Rogers at the height of the country singer's fame only made $20.2M uninflated back in the day (making it the 46th highest grossing movie back in 1982). However, F1 is very different, a fire-breathing, sassy Pitt, Imax speaker blaring, floor rupturing popcorn movie. Hot fun in the summertime. In what is a 100% of the international footprint, F1 is opening in 78 markets starting with France, Italy, UK, Korea and more opening today. Among majors, Germany, Brazil and Mexico join the fray on Thursday. Then comes Spain, China and Japan, notably, along with several others. Look for the Euro majors, Australia, Japan and the Middle East to get into the driver's seat as the biggest markets for Formula One in general.


	The promo campaign has been in full drive abroad with stops in Montreal, Mexico City, Abu Dhabi, and London including at Formula One racetracks and events. Tom Cruise turned up at the red carpet in London to support Pitt and his Top Gun 2 director Kosinski. 


	Warner Bros worked closely with Apple Original Films on all aspects of marketing and distribution. Sources tell me that when it came to studios bidding on F1, they had to get some skin in the game. I understand that Warner Bros. chipped in for 50% of the P&A. Both Apple and Warners recoup the P&A together before the Burbank, CA lot gets a distribution fee around 12%.


	Warners held around 200 Imax screenings on Monday for fans, with more previews starting Thursday at 3PM. Men over 25 is the best demo in first choice for F1, higher than Pitt's Bullet Train. Unaided awareness is best with dudes overall and higher than Bullet Train and Ford v. Ferrari. 


	Universal Pictures will release the PG-13 genre sequel M3GAN 2.0 in 3,000+ North American theaters with an opening that's over/under $20M. Presales we hear aren't strong, 25% of what Evil Dead Rise was before its $24.5M opening and half of Smile 2 ($23.2M). The first movie post New Years 2022, in the wake of a Christmas filled with Avatar: The Way of Water, opened to a great $30.4M hot off a marketing campaign consisting of dancing Megans which became a TikTok sensation. The original director and writer of the first film, Gerard Johnstone, is back. The first M3GAN minted $95.1M domestic, $180M worldwide for a net near $79M profit off a $12M production cost. Tracking is led by younger women between the ages of 17-34. Expectations are lower this time around. The Blumhouse Atomic Monster movie will also open in 79 international markets including UK & Ireland, Mexico and Brazil. Previews start Thursday at 2PM.

It took a long time for Brad Pitt & Tom Cruise to age. They still look, but they don't look that young anymore. I'm sure they enjoyed it while it lasted. I'm glad they are still at it.

Superman 350 million
Fantastic four 620 million

Superman.   1.13 billion

Fantastic 4 451 million

F1 is going to overperform heavy this weekend as WOM will drive this film forward. The movie is incredible.

I'll be first in line to see f1 on imax… racing scenes look absolutely out of this world!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Ironheart gets off to a breezy and reasonably engaging start","https://www.avclub.com/ironheart-premiere-recap-episodes-1-2-3","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 02:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: The A.V. Club will return to recap episodes four, five, and six on July 1.]    

For being a follow-up to one of Marvel Studios' highest-grossing and consequential entries since Avengers: Endgame, the hype surrounding Ironheart has been notably subdued. Created by Chinaka Hodge and executive produced by Ryan Coogler, the six-episode miniseries sure looks as though it's premiering under protest: paired with a muted marketing campaign (“unceremonious” might be a better word), the rollout of Ironheart, with its first three episodes debuting on June 24 and the last three dropping a week later, suggests that Marvel is grounding Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) before she takes her first solo flight. 

This seeming diffidence comes after an opaque and lengthy post-production (principal photography wrapped in late 2022), encouraging the online speculation apparatus to forensically evaluate every possible reason why Ironheart seems to have been set up to fail. Did the series fall victim to the same restructuring quagmire that hamstrung Daredevil: Born Again? Or did Marvel lose confidence in backing an untested property? The latter option is not without precedent (Echo had it worse), but it muddles Disney's shifting attitudes toward its Marvel TV offerings. Say what you will about Secret Invasion, but at least it was allowed to coast to an ignominious end on a weekly schedule. What did Ironheart do to deserve its arrival in steerage?  

The answer is not much. Ironheart is neither an instant classic nor a debacle, but a breezy, reasonably engaging bit of Marvel business that doesn't skimp on hardware or mystery. If it is guilty of anything, it's being too pat and frictionless. Its politics and drama get obligatory lip service, but the series glosses over its few genuinely provocative ideas concerning class and personal responsibility (for now, anyway). And the show's CG effects are solid for TV—Riri's suit soars convincingly and falls apart even more so—and its vibrant cast of characters brings a little life to a corner of the MCU that has been largely overlooked: Chicago, specifically its Humboldt Park and South Shore environs. This setting superficially expands the franchise while also grounding it, as the series' modest revelations connect its ironclad hero to those who came before her.

We rejoin Riri following her “internship abroad” in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, where she enjoyed access to the infinite technological resources of Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright). Back in the States, Riri is broke and persona non grata at MIT after getting busted for selling assignments to students, which creates a rough transition back to the real world that humbles our intrepid inventor and limits her advancement of the AI that operates her prototype suit. (“Do you think Tony Stark would be Tony Stark if he wasn't a billionaire?” she asks rhetorically.) Her methods of scrounging up cash are a smidge unethical, but at least she isn't a war profiteer like a certain departed Avenger I could mention. And she remains, at least initially, sanguine about her choices. Riri is an unapologetically messy character, an aspiring technocrat whose ethics adapt to her financial situation. Hell, on her way out the door, she “finesses a few resources” from the university by suiting up in the latest version of her armor, her brilliance (not to mention labor) trumping the sanctity of school property. Riri isn't merely a genius; she's an iconoclast who refuses to play nice with academia or be made to feel small. 

Her rebellion against social constraints isn't fueled just by prickly financial and intellectual needs but a jackpot of trauma: the simultaneous deaths of her stepfather, Gary (Laroyce Hawkins), and her best friend, Natalie (Lyric Ross). The latter is resurrected as Riri's grief-coded AI assistant by the end of the first episode (“Take Me Home”), adopting Natalie's sparkling personality and injecting the show with anodyne banter and a moral core. Her digital existence suggests a new angle to what drives Riri's chaotic choices: Does she do this out of survivor's guilt (she was present during their deaths) or the lonely pursuit of greatness? How much does the former influence the latter? Ironheart skirts serious introspection in its first three episodes. For now, it's enough to know that she will do whatever it takes to “revolutionize safety” with her innovations (“Help would never be too late,” she says), her successes making her bigger than Jobs, Gates, Pym, and Stark. Just don't get in her way. 

Riri's cash-strapped return to Chicago compels her to pivot into the local underworld. Soaring over the Chicago River, her suit's high-flying antics catch the eye of Parker Robbins, a.k.a. The Hood (Anthony Ramos), a criminal who operates out of a shuttered pizza joint and boasts a motley crew: Clown (Sonia Denis), the resident arsonist; Slug (Shea Couleé), the bedazzled hacker from Madripoor; Stuart, er, “Rampage” (Eric André), another, sweatier hacker; hired muscle Ros and Jerry, a.k.a. the “Blood Siblings” (Shakira Barrera and Zoe Terakes, respectively); and the knife-flipping John (Manny Montana), Robbins' moody right-hand man.  

Before he brings her into his fold, Parker subjects Riri to a unique job interview: defusing an elevator death trap. (“This is illegal!” is her adorable response.) Her escape impresses The Hood, so he seals their Faustian pact with carefully chosen platitudes that cut to her core. “Soon enough, you're gonna get tired of making yourself so small to fit inside those awkward boxes they put you in.” He offers validation with his extortion jobs, and while you'd think someone as smart as Riri would see through the noise, the money is green. So, you see, ethically, her hands are tied.   

Parker's first mission with Riri involves extracting cash from TNNL, a startup repurposing Chicago's ancient freight tunnels into Musk-coded private highways. Riri's prep leads her to suburbanite and human paradox Joe McGillicutty (Alden Ehrenreich), a tech ethicist with a secret bunker filled with illicitly procured bionics. After a few scenes of bonding, including a carpool-karaoke rendition of Alanis Morissette's “You Oughta Know,” it becomes agonizingly clear that Joe is hiding more than just a stash of illegal gear.  

At least the person he eventually reveals himself to be is a surprise: Ezekiel Stane, son of Obadiah (Jeff Bridges), the Iron Monger who died trying to kill Tony Stark at the end of 2008's Iron Man. “He went full supervillain,” Zeke says of his father. “Then you come knocking on my door with that same iron energy.” The irony is rich: Riri, trying to distinguish herself from Stark, ends up collaborating with the offspring of one of his enemies—albeit reluctantly and with a considerable amount of mutual blackmail. 

The TNNL job kicks off with minor hitches—mainly, a guard catching a magically lassoed bullet from Parker, even though Riri insisted that she didn't want anyone hurt as a result of their crimes. She doesn't trust this sulky hunk in his ridiculous crimson hood despite his talk about shared vision and community empowerment, and she definitely doesn't like the implications of his powers.Clown says she heard he stole his mysterious hood from coat check at Bottom Lounge, while lore suggests he wrestled it from a demon. One thing is for sure: That hood is not vintage Hermès, and its owner's vague allyship feels phonier by the minute. 

One conspicuous wrinkle in Parker's crew is that they each claim to care about “the community” (in all its forms, presumably) while committing crimes that enrich only themselves. Each member is hostile toward CEOs, imbuing them with a Robin Hood “take from the rich” mentality while neglecting the other part of that credo: tempering the hypocrisy (some say they will use their ill-gotten gains to open spaces for like-minded individuals someday) without fully excusing it. This creates a hazy demarcation between good and bad for Riri to navigate, as it also draws imperfect parallels to recent class-war news items. (“Are we Ocean's Eleven or The Sopranos?” she asks at one point, to which The Hood replies: “What's the difference?”) Perhaps the remaining episodes will see The Hood's coterie embracing chaos despite their morality, which may, in turn, give Ironheart a knottier complexity. Time will tell.

The third episode, “We In Danger, Girl,” is where the series makes its first substantial moral collision. During a heist at Heirlum—a company whose monastic CEO disrupts Parker's plans by throwing them in his face—Riri tries to carve off a piece of the hood to scan its magical properties. From here, things go sideways. John, believing she has betrayed his leader and friend, flies into a rage and ultimately suffocates in one of Heirlum's climate-controlled biospheres, left for dead by Riri. It's an effectively gnarly cliffhanger: Her guilt spirals into a full-blown panic attack, while the fallout calls into question Parker's loyalty to the sinister force that granted him his hood. 

John's grim demise underscores the show's thesis: By building herself up, Riri inadvertently breaks down her relationships, ideals, even her sense of self. “The best way to know a thing,” her father once said, “is to take it apart and put it back together.” Riri has stripped her morality down to the frame in pursuit of greatness. The question now is what she'll build from it. So far, Ironheart is more interested in its heroine's contradictions than her triumphs. That's a strength. More than being important, Riri wants to be iconic. But what does it mean when your hard-won glow-up is subsidized by people with horns under the hood?

Dear Batman movie music people: won't you please consider Anamanaguchi? That's the question the band is asking in the very fun video for their new song, “Magnet.” “‘Magnet' is a love song with some extreme feelings–an almost dark romance that feels like it's gliding out of control in a blissful way,” the band said in a statement. “We realized after the fact that this balance is a key part of the formula for Batman music.”

It also makes a pretty good formula for a music video. The band brought on director and cinematographer Jared Raab to put together a clip almost as meta as the name of his recent project, the SXSW-premiering Nirvanna The Band The Show The Movie. In it, the band doesn't even strive to be in a specific Batman movie. (The Batman Part II won't be out for a while anyway.) “We have to strike while the iron is hot, and they're making more Batman movies all the time,” they surmise before the video cuts to a sort of digital application full of clips of the band interspersed with all those past Batmen. This writer isn't a Batman movie music person, but if she was, she would probably be swayed.



“Magnet” will appear on the chiptune band's first-ever lyrically driven rock album, Anyway. They're also working on the soundtrack for the new Scott Pilgrim game, Scott Pilgrim EX, due out in 2026. (It's not a Batman, but it's still pretty good.) The band also recently announced a 32-stop North American tour. You can find dates and ticketing info here. Anyway is out August 8. Maybe it will show up in a Batman soundtrack sooner rather than later.

Kim Kardashian is once again making headlines with a striking transformation.

In a fresh campaign for SKIMS' collaboration with Roberto Cavalli, the 44-year-old entrepreneur and reality star stunned fans by swapping her iconic long brunette locks for a voluminous curly blonde bob. The unexpected hairstyle, accessorized with a wide red headband, gave Kardashian an entirely new look, prompting many to do a double-take.

A post shared by SKIMS (@skims)

The campaign features Kardashian modeling a tiger-print scoop-neck swimsuit, part of the limited-edition line between her shapewear brand and the luxury Italian fashion house. While the swimwear caught attention, it was the head-turning hairstyle that had fans talking.

Though the blonde curls are likely the result of a wig, Kardashian has never been shy about switching up her style. In fact, her latest transformation arrives just months after a dramatic cut from celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton.

“Love this new chop on kim, we got 7 inches off her hair!” Appleton captioned a Feb. 2 Instagram post, adding, “(No it's not a wig before u start lol).”

A post shared by SKIMS (@skims)

This isn't the only recent hair makeover in the Kardashian household. Earlier in June, Kardashian's daughter North West, 11, debuted bright blue hair, trading in her natural dark locks for a bold pop of color.

Hair has always been an extension of identity for Kardashian, who shares four children—North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm—with ex-husband Kanye West. She's spoken candidly about the link between hair and mood, telling Allure in 2022, “I'm sassier. I'm more confident as a blonde. As soon as I go back to brunette, I'm a boss.”

Her commitment to hair maintenance is well-documented. In a 2018 episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” Kardashian revealed to her mother Kris Jenner, “I put it in my will that I have to always have my hair done.”

The SKIMS x Cavalli moment is just the latest in a long line of beauty evolutions for Kardashian. From fiery red to platinum blonde, and now this bouncy blonde bob, her hair choices continue to be a canvas for self-expression—and a spark for conversation across social media.

“The creative director for the wigs deserves a raise,” one fan commented. “I can't breathe !! This is soo breathtaking, Kim !!” wrote another. 

As fashion and beauty fans eagerly follow the rollout of the SKIMS collaboration, it's clear that Kardashian's transformations remain as headline-worthy as ever.

Mariska Hargitay has been attending red carpet events for her documentary, “My Mom Jayne” (which has offered a glimpse into her childhood and the secrets that were kept from her, including the revelation that her biological father is not Mickey Hargitay, People reports). However, the film's promotion has also provided a unique opportunity for fans to see more of the actress and her family.

Hargitay is married to Peter Hermann, and the couple has been married since 2004, after meeting on the set of “Law & Order SVU.” The pair is also proud parents to three children, August, Andrew, and Amaya.

Hargitay does not often post photos of her family on Instagram, and they are rarely photographed all together (although they have attended events and walked red carpets together before). However, when they recently attended the 2025 Tribeca Festival at Carnegie Hall on June 13, 2025, they posed on the red carpet for an absolutely gorgeous family photo.

Ten days later, June 23, 2025, the family stepped out again to attend an event at the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Hargitay and Hermann posed for photos with their two eldest children, August and Amaya. 

They look so grown up!

Hargitay and Hermann became parents for the first time in 2006, when their son August Miklos Friedrich Hermann was born. The actress was 42. They later adopted Amaya Josephine Hermann in April 2011, and six months later, in October 2011, they adopted their third child, Andrew Nicolas Hermann.

Hargitay has opened up about having children later in life. “I'm so grateful that I'm an older mom. Grateful that I became successful older. I don't know if I could have handled it when I was younger,” she told People in January 2024. “When I was younger I wasn't as present but as I've gotten older I've started to accept and appreciate.”

She continued, “And now I'm going to savor this moment. I want to share my lessons and where there is pain that I can fix that really inspires me to lighten the load.”

Hargitay has also shared a lesson that she learned from motherhood. “The thing that's made me a better parent is my kids,” she told People in 2018. “Because they taught me to really listen. My husband is my North Star, and my kids are my teachers.” What a gorgeous family!

Tom Sandoval on America's Got Talent?!?

Yep, that's right. The former “Vanderpump Rules” star appeared in front of the judges with his band, Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras, in an episode that aired on Tuesday, June 24. And with that, he explained why this moment meant so much to him, especially after everything that happened in the past. 

“A couple of years ago, I made some really bad choices,” Sandoval said ahead of the audition to the cameras. “I was involved in a very bad cheating scandal, and I let down a lot of people.”

“It pretty much destroyed my life,” he continued. “It was absurd how much coverage and how big it became. Ever since then, it's like everything I do is completely criticized. I feel a lot of pressure.”

Then, when he took the stage, Simon Cowell pointed out that he's friends with Lisa Vanderpump and asked about his transition to music. 

“With being on a reality TV show, that's very much about your personal life,” Sandoval detailed. “And a couple of years ago, I was involved in a scandal and I was labeled as the ‘Most Hated Man in America' by The New York Times. It was really, really rough and I was in a very, very dark place. I felt as though I had nothing in my life and this band was the only thing that kept me going.”

So, what's his hope by coming on America's Got Talent? 

“I would love nothing more than for us to tour the world and be the ultimate cover band, the party band,” he said. 

A post shared by America's Got Talent – AGT (@agt)

After Sandoval told the judges about the scandal, Cowell joked, “Let's get America to like you!”

Then, as he began setting up, the judges turned to one another, with Sofia Vergara asking Howie Mandel, “What was the scandal?”

“He slept with his girlfriend's best friend,” Mandel responded. 

“No wonder nobody likes him then!,” Mel B chimed in. 

“Because of that, he became the ‘most hated man' [in America],” Vergara asked. 

“Do you know how not interested I am in any of that stuff,” Cowell said.

Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras performed a cover of A-ha's hit song, “Take on Me.” And the judges were certainly fans of it.

Mel B said that it “made me smile,” while Vergara said Sandoval did “look amazing up there.”

However, when it was Cowell's turn, he didn't hold back, telling Sandoval that his “vocals weren't great,” but said that it was nice to see him stay “true to who you are.”

And with that, all the judges gave him a yes, allowing him to move on to the next round.

Porsha Williams has really been through it over the last year or so. The “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star is relieved that her divorce from Simon Guobadia has been finalized, and she is ready to discuss the fallout. 

In a new exclusive interview with PEOPLE, she explained how her husband quickly changed. “You're not looking at the same person who loved you before. I'll never forget. I looked at him, and it wasn't really what he said, it was how I felt because I really operate off of energy,” explains Porsha.

Even though Porsha felt like Simon had changed, she still held onto hope for her marriage. “I still thought I was grasping and still with the person that I knew and loved, my person. At the end of the day, I felt like, and some of me still feels like, Simon was my person.”

“I came to the realization when we were having pretty much our first really drag-out argument. There was some paperwork that needed to be handled, and I wanted to bring in some attorneys to represent me, and that was frowned upon, and he, I don't know, it was a look. I didn't know I was going to divorce him in that moment, but I knew we had probably reached a point of no return,” Porsha added. She then called the end of their relationship “prettying up the ugly.”

Porsha filed for divorce from Simon in February 2024. According to Porsha, “I would think that he would feel like it was a blindside for him. He was out of the country, and I had begged him not to go out of the country. I felt it wasn't safe for him to be traveling anymore when I got some information.”

The two had a prenup, and in the end, money wasn't the hardest part for Porsha. “I was very responsible. He was very responsible. Both of us were, and we were proud of our prenup. We felt like, ‘Okay, this is comfortable for us at our age, bringing together two big worlds.'” She knew that she would be fine financially after their divorce.

It was the depth of the heartbreak that crushed the reality star. “On the side of emotions, I was not prepared for going through this divorce. I really think I miscalculated how much I cared for my husband. It was a tough decision. I just loved him and I trusted him. Those two things are big factors that really hurt in the divorce. The fact that I loved him so much, I trusted him so much, and I felt safe with him.”

“I do believe there were some old habits. Some desires that he had, and there were some things he wanted to accomplish outside of family. I possibly think he chose those things over me, over us. What this healing process has been like, I swear, it's been like super highs and super lows. In the beginning, I was just really in a whirlwind of wondering, ‘Did I do the right thing? What has happened? Who is he really? Who am I really? Is it my fault?”

She continued, “I don't break up with someone and 100% blame them. I looked for where I can be accountable to soothe myself and have some truth.” Porsha credits her mom and her sister for helping her get through things, and she is finally on the other side of her healing journey.

When real-life Hallmark couple Erin Krakow and Ben Rosenbaum, who both star on “When Calls The Heart,” revealed via social media on June 23, 2025, that they'd tied the knot, it came as a huge surprise to fans — and maybe even some of their fellow stars, since the duo never revealed publicly that they were engaged. 

Although a handful of their famous friends were quick to reply to their June 23 announcement, including their dear friends and fellow WCTH couple Kevin McGarry and Kayla Wallace, many more have since replied with sweet words of celebration. 

A post shared by Erin Krakow (@erinkrakow)

Less than four days after Krakow posted two photos from her and Rosenbaum's nuptials, with her wearing a beautiful wedding dress and long veil, and him in chocolate brown suit, nearly 80,000 fans and friends had liked the post and almost 5,000 had left comments. 

McGarry, who plays Mountie Nathan Grant on WCTH — now the beau to Krakow's lead character Elizabeth Thornton as they head into filming season 13 — was one of the first to react to her post, sweetly writing, “Beautiful pictures, beautiful friends, beautiful husband and wife – xo”

McGarry's wife Wallace, who now appears part-time on the WCTH given her role in Paramount's “Landman,” wrote, “I'm still crying. My favourite pairing! 🧀 🍷”

On June 25, Pascale Hutton, who plays Krakow's best friend on WCTH, popped in to write, “Love you both with all my heart ❤️”

Kavan Smith noticed Rosenbaum's cool two-toned loafers and wrote, “Perfect couple. Love the shoes B”

Hyland Goodrich, who plays Krakow's son Little Jack on the show, left a comment (likely with help from his mom) that said, “A pairing written in the stars. ✨ You two are magic! 🥰🎊🤗😍”

Tierra Skovbye, who joined the cast during season 12, wrote, “You guys!!! I am so happy for you!!! ❤️❤️❤️ stunning!”

Melissa Gilbert, who also joined the cast as a guest star in season 12 and will return for season 13, commented, “This makes me soooooo happy!!! Congratulations you two!”

Viv Leacock, who plays Joseph Canfield on WCTH, chimed in, “So much love!!! So happy for you two!! Both looking absolutelyincredible!! Much love from all of us❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️”

WCTH co-creator and producer Brian Bird wrote, “So thrilled for you, Ben and Erin! Two of my favorite people in the world!”

The cast has been dropping into wardrobe for individual fittings in Vancouver throughout June, but they're sure to celebrate Krakow and Rosenbaum's union when they're all back together to start filming season 13 in July. 

A post shared by Erin Krakow (@erinkrakow)

It's not just WCTH cast members celebrating Krakow and Rosenbaum in the comment section of their wedding announcement. Plenty of other Hallmark stars have shared their excitement for them too, including Krakow's “It Was Always You” co-star Tyler Hynes, who commented, “Love n stuff ✨🤍✨”

Tamera Mowry-Housley, who recently filmed a fun Hallmark+ promo with Krakow, called out the bride's curly updo by writing, “Curls are gorgeous 😍 Congrats @erinkrakow 💍”

Rachel Boston chimed in with “Congratulations!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️” and Lacey Chabert wrote a nearly identical comment, “Congratulations!!!! 💗💗💗💗”

A few days after Cannes wrapped up last month, my IndieWire colleague Ryan Lattanzio published an interview with filmmaker Nadav Lapid, whose furious new satire of modern Israel quietly premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section at the very end of the festival. That was a curious and pronounced demotion for a rising auteur whose similarly blistering previous feature (2021's “Ahed's Knee”) had been selected for the main Competition, where it emerged from a stacked field to win the Jury Prize. But the world has changed over the last four years, and — according to French outlet Le Nouvel Obs — Cannes president Iris Knobloch is no longer comfortable with shining her festival's brightest spotlight on a movie so hostile towards Benjamin Netanyahu's ongoing genocide.

Ryan's headline, “You May Never Get to See Cannes' Most Provocative and ‘Dangerous' Movie,” epitomizes the sensationalism that ad-supported websites like ours sometimes lean on to drive clicks toward stories about two-and-a-half-hour art films that the reader may never get a chance to see (a shocking admission, I know). And truth be told, I might have rolled my eyes at that framing had I not already seen the movie in question But I had seen the movie. Just as importantly, I've also seen how other movies about Israel's war on Gaza have been treated since the events of October 7, 2023, and so — to my great dismay — my only reaction to Ryan's headline was to wince in recognition of its truth. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Lapid's film is called “Yes.” The film industry's response to it has predictably been “no.” 

For the first time in my professional career as a critic, there is a subject that some festivals — and virtually all U.S. distributors — are too afraid to touch. In a bleeding-heart business that prides itself on the sensitivity it brings to difficult stories, a business in which people are regularly festooned with awards for shining a light on the darkest corners of human civilization, the Palestinian genocide has become uniquely taboo.

You know things are bleak when the Oscars are the industry's lone act of moral courage, but in rewarding “No Other Land” with the documentary world's highest honor, the Academy forced attention onto a crisis that the rest of Hollywood still won't touch.

Or even deign to profit from! Even more than its liberal bonafides, our country's independent film business loves stellar box office returns. However, the overwhelming interest in “No Other Land” — which became an object of great fascination upon its prize-winning premiere at the 2024 Berlinale, and was clearly destined for an Oscar nomination soon thereafter — mysteriously failed to translate into proper distribution. 

 










The film was earmarked for success, and had it been about any other subject, that would have been reason enough for someone to release it. And I was certain that someone would. After all, the moral consequences of settler colonialism is only the single most popular subject in the history of American moviegoing, and so it didn't seem all that far-fetched to think that a single distributor might be willing to display the same backbone as the YouTube star who sings to my two-year-old daughter about the magic of using the potty.

While rumors persist that producers rejected a handful of offers in order to preserve the movie's “Netanyahu doesn't want you to see this” mystique (a source confirmed they balked at a single lowball offer), even the most forward-thinking and outspoken executives I harangued about “No Other Land” last summer told me they couldn't afford the controversy. Precisely none of them changed their minds after the film was invited to Hollywood's biggest night.

Needless to say, that's a sharp break in the history of a business that has long seen a degree of public discomfort as more feature than bug. When rumors spread that  “Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat” would make audiences fear for their very lives, the Lumière brothers' actuality became an international sensation. Almost 100 years later, the promise of protests and death threats failed to stop Universal Pictures from turning a profit on “The Last Temptation of Christ,” which screened around the world even after an Integralist Catholic group set fire to a Paris cinema in the middle of a screening. Glib or otherwise, examples abound.

 










But Israel is unique for how its identity as an ethnostate has been weaponized into a rhetorical shield the size of the Iron Dome. Accusations of “anti-Semitism” are routinely used to silence critics — much as right-wing activists invoked misguided accusations of pedophilia to turn “Cuties” into a symbol of supposed liberal depravity. Domestic Zionist groups even threatened to revoke the lease of a theater that screened “No Other Land.” (Upon withdrawing his resolution, Miami Beach mayor Steven Meiner called upon the nonprofit theater in question to screen films in which “the viewpoint of the State of Israel is fully and accurately presented,” which of course describes “No Other Land” to a tee.) Be that as it may, one can only imagine the very real difficulties that distributors might have faced had they put themselves in the line of fire, and so the vast majority of them decided that it wasn't worth the trouble.

“No Other Land” was ultimately self-released, and its $2.5 million box office haul made it the third-highest-grossing documentary of 2024. It earned more than any movie ever distributed by the only company that made a formal offer for it. 

The point, of course, isn't that America's film industry should be doing more to profit off the back of an unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe. The point is that America's film industry is displaying a collective degree of cowardice that finds it deliberately acting against its own ethos as both an artform and a business. The former is routine, but the latter is remarkable.

 










For me, it represents a moral abstention wholly unprecedented in my lifetime. Consider Hollywood's relatively decisive reaction to other global crises. The AIDS outbreak is an imperfect comparison for several reasons, but I'm struck by the fact that sober and enduring movies about the epidemic were widely distributed as early as 1985 despite the virulent demonization of its victims. Michael Moore was booed at the Oscars for voicing his opposition to the Iraq War in 2003, only for “Fahrenheit 9/11” to gross more than $222 million the very next year. Today, it often takes less than a week for a disaster to become the subject of its own Hulu documentary.

While the films' impact on government policy and/or public opinion is debatable, movies large and small have been at the forefront of some of the 21st century's most difficult conversations. It was the movies that told us that climate change is real. That Michael Jackson was bad. That McDonald's makes you fat. It was the movies that revealed the extent of the American government's efforts to surveil its own people, took us into the broken heart of the war in Ukraine, and proved that octopuses can teach you things.

And now, among all forms of popular media, it's the movies that now feel uniquely feckless as they respond with uncharacteristic silence to one of the worst ongoing atrocities of our time. 

 










As the Jewish grandson of a Holocaust survivor, I haven't been shy about my feelings toward the atrocities being committed in Gaza. The horror I feel about them being conducted in my name, and with my tax dollars, is obviously at the root of my frustration with the film industry's continued refusal to meet — or even observe — the moment. It's a refusal so complete that Badie and Hamza Ali had to launch their own label, Watermelon Pictures, to ensure that urgent documentaries like “From Ground Zero” and “The Encampments” were made available to American viewers. 

And yet, I didn't write this column just to revisit the lack of support for “No Other Land,” or even to bemoan the fact that “Yes” faces even bleaker prospects at receiving proper distribution. Not only is Lapid's film a much thornier piece of work that's willing to provoke viewers on both sides of the “is genocide good?” debate (a license it self-grants by acknowledging the absurdity of that question), but its lack of awards potential denies it the best sales hook that “No Other Land” had to its advantage.

The specialized market is on its knees at the moment and many of its biggest players are partially funded by Israeli money. Still, this represents a striking reversal of fortune for Lapid, a filmmaker whose previous movies have all been released in the United States despite sharing the same mercilessly self-excoriating approach to Israeli-ness that rages beneath every minute of “Yes.” 

 










I suspected that would be the case for whatever movie Lapid chose to make in the aftermath of October 7. While I was dismayed that every distribution executive I spoke to at Cannes seemed to shudder at the mere thought of acquiring “Yes,” I wasn't surprised. What caught me off guard, and what inspired me to yell back into the void about an all-too-familiar subject (at a time of such widespread chaos that it seems ridiculous to think the film industry matters at all) was the possibility that “Yes” may not even get another chance to be ignored. 

It hadn't occurred to me that this singularly vital addition to post-October 7 cinema that dared to do more than pick a side might be shunned from the same festivals that leapt at the chance to screen his previous work.

“Yes” has not been formally rejected from Telluride, TIFF, NYFF, or any of the other marquee stops on the fall circuit, but as of this writing I can confirm that it has yet to be privately invited to any of them either, which isn't an encouraging sign at this point in the summer. I'm confident that cooler heads will prevail, especially at festivals that have long embraced political antagonism as a raison d'être, but the uncertainty alone is enough to redouble my fear that the film industry's recent conservatism is trickling upward even faster than it's trickling down from the executive level.

 










The problem is worsened by the broken and outmoded state of the Oscars' Best International Feature category, which lets foreign governments handpick their own submissions and launder their public images. While recent nominees like “I'm Still Here,” “Collective,” and “Argentina, 1985” didn't flatter their home countries, the system gives authoritarian regimes the power to bury dissenting films. China can block wider recognition of Jia Zhangke's “Caught by the Tides,” Iran can limit the audience for Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident,” and Georgia can suppress Dea Kulumbegashvili's “April” — a film so politically explosive it forced its director into exile. The Academy process enables the very abuses these films seek to expose.

That the Israeli Film Fund contributed financing to “Yes” is 1) hilarious, and 2) no reason to hope the country would submit a legendary self-own to the Academy Awards. (Lapid told Ryan he wasn't sure the government was even aware of the movie's existence.)

How much does that matter in the grand scheme of things? Even in an alternate universe where “Yes” wound up in the mix on Oscar night, it's not as if it would drastically reconfigure the discourse about the genocide in Gaza. A little gold man doesn't have the power to un-kill 50,000 children any more than it has the power to spare the deaths of 50,000 more. “No Other Land” winning an Academy Award didn't even prevent the further desecration of the area depicted in the film, nor did it prevent producer Hamdan Ballal from being savagely attacked by a group of masked settlers soon after he returned home from Los Angeles. 

 










The Dolby Theatre hosted two of Hollywood's only meaningful attempts to confront the slaughter, and those moments landed with disproportionate force because they pierced through our community's galling abstention from this atrocity. The speeches from the “No Other Land” team earlier this year, and “The Zone of Interest” director Jonathan Glazer the year before, cast a brief, glaring light on a crisis that the industry continues to ignore. In those moments, television confronted a reality that film has refused to acknowledge for itself— a humiliating failure for a medium once hailed as “truth 24 times per second.”

I've long argued that movies have a brighter future than streaming lobbyists would have us believe, but such willful blindness is the only thing that's ever truly dimmed my optimism for the medium's continued value. In a world starved for the very truth that our industry has neglected to acknowledge, what value could the cinema possibly hold if it lacks the courage to show us the reality that confronts us on every other screen?

A broken clock is right twice a day, but even at its funniest, “M3GAN 2.0” feels like it's here too soon and too late. Filmmaker Gerard Johnstone returns with a frustrating and tedious follow-up to Blumhouse's smash-hit horror movie about a killer robot from 2023. 

The director reunites with original “M3GAN” stars Allison Williams and Violet McGraw for his bizarro sequel — an exhausting two-hour expansion that introduces several different versions of M3GAN (played by Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and a strange new frenemy known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno). Johnstone steers the murderous android into a muddy redemption arc just as he forces the franchise to abruptly switch genres. Swapping out scares for action beats, that unexpected approach creates a colorful techno-apocalypse with admirable ambitions aimed at something like “Terminator II — for Girls!” Still, it lacks life.

Johnstone loses his way, taking over writing the script from the wonderfully funny Akela Cooper (“Malignant”). She created the first “M3GAN” with James Wan and has a story credit on the sequel. Her wickedly dark humor lives on in M3GAN's vicious one-liners, even as Johnstone's exposition-heavy script drags the story down. From “Evil Dead” to “The Strangers,” scary movies will often make dramatic tonal shifts between their first and second chapters. That's as good a strategy as any for keeping seasoned slasher fans on their toes, but storytelling categories as potentially diverse as horror and action can draw in totally different audiences. Bolting those two crowds together can be tough, and “M3GAN 2.0” multiplies its problem by seeming ambivalent in the penumbra of real AI.

Tasked with more screen time than anyone (or anything) in this film needs, Williams reprises her role as Gemma. A reluctant caregiver and negligent toy inventor — picture the mom from “Child's Play” combined with Mark Zuckerberg on an apology tour — she almost lost her niece, Cady (McGraw), to an anxiously attached prototype a few years ago. At age 12, the Orphan Formerly Known as M3GAN's Best Friend has mixed feelings about her brush with the deadly doll. Sure, Cady's high-tech companion killed four people and a dog; not to mention, she threatened to lobotomize her aunt. But that was then, this is now, and as M3GAN explains upon her triumphant and bratty return, she only did those things because she is “a person!” with “feelings!!” and she was “UPSET!!!”

In her first movie, M3GAN was campy enough to become an accidental gay icon, on par with quietly fabulous tormenters from Pennywise to The Babadook. Now, in June 2025, Blumhouse is sending her sequel to theaters on a confused wave of Pride-themed marketing so niche it seems likely to undercut the film's PG-13 rating. The hit-or-miss studio tends to misdirect its success, but Johnstone helps Blumhouse turn “M3GAN 2.0” into an extravagant work of misunderstanding with a misshapen narrative that is both logically messy and emotionally insecure. An explosive source of passive aggression, M3GAN is beloved by moviegoers for her unfiltered reactions and atypical combination of traits. 

 










She's lethally maternal but motivated by a specific type of single-minded terror that's usually reserved for narcissistic men and the grudges of preteen girls. Arm the more menacing, earlier version of M3GAN with some real firepower, and you could unearth some extra grisly horror-action scenes. Sadly, Johnstone can't make himself cut enough dialogue to deliver on the promise of even his smartest set-pieces. M3GAN hacking into a rentable street scooter should be bloody and memorable. Instead, the sequel chains its bitchy anti-hero to a morality lesson that won't end and confirms: “M3GAN 2.0” is not a horror movie by most definitions. Compared to other Blumhouse sequels, the robotic misfire recalls the toothlessness of “Five Nights at Freddy's” and the good-idea-bad-execution of “The Forever Purger.”  It also makes you fear for the fate of future projects, including the “Ma” sequel or “Black Phone 2.”

Johnstone's repeated attempts to find the soul of “M3GAN 2.0” are better than releasing a film you know is shallow. Die-hard fans will discover enough pleasing weirdness — particularly in its pandering conclusion, inconsistent special effects, and the way Williams says “melatonin” — to make the entire affair seem worthwhile. (It's no La Roux's “Bulletproof,” but you can also expect to hear at least one outrageous needle drop from a legendary pop princess. That said, the sequel's dancing disappoints.)

 










Still, M3GAN's greatest asset was never her heart, but her lack of one. It's somewhat baffling, then, that she is easily the most likable character in a lineup of algorithmically hateable humans. The sequel's director hails from New Zealand, and that's presumably how he got Jemaine Clement to play a whacked-out tech billionaire. But Hell only knows where Blumhouse started looking when it was time to cast a slippery tech ethicist as Gemma's profoundly pretentious love interest (Aristotle Athari).

Useless narrative threads and too many wasted elements give away “M3GAN 2.0” as an amateur effort made by a talented horror filmmaker who has not yet mastered action's specific visual language or skill set. Of course, when Blumhouse makes the risky move back toward “M3GAN” with its spinoff “Soulmate” (already scheduled for next year), the should-be silly series ought to experiment with a hybrid model mixing the stakes of serious nightmares with the spectacle of nunchucks. Only then will true “M3GAN” devotees see the blood-thirsty queen of the bear crawl properly unleashed.

From Universal Pictures, “M3GAN 2.0” is in theaters on Friday, June 27.

Is there such a thing as creating your own paradise? Well, the star-studded cast of Ron Howard's “Eden” are about to find out. Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, Daniel Brühl, and Sydney Sweeney lead the film, which dramatizes the “shocking true story” (per the film's official logline) of a group of disillusioned outsiders who left civilization to start their own society on a remote, uninhabited island.

Of course, the clan later discovered that the “greatest threat isn't the brutal climate or deadly wildlife, but each other,” as the synopsis tells us. “As tensions spiral and desperation takes hold, a twisted power struggle unfolds, leading to betrayal, violence, and the deaths of half the colony.”

Noah Pink wrote the script with Howard directing, as well as producing alongside Brian Grazer, Karen Lunder, Stuart Ford, William M. Connor, and Patrick Newall.

And for those wondering, yes, the “Eden” cast did actually rough it themselves. De Armas previously told Vanity Fair that starring in “Eden” pushed her to get to her “craziest” self onscreen, with the publication also citing that Howard “actually had to push back on both Law and Kirby's commitment to Method, Floreana-style living.”

 










De Armas admitted that she was “a little scared” to take on the role, as the film is “really out there.” She later decided that she “wanted the challenge” of starring in the feature. “Having this crazy threesome relationship, and being a woman of opposites — either she's sweet and tender and fragile and nervous and scared, or she's absolutely crazy and dangerous, it was kind of finding that limit. What was the craziest I could get? How far could I go?,” de Armas said.

The “Ballerina” star later explained why the singing aspect of the film was part of the stress of shooting. “I just couldn't convince [Howard] to let me lip sync so I had to learn the song. It was horrible. I was terrified,” de Armas said. “I would rather do 100 stunts than sing that song. It was terrifying because it's also in front of all the actors. I just felt very exposed and vulnerable and it's not one of my talents for sure.”

However, it all proved to be worth it: The IndieWire review for “Eden” deemed de Armas a “scream in a cast filled with standout performances.”

Vertical will release “Eden” in theaters on Friday, August 22. Check out the teaser below.

Iconic ventriloquist and puppeteer Shari Lewis gets a documentary ode to her trailblazing career as a children's entertainer in “Shari & Lamb Chop.” The new documentary, from “Love, Gilda” director and Emmy-nominated filmmaker Lisa D'Apolito, takes an up-close and personal look at her life and career starting with the CBS television series “Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts” in the early 1950s, through “The Shari Lewis Show” and “The Charlie Horse Music Pizza,” with her second husband Jeremy Tarcher. 

Kino Lorber releases the documentary in theaters on July 18, with digital, educational, and home video releases to follow. Watch the trailer, an IndieWire exclusive, for “Shari & Lamb Chop” below.

Here's the official synopsis: “Before Fred Rogers and Jim Henson, there was Shari Lewis, a children's television pioneer whose whimsical characters and ebullient spirit have guided generations of children as they came of age. Raised in the Bronx by a proud feminist mother and a professor father who moonlighted as Peter Pan the Magic Man, Shari became a multitalented dancer, singer, and magician. But when an injury sidelined her dance aspirations, she channeled her creativity into a passion for ventriloquism, creating the now beloved sock puppet characters Charlie Horse, Hush Puppy and, of course, Lamb Chop.

“From her early years of TV success to the crush of her show's cancellation to her 1990s comeback in her 60s, Lisa D'Apolito's heartfelt doc charts the life, loves, and career hits and misses of the spunky perfectionist whose talent and perseverance stand as a testament to women's power and forever changed the landscape of children's entertainment. Featuring interviews with ventriloquists inspired by Lewis alongside nostalgia-rich clips and home movies, this vibrant portrait brims with the same warmth, wit, and magic that defined her, celebrating the power of imagination and the inner child within.”

Said D'Apolito, “Shari Lewis's life is the ultimate comeback story. Shari mesmerized and empowered generations of children and their family in believing in themselves and having fun doing it. Audiences for the film have been multi-generational and have laughed and cried together and fallen in love with Shari and Lamb Chop. I hope it is a film that you can go with your grandparent, parents and your children and whether you watched Shari on TV or not, it brings the magic of childhood.”

Said Mallory Lewis, Shari's daughter, “I could not be happier that the world is finally going to get to truly know my mother's story and for the first time meet the fascinating and complex woman, the wife, the mother, the producer, that was Shari Lewis! They will not be disappointed.”

 










The film is produced by White Horse Pictures and MoJo Global Arts and presented by Concord Originals and Olive Hill Media in association with The 51 Fund, Carlene Laughlin, and Chicago Media Project. The film first premiered at DOC NYC.

The documentary is produced with the full cooperation of the Shari Lewis estate, through her daughter Mallory, who shares in her mother's legacy performing with Lamb Chop regularly across the U.S.

Channing Tatum is going where he has never gone before on-screen: The actor/producer collaborates with legendary indie director Derek Cianfrance for crime drama “Roofman,” based on real-life felon Jeffrey Manchester. The film centers on Tatum's depiction of Jeff, who was known for living in a Toys 'R' Us store after escaping from prison. He sustained himself by breaking into more than 60 McDonald's over the course of his crime career.

The first look at “Roofman” states that the film is “based on a true story *as told by a liar.” The film takes place over the course of six months in 2004, during which Jeff lived under the alias “John Zorn” in a North Carolina community. Kirsten Dunst portrays Leigh Wainscott, the divorced mom who works at Toys 'R' Us and falls for Tatum's character. Ben Mendelsohn, LaKeith Stanfield, Juno Temple, Melonie Diaz, Uzo Aduba, Lily Collias, Jimmy O. Yang, and Peter Dinklage also star.

Tatum told EW that he felt a “lot of pressure” filming “Roofman” especially since he was portraying a real person. “It's impossible to tell someone's real life story in 90 minutes,” Tatum said. “I really hope Jeff likes the movie. He's made some bad decisions in his life. That is a fact. But he is probably the first one to tell you that. But I just find him such a beautiful and unfortunate soul. It breaks my heart; he's so smart and alive, even on a phone call. The first time I ever talked to him, I was nervous, and he knew things about me and asked me about my life. He made things really easy.”

 










As for working with “Blue Valentine” director Cianfrance, Tatum explained how he had a “soul contract” with the filmmaker for this role. “Derek came into my life at a very interesting point where I'd reached a different place in my craft,” Tatum said. “I didn't really expect to go to the places that we did. Derek and I signed this soul contract. I don't think I've been given the opportunity to do work like this. I've never been pushed as hard as Derek pushed me.” 

Tatum continued, “We made a deal in the beginning that there was no unsafe place. We would do a take as it was written; we'd do a take that was silent; we would do a take like Jerry Lewis. We went all over the map and there was no wrong. That created a place of real vulnerability. It opened up a space to really sit in the loneliness of this character. … This was a spiritual marathon on some level.”

“Roofman” is written by director Cianfrance and Kirt Gunn. Both Tatum and Cianfrance also executive produce, along with Jonathan Glickman, Thom Zadra, Charles M. Barsamian, Chris Parker, Tyler Zacharia, and Jonathan Montepare. Jamie Patricof, Lynette Howell Taylor, Alex Orlovsky Duncan Montgomery, and Dylan Sellers produce.

“Roofman” is a Paramount Pictures feature, in Association with Miramax, FilmNation Entertainment, and Von Waaden Entertainment, LLC.

 










In addition to “Roofman,” Tatum also has his “Ghost” remake in the works, plus the Zellner Brothers' “Alpha Gang.” Cate Blanchett, Léa Seydoux, Dave Bautista, Zoë Kravitz, Steven Yeun, and Riley Keough round out the ensemble cast for the film about a group of alien invaders who are disguised in human form as a 1950s leather-clad biker gang. Tatum also already wrapped Beth de Araújo‘s sophomore feature film “Josephine” in 2024 alongside Gemma Chan, Philip Ettinger, and Syra McCarthy.

Paramount Pictures will release “Roofman” on Friday, October 10 in theaters. Check out the film's first trailer below.

It's been six years since the release of “Missing Link,” the fifth stop-motion animated film from the Portland-based animation house Laika. If you don't remember it, that's because the $100 million film — though well reviewed with an 88 percent Rotten Tomatoes score — was a financial bomb, bringing in only $26.5 million globally. Prior Laika films were all budgeted in the $60 million range and were almost all consistent performers at the box office with around $100 million globally, but reports at the time estimated “Missing Link” could have lost over $100 million after expenses.

 










The onset of COVID-19 in early 2020 didn't help Laika bounce back. The pandemic severely hampered the company's ability to work by hand in their tactile animation facility in the Oregon woodlands, such that production on the company's next ambitious stop-motion epic, “Wildwood,” did not formally begin until September 2021. The company's founder, Travis Knight, in the meantime has been occupied with the upcoming live-action “Masters of the Universe” tentpole film for Amazon MGM.

But Laika hasn't been sitting idly in the six years that have passed. After the failure of “Missing Link,” the studio has taken its time to, just as they do with each of their films, rebuild piece by piece. They're now aiming to let a new audience know who they are, all over again.

“It hasn't been a quiet phase for us,” David Burke, Laika's CMO, told IndieWire. “It's really been more a quiet build. It's not us being dormant. We've been using that time to reflect on who Laika is and what the audience needs from us now, and also recognizing that the industry is shifting. We're not just adapting. We're reasserting what makes Laika singular.”

“Wildwood” is as good of a re-introduction as any. The fantasy film is based on the first in a trilogy of YA novels by Colin Meloy, better known as the lead singer and songwriter for the Portland-based indie rock band The Decemberists. But the project is also right at home for Laika, as it's set in a secret forest just outside of Laika's home in Portland and follows a girl whose baby brother is taken into the forest, only to discover an exotic world of talking animals and bandits. It sounds like she might've stumbled on Laika's studio facility. 

“Wildwood” was the headliner as part of Laika's Annecy presentation, in which the company teased its upcoming animated projects — not even including its new live-action division — it has in the works. It also reminded the audience that a six-year layover didn't mean audiences forgot about them completely.

 










Last year, Laika in partnership with Fathom Entertainment in the U.S. and Trafalgar Releasing internationally for the re-released Henry Selick's 3-D darling “Coraline,” raking in $56 million at the box office and making it one of the most successful re-releases ever. The company will hope lightning strikes twice and plans to re-release “ParaNorman” remastered and in 3-D on October 25 in the US, and it will also be accompanied with a new short film, “ParaNorman: The Thrifting.”

That short is a good example of how Laika is going beyond its roots, having outsourced some of the animation work to a French company called Passion Pictures, while keeping the creative in-house. But in addition to outsourcing, Laika has used the time to ramp up infrastructure internally and now has a beefy development slate. Considering Laika has in its first 20 years since being founded in 2005 only made five films (not including the company's collaboration on “Corpse Bride”) to date, the studio appears to be setting themselves up to make a lot more movies in its next 20.

That means live-action productions like Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck taking on a Taylor Jenkins Reid novel or Jon Spaiths making his directorial debut on a sci-fi thriller. And it also means — crucially — the ability for Laika to produce multiple movies at once, with both the fantasy adaptation “Piranesi” and the neo-noir folktale “The Night Gardner” both in active development. The Annecy presentation also teased new projects in the works from the animator duo known as Headless (Victor Maldonado & Alfredo Torres), Chris Butler, Sam Fell, and The Copeland Brothers. 

 










“We've always been about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in stop-motion animation, and now we're taking that mindset and applying it to filmmaking in general,” Burke said. “I think what the world will see is that when ‘Wildwood' is released and there's more visibility around our broader creative strategy, there's going to be a greater understanding around the expressions of that.” 

But the lengthy layover has meant Laika has to get more aggressive in positioning “Wildwood” to audiences, even before the company has secured a distributor to release it (Burke said the company is in active discussions with several potential distributors for the film). Theatrical would seem to be the priority since four of their five of their films were released via Focus Features, while “Missing Link” was one of the last wide releases from Annapurna Pictures and United Artists Releasing.

Laika has re-evaluated its event strategy and consumer product strategy in the recent years. It's been working on brand affinity, deeper audience connections, and simple awareness for Laika's films with younger audiences.

The “Hidden Worlds” exhibit at Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture back in 2023 was one cog in that flywheel (it will move to the Academy Museum in December 2026 through September 2027), with Laika trotting out real puppets and sets for display. Other targeted TikTok marketing featuring making-of reels for films like “Coraline” and “The Boxtrolls” has been another. Burke says the success of the “Coraline” re-release is the product of several years of effort in terms of generating awareness and not an overnight surprise. And the door is open for re-releases of its other titles too. 

 










“We couldn't just kind of rely on traditional marketing strategies to lead the release of ‘Wildwood,” Burke said. “We had to be a little bit more intentional, a little bit more strategic and really take responsibility for growing the audience in house and put in place a number of strategic initiatives.”

Still, these movies need to make financial sense in a way that “Missing Link” didn't. Burke said the goal in this period has been to develop better workflows, adjust their process, bring in tech solutions, and become more efficient, all without sacrificing quality. He insists they're doing that even as Knight juggles numerous projects at once.

It's not just Laika that is navigating a tricky spot in animation. There's as much demand for kids and family films as ever, but just ask Pixar about the challenges of launching an original property in theaters these days. Even Netflix, which has seen huge numbers licensing Illumination movies, hasn't seen the same results with its original animation forays. 

So whether “Wildwood” and future Laika films make more sense for a streamer or in theaters, Laika is relying on “Wildwood” being the face of an exciting next chapter on the company's journey.

“What we're aiming to do is really eventize ‘Wildwood' as a destination film for not just Laika fans, not just animation fans, but audiences in general, and we feel we have something that is truly unique, that is of the culture,” Burke said. “There's something that's really resonating right now that feels right for Laika, and I would say that there's every confidence for us to deliver on an event animation film with ‘Wildwood.' ‘Coraline' underlines that we can mobilize our fans and animation fans, but we can also mobilize new audiences.”

A new book of Bob Dylan's artwork is set to be published later this year. The coffee table collection Point Blank (Quick Studies) features approximately 100 drawings from between 2021 and 2022, alongside “prose vignettes” courtesy of Eddie Gorodetsky, Jackie Hamilton, and Lucy Sante. Some of the pieces served as studies for paintings currently on display at London's Halcyon Gallery through Sunday, July 6, as part of an exhibition also called Point Blank. The book comes out Tuesday, November 18, via Simon & Schuster.

“This book showcases Bob Dylan's mastery of telling stories, creating moods and provoking feelings,” Sean Manning, a Simon & Schuster vice president and publisher, said in a press statement. “The images are deeply evocative, at once innocent and world-weary, joyous and forlorn, humorous and sensual, enigmatic and familiar. Dylan's ability to find beauty and mystery in the seemingly mundane is one of his great gifts—and the gift he's continually given to the public over the years, including now with Point Blank.”

In 2016, Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize in Literature. His 2022 essay collection, The Philosophy of Modern Song, became a New York Times bestseller, but spawned controversy when supposedly hand-signed copies of the book were revealed to contain replica autographs. November 18 will also see Simon & Schuster release an unabridged audiobook of 2004's Chronicles: Volume One, read by Sean Penn. Earlier this month, Dylan narrated the trailer for MGK's new album, Lost Americana.

Oklou has released a new remix EP to accompany her February album Choke Enough. Nick León, Malibu, Aaron Hibell, and Jamesjamesjames each contribute a remix. Hear them all below.

Hibell, who remixes “Take Me by the Hand” on the EP, said in a press release, “I've been a fan of Oklou for a while now, and when I heard her latest album, especially ‘Take Me by the Hand,' I was immediately drawn to the '90s and early 2000s trance influences woven through it. I wanted to really flip it into my own style, pushing further into that old school trance aesthetic but still feeling fresh and anthemic, that's been such a big part of my sound.”

Nick León, who is releasing his own album A Tropical Entropy this Friday, was an additional producer on Choke Enough track “Harvest Sky.” He takes on “Blade Bird.” Malibu and Jamesjamesjames both rework the album's title track.

Oklou will soon head out on a North American and European tour, including a date at Pitchfork Music Festival London.

June 25, 2025

Twenty years ago last month, Burial released his debut EP—and unleashed a ghost. The British producer's music, shot through with a sense of loss and veiled in vinyl crackle, epitomized a blurry set of ideas about nostalgia and otherworldliness that were bubbling up across a swath of experimental music. Soon, shepherded by critics Mark Fisher and Simon Reynolds, a new term had entered the lexicon: “hauntology.” Borrowed from French postmodernist philosopher Jacques Derrida's 1993 book Specters of Marx, hauntology, in Fisher's framing, hovers miasmically over a loose nexus of ideas around melancholy, technology, memory, and capitalism. Examining the work of a number of like-minded artists, including Burial, Philip Jeck, the Caretaker, and the figures behind the Ghost Box label, he later wrote: “Their work sounded ‘ghostly,' certainly, but the spectrality was not a mere question of atmospherics. What defined this ‘hauntological' confluence more than anything else was its confrontation with a cultural impasse: the failure of the future.”

As a description of ghostly affect and 21st-century disappointment, hauntology has been a largely British phenomenon—and, despite Fisher's philosophical intent, has often been invoked mainly to mean, “sounds spooky.” But for those who know where to look, Latin American electronic music has long buzzed with hauntological portent, and with good reason: With its overlapping histories of genocide, colonialism, dictatorship, migration, organized crime, thwarted utopia, and rapacious neoliberalism, Latin America knows a thing or two about failed futures. Numinous energy ripples through the wraithlike voices of Lucrecia Dalt's Anticlines, No era sólida, and ¡Ay!; it chills the blood in Debit's The Long Count, which used synthesis and machine learning to resuscitate the sounds of the ancient Maya; it rises like narcotic vapors from the plodding tempos of cumbia rebajada, born when a malfunctioning soundsystem began playing back the upbeat tropical style at a funereal pace and gravelly pitch. (“When you slow down the cumbia,” Nicolás Vallejo, whose work as Ezmeralda filters cumbia rebajada into an ambient haze, once explained, “the ghosts start to emerge.”)

Fantología I, released by the Quito, Ecuador, label +ambién, is framed as a Latin American response to the discourse around hauntology—a discourse that label heads Gregorio Hernández (DJ +1) and Daniel Lofredo (Quixosis) say has too often turned a blind eye to the Global South. The object of their scrutiny is “a very Latin American kind of uncertainty,” they write: “an ever-present ghost that shadows the region in the 21st century.” Where the Global North mourns “lost golden ages”—the sci-fi futurism of the 1960s, the renegade paradise of '80s rave—they instead “confront the specter of failed statehood, chronic instability, and the fading promise of futures that may never arrive. These tracks reflect on a society forever negotiating a compromised tomorrow—and discovering how to live, even love, within that tension.”

What immediately stands out is how varied the compilation is. With its well established set of signifiers, hauntological music can be easy to parody, but there's no color-by-numbers glumness here. The album opens with all the pregnant mystery of an orchestra tuning up: “Encuentros Invisibles,” by Dominican artist Alina Labour, teems with vibrant frequencies out of which a slow-moving bass melody gradually emerges, accompanied by rustles and sighs. Azulina—an alias of Buenos Aires' Chancha Vía Circuito (Pedro Pablo Canale)—builds on the anticipatory mood with “Tundra,” an atmospheric scene-setter in which breathy flutes hover like mist over a craggy landscape of clicking and crackling. But not all of Fantología I is expressly ambient in nature. Mexican composer Isaac Soto's “Volcanic House,” a highlight, abruptly shifts into a rhythmic mode, playing a tightly coiled drum groove against unsettling din, atonal violins, and eerily dubbed-out tendrils of synthesized sound—imagine Livity Sound or Hessle Audio possessed by poltergeists. Likewise, Quito's Quixosis and Quantum Juan fashion shimmery ambient techno out of digital bell tones and syncopated machine beats.

The range of moods is just as wide; Fantología I often feels as much like a conversation as a compilation. Denver-based Fuya Fuya and Quito resident Entrañas' “Tú Sé Tú” is a disorienting plunge into a dripping cavern of high-def sound design, like spelunking in THX. +ambién co-founder Gregorio +1 takes a similarly tactile approach to “Florecer,” smearing on FM chimes and foamy white noise. Buenos Aires' Minicomponente, on the other hand, explores ethereal pop music on “Nacimos para morir,” her singing turning increasingly dissonant over loping electronic beats and unsettling synths that stab and swirl. If Ezmeralda's “Los cielos” feels like an attempt to push music past the point of recognizability, drowning distant chords in a slurry of digital hiss, Guatemala's Alex Hentze all but does away with artifice on “El Viento lo Sabe,” sketching a contrapuntal synthesizer melody that could translate to virtually any acoustic instrument or ensemble without losing its essence.

The most invigorating tracks contain multitudes. Zen Liminal's “Pululahua,” a collaboration with Quito luthier Pablo Jacho, layers breathy flutes over rushing liquid and pulsing drones, at once calm and tensile—at rest, yet ready to pull apart at any moment. Dominican producer Boundary's muted synth etude “Waverider” is wistful but also playful, rejecting the self-seriousness of so much European hauntology. Lima, Peru's Orieta Chrem begins with earthy congas and pan flutes before building into a slow-moving, Drexciyan machine groove, blurring the line between the acoustic and the electronic. And Mexicali producer Siete Catorce, Ibarra-based Kichwa producer Mala Fama, and Bogotá's Colombian Drone Mafia all infuse their respective tracks—a grinding triplet groove, a maelstrom of streaks and trackers, and an ultra-vivid explosion of rainforest psychedelia—with manifold sounds and emotions that resist being pinned down. Even at their moodiest, Fantología I's contributors refuse to settle for the wistful resignation so often associated with northern hauntology. In their contradictions, these artists are seeding new futures.

	That great popping sound you may have heard ripple across New York City and beyond Tuesday night around 10:30 p.m., wasn't champagne. It was the sound of a thousand Republican heads exploding at the news that 67-year-old accused sex pest and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had conceded the Democratic mayoral primary to Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old Democratic Socialist who captured New Yorkers' imagination with his vision for a more affordable city. 


	During the primary, Mamdani spoke about his plans to make city buses fast and free, pointing to New York's fare-free Staten Island ferry as proof that it's possible. He talked about the mayor's discretion to select members of the Rent Guidelines Board, which sets the maximum allowable increase annually for rent-stabilized apartments. And he pointed to New York City's incredibly popular “3-K For All” program, created under Mayor Bill DeBlasio, as evidence that there is both the demand and power for the city to extend that program to provide universal child care for kids as young as six-weeks-old. 

	











	Democratic voters overwhelmingly backed Mamdani's candidacy on Tuesday — and Republicans are freaking out. Many a frothing xenophobe can't fathom the idea that Mamdani, a Muslim and a naturalized U.S. citizen who has lived in the United States since he was seven years old, has a pretty good shot of becoming mayor now. Famous Islamophobe and Donald Trump confidant Laura Loomer went on a tear after Cuomo's concession. “WHY DO WE NOT HAVE LAWS THAT SAY FOREIGNERS CANNOT HOLD OFFICE IN THE US??? WHAT THE HELL!?” she screeched.

	“There will be another 9/11 in NYC and @ZohranKMamdani will be to blame,” Loomer added. “Get ready for Muslims to start committing jihad all over New York.” Loomer is a 9/11 conspiracist who maintains a close relationship with Trump despite being viewed as a liability by some members of the president's inner circle.

	Following the Democratic primary on Tuesday, though, there was no daylight between Loomer's toxic rhetoric and the kind being spewed by more mainstream MAGA heads. Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA and a high-profile Trump supporter, posted, “24 years ago a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11. Now a Muslim Socialist is on pace to run New York City.” 


	“A foreign-born Muslim socialist just won the primary for New York City mayor,” Kirk's MAGA-world fellow traveler Jack Posobiec wrote. “Are we allowed to talk about mass immigration now?”


	Trump's Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called Mamdani a “anarchist-socialist,” and blamed his victory on “unchecked migration” that “fundamentally remade the NYC electorate.” (Non-citizens, it's worth noting, cannot vote in New York City elections.)


	It wasn't just the MAGA warriors melting down over Mamdani — the Republican old guard and their media allies are having a similar conniption. “SOS,” the front page of The New York Post blared. On Fox News, Mayor Eric Adams — who dropped out of the Democratic primary after the Trump administration dropped its prosecution against him, and who will run as an Independent against Mamdani in November — got an assist in bashing his rival from Fox and Friends. As the show's host recited Mamdani's (extremely popular!) campaign promises, like funding for affordable housing, free buses, and no-cost childcare, Adams hissed, “He's a snake oil salesman.”  


	“New York City's soul is rotting,” the conservative columnist John Podhoretz sniffed. “If we allow 9.1 percent of registered voters [to] determine the future of New York City, then we deserve the city that we are going to get,” posted billionaire hedge fund chief Bill Ackman, a Trump supporter who donated $500,000 to Cuomo's Super PAC.

	David Frum, the former George W. Bush speechwriter turned Atlantic editor, declared “Well, at least we can retire that faded and false line, ‘antisemitism has no place in New York City.'” 


	Throughout the primary, Mamdani was dogged by accusations of anti-semitism, despite the fact that he used those exact words — “antisemitism has no place in New York City” — repeatedly, and spoke movingly about his connection to Jewish New Yorkers and their reasonable concerns about rising antisemitism. He also courted support from Jewish New Yorkers, and cross-endorsed the highest-ranking Jewish official in the city, Comptroller Brad Lander.

	Nevertheless, on X, the Republican Jewish Coalition warned its supporters to “Evacuate NYC immediately.” Their call was signal boosted by the Zionist group Betar Worldwide. “We urge all Jews to evacuate NYC,” the Israel-based organization posted.


	Mamdani supporters, meanwhile, seem to be living for the cope. “If anyone's leaving NYC out of fears of sharia taking over please lmk I will buy your brownstone and live in it,” the leftist streamer Hasan Piker wrote.

	Readers of Sunday's New York Times were treated to an unusual full-page ad from a rival newspaper — the venerated satire periodical The Onion. Most of the available space was taken up by a mocking editorial piece with a headline that blared: “Congress, Now More Than Ever, Our Nation Needs Your Cowardice.” In a note at the bottom of the page, the company revealed that print copies of the op-ed were being delivered to the very lawmakers it ripped apart as complacent do-nothings under an increasingly authoritarian Donald Trump. 


	And, just by wild coincidence, the stunt came right as the administration barreled ahead with the bombing of Iran, a destabilizing and politically unpopular action that for many Americans recalled the preludes to other catastrophic wars the U.S. has initiated in the Middle East. Whether Congress can successfully challenge Trump's unilateral show of military force — something it is technically obliged to do under the Constitution — remains to be seen. But the smart money is almost always on The Onion‘s prescient cynicism.

	











	Here, Ben Collins, who has served as CEO of the 37-year-old publication since it changed owners in April 2024, talks about why the staff decided to make a bold statement in the Gray Lady, the success of their relaunched print model, an ongoing legal battle with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and how The Onion‘s writers stay one step ahead of a surreal new normal.

So, this New York Times op-ed. Can you tell me how that came together, and why this was the moment for it?[The writing staff] have been sitting around looking at the failure of the legislative branch, which I thought was a co-equal branch of our government, but I guess it isn't. We're learning a lot of new stuff all the time. And they really wanted to go for it. The only note that I give them is just, if you are ready to go for it, let's go for it as hard as we can. So we reached out to the New York Times for editorial space. We didn't even know what we were going to put in there yet, necessarily, months ago. I just wanted them to have the ability to do something in that space. And they came up with that headline, and they were like, it's time. They also came up with the idea to mail that headline to Congress. I don't know who was in the room, but somebody on editorial staff was like, why don't we just make this all one thing, let's mail it to Congress, publish it as a full page of the New York Times, and make it a big hairy deal. We're hitting the gas pedal here, and think it's working. Hopefully they should be showing up in the mailboxes of every single congressperson.

What kind of a reaction are you expecting?I have no idea! The thing that The Onion does best is it creates, in my opinion, some catharsis. It [allows] people without the full vocabulary for the moment to create a complete sentence for themselves. It allows them to put up a protest sign. We wanted people to understand that they are not alone in feeling particularly helpless in this moment. And we want Congress to understand that maybe they could fucking do something at some point in any capacity about the litany of horrors that we have been subjected to in the last six months.


It's also fun to do it in the in the New York Times, since their editorial section has advocated for some questionable things over the decades.Yeah, I mean, we're right back in 2003. The timing is crazy in terms of the the the Iran bombing — I almost called it Iraq, because the language and the op-eds are the same as when I was growing up. I read a David Shields book called War Is Beautiful, it's a collection of New York Times photos of Iraq and Afghanistan where they made war look like this beautiful Disneyfied fireworks display, and that's not what it is. War is fucking brutal and horrible and evil. And it does feel like we're back in this mode where completely disconnected elites are killing people for sadomasochistic enjoyment. I grew up with this, and so did The Onion. This is where The Onion is at its at its best, when they are fully lined up against what is very clearly “The Man,” and the machine is in full swing, from cable news to the Times op-ed page to the government itself, with every Republican in Congress and some Democrats [embracing] the idea that if we just annihilate some of these people, there will be no consequences. We've been through this before. During the Iraq War, The Onion was one of the only places to stand up against it. It was just, like, The Onion and the fucking Dixie Chicks, and now we're right back in that moment. Thankfully, I think more people can smell that this reeks and are not buying the party line of lobbyists that appear in the mainstream news saying that this will end all of our problems in the Middle East. We're just doing what we did 20 years ago.


It's been a little over a year since the leadership shakeup at The Onion. What have you learned in that time, and are you feeling a sense of accomplishment a year later?Things have dramatically changed in the media landscape, and the fact that we're important and viewed as truth-tellers is an incredible indictment of the rest of the press. It's insane. I will say I am so deeply proud of the independent journalists out there that have stepped up and have a lot to lose in the face of harassment campaigns and lawfare and the immense power against them — they've done some of the best work ever. That's why we gave the scoop to Marisa Kabas at The Handbasket, she is just one of many people in independent media right now who are doing some of the best and most unafraid journalism I've seen in my lifetime. What we've seen is people who have told the truth and not kowtowed and not just bent over for this administration, or tried to meet halfway on fascism. Those are the places that have done really well. We've gone all in on speaking the truth, despite how dangerous it is now — the truth is incredibly absurd, so it just happens to line up very nicely with our business model. But yeah, it's been both horrible and horrific and and heartening to see that our work is more important than ever. And, you know, I would guess that by the end of the year, we're going to be one of the biggest newspapers in the country by distribution. We ship this paper to all 50 states and over 50 countries. I'm proud of the people who work here because they stood up a newspaper in a three months and have only made it bigger and better and sharper and more incisive.

	











A lot of people would look around at the state of the world and say it's beyond parody or satire. How do your writers think about that and face that challenge?That's a question that we get a lot, and I think that it just shows how hard this is and that you need professionals. What we do is incredibly inefficient, and it's art, and it's hard, and that's what makes us great. We throw away like 150 headlines a day. That's not an exaggeration. Every day, they go in there, they write usually over 150 headlines, and they whittle them down to two or three. Sometimes it's zero. Sometimes nothing comes out of that. And then they they decide, like, is this a video? Is something we grab as a NIB, which stands for “news in brief.” Where does this live in the Onion universe, basically. And then from there, they build out the joke. It's surgery every single time on each verb and and article and everything. It's just a tremendous amount of work. If Sam Altman or whoever came in here and took over this company, it would be fucking obliterated instantly. Because it's an old-fashioned machine that we have that works really well. We have 40 years of institutional knowledge here. The thing that I've come to realize is there's a math and a science and art to this. I think most people feel that satire is like, turn everything up to 2x speed or just do the inverse or something. I think what The Onion does is like 1.25x speed. It allows you to see into some funhouse future. And it just allows [the writers] to cook a lot easier. They don't overdo it. And by doing that, it kind of like keeps it within the bounds of reality, but in a way that is both funny and biting.


There's a strong tradition there, but in this last year, we've seen some big swings that we wouldn't have seen from the old Onion. I realize it didn't quite work, but are we going to see more stuff like the attempted acquisition of Infowars out of bankruptcy?We're still working on that, brother. As I've said, Alex Jones is the Michael Jordan of evading justice. He's gummed up the work so substantially in every way, and scared every judge and every person that he can intimidate. So we're still trying to get through it, and we are confident we'll end up with it by the end of the day, but I don't know when the end of that day is, so we're still fighting. But yes, expect us in weird places. We constantly want to show up, saying the sentence that everybody's thinking but can't say in public right now. We have this incredible market advantage of not being beholden to anybody right now. And it's great for our bottom line. What I'm trying to say is, we're going to be rich. It's a gold mine for us, baby! Expect us to do both the right and the funny thing in incredibly surprising and weird ways in the next few months and hopefully years. We have a bunch of stuff lined up that will hopefully get people off their couch a little bit. We want to be able to say stuff that other people, for institutional reasons, can't say, or they're too afraid to say.

	











You may be the only CEO in America making that promise.We're in a unique position, certainly. And other places have to learn from this — being afraid all the time and just constantly making transactional moves. How long can you survive like this? What is even the point of being alive if you're just gonna continue managing rot? And it seems like that's what 98 percent of people are doing in these media companies right now. I don't know, take a chance. Nobody likes what's happening. Especially if you're a journalism company or a media company, you're [meant to be] actually reflecting what people want or what people believe. So get some guts and do something interesting. It's not that hard.


So that's your advice to Jeff Bezos?Him, no, he shouldn't. He should not do anything ever again. He should just stop whatever he's doing. [Those] people who have gotten us to a very bad spot should go take their boats into the ocean and do sea-steading or whatever they keep saying they're going to do. Go light fireworks in the ocean and look at them for the rest of your lives, just be happy. Go away from us, please.


I have an ethics question. Your partner, Kat Abughazaleh, is running for Congress in Illinois. I was just wondering if you'll abuse your power to endorse her through the through the paper of record.I've been threatening all of everyone in Illinois with personal punishment if they don't say that she's the coolest person who's ever lived. I'm extremely rich. What I do is I drive my Lamborghini to everyone's house and I just berate them at their doorstep. So that's my plan. If you haven't been berated yet by me at your doorstep, or had me shouting at you from the Lamborghini, then, frankly, I haven't done my job. She's fucking great. I'm proud of her. She's doing so good. And yeah, the second that we get into internecine local politics at The Onion is the second that we've lost the plot.


Though it is a Chicago paper, after all.It is a Chicago paper. That's correct. I'm assuming we've done some Chicago stuff, right? I'm actually gonna look it up. I don't really know, but let me see if we did, like, a Rod Blagojevich story. Oh, these are fucking ancient. Let's see. “Rod Blagojevich Trying To Sell Presidential Commutation to Cellmate For $2.8 Million.” Pretty good. So, yeah, there is Illinois politics in general. But no, that whole thing is very strange, because I've never been around actual politics, so to hear it in the other room when I wake up every day — she spends every day just like, pounding on doors and shaking hands. And it's very different lifestyle, certainly.

It seems in the nature of The Onion that it's going to take rotten people down a notch rather than elevate good politics. But then you had this idea to put up information about gun violence on the Infowars site. Is there room for earnestness at The Onion, where it's not just sarcasm? I don't actually think so. I think there are words and there are actions. You can do good deeds with your actions, but in terms of the words that we put out on a day-to-day basis, we are going to remain stupid as fuck and silly, and we're going to try as hard as we can to get to the to the meat of stuff by not telling the truth. That is what The Onion is, writ large. We will obviously do stuff too, we will do whatever we can to make the world better. Hopefully, you'll see that in the next few months, as we kind of grow and build on top of this weird little newspaper empire established in a year. But we don't let anybody get in the way of the actual writing or the editorial or the videos they make, or anything like that. That stuff is sacrosanct, and if we can do some good on the side as a means of getting that writing in front of more people, even better. Good stories are kind of against the law right now. We want to show up in places and make people believe that good things are possible and that you're not going nuts, that things are actually quite exactly as bad as you think they are. And here's, like, a very short sentence that will allow you to think about the world through that construct. That's the whole goal here, man.

	A land grab in President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” — which would put 250 million acres of public lands at risk of being auctioned to the highest bidder — has been judged out of bounds by the Senate's in-house rulekeeper.Trump's lard-the-rich legislation is being pushed through Congress as a “reconciliation” bill, which means it is not subject to the Senate filibuster and only needs a simple majority to pass. But such budget legislation must adhere to the “Byrd rule,” which bars extraneous provisions from being tacked on. On Monday evening, the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the privatization of nearly 3 million acres of treasured, wild spaces did not clear that bar.Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee is the chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and the architect of the provision requiring “mandatory disposal” of the public's property. Lee is an ideological foe of public lands. He proclaimed in a February post on X that “the U.S. government should never be the largest landowner in America.” He argued the feds should only “keep the national parks,” its “military bases,” and “maybe some of the most historically and environmentally sensitive properties.” It should then, Lee insisted, “sell the rest — not all at once, but steadily.”


	Lee is an extremist even in his own party. And his provision faced fierce opposition from environmental groups, top Democrats, a former Trump Interior Secretary, and even the Republican senators from Idaho, where more than 20 million acres were at risk. (Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch put out nearly identical statements over the weekend saying they “do not support” the provision to “sell public lands.”)Despite the political and parliamentary blowback, Lee is not giving up. In a post on X Tuesday, he wrote that he is “doing everything I can to support President Trump and move this forward.” He wrote that his next version of the bill will take steps to protect “farmers, ranchers, and recreational users.” Lee would take all Forest Service land out of the mix, limiting the selloff to Bureau of Land Management lands, and only those properties within 5 miles of “population centers.” Doing a second-rate Trump impression with all-caps, Lee vowed to establish “FREEDOM ZONES” to “ensure that these lands benefit AMERICAN FAMILIES,” asserting that the move would address “crushing” housing prices. “Stay tuned,” he wrote. “We're just getting started.”


	To better understand the state of play regarding Lee's contentious proposal, Rolling Stone reached out to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who used to chair Lee's committee. Nearly half of the land in Wyden's home state of Oregon is owned by the federal government, with the BLM managing nearly all of the southeast quadrant of the state, bordered by Nevada and Idaho.In addition to being a longtime champion of public lands, Wyden is currently the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee where he is seeking to blunt the Big Beautiful Bill's giveaways to the “gazillionaires.”

	Just last weekend I had four town hall meetings in the state, open to everybody. Three were in places where Donald Trump got 70 percent or more — Ontario, La Grande, and Baker City. In these bright-red communities, there was very substantial opposition to the question of selling off public lands. 


	They're alarmed about what privatizing lands means for drinking water and the air. They're worried about big developers coming in and destroying the lands that they enjoy — for hunting, fishing, camping and more. And they're worried about what it means for rural jobs that are supported by public lands. 


	This is in our DNA. The reality is, when the federal government owns much of your state, you feel strongly about treasures that are emblematic of what's important to you. Protecting public lands is in Oregon's DNA.

What does Monday night's procedural ruling mean?


	What the parliamentarian did was to strike Lee's proposal. So, boom, struck. But Lee has come back already with something that basically keeps the BLM aspects of this, because he thinks that'll be easier than the [selloff of land managed by the] Forest Service. 


	He wants to make it near the population areas. But that makes the people in populated areas close to recreation particularly vulnerable. As far as I'm concerned, this is at least as bad as the earlier version, and potentially worse, because it'll affect bigger groups. More people, close to population centers. Prescription for trouble.By the way, this is also an invitation to extremists to set up camp in rural areas. 


How so? Connect the dots for me. 


	Because there are no ground rules. If you're one of these extremist outfits and you want to get outside any kind of government accountability and scrutiny and oversight, this is your opportunity.


So the danger is that it's not just the BlackRocks, the private equity funds, or the golf resort developers that might get in on the land grab, but you could have extremists looking to set up an encampment?












	That's what I asked about this weekend. I mentioned big economic interests and hedge funds and all that. But I said, “How many of you remember the Rajneeshees?”


You're referring to the dangerous cult that infamously made a compound in rural Oregon in the 1980s.


	There's no limits on those kind of people.To your broader point, there doesn't seem to be any process spelled out by Lee. A lot seems to depend on how connected you are to the Interior Secretary or Trump's Cabinet.


	It's made for interest groups who want to hot-wire the process. None of this is backed up by accountability. What really makes this a political farce is that Montana is excepted. How'd they get a free ride? They went to Trump early on. There's been connections with a lot of those [Montana] folks and the Trumps. And they got it, right?


Do you see Lee as committed to this privatization effort?This didn't come to him in the last couple of months. I was chairman of the committee, so I know the members. This has been his position for years. What's different here is that he thinks he's got an executive branch that'll help him.


Lee is talking about “FREEDOM ZONES” to benefit “AMERICAN FAMILIES.” Is it your sense that that means the freedom for rich folks to buy lakeside chalets?


	There's been repeated claims that selling off public lands will address America's housing affordability crisis. We need more affordable housing. But you aren't going to get that by helping the people at the very top get even wealthier, while the poor get poorer. 


	Nothing in this bill does anything to ensure that there's going to be affordable housing for people of more-modest means. But you can be sure that the people who are going to benefit are the wealthiest Americans who can find a new luxury vacation home. 


Norms are flying out the window. Do you expect that the Republicans are going to honor the parliamentarian's rulings on this? 


	I hope so. We'll have to see. The Republican Senate proposals are consistently about giving people at the top more benefits. What I want as the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee is to give everybody in America the chance to get ahead. 


	We have two tax codes in America. The firefighter pays taxes with every paycheck. If you're a gazillionaire you can pay what you want, when you want to. The [Trump] bill starts with the fact that the rate [cuts] are for the multi-millionaires and the billionaires. That's paid for by cutting [services for] people in modest means.

Final thoughts about the land grab?


	This is particularly important to Westerners. I want to protect our treasures. I want people to be able to make a living. I was chairman of the committee. I know from 1,100 open-to-all town hall meetings [that I've done in the state], this is personal. This is deeply felt. This is what Oregon and Western-land states are all about. What are we gonna say, when people bring up these policies? “No way.” Not complicated. “No. Way.”

	Hours after prosecutors rested their sprawling sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy case against Sean Combs on Tuesday, prosecutors filed a late-night letter to the court saying they would no longer be pursuing theories that the Bad Boy Records founder was involved in attempted arson, attempted kidnapping, and aiding and abetting sex trafficking.


	The alleged acts were listed in Combs' indictment under Count One, his racketeering conspiracy charge. Prosecutors listed arson and kidnapping as predicate acts that included both substantive and “attempted” acts.


	“The Government is no longer planning to proceed on these theories of liability, so instructions are no longer necessary,” prosecutors wrote in their letter to U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian.


	The alleged racketeering conspiracy count still alleges Combs and his co-conspirators engaged in other predicate acts including bribery, witness tampering, forced labor, and drug offenses.


	And Combs is still facing separate counts of sex trafficking his ex-girlfriends Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and a woman using the pseudonym Jane, as well as two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly paying for male escorts to fly across the country to have sex with his girlfriends while he watched.

	











	The 55-year-old, who seemed to be in good spirits in the final days of his trial, has pleaded not guilty to all charges.


	To Mark Chutkow, a former federal prosecutor in Detroit who specialized in racketeering and human trafficking cases, prosecutors streamlining aspects of the predicate acts when giving charging instructions to the jury serves two purposes: minimizing confusion and warding off a possible defense strategy of accusing the government of overreaching. 

	











	“I wouldn't see that as a victory for [Combs] per se,” Chutkow, now a trial attorney at Dykema Gossett, tells Rolling Stone. “That's just something that happens in large, complex cases where you want to make sure that the jury doesn't get confused.”

	“The judge is clearly concerned about jury confusion, but the prosecution should be too because confusion is an advantage to the defense,” Chutkow adds. “The prosecution wants the cleanest case that they can present to the jury, so that there aren't a lot of disputes and arguments there.” 


	The alleged kidnapping of former Combs assistant Capricorn Clark in 2004 marks the start of the government's racketeering conspiracy count against Combs. Clark testified that Combs accused her of stealing diamond jewelry and had a security guard ransack her apartment looking for the items. After the guard found nothing, Clark said she was escorted to a locked, dilapidated office building in midtown where an unknown man administered five consecutive days of lie-detector tests. “He said if you fail these tests, they're going to throw you in the East River,” Clark testified.


	Years later, in December 2011, Clark said she was in Los Angeles working for Combs when he arrived at her apartment. Livid and allegedly toting a gun, Combs had just come from a freak-off with Ventura and discovered the R&B singer was dating rapper Kid Cudi (real name Scott Mescudi). “Get dressed; we're going to go kill that n—a,” Combs allegedly said. Clark said she was terrified, but when she tried to protest, Combs told her, “I don't give a fuck what you want to do.” 


	Clark claimed that as she rode in Combs' SUV with his driver over to Mescudi's Hollywood Hills home, the gun was visible in Combs' lap. She said she stayed in the car as Combs roamed around Mescudi's house, making a panicked call to Ventura when he wasn't looking.

	Weeks later, in January 2012, Mescudi testified that after rebuffing Combs' attempts to talk about his fling with Ventura, he received a call that his Porsche had been fire-bombed. A hole was cut into the roof, and a Molotov cocktail had been dropped into the driver's seat of the luxury vehicle, charring the car's interior and destroying the car. Ventura testified that Combs had earlier threatened to explode Mescudi's car in his driveway, and Mescudi said he suspected Combs had something to do with the arson attempt.


	The third alleged kidnapping incident occurred in January 2009, stemming from Combs allegedly stomping on Ventura's face in the back of a car after a night out. “I never experienced anything like that before where I was getting really, really badly beaten,” Ventura testified. 

	











	Afterward, Ventura said Combs' security members had to “sneak” her into a hotel, where she stayed for a week as her injuries healed. Although Ventura said she told Combs that she wanted to leave, Combs allegedly refused. “I don't think I would have gotten out of there smoothly,” Ventura explained when questioned why she didn't just leave the hotel by herself. “It was not safe. I didn't have just the resources I need[ed] to get out and move and not have anybody stop me,” she said. 


	The government's letter followed hours after prosecutors rested their case, which spanned six weeks and included tearful testimony from many of the trial's 34 witnesses.

	On Tuesday, Shapiro argued there was especially “thin proof” that Combs' employees had “knowingly participated in crimes with or for Mr. Combs” other than picking up “personal” quantities of drugs. When it came to freak-offs, where the alleged sex trafficking took place, Shapiro claimed Combs and his girlfriends went out of their way to hide the details of Combs' personal sex life from his staffers, booking male escorts themselves. 


	“The assistants set up and cleaned hotel rooms, but they didn't know much, if anything, about what went on between Mr. Combs and his girlfriends in the hotel rooms, other than they used a lot of baby oil and Astroglide and drank alcohol and perhaps used drugs,” Shapiro said.

He Won'","https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/zohran-cuomo-concedes-new-york-city-mayor-primary-democrats-1235371489/","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 03:32:51 GMT","

	The early results of the Democratic primary are mostly in, and disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo is trailing dreamboat Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani by seven points. And while it doesn't look like either candidate will clinch a majority of the vote before the Ranked Choice Voting elimination rounds begin, it's basically a wrap: Mr. Cardamom is poised to clinch the Democratic nomination for mayor in the largest city in America. 


	Shortly after 10:30 p.m., Cuomo took the stage at his election night party and told supporters he'd called Mamdani to congratulate him on his primary victory. He praised Mamdani's “really smart, and good, and impactful campaign.”


	“Tonight was not our night,” Cuomo said. “Tonight was Assemblyman Mamdani's night…. He deserved it. He won.” 


	Speaking with The New York Times after that, Cuomo said, “I said he won the primary election.” He said he intends to “look at the numbers,” and make a decision about running on an independent line. Cuomo has already filed paperwork to form his own party — The Fight and Deliver Party — and could run in the general election if he wants. 

	











	Cuomo's loss was also a rebuke — a further humiliation — for establishment Democrats. Cuomo was endorsed by South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the man who famously helped revive Joe Biden's flagging candidacy in 2020, and former President Bill Clinton. (Cuomo served in his Cabinet.) 


	It is a stunning upset by Mamdani, a 33-year-old third-term New York state assembly member representing Queens, who based his campaign on economic concerns, promising a rent freeze for some 2 million rent-stabilized apartments, free city buses, universal child care, and city-owned grocery stores.

	Official results will become available in a week, when the Board of Elections accepts its last mail-in ballots. Mamdani is the clear favorite, but others remain in the race, including some candidates who cross-endorsed with him, like Brad Lander, the New York City Comptroller, who stands in third place. 


	Lander celebrated Cuomo's bad fortune at his own election night party. “Andrew Cuomo is in the past. He is not the present or future of New York City,” he said. “Good fucking riddance.”

Anyone see anything they can't explain? A resident living in New York's upper Hudson Valley reported a strange site flying in the sky late Saturday night. The person who filed the report even says the object was traveling through the clouds at a hypersonic rate of speed.

The sighting once again raises the question if the source is some sort of unidentified flying object, or simply something like miliary aircraft, or naturally occurring phenomena?

New York has a long history with unidentified flying objects, as the state ranks 5th overall for sightings across the United States. It's no secret New York, particularly the state's Hudson Valley area, has a long history with unexplained flying phenomena and other strange sightings.

As stated many times, these observations of so-called UFOs can easily be explained as drones, military planes, communication satellites, or even a meteor burning up in the upper atmosphere, though.

A resident living in Climax, New York reported to the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting center that they witnessed an object traveling at a hypersonic rate of speed the night of June 21. The report describes what they allegedly saw as ""orbs seen through cloud cover at incredible speeds.""

The witness say that for about an hour they saw two white orbs ""through thick cloud cover"", flying across the sky at an extremely fast rate of speed. The person say that this would continue every 5 to 10 minutes for roughly around an hour that night.

The report says that the person witnessed ""the orb start as one"", and then ""split off and make a U-turn"" through the sky.

ILLINOIS — Whether you're a believer or skeptic, World UFO Day on July 2 is an occasion to ponder unexplained phenomena seen over the skies of Illinois over several decades.

World UFO Day 2025 commemorates the 78th anniversary of what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers.” It started with the first widely publicized U.S. sighting of an unidentified flying object by a civilian pilot searching the Cascade Mountains of Washington for a crashed military aircraft, followed by the crash of a mysterious object near Roswell, New Mexico, on July 2, 1947. 

Together, those incidents more or less made it safe for Americans to talk about strange occurrences in the sky. 

The National UFO Reporting Center takes thousands of reports a year from people who can't explain what they're seeing, whether a bright light, a peculiarly shaped object, or an aircraft that rapidly accelerates and decelerates just as quickly, seemingly exceeding current understanding of propulsion.

Sightings In Illinois 

This year alone, 34 reports have been made about strange sightings in the skies over Illinois. Some examples:

‘Summer Of The Flying Saucers'

On June 24, 1947, civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier, Washington, when he saw nine crescent-shaped objects flying in formation at about 10,000 feet at about a nearly impossible speed for the times of 1,200 to 1,700 mph.

It wasn't the first sighting of a UFO, but the public quickly became fascinated — and slightly terrified — after Arnold's sighting was reported worldwide. News coverage often included references to a “flying saucer,” a play on Arnold's statement that the object moved “like a saucer would if you skipped it over water.”

More reports followed during what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers,” including the Roswell incident. The Roswell Army Air Field announced in a July 8, 1947, news release that it had recovered the wreckage of a “flying disc” from W.W. “Mac” Brazel's ranch about 75 miles north of Roswell. 

The release was straightforward, noting:

“The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's office of Chaves County.

“The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff's office, who in turn notified Major Jesse A Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office.

“Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher's home. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters.”

The Roswell Army Air Field mentioned nothing in its press release about alien life, but people were already growing uneasy about what might be circling overhead. Brazel was among them. 

He thought the object he found on his ranch was similar to what Arnold had seen, or to the objects described in stories about flying saucers and discs, so he gathered some of the material from the wreckage, including rubber strips, tinfoil and thick paper, and deposited them with Sheriff George Wilcox, who in turn turned it over to the commanding officer of the Roswell Army Air Field.

Military Said It Was Mistaken

Within 24 hours of the original press release, the military backtracked and said a mistake had been made and the “flying disc” was in reality a crashed weather balloon.

The story was widely accepted, and the Roswell incident might have become a forgotten chapter in history if not for a 1978 conversation between physicist and ufologist Stanton T. Friedman and Marcel, by then retired, according to an account in BBC's Sky At Night Magazine.

Marcel said the weather balloon story had been a cover, the photos had been staged, weather balloon debris had been substituted for the real wreckage, and that everyone involved in the retrieval believed it to be an extraterrestrial craft. The story was corroborated by a number of other retired military personnel who had been at Roswell at the time.

Some skeptics dismissed it as a tall tale, saying Marcel and others were seeking attention or writing themselves into the story. Regardless, Roswell became embedded in pop culture books, documentaries and movies.

One story that captured the attention of conspiracy theorists was that the wreckage had been seized by the military to reverse-engineer an extraterrestrial flight at Area 51 — a highly classified Air Force military installation in the Nevada desert primarily known for its role in developing and testing experimental aircraft and weapons systems. And a fake film clip purported to show “an alien autopsy” connected to Roswell.

Bowing to public pressure about the incident in the 1990s, the government launched a retrospective investigation that concluded the object that crashed was a Project Mogul weather balloon carrying top-secret equipment designed to search the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests.

A Government-Fueled Conspiracy?

2025 brings an interesting new twist to the story. 

According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal published on June 6, the government fueled the UFO conspiracy theories, especially during the Cold War, to hide its true mission at Area 51. Specifically, the Pentagon wanted to conceal the development of advanced aircraft, such as the otherworldly-looking F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, according to the report.

The disinformation campaign was uncovered by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, established by the Pentagon in 2022, to investigate UAP reports. A report last year dismissed the notion that the government covered up the existence of extraterrestrial life But, The Journal reported, “public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.”

As an investigation of the possibility of deliberate misinformation to hide secret programs continues, the government continues to take UAP and other unexplained phenomena seriously, The Associated Press reported.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- In a speculative corner of the ETF world, artificial intelligence is fast becoming yesterday's trade. Instead, the next disruptive bet on humanity's fate is moving into the realm of science fiction: Humanoid robots, UFOs and quantum computing.

To a niche band of opportunistic fund managers, these aren't far-flung fantasies — they're frontier investments for risk-loving tech maximalists and beyond.

Robots that help cook and clean. Quantum computers powerful enough to crack modern encryption. Secretive defense contractors building out technologies inspired by extraterrestrial life forms. Over the past few months, issuers including Roundhill Investments, KraneShares and Themes have designed products aiming to capture these out-of-this-world ideas — betting investors will buy the story before the science well and truly arrives.

It's the kind of thematic-investing pitch popularized by Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management — which also touts the humanoid sector — in the pandemic: Bold claims, long timelines, uncertain payoffs. Only this time round, there are even fewer corporate-earning stories, industry benchmarks or valuation models to anchor the trade. Yet with the AI story now firmly embedded into mainstream portfolios, issuers are looking for first-mover advantages to market the next novel tech story.

“ETF issuers are always looking for the next frontier. Themes evolve quickly, AI was a hit, but the space is now crowded with products. The race is on to discover the next big idea,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Some may sound far-fetched today, but we've said that before about themes that are now hits. What seems niche now could be a success tomorrow.”

Among the most eye-catching is the humanoid sector, which Morgan Stanley sees ballooning into a $5 trillion market by 2050. In early June, KraneShares launched KOID — a fund targeting companies behind people-like robots. Roundhill, meanwhile, is preparing a competing humanoid ETF.

Dave Mazza, the CEO of Roundhill, is behind that actively managed fund, which is set to launch on Thursday under the ticker HUMN with a focus solely on the companies designing and building humanoids. He sees the theme playing out as early as the next six months, as advances in AI and robotics converge. Elon Musk, for one, expects thousands of Optimus bots in Tesla Inc. factories by year-end.

“Humanoids aren't flying cars or quantum computing. In China, these robots are already in market and will be coming to market in the US in the near future.” said Mazza. “This ETF offers investors dedicated access to a theme that's playing out today, not tomorrow.”

Derek Yan, senior KraneShares investment strategist, says household-name companies like Tesla and Nvidia Corp. are already in the mix, and are planning to deploy billions of dollars into humanoid tech for use in hospitals, factories, elder care and more. Newer, often international players, like South Korea-based Rainbow Robotics and Japan-based Nidec Corp., as well as private entrants like China–based Unitree, are also joining the race.

KOID tracks a rules-based index. Yan's team started its stock-picking search for the fund by sifting through a wider universe to filter down to companies in three main areas of interest: the “brain”; the “body,” which includes humanoid component suppliers; and the “integrators,” or companies commercializing full humanoid robotics. The fund's largest holdings include Jabil Inc., Lynas Rare Earths Ltd., Amphenol Corp. and Melexis NV, though Nvidia and Tesla also round out the list.

“As Physical AI models continue to break through, we're approaching a ‘GPT moment' for humanoids,” said Yan. “It's the next big thing after generative AI.”

Space Age

Quantum computing is a functioning — albeit nascent — sector, with a Defiance product, QTUM, already pulling in more than $600 million in flows this year amid an 11% rally. But other strategies are anchored in pure conjecture. Matt Tuttle, for one, is angling to bring UFOD — a UFO-themed ETF powered by AI — to market, built on speculation that alien tech may be hiding in defense-contractor R&D labs.

For ETF issuers, filing early isn't just a product decision; it's a first-mover narrative play. Some retail traders are responding. Thematic-ETF flows and assets under management have been picking up in recent weeks as investors look for exposure to new ideas and as portfolio diversifiers, according to Todd Sohn at Strategas.

Critics argue that some of these investment areas are yet undeveloped and might not catch on with investors. Even many AI funds, of which there are more than 40, according to Bloomberg data, are having a difficult time attracting cash.

“At the end of the day, it strikes me as a very, very narrow niche to try to capitalize on,” Dave Nadig, an ETF industry veteran, said of the humanoid sector.

But for early adopters of imagined realities, that's beside the point for now. In a saturated market, they offer something scarcer than market returns or fundamentals: a story to believe in.

Issuers, moving at rapid-fire pace to ride newfangled ideas, have another incentive: standing out from the crowd. The $11 trillion ETF landscape remains ever-competitive in the US, now flooded with more than 4,200 products.

At Lazard, a $235 billion asset manager, Sarj Nahal runs a megatrends ETF that trades under the ticker THMZ. He has identified a number of investment themes for the fund, including software apps and agents, data and AI, and future health, among others. The fund, up 20% since April, holds global names like Siemens AG and EssilorLuxottica SA.

“This is very much about the issues that are going to be on the table three to five years from now,” Nahal said in an interview. “We don't want to be investing in what's on page one of the newspaper — what we're trying to spot is those issues and those structural drivers or data points that are coming from the companies that we're talking to that are currently on section C, page 32 but that are slowly moving their way to the front of the newspaper.”

Cautionary Tale

Still, the metaverse — a pandemic-era supertrend — offers a cautionary tale. It promised an immersive virtual future and drew in some of the world's biggest brands. Facebook even changed its name to Meta Platforms Inc. to stake its claim. But the hype unraveled just as fast. In 2023, at least two ETFs based on the metaverse ended up closing. Today, the term barely registers in earnings calls or investor decks. Other themes have also fizzled: marijuana and psychedelics ETFs failed to gain traction.

“Investing in unconventional technology themes can offer early exposure to disruptive trends — ideally, this would be similar to investing in the internet or digital assets in their early stages,” said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at ETF shop TMX VettaFi. “But very few themes have that level of success and some never fully materialize.”

World UFO Day 2025 commemorates the 78th anniversary of what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers.” It started with the first widely publicized U.S. sighting of an unidentified flying object by a civilian pilot searching the Cascade Mountains of Washington for a crashed military aircraft, followed by the crash of a mysterious object near Roswell, New Mexico, on July 2, 1947. 

Together, those incidents more or less made it safe for Americans to talk about strange occurrences in the sky. 

The National UFO Reporting Center takes thousands of reports a year from people who can't explain what they're seeing, whether a bright light, a peculiarly shaped object, or an aircraft that rapidly accelerates and decelerates just as quickly, seemingly exceeding current understanding of propulsion.

Sightings In Illinois 

This year alone, 34 reports have been made about strange sightings in the skies over Illinois. Some examples:

‘Summer Of The Flying Saucers'

On June 24, 1947, civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier, Washington, when he saw nine crescent-shaped objects flying in formation at about 10,000 feet at about a nearly impossible speed for the times of 1,200 to 1,700 mph.

It wasn't the first sighting of a UFO, but the public quickly became fascinated — and slightly terrified — after Arnold's sighting was reported worldwide. News coverage often included references to a “flying saucer,” a play on Arnold's statement that the object moved “like a saucer would if you skipped it over water.”

More reports followed during what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers,” including the Roswell incident. The Roswell Army Air Field announced in a July 8, 1947, news release that it had recovered the wreckage of a “flying disc” from W.W. “Mac” Brazel's ranch about 75 miles north of Roswell. 

The release was straightforward, noting:

“The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's office of Chaves County.

“The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff's office, who in turn notified Major Jesse A Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office.

“Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher's home. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters.”

The Roswell Army Air Field mentioned nothing in its press release about alien life, but people were already growing uneasy about what might be circling overhead. Brazel was among them. 

He thought the object he found on his ranch was similar to what Arnold had seen, or to the objects described in stories about flying saucers and discs, so he gathered some of the material from the wreckage, including rubber strips, tinfoil and thick paper, and deposited them with Sheriff George Wilcox, who in turn turned it over to the commanding officer of the Roswell Army Air Field.

Military Said It Was Mistaken

Within 24 hours of the original press release, the military backtracked and said a mistake had been made and the “flying disc” was in reality a crashed weather balloon.

The story was widely accepted, and the Roswell incident might have become a forgotten chapter in history if not for a 1978 conversation between physicist and ufologist Stanton T. Friedman and Marcel, by then retired, according to an account in BBC's Sky At Night Magazine.

Marcel said the weather balloon story had been a cover, the photos had been staged, weather balloon debris had been substituted for the real wreckage, and that everyone involved in the retrieval believed it to be an extraterrestrial craft. The story was corroborated by a number of other retired military personnel who had been at Roswell at the time.

Some skeptics dismissed it as a tall tale, saying Marcel and others were seeking attention or writing themselves into the story. Regardless, Roswell became embedded in pop culture books, documentaries and movies.

One story that captured the attention of conspiracy theorists was that the wreckage had been seized by the military to reverse-engineer an extraterrestrial flight at Area 51 — a highly classified Air Force military installation in the Nevada desert primarily known for its role in developing and testing experimental aircraft and weapons systems. And a fake film clip purported to show “an alien autopsy” connected to Roswell.

Bowing to public pressure about the incident in the 1990s, the government launched a retrospective investigation that concluded the object that crashed was a Project Mogul weather balloon carrying top-secret equipment designed to search the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests.

A Government-Fueled Conspiracy?

2025 brings an interesting new twist to the story. 

According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal published on June 6, the government fueled the UFO conspiracy theories, especially during the Cold War, to hide its true mission at Area 51. Specifically, the Pentagon wanted to conceal the development of advanced aircraft, such as the otherworldly-looking F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, according to the report.

The disinformation campaign was uncovered by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, established by the Pentagon in 2022, to investigate UAP reports. A report last year dismissed the notion that the government covered up the existence of extraterrestrial life But, The Journal reported, “public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.”

As an investigation of the possibility of deliberate misinformation to hide secret programs continues, the government continues to take UAP and other unexplained phenomena seriously, The Associated Press reported.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Jensen Ackles on [Spoiler]'s surprise appearance on ‘Countdown' and the ‘Supernatural' reunion on ‘The Boys'","https://www.goldderby.com/article/2025/jensen-ackles-countdown-interview/","Wed, 25 Jun 2025 13:00:12 GMT","

[WARNING: The following story contains spoilers about the first three episodes of Countdown.]

It may be hard to believe, but Jensen Ackles can be called a TV veteran since he has been entertaining TV viewers for nearly 30 years. He first grabbed viewers' attention in 1997 as teen Eric Brady on NBC daytime soap Days of Our Lives before chasing demons alongside Jared Padalecki on The CW's Supernatural for 15 years. Since then, he's appeared on ABC's Big Sky, CBS' Tracker, and as superhero Soldier Boy on The Boys (a role he'll reprise for the Prime Video show's fifth and final season). He also found time behind the camera by directing six Supernatural episodes, an episode of Padalecki's Walker, as well as executive-produce and narrate the short-lived Supernatural spin-off The Winchesters.

 










Now, Ackles stays on the right side of the law as sardonic Det. Mark Meachum in the action drama Countdown, which drops its first three installments on Wednesday (the rest of the 13-episode series rolls out weekly). On the series, a Department of Homeland Security agent is suddenly murdered, so a special task force is created with Meachum and others from different arms of law enforcement. However, that murder investigation leads them to bigger threats that has the potential of destroying Los Angeles. Jessica Camacho, Uli Latukefu, Violett Beane, Elliot Knight, and Grey's Anatomy and Euphoria star Eric Dane round out the cast.




			Popular on Gold Derby		






Here, Ackles tells us more about why Countdown appealed to him, that surprising TV face we saw in the opening of the series, as well as an update on the Supernatural reunion with Padalecki and Misha Collins on The Boys.

 










Gold Derby: You were looking for something to do under your new Amazon deal, so what was it about Countdown that just seemed like the right thing to start with?

Jensen Ackles: Derek Haas [Countdown creator, showrunner, and executive producer], largely. He and I had a couple conversations and then I flew out to L.A., we had lunch, and there was just an instant kind of connection there. Obviously, his resume and pedigree speaks for itself. The guy is well versed in storytelling and character-building and also doing broadcast, which I come from as well. I felt like he had a really good sense of how to build a set and how to build a crew, and how to build a team and a cast that could really sing.

And I gotta be honest, I'm not gonna lie. Since Supernatural, I didn't think it would ever get that fun again. This was some of the most enjoyable days on set I have had in my life. From top to bottom, everybody was there to do solid work but to also have a great time doing it. The days that we were all together for the task force headquarters were the greatest days ever because we were all having fun, and we were on set and we were just laughing and we were playing games in between sets or in between scenes. I hope that the chemistry off-screen translated onscreen. I believe it did and I hope we get to do it for many more years.

Tell me about Mark Meachum. How would you describe this guy in your words?

He's a inherently good guy that has just been dealt a really, really bad hand. He's trying to make it in this world the best way he knows how. He could have gone the bad route and been a drug dealer or a drug runner or working for the bad guys very easily, which is probably why he did so well undercover. He can relate to these guys more so than somebody who grew up in white-collar America and had loving parents. This guy comes from broken home, broken family, and a broken deal.

 










I think that he decided to not go the dark route and try to try to bring light to the darkness. It's a fun character to play because there is darkness in there. It's an internal battle, so he fights throughout the series. The fact that he's got this terrible diagnosis — again, he's been dealt a bad hand — but instead of opting to just cash in and be like, ""I'm done. I'm out,"" he's like, ""No, I'm going to jump on this grenade and save as many people as I possibly can.""

We learn of Meachum's health issues in the first episode. Can you clarify what he is actually dealing with?

It's an inoperable brain tumor. And that was one of the great things that Derek wrote in — this guy is not just a maverick. He's not just a cool guy with sunglasses and smoking cigarettes. Do you know Den of Thieves with Gerard Butler? He's just this tough guy in a leather jacket that should ride for a motorcycle club, but instead he's a cop. I'll watch those movies all day. But Meachum, he's not doing it because he's that guy. He's doing it because he's got nothing to lose and he would rather take risks so that his team doesn't have to.

Seeing Milo Ventimiglia in the opening was a big surprise since that has been kept under wraps. How did that come about? Did you make a call?

 










I don't know if this is out of the purview of what we should talk about, but that whole thing was filmed with another actor and who did a great job, but they brought him in as a guest star and they shot that whole sequence. Then, I think once they got into the editing room, they were like, ""This feel like it needs to be a familiar face."" So it's a testament to the Amazon team and a testament to Derek and Jonathan Brown, who directed the first episode and [is] also our producing director, since they were like, ""The stakes need to be heightened here because this sets the whole show on its journey.""

Derek came to me and says, ""I think we're going to reshoot that whole sequence, and it's obviously a lot of money to redo it, but we got to get somebody. Do you know Milo?"" I was like, ""Of course I know Milo. He'd be fantastic. Does he want to do it?"" He said, ""We pitched it to him and we think he's in."" I sent Milo a text and was like, ""Bro!"" So he came for a costume fitting, but he came to set to say hi. I hadn't seen Milo in maybe a year or two, but we go way back, obviously. It was really good to see him and I was just giddy that he came on. And he nailed it as I knew he would.

It's too bad his character dies so quickly in the opening!

Oh, trust me. I was already pitching, ""Can we do some flashbacks where Milo comes in and we actually know each other?"" Derek was like, ""Let me do the writing.""

We find out Meachum may not be the best at romantic relationships since his fellow task force member, DEA agent Amber Oliveros (Camacho), knows his former fiancée. Is there some romantic tension between Meachum and Oliveros that we may see develop over the first season?

 










You will. I mean, with any good ""will they or won't they?"", there's got to be tension. That is definitely an intentional situation there, but instead of Meachum trying to win her over, he's more like, ""I don't need to deal with that. I'm just gonna stay in my lane."" But they are partnered up effectively, so you get a bit of a buddy comedy. And Jess just brought it all to the table and did a fantastic job of bringing a really strong character and somebody who's not gonna placate to Meachum at all. That relationship needs that friction, and it will be kind of your classic ""will they or won't they?"" So far, it's ""won't they?""

You directed on Supernatural and Walker, so any chance we're seeing you in the director's chair at all in Season 1?

I would absolutely love to direct at some point. I want to make sure we have a strong foundation and we have our feet on the ground with what we're doing first. Look, if they threw me in the director's chair tomorrow, I would feel abundantly confident in the cast, but more so the crew. Vanessa Joy [Smith], who's our director of photography, is one of the best I've ever worked with in my life. [She] and her crew are just amazing. She did all five seasons of Mayans M.C. and she is an absolute joy. I mean, it's right in her name! She's such a pro. So, yeah, if your DP is of that caliber, it's hard for a director to really fail. I love being in a position directing-wise where I can't fail.

You're working with Jensen and Misha on The Boys. How would you describe working again with them?

We already shot it, and it was like three brothers coming together to have dinner at somebody else's house. It was like, ""All right, listen, Mom's not here, but we've got to clear our plates at the end. Everybody just mind your p's and q's. Don't mess this up. We've got a reputation. Let's not destroy it.""

It's 1961, and something is in the skies over Grafton County, New Hampshire. A historical marker has been placed along the Daniel Webster Highway near Lincoln commemorating the purported events of that night more than 60 years ago. The marker — labeled “Betty and Barney Hill Incident” — tells the strange story of a couple returning home from a vacation in Niagara Falls and Montreal when they “experienced a close encounter with an unidentified flying object and two hours of ‘lost' time.” The text continues, noting that the Hills filed an official report with the Air Force's Project Blue Book the day after the incident. The Hills did not, however, go public with their alien abduction tale until several years later.

Anyone with a passing interest in the paranormal can list other alleged abductees, including Whitley Strieber and Travis Walton. Those incidents call to mind a laundry list of terrifying medical procedures and humiliating practices, including invasive probing. Most of the stories associated with alien abductions are neither cute nor family friendly.

But that didn't stop Pixar from making “Elio.”

“Elio” is billed as an animated science-fiction adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Released in theaters on June 20, the film's directors include Madeline Sharafian, Domee Shi, and Adrian Molina. The screenplay was written by Julia Cho, Mark Hammer, and Mike Jones, from a story by Molina, Sharafian, Shi, and Cho.

The story revolves around Elio Solís (voice of Yonas Kibreab), a young boy with an active imagination who develops a somewhat unrealistic obsession with aliens. At the beginning of the film, Elio is living with his aunt because — everybody say it with me — Elio's parents are dead. This common Disney trope has now oozed into Pixar territory. It has become such a worn out, overused story element that the script for “Elio” doesn't even bother to provide a backstory for the child's deceased mother and father. The viewer isn't offered any hint of an explanation. No tragic shipwreck, as in “Frozen.” No fatal car accident, as in “Lilo & Stitch.” Poor Elio's parents are just dearly departed, leaving their only offspring with a career-minded Air Force major who sacrifices her dream of becoming an astronaut to raise her nephew.

At the beginning of the film, the relationship between Elio and Aunt Olga (Zoe Saldaña) is reminiscent of the strained situation that existed between Lilo and her teenage sister Nani in the 2002 animated “Lilo & Stitch.” In both films, the unexpected death of the main character's parents leads to a dysfunctional family setting. Like Nani, Olga has no practical parenting experience. She finds it increasingly difficult to balance her military career with the responsibility of raising her nephew. Elio is presented as having neurodivergent personality traits.

Feeling alone in the world, he convinces himself that no one on Earth wants him, including his aunt. After viewing a museum exhibit focusing on the Voyager 1 spacecraft, he begins to fixate on the possibility of extraterrestrial life. He actively seeks to be abducted by aliens, hoping they will embrace him and make him feel loved.

Things get off to a rocky start, with some predictable detours. While calling the occupants of any passing interplanetary crafts, Elio gets into a fight on the beach with two other boys which leads to law enforcement involvement and a trip to a medical facility to patch a black eye.

Elio next attempts to use a high-tech computer system at the military base where Olga is stationed to send a message to his would-be alien saviors, because that seems like something an 11-year-old could accomplish by simply pressing one key on a keyboard, right? That incident almost costs Olga her job, which in turn causes her to send Elio to a youth camp. Remember the two boys from the fight on the beach five minutes ago? Yup, they're at the camp, too.

No worries, because Elio doesn't spend much time there. The first night, while being chased through the woods by his tormentors, Elio is miraculously beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far and wide. The aliens received his message, and — believing him to be the leader of Earth — have made him a candidate for membership. Elio forms new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, including Glordon (Remy Edgerly), a tender-hearted princeling.

Around this point in the film, the script suddenly introduces an antagonist. Lord Grigon (Brad Garrett) a grumpy warlord who has been rejected by the Communiverse. Their refusal to admit him displeases him, and he decides that he will simply conquer the Communiverse. Unable and unwilling to defend themselves, the members of the Communiverse prepare to flee. Elio, desperate to stay with them, offers to negotiate on their behalf.

Meanwhile, back on Earth, Olga has been living with an Elio clone provided by the Communiverse.

The script feels choppy and unoriginal. The plot is meant to be propelled by the death of Elio's parents and its aftermath, yet the details of the event are curiously omitted. Elio's approach to coping with grief is unique, but the story fails to fully explore how he arrived at a level of isolation and disconnection so extreme that he sought to leave Earth. Pixar's platitudinous messaging is heavy-handed, with specific moments that are engineered to hit viewers right in the feels. Sometimes, those come across as a little too obvious.

I turned to a younger audience member — my 18-year-old daughter and die-hard Disney-Pixar fan — to help understand why “Elio” is still an enjoyable experience. She pointed out that the visuals and character designs are appealing, and that the emotional aspects of the story are poignant without being overly stressful. She said “Elio” has a relatable theme, it's sweet and funny, and it offers insights into how to mend dysfunctional relationships.

I can't argue with her observations. Despite its sometimes unwieldy script, “Elio” is gorgeously animated, technically proficient, and emotionally fulfilling.

As for Betty and Barney Hill, their alien abduction case remains one of the most well-known and controversial stories in ufology. The 1975 made-for-television film “The UFO Incident” covers the abduction and its aftermath, with James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons in starring roles. Word is that Hollywood plans to rework the story, casting Demi Moore and Colman Domingo in an upcoming Roger Ross Williams-directed film titled “Strange Arrivals.”

PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE have just droppped a surprise cover of a Lola Amour hit single.

On June 24, 2025 (Tuesday), Japanese boy group PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE — or simply, PSYCHIC FEVER — posted a short video on their social media, which sees members KOKORO and REN covering a short snippet of Lola Amour's 2023 track “Raining In Manila.” It sees them singing the song's chorus, with KOKORO covering the main lines while REN provides backing vocals.

Watch the short cover below:

Notably, a few days before this on June 21, 2025 (Saturday), Lola Amour also posted a short video on their own social media accounts, which sees the the Filipino funk-pop band covering PSYCHIC FEVER's summer hit “Gelato.” Jokingly referred to by the band as a result of them having “five hours to kill before a show,” the cover sees Lola Amour put their signature laid-back, brass-infused spin on the track. Watch it here.

Released on June 14, 2023, Lola Amour's “Raining In Manila” quickly gained widespread attention online from listeners within the Philippines and beyond, becoming the band's breakthrough into the mainstream. It served as the first single from their self-titled debut album, which came out last April 10, 2024.

Meanwhile, PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE's “Gelato” came out last May 15, 2025. It is the lead track from the seven-piece group's latest EP, entitled PSYCHIC FILE III, which was released on May 30.

Kate Shemirani's daughter, Paloma, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer. Despite doctors informing her that she had an 80 percent chance of survival with chemotherapy, Paloma refused treatment and instead opted for alternative therapies, reportedly under her mother's influence. She died in July 2024 at the age of 23. Also read | World Cancer Day 2025: Cancer spreads from person to person? Here are 4 most common myths and facts about the disease

In a June 23 interview with BBC Panorama, Paloma's brothers, Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani, blamed their mother Kate's anti-medicine conspiracy theories for her death. They said that Kate's influence led Paloma to reject chemotherapy and medical treatment. Kate Shemirani is a former nurse whose registration was cancelled reportedly due to promoting misinformation about Covid-19.

Kate styles herself as 'the Natural Nurse' on social media and has 'been known to spread conspiracy theories and once-fringe anti-medicine views to millions' – which her sons believe contributed to Paloma's decision to refuse cancer treatment. Paloma's elder brother Sebastian said: “My sister has passed away as a direct consequence of my mum's actions and beliefs and I don't want anyone else to go through the same pain or loss that I have.”

The brothers alleged that their mother texted Paloma's boyfriend, Ander, saying, ""TELL PALOMA NOT TO SIGN [OR] VERBALLY CONSENT TO CHEMO OR ANY TREATMENT"". The brothers further said they hope they can help prevent other deaths like Paloma's, and they believe social media companies should take stronger action against medical misinformation.

“I wasn't able to stop my sister from dying. But it would mean the world to me if I could make it that she wasn't just another in a long line of people that die in this way,” Gabriel said.

According to her sons, Kate's anti-medicine views were accelerated in 2012, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Even though she had the tumour removed through surgery, she credited alternative therapies for her recovery and reportedly shared online how she used a programme including juices and coffee enemas to become 'cancer-free'.

Kate has not directly responded to the allegations made against her by her sons in connection with Paloma's death, but has publicly blamed the NHS (National Health Service) for her daughter's death. 

She and her ex-husband, Faramarz Shemirani, reportedly said they have evidence that Paloma died due to medical interventions without a confirmed diagnosis or lawful consent. However, the BBC reported it had seen no evidence to support these claims.

Paloma's death highlights that it's essential to rely on credible sources and consult with healthcare professionals for accurate information about cancer.

A coronal hole in the sun could result in visible auroras over about 15 U.S. states tonight (June 25), with the Space Weather Prediction Center expecting a moderate geomagnetic storm.

A ""hole"" in the sun is sending a high-speed stream of charged particles toward our planet, which could make dancing auroras visible from about 15 U.S. states tonight (June 25).

The auroras are predicted to be most intense over Alaska and Canada, but they could potentially also be seen across the north of the contiguous U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center.

""The aurora may become visible over some northern and upper Midwest states from New York to Idaho,"" representatives for the Space Weather Prediction Center wrote in an update.

If skywaters are treated to a northern lights display tonight, it will be thanks to a coronal hole in the sun's atmosphere. These less-dense areas of the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, enable streams of charged particles, or solar wind, to escape into space at high speeds. When these high-speed streams collide with Earth, they can increase geomagnetic activity, which produces auroras.

The Space Weather Prediction Center is anticipating that the coronal hole streams will trigger a moderate (G2) geomagnetic storm. The geomagnetic storm scale ranges from G1 to G5, with G5 being the most severe. Storms of a G2 magnitude aren't rare but can produce strong auroras.

The U.K.'s Met Office has forecast minor to moderate (G1 to G2) geomagnetic storms on Wednesday, though it noted that a strong G3 storm can't be ruled out.

Auroras occur in the sky when charged particles from the sun hit Earth's upper atmosphere, colliding with oxygen and nitrogen particles. These particles then glow different colors as they shed energy from the collision, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Oxygen gives off the greens and reds in the auroras, while nitrogen gives off the blue and purple colored light, according to NASA.

The auroras are expected to form above Alaska and Canada, with the light show's southern extent just grazing the northern edge of the contiguous U.S. However, auroras don't have to be directly overhead for people to see them and can be observed from as far as 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) away, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center.

Auroras are typically best viewed just after sunset or just before sunrise. However, they are tricky to predict, and there's no guarantee that people living in northern states will be able to see anything on the northern horizon.

Geomagnetic activity is expected to drop after tonight, with a minor G1 storm forecast for Thursday (June 26), according to the Space Weather Prediction Center.

Worldline SA shares cratered on Wednesday, wiping out around €500 million ($580 million) of market value on reports that the company allegedly covered up fraud by some of its customers.

Shares in the firm, which describes itself as the largest European payment processer, closed down 38%, having been halted multiple times. That followed the publication of a series of articles co-ordinated by the European journalism network EIC, which claimed the firm had ignored warnings and continued to do business with prohibited and other high-risk customers in recent years, effectively enabling some fraudulent transactions to continue.

A crucial government panel of vaccine advisors is holding its first meeting Wednesday since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed several vaccine critics to the group. 

Earlier this month, Kennedy in a stunning step removed and replaced all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group reviews vaccine data and makes recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts.

ACIP members are independent medical and public experts who make recommendations based on rigorous scientific review and evidence. It is unclear how Kennedy's new members, given some of their skepticism of immunizations, will affect vaccine policy and availability in the U.S. 

""Vaccines are not all good or bad,"" Dr. Martin Kulldorff, the new ACIP chair, said in opening remarks.

""If you think that all vaccines are safe and effective and want them all, or if you think that all vaccines are dangerous and don't want any of them, then you don't have much use for us. You already know what you want,"" said Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who questioned lockdowns and other public health measures early in the Covid-19 pandemic.

""But if you wish to know which vaccines are suitable for you and your children and at what ages, then we will provide you with evidence-based recommendations,"" he added.

During a full-day meeting Wednesday in Atlanta, the panel will evaluate data on Covid-19 vaccines and RSV shots, with a vote on recommendations for the latter. The group will convene again on Thursday to review data on shots for the flu and other diseases. 

The CDC director has to sign off on those recommendations for them to become official policy.

Kulldorff said ACIP will create new work groups, which are staff that review published and unpublished data and develop recommendation options to present to the committee. One new work group will review the childhood vaccine schedule, while another will examine shots that have not been subject to reviews in more than seven years, he said.

The latter group may examine the universally recommended hepatitis B vaccine and ask whether it is ""wise"" to administer the shot to every newborn before they leave the hospital, among other topics, Kulldorff added.

""This was supposed to be a regular practice of the ACIP, but it has not been done in a thorough and systematic way. We will change that,"" Kulldorff said.

Ahead of the meeting, one of Kennedy's new appointees stepped down from the panel.

In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew from ACIP during a mandatory review of each member's financial holdings, without providing further details. It is unclear what his financial holdings are.

Ross is a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology and has served on another CDC advisory panel focused on breast and cervical cancer.

A CDC web page on conflict of interest disclosures for ACIP members does not appear to list any for Kennedy's members, apart from Dr. Cody Meissner.

Kennedy's eight new members include some well-known vaccine critics, such as Dr. Robert Malone.

Malone bills himself as having played a key role in the creation of mRNA vaccines, but has gained a large following for making baseless and disproven claims about Covid-19 shots. 

Another new member, Retsef Levi, has pushed to stop giving mRNA vaccines, falsely claiming in a post on X that they cause ""serious harm including death, especially among young people.""

Another member, Vicky Pebsworth, is a nurse on the board of The National Vaccine Information Center. That organization has been widely criticized as a leading source of misinformation and fearmongering about immunization.

During the meeting on Wednesday, Pebsworth revealed that she owns stock and health-care sector funds that include vaccine manufacturers. But she said her holdings are under the amount the government considers to be a conflict of interest, allowing her to participate in the ACIP meeting.

Kennedy fired previous ACIP members for having what he called ""persistent conflicts of interest."" But all HHS agencies and their advisory panels have had rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years.

Chinese and Hong Kong scientists succeed in animal trials, but potential problems include risk of devices being left in body and public suspicions

Swarms of tiny robots, each no larger than a speck of dust, could be deployed to cure stubborn infected sinuses before being blown out through the nose into a tissue, researchers have claimed.

The micro-robots are a fraction of the width of a human hair and have been inserted successfully into animal sinuses in pre-clinical trials by researchers at universities in China and Hong Kong.

Swarms are injected into the sinus cavity via a duct threaded through the nostril and guided to their target by electromagnetism, where they can be made to heat up and catalyse chemical reactions to wipe out bacterial infections. There are hopes the precisely targeted technology could eventually reduce reliance on antibiotics and other generalised medicines.

The tiny devices are part of the expanding field of micro- and nano-robots for use in medicine. They have also been developed to deliver drugs and to remove bacteria from medical implants such as stents and hernia meshes.

Experts believe they could be in clinical use for treating infections in bladders, intestines and sinuses in five to 10 years. Scientists in China, Switzerland, the US and the UK are developing more sophisticated versions capable of moving through the bloodstream.

The latest development came from a collaboration of academics at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, and universities in Guangxi, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Yangzhou and Macau.

Researchers in the emerging field acknowledge risks include some of the tiny micro-robots being left behind after treatment which could cause longer-term side effects. Another potential problem, cited by technology experts, is public suspicion at the thought of welcoming robots into the human body and conspiracy theories arising around fears the robots could be activated without consent.

The latest breakthrough, based on animal rather than human trials, involves magnetic particles “doped” with copper atoms which clinicians insert with a catheter before guiding to their target under a magnetic field.

The swarms can be heated up by reacting to light from an optical fibre that is also inserted into the body as part of the therapy. This allows the micro-robots to loosen up and penetrate viscous pus that forms a barrier to the infection site. The light source also prompts the micro-robots to disrupt bacterial cell walls and release reactive oxygen species that kill the bacteria.

The study, published in Nature Robotics, showed the robots were capable of eradicating bacteria from pig sinuses and could clear infections in live rabbits with “no obvious tissue damage”.

The researchers have produced a model of how the technology could work on a human being, with the robot swarms being deployed in operating theatre conditions, allowing doctors to see their progress by using X-rays. Future applications could include tackling bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, stomach, intestine, bladder and urethra, they suggested.

“Our proposed micro-robotic therapeutic platform offers the advantages of non-invasiveness, minimal resistance, and drug-free intervention,” they said.

Prof Sylvain Martel, director of the Nano Robotics Laboratory at the Polytechnique de Montréal in Canada, who was not involved in the research, said the science seemed effective.

“It's like a rocket that you can direct with a magnetic field,” he said.

He predicted micro-robots could be available for treatments in three to five years but possibly not for another decade, as regulators still need to approve their use and the manufacturing processes, which differ from those of standard pharmaceuticals.

“The main advantage with micro-robots is the targeting,” Martel said. “Instead of taking medicine that goes into the bloodstream and a small quantity goes to the right location, you can target.”

He said the public would soon set aside any fears over the idea of having robotic devices in their bodies.

“Maybe at the beginning [they will be afraid],” he said. “But they will get used to it pretty quickly.”

Dr Andrea Soltoggio, a reader in artificial intelligence at Loughborough University, said: “The public may be suspicious about non-biological objects like nano-robots being inserted into our bodies. It may even trigger conspiracy theories.

“But it is important to look at what nano-robots are designed for. In this case, we see an example of a targeted intervention to reduce or eradicate an infection with a localised action.

“Nano-robots' behaviour is often simpler and more targeted than many drugs and they could effectively complement a wide range of therapies.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Capital crimes cut

The government has abolished the death penalty for eight crimes, state media reported yesterday. The number of offenses facing capital punishment would be almost halved from an original 18 to 10 from next month, according to the penal code approved by the National Assembly, the official Bao Chinh Phu news portal reported. According to the amended law, the crimes no longer punishable by death are: attempting to overthrow the administration, sabotaging state facilities, production and trade of counterfeit medicine, illegal transportation of narcotics, sabotaging peace and waging war, espionage, property embezzlement and bribe-taking. Convicts would instead be given the maximum sentence of life in prison. Following the announcement, a property tycoon sentenced to death for fraud totaling US$27 billion no longer faces execution, her lawyer said. Property developer Truong My Lan's lawyer Giang Hong Thanh told reporters that her death penalty “will be converted to life imprisonment... I informed Ms Lan this morning, she is very happy.”

Human remains found 

Human remains were found near the village of Blatten, which was wiped out by a glacier collapse last month, local police said on Tuesday. Searchers have been looking for a missing 64-year-old man ever since a flood of earth, rock and ice smothered the Alpine village on May 29, crushing most of its houses. On Tuesday, “during a targeted search in a predefined area of the floodplain, human remains were located and recovered,” the Valais cantonal police said in a statement. The remains were in the process of being identified.

Migrant facility work starts

Florida on Tuesday began construction of a temporary migrant detention facility dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” due to its remote location in the Everglades, a vast subtropical wetland teeming with alligators, crocodiles and pythons. Footage aired by a local NBC affiliate showed the start of construction on the site, which is to have large tents to house migrants and trailers for staff. The facility would have minimal security due to the natural barriers provided by the surrounding inhospitable marshy grasslands, a Florida official said last week.

A key military-industrial site in the Russian city of Taganrog linked to Moscow's production of combat drones and electronic warfare systems was damaged overnight, a Ukrainian official said on June 25, amid Russian reports of Ukrainian drones targeting the area.

""Something unknown flew into the Atlant-Aero plant in Taganrog,"" Andrii Kovalenko, head of the counter-disinformation center at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council  said. 

""This is an important node in the Russian military-industrial complex, specializing in components for combat drones and control systems.""

Kovalenko said the plant is involved in the production of ""Orion"" drones, electronic warfare complexes, and digital integration systems for strike FPV (first person view) drones and loitering munitions.

Russian authorities reported a wave of overnight Ukrainian drone attacks across multiple regions, including Rostov, which borders eastern Ukraine. Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces shot down 40 Ukrainian drones over several areas, including the Crimean Peninsula and seven over the Rostov region.

Rostov Governor Yuri Slyusar said on Telegram that while there were no casualties, the strikes allegedly caused a fire at a sports complex and damaged a high school and two residential buildings in Taganrog. In nearby Azov, a grain warehouse and industrial facility were hit, he added, without providing further detail.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Throughout Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have extensively invested in drone technology, revolutionizing the way wars are fought.

Ukraine has ramped up its domestic drone production and long-range strike capabilities as it seeks to weaken Russian military infrastructure deep behind enemy lines. Earlier in June, Ukrainian drones targeted long-range Russian bombers in an operation dubbed ""Spiderweb.""

Russia has escalated its missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, launching hundreds of drones during overnight assaults. Since February 2022, Moscow has launched 28,743 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine

Speaking at the NATO Defense Industry Forum in The Hague on June 24, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine can produce over 8 million drones of various types each year. He called for an increased investment from the allies to reach that potential. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"
