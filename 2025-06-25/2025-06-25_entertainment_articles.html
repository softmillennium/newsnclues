                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: After teasing a potential sequel to his Oscar-winning drama The Social Network for years, Aaron Sorkin looks to have found an angle to tackle for his follow-up film. Sources tell Deadline that Sorkin has been set to direct The Social Network Part II for Sony Pictures. Insiders say that while it's being called part two, it's not a straight sequel but rather a follow-up to the original movie that explored the origins of what would become the world's biggest social media platform. The new film project is in development with Todd Black, Peter Rice, Sorkin and Stuart Besser producing. Released in 2010 by Sony Pictures, The Social Network was a huge hit with audiences and critics and earned $226 million at the global box office. Nominated for eight Oscars including Best Picture, the film won three, including Sorkin for Best Adapted Screenplay. Since its release, Sorkin has noted on several occasions his interest in doing a follow-up, but he couldn't find the right angle. Following the events of January 6, 2020, when the U.S. Capitol was attacked, Sorkin found new inspiration saying in an interview last year that he believed Facebook played a part. Sources stress that the new film isn't a “January 6” movie and will focus not just on the 2020 election but also Facebook's effect on teens, preteens, violence and countries outside the U.S. Although the original was directed by David Fincher, Sorkin will take on directing duties for this pic having sharpened his skills since the original Social Network came out. No production date has been set, but sources say that with various deals closed, Sorkin will now focus on finding his ensemble. One can expect every agent in town moving fast to get their rising stars in front of Sorkin for the highly-coveted parts, given what the original did for actors including Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. Speaking of Eisenberg, who earned an Oscar nomination for playing Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, it is unknown how big a role he will have in this story and whether Sorkin has been in touch with him to reprise the part. That said, while it makes sense that most of the other characters would not return for this film, it's hard to imagine another movie about Facebook not having Zuckerberg appear in some form. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. He's got to be a part of this. And there's no better actor to play him than Jesse Eisenberg. You can't call this part 2 and not bring back Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. Please — for the sake of cinema — have someone else direct it. If Fincher won't do it, bring in Bennett Miller.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: In a major deal that was highly competitive with multiple bidders, Amazon has bought the rights to Collision, a short novel in Don Winslow's upcoming story collection The Final Score for Jake Gyllenhaal to star in and produce with his Nine Stories partner Josh McLaughlin and The Story Factory's Shane Salerno. Collision tells the harrowing story of a devoted husband and father with a great life who makes one terrible mistake that sends him to prison, where he must learn how to survive. But that's only the beginning: When he finally becomes free, he learns why he was protected in prison and is a sent on a mission that will change him forever. This is a reunion with Winslow and Amazon. Gyllenhaal recently starred in Doug Liman's Road House for Amazon. Following that movie's record-breaking debut on Prime Video with over 50 million viewers in its first two weekends, Amazon MGM Studios signed the Oscar-nominated actor's production label Nine Stories to a first-look deal. Stephen King tweeted last week to his 7 million X followers that Winslow's story collection was “the best crime fiction I've read in twenty years” which spiked sales. The book will be released by HarperCollins on September 17. After exec producing and starring in Apple's Presumed Innocent and seeing the critically acclaimed series become one of Apple's most-watched dramas of all time, Gyllenhaal is back on board to exec produce a second season. Gyllenhaal recently starred in Othello with Denzel Washington at Broadway's Ethel Barrymore Theatre, which became the top-grossing play in Broadway history. RELATED: ‘Othello' With Denzel Washington & Jake Gyllenhaal: Once Again Iago Gets The Last Laugh – Broadway Review Winslow has won major writing awards all over the world and his work has attracted the likes of Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Mann, Ridley Scott, Oliver Stone, James Mangold, Scott Frank, Steven Zaillian, Rian Johnson, Matt Damon, David Mamet, Chris Storer and Austin Butler, among others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a supposed democracy that prides itself on the principle of free speech, the United States hasn't done a great job of protecting that right in recent years. Mikkelsen said that he was detained by immigration authorities for hours at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey earlier this month, interrogated about terrorism and drug trafficking, and ultimately sent home to Norway because border agents discovered a Photoshopped picture of the vice president with a bald, egg-shaped head on his phone — having threatened him with a hefty fine or jail time if he didn't give them access to the device. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment on the incident, but both CBP and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, have publicly denied that Mikkelsen's trip was scuttled over the meme, insisting that he was rerouted back to Oslo because of his “admitted drug use.” Mikkelsen then confirmed to Nordlys that he had told agents about legally consuming cannabis in both Germany and New Mexico. As a pretext for keeping someone out of the U.S., that's about as flimsy as an offending meme, and Mikkelsen further stated that the explanatory document he received from authorities after he was released is full of bizarre falsehoods, such as claims that he has a Spanish passport, had come to visit family in the U.S., and was traveling with a homemade wooden pipe (in fact, his interrogators had only seen a picture of this object on his phone, along with the outrageous Egghead Vance). Even going by the agencies' official story, this was a shocking, thuggish abuse of power. It may be worth asking: what is the commentary here, exactly? That the vice president would be more amusing with less hair, a perfectly rounded face, and an uncanny, doll-like stare? Compared to most of the other “rare” Vance portrait edits that took over the internet in February and early March, many of which depicted him as a chubby child, it's not particularly mean, let alone some kind of threat to national security. Perhaps the most galling thing about custom agents flagging such a picture — remember, they haven't denied this part — is that when they were all the rage, Vance himself said he had seen them and thought they were funny. Why is he silent now that federal agents are vetting this sort of material in the customs process, violating the liberty and dignity of a man who also happens to enjoy it? The Department of State said last week that those applying for student visas would have to submit to a review of their social media accounts in order to confirm they are not criticizing their host country or its government. Whistleblower Spills on Trump DOJ's Strategy for Handling Courts: ‘F-ck You' Judge Skewers Trump Admin's Terrible Case Against Kilmar Abrego Garcia Trump's Admin Is Policing Foreign Students' Social Media for ‘Political Activism' Hostile or disapproving questions about a silly meme, however, would raise the bar for paranoid border defense to an absurd new level. We know from history that repression begets more of the same, that authoritarians become more fragile as they attempt to eliminate even the mildest critiques of their policies and personalities. Sure, China has the ability to control whether citizens can see Pooh on social media, and the U.S. border patrol has the latitude to turn away anyone who may have ridiculed our current executive branch at some point. But as flexes of the state's strength, these actions betray institutional weaknesses. A vice president theoretically needing protection from the camera roll of a Scandinavian backpacker cannot actually claim the standing of his own office; it's simply too pathetic. It's clear from how they treat individuals like Mikkelsen that they are less interested in public safety than opportunities to harass and intimidate. Much of this content is specifically crafted to smear migrants arrested by masked ICE gangs or broadly propagandize about a fictional mass invasion by marauding people of color. Don't tell Trump that Wall Street traders have a market strategy based on the common wisdom that he always “chickens out” on tariffs, or he'll call you “nasty” at a media briefing. Don't take note of press secretary Karoline Leavitt‘s huge, garish cross necklace, or she'll be embarrassed into no longer wearing it. Don't take a shot at Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for spending thousands of dollars to install a makeup studio at the Pentagon, or he'll have to use his personal and departmental accounts to lash out over the “TRASH” story. Above all, do not digitally alter the sacred visage of J.D. Making him look slightly wider, or redder, or like an emo mall goth is a grave insult to one of the great patriots of our time. You will have to suffer the corruption and stupidity and vindictive punishments of this administration without resorting to the comforts of laughter.

After finding herself in inexplicably hot water over the cheeky cover to her upcoming new album Man's Best Friend, pop superstar Sabrina Carpenter is sharing a new version of the album art — and she says it got the stamp of approval from more than just her label. The new black-and-white cover shows Carpenter with her hand placed on a suited man's shoulder as she peers off-camera. “i signed some copies of Man's Best Friend for you guys,” she wrote in the caption. “& here is a new alternate cover approved by God.” Some critics called out the cover's provocative and sexualized imagery, with a few going as far as to claim that the image was anti-feminist. “She's not doing anything outrageous … There have been far flashier covers than hers,” Simon said in an interview with Rolling Stone. The album itself is already off to a good start, with lead single “Manchild” earning Carpenter her second No. “I can't tell you how much this means to me!!! !” she wrote on Instagram after news broke of her No. Check out Sabrina Carpenter's divine-ordained new artwork for Man's Best Friend below: A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. A few days after Cannes wrapped up last month, my IndieWire colleague Ryan Lattanzio published an interview with filmmaker Nadav Lapid, whose furious new satire of modern Israel quietly premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section at the very end of the festival. That was a curious and pronounced demotion for a rising auteur whose similarly blistering previous feature (2021's “Ahed's Knee”) had been selected for the main Competition, where it emerged from a stacked field to win the Jury Prize. But the world has changed over the last four years, and — according to French outlet Le Nouvel Obs — Cannes president Iris Knobloch is no longer comfortable with shining her festival's brightest spotlight on a movie so hostile towards Benjamin Netanyahu's ongoing genocide. Related Stories ‘M3GAN 2.0' Review: Bloated Killer Robot Sequel Swaps AI Horror for Desperate Action-Comedy Hudson Film Festival's Third Annual Edition Features Sundance Winners ‘East of Wall' and ‘Cactus Pears' Ryan's headline, “You May Never Get to See Cannes' Most Provocative and ‘Dangerous' Movie,” epitomizes the sensationalism that ad-supported websites like ours sometimes lean on to drive clicks toward stories about two-and-a-half-hour art films that the reader may never get a chance to see (a shocking admission, I know). Just as importantly, I've also seen how other movies about Israel's war on Gaza have been treated since the events of October 7, 2023, and so — to my great dismay — my only reaction to Ryan's headline was to wince in recognition of its truth. For the first time in my professional career as a critic, there is a subject that some festivals — and virtually all U.S. distributors — are too afraid to touch. In a bleeding-heart business that prides itself on the sensitivity it brings to difficult stories, a business in which people are regularly festooned with awards for shining a light on the darkest corners of human civilization, the Palestinian genocide has become uniquely taboo. Even more than its liberal bonafides, our country's independent film business loves stellar box office returns. However, the overwhelming interest in “No Other Land” — which became an object of great fascination upon its prize-winning premiere at the 2024 Berlinale, and was clearly destined for an Oscar nomination soon thereafter — mysteriously failed to translate into proper distribution. The film was earmarked for success, and had it been about any other subject, that would have been reason enough for someone to release it. While rumors persist that producers rejected a handful of offers in order to preserve the movie's “Netanyahu doesn't want you to see this” mystique (a source confirmed they balked at a single lowball offer), even the most forward-thinking and outspoken executives I harangued about “No Other Land” last summer told me they couldn't afford the controversy. Precisely none of them changed their minds after the film was invited to Hollywood's biggest night. When rumors spread that  “Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat” would make audiences fear for their very lives, the Lumière brothers' actuality became an international sensation. Almost 100 years later, the promise of protests and death threats failed to stop Universal Pictures from turning a profit on “The Last Temptation of Christ,” which screened around the world even after an Integralist Catholic group set fire to a Paris cinema in the middle of a screening. But Israel is unique for how its identity as an ethnostate has been weaponized into a rhetorical shield the size of the Iron Dome. Domestic Zionist groups even threatened to revoke the lease of a theater that screened “No Other Land.” (Upon withdrawing his resolution, Miami Beach mayor Steven Meiner called upon the nonprofit theater in question to screen films in which “the viewpoint of the State of Israel is fully and accurately presented,” which of course describes “No Other Land” to a tee.) Be that as it may, one can only imagine the very real difficulties that distributors might have faced had they put themselves in the line of fire, and so the vast majority of them decided that it wasn't worth the trouble. “No Other Land” was ultimately self-released, and its $2.5 million box office haul made it the third-highest-grossing documentary of 2024. The point, of course, isn't that America's film industry should be doing more to profit off the back of an unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe. The point is that America's film industry is displaying a collective degree of cowardice that finds it deliberately acting against its own ethos as both an artform and a business. For me, it represents a moral abstention wholly unprecedented in my lifetime. Consider Hollywood's relatively decisive reaction to other global crises. Today, it often takes less than a week for a disaster to become the subject of its own Hulu documentary. And now, among all forms of popular media, it's the movies that now feel uniquely feckless as they respond with uncharacteristic silence to one of the worst ongoing atrocities of our time. As the Jewish grandson of a Holocaust survivor, I haven't been shy about my feelings toward the atrocities being committed in Gaza. It's a refusal so complete that Badie and Hamza Ali had to launch their own label, Watermelon Pictures, to ensure that urgent documentaries like “From Ground Zero” and “The Encampments” were made available to American viewers. And yet, I didn't write this column just to revisit the lack of support for “No Other Land,” or even to bemoan the fact that “Yes” faces even bleaker prospects at receiving proper distribution. Not only is Lapid's film a much thornier piece of work that's willing to provoke viewers on both sides of the “is genocide good?” debate (a license it self-grants by acknowledging the absurdity of that question), but its lack of awards potential denies it the best sales hook that “No Other Land” had to its advantage. The specialized market is on its knees at the moment and many of its biggest players are partially funded by Israeli money. Still, this represents a striking reversal of fortune for Lapid, a filmmaker whose previous movies have all been released in the United States despite sharing the same mercilessly self-excoriating approach to Israeli-ness that rages beneath every minute of “Yes.” I suspected that would be the case for whatever movie Lapid chose to make in the aftermath of October 7. What caught me off guard, and what inspired me to yell back into the void about an all-too-familiar subject (at a time of such widespread chaos that it seems ridiculous to think the film industry matters at all) was the possibility that “Yes” may not even get another chance to be ignored. “Yes” has not been formally rejected from Telluride, TIFF, NYFF, or any of the other marquee stops on the fall circuit, but as of this writing I can confirm that it has yet to be privately invited to any of them either, which isn't an encouraging sign at this point in the summer. I'm confident that cooler heads will prevail, especially at festivals that have long embraced political antagonism as a raison d'être, but the uncertainty alone is enough to redouble my fear that the film industry's recent conservatism is trickling upward even faster than it's trickling down from the executive level. While recent nominees like “I'm Still Here,” “Collective,” and “Argentina, 1985” didn't flatter their home countries, the system gives authoritarian regimes the power to bury dissenting films. China can block wider recognition of Jia Zhangke's “Caught by the Tides,” Iran can limit the audience for Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident,” and Georgia can suppress Dea Kulumbegashvili's “April” — a film so politically explosive it forced its director into exile. How much does that matter in the grand scheme of things? Even in an alternate universe where “Yes” wound up in the mix on Oscar night, it's not as if it would drastically reconfigure the discourse about the genocide in Gaza. “No Other Land” winning an Academy Award didn't even prevent the further desecration of the area depicted in the film, nor did it prevent producer Hamdan Ballal from being savagely attacked by a group of masked settlers soon after he returned home from Los Angeles. The Dolby Theatre hosted two of Hollywood's only meaningful attempts to confront the slaughter, and those moments landed with disproportionate force because they pierced through our community's galling abstention from this atrocity. I've long argued that movies have a brighter future than streaming lobbyists would have us believe, but such willful blindness is the only thing that's ever truly dimmed my optimism for the medium's continued value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When real-life Hallmark couple Erin Krakow and Ben Rosenbaum, who both star on “When Calls The Heart,” revealed via social media on June 23, 2025, that they'd tied the knot, it came as a huge surprise to fans — and maybe even some of their fellow stars, since the duo never revealed publicly that they were engaged. Although a handful of their famous friends were quick to reply to their June 23 announcement, including their dear friends and fellow WCTH couple Kevin McGarry and Kayla Wallace, many more have since replied with sweet words of celebration. McGarry, who plays Mountie Nathan Grant on WCTH — now the beau to Krakow's lead character Elizabeth Thornton as they head into filming season 13 — was one of the first to react to her post, sweetly writing, “Beautiful pictures, beautiful friends, beautiful husband and wife – xo” McGarry's wife Wallace, who now appears part-time on the WCTH given her role in Paramount's “Landman,” wrote, “I'm still crying. Kavan Smith noticed Rosenbaum's cool two-toned loafers and wrote, “Perfect couple. Hyland Goodrich, who plays Krakow's son Little Jack on the show, left a comment (likely with help from his mom) that said, “A pairing written in the stars. Tierra Skovbye, who joined the cast during season 12, wrote, “You guys!!! Melissa Gilbert, who also joined the cast as a guest star in season 12 and will return for season 13, commented, “This makes me soooooo happy!!! Viv Leacock, who plays Joseph Canfield on WCTH, chimed in, “So much love!!! The cast has been dropping into wardrobe for individual fittings in Vancouver throughout June, but they're sure to celebrate Krakow and Rosenbaum's union when they're all back together to start filming season 13 in July. It's not just WCTH cast members celebrating Krakow and Rosenbaum in the comment section of their wedding announcement. Plenty of other Hallmark stars have shared their excitement for them too, including Krakow's “It Was Always You” co-star Tyler Hynes, who commented, “Love n stuff ✨🤍✨” Tamera Mowry-Housley, who recently filmed a fun Hallmark+ promo with Krakow, called out the bride's curly updo by writing, “Curls are gorgeous 😍 Congrats @erinkrakow 💍”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardi B and boyfriend Stefon Diggs are living their best lives with a trip to France. Cardi showed off the lavish digs of their medieval mansion while enjoying one another's company in a series of Instagram Stories on Tuesday (June 24). While presumably in town for Paris Fashion Week, Cardi couldn't believe her NFL star boo booked them a massive castle. “This man got us staying in a castle. Cardi continued to give fans a tour of the luxurious chateau while taking them back in time through the dining room, bedroom and indoor pool wing of the castle. This man is so rich he got us in a f—king castle. Another clip found Diggs joking about how he and Cardi will be sitting and eating dinner while at opposite ends of the huge dining room. “Look at the toilet, chile,” she posted to her IG Story. And this where I'ma wash my royal hiney.” Cardi seems to be on cloud nine in her new relationship with Diggs. Dating rumors swirled between the rapper and NFL star at the top of 2025, but they made things official when stepping out to a New York Knicks playoff game together in May.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Social media influencer Liver King has been arrested and charged with making alleged “terroristic threats” against Joe Rogan, Austin's KXAN reports. The 47-year-old born Brian Johnson shared a series of Instagram videos earlier this week in which he challenged the podcaster to a fight. “Joe Rogan, I'm calling you out, my name's Liver King. “On Tuesday, June 24, 2025, at approximately 9:30 a.m., Austin Police Department (APD) detectives were notified that a subject identified as Brian Johnson, known online as ‘Liver King', had made threats against Joe Rogan on his Instagram profile,” the Austin Police Department shared in a statement to Rolling Stone. Johnson was taken into custody at a Four Seasons Hotel in Austin, Texas, on Tuesday, June 24. “This remains an active investigation,” the police department said. According to documents from the Travis County Jail, Johnson now faces one Class B Misdemeanor charge of Terroristic Threat Causing Fear of Imminent SBI. According to the Texas-based Keates Law Firm website, which bears no known association to Johnson, a Terroristic Threat Causing Fear of Imminent SBI charge generally relates to threats “to commit any offense involving violence with intent to place a person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury,” or “places the public or a substantial group of the public in fear of serious bodily injury.” According to the Austin Police Department via KXAN, Rogan told detectives he “had never had any interaction with Johnson and considered the posts to be threatening” when they contacted him. Johnson did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.

Last month, Netflix's popular sports documentary series Untold released Untold: The Liver King, exploring the creation of Johnson's digital empire. “And when shock and outrage get views, what are you willing, or even able, to keep doing to stay at the top of the algorithm?” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

A broken clock is right twice a day, but even at its funniest, “M3GAN 2.0” feels like it's here too soon and too late. The director reunites with original “M3GAN” stars Allison Williams and Violet McGraw for his bizarro sequel — an exhausting two-hour expansion that introduces several different versions of M3GAN (played by Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and a strange new frenemy known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno). Swapping out scares for action beats, that unexpected approach creates a colorful techno-apocalypse with admirable ambitions aimed at something like “Terminator II — for Girls!” Still, it lacks life. Related Stories The Next Jane Austen Classic to Get a Reboot? A New ‘Sense and Sensibility,' Starring Daisy Edgar-Jones ‘Eden' Teaser: Jude Law and Vanessa Kirby Endure an Unhinged Ana de Armas in the Wilderness Her wickedly dark humor lives on in M3GAN's vicious one-liners, even as Johnstone's exposition-heavy script drags the story down. From “Evil Dead” to “The Strangers,” scary movies will often make dramatic tonal shifts between their first and second chapters. Bolting those two crowds together can be tough, and “M3GAN 2.0” multiplies its problem by seeming ambivalent in the penumbra of real AI. Tasked with more screen time than anyone (or anything) in this film needs, Williams reprises her role as Gemma. A reluctant caregiver and negligent toy inventor — picture the mom from “Child's Play” combined with Mark Zuckerberg on an apology tour — she almost lost her niece, Cady (McGraw), to an anxiously attached prototype a few years ago. But that was then, this is now, and as M3GAN explains upon her triumphant and bratty return, she only did those things because she is “a person!” with “feelings! In her first movie, M3GAN was campy enough to become an accidental gay icon, on par with quietly fabulous tormenters from Pennywise to The Babadook. Now, in June 2025, Blumhouse is sending her sequel to theaters on a confused wave of Pride-themed marketing so niche it seems likely to undercut the film's PG-13 rating. The hit-or-miss studio tends to misdirect its success, but Johnstone helps Blumhouse turn “M3GAN 2.0” into an extravagant work of misunderstanding with a misshapen narrative that is both logically messy and emotionally insecure. She's lethally maternal but motivated by a specific type of single-minded terror that's usually reserved for narcissistic men and the grudges of preteen girls. Sadly, Johnstone can't make himself cut enough dialogue to deliver on the promise of even his smartest set-pieces. M3GAN hacking into a rentable street scooter should be bloody and memorable. Instead, the sequel chains its bitchy anti-hero to a morality lesson that won't end and confirms: “M3GAN 2.0” is not a horror movie by most definitions. Johnstone's repeated attempts to find the soul of “M3GAN 2.0” are better than releasing a film you know is shallow. Die-hard fans will discover enough pleasing weirdness — particularly in its pandering conclusion, inconsistent special effects, and the way Williams says “melatonin” — to make the entire affair seem worthwhile. (It's no La Roux's “Bulletproof,” but you can also expect to hear at least one outrageous needle drop from a legendary pop princess. It's somewhat baffling, then, that she is easily the most likable character in a lineup of algorithmically hateable humans. The sequel's director hails from New Zealand, and that's presumably how he got Jemaine Clement to play a whacked-out tech billionaire. But Hell only knows where Blumhouse started looking when it was time to cast a slippery tech ethicist as Gemma's profoundly pretentious love interest (Aristotle Athari). Useless narrative threads and too many wasted elements give away “M3GAN 2.0” as an amateur effort made by a talented horror filmmaker who has not yet mastered action's specific visual language or skill set.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Violet McGraw also returns as the orphaned niece of a roboticist whose rogue automaton companion must be reassembled to bring down an even deadlier doll. But the humor is forced to compete with seriously overcomplicated plotting in a sequel that entangles its horror comedy roots with uninspired espionage elements, becoming a convoluted mishmash with shades of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Mission: Impossible and the Austin Powers franchise. 'M3GAN 2.0' Filmmaker Gerard Johnstone Won't Be Surprised If There's "Another Five of These Movies" The sequel works best when its focus remains on the central family unit — robotics scientist Gemma (Allison Williams), her orphaned niece Cady (Violet McGraw) and M3GAN (played physically by dancer Amie Donald in a mask and voiced by Jenna Davis), the android intended as Cady's companion and protector, who went rogue in the last movie and had to be destroyed. Release date: Friday, June 27Cast: Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, Brian Jordan Alvarez, Jen Van Epps, Amie Donald, Jenna Davis, Aristotle Athani, Timm Sharp, Ivanna Sakhno, Jemaine ClementDirector-screenwriter: Gerard Johnstone The director makes it clear from the opening that this will be a very different film — less interested in the domestic dysfunction and corporate mayhem of its predecessor and more concerned with arms-dealers, duplicitous techies and an industrial military complex with a shiny new toy. None of which, sad to say, is terribly fresh or exciting. Much has changed on the artificial intelligence front in the two-and-a-half years since M3GAN was released, as AI has rapidly become more prevalent in contemporary life, both online and off-. But it's too silly to have much bearing on the real world. Instead, she starts acquiring empathy and morality, which we all know are no fun. “You killed four people and a dog!” Gemma reminds her. While M3GAN's humanoid casing was destroyed when she got out of control last time around, her codes survived in not-quite-sleep mode. M3GAN has way too much intimate knowledge of her inventor for Gemma's comfort, but when their lives are endangered, the robot makes a convincing case that only she can help them take down a new robo-threat. Developed from the M3GAN template by the U.S. Army's Defense Innovation Unit in Palo Alto and overseen by Colonel Sattler (Timm Sharp), Amelia is introduced on a test mission near the Turkish Iranian border, where she ignores her orders to rescue a kidnapped scientist, instead killing him and wiping out an entire research facility. But there's an awful lot of plot to trudge through before Amelia's inevitable encounter with the rebirthed M3GAN. Some of that involves Gemma's advocacy for stricter AI control measures; her quasi-romance with fellow cautionary tech activist Christian (Aristotle Athani); her secret development with Cole and Tess of an AI-free mecha-suit that will equip humans with robot strength and stamina; the industrial espionage of tech billionaire Alton Appleton (Jemaine Clement), who believes that Gemma's new exosuit could be a game-changer with the addition of his neuro-chips; and the discovery of a killer robot dating back to 1984, dubbed Project Black Box, which has been locked in a vault, continuing to develop for decades. Naturally, there's also friction between rebellious Cady and her aunt, whose alarmism after the renegade M3GAN disaster in the first movie means computer science enthusiast Cady has to keep her own robotics projects hidden. Not that this thread is given the space to acquire much weight. But too often, the star attraction takes a back seat to the much less entertaining Amelia, an icy blonde killing machine like so many icy blonde killing machines before her, with none of M3GAN's sardonic wit. Sure, Amelia gets to do some cool stuff like scamper on all fours toward a target, scramble down a wall like a spider, rip the head off one poor unfortunate and neutralize entire tactical units with her dazzling fight skills. But the action mostly feels rote and lacking in suspense. McGraw and Williams (who's also a producer here) are no less appealing than they were in the original, and Gemma gets to step into the fray with gusto once M3GAN slips inside her head via a neuro-chip. But he doesn't stick around long enough to help get through the messy patches. And Athani signals Christian's shadiness almost from his first appearance, which removes any surprise from the busy narrative contortions of the protracted climax. The movie looks polished, thanks to Get Out cinematographer Toby Oliver's sleek widescreen visuals. But it becomes a drag as confusion spirals around who's controlling Amelia and how to stop her. M3GAN herself remains a fabulous creation with a wicked sense of humor (“Hold onto your vaginas,” she warns Gemma and Cole as she takes control of a sportscar), and the character's canny mix of sweetness and menace is by no means tapped out.

We also see a lot more of Julia Garner's Silver Surfer, as she descends to Earth to herald the arrival of Galactus (Ralph Ineson), who seems big and scary despite the fact that we still haven't really gotten a good look at his character. Galactus' arrival spells uncertain doom for Marvel's first family, who can't promise the people of this retro Earth that they'll be able to keep them safe. We also see more of Invisible Woman's powers, a few blink-and-you'll-miss-it arm stretches from Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), and Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn) exercising his greatest power of all: flirting. The Fantastic Four and their beloved planet may be forced to face their greatest foe yet, but throughout it all, one thing remains the same: Ben still won't say “it's clobberin' time.” Regardless, it's almost time for fans to experience the highly anticipated new Marvel entry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dear Batman movie music people: won't you please consider Anamanaguchi? That's the question the band is asking in the very fun video for their new song, “Magnet.” “‘Magnet' is a love song with some extreme feelings–an almost dark romance that feels like it's gliding out of control in a blissful way,” the band said in a statement. (The Batman Part II won't be out for a while anyway.) “We have to strike while the iron is hot, and they're making more Batman movies all the time,” they surmise before the video cuts to a sort of digital application full of clips of the band interspersed with all those past Batmen. “Magnet” will appear on the chiptune band's first-ever lyrically driven rock album, Anyway. The band also recently announced a 32-stop North American tour. You can find dates and ticketing info here. Maybe it will show up in a Batman soundtrack sooner rather than later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new compilation of Joni Mitchell's jazz music has been announced. Spanning her 1968 debut, Song to a Seagull, through her performance at the 2022 Newport Folk Festival, Joni's Jazz traces Mitchell's longstanding love affair with the titular genre. Check out the full tracklist and listen to a demo of “Be Cool,” from 1982's Wild Things Run Fast, below. “It was a joy to play with him,” she said of the late jazz great. “He will be missed, but he will remain alive for me in this music.” The project features Mitchell's collaborations with Shorter, as well as those with jazz legends Jaco Pastorius, Herbie Hancock, and Charles Mingus. Joni's Jazz will be out September 5, via Rhino, in 8xLP and 4xCD box set formats. The physical editions are accompanied by liner notes, photographs, and some of Mitchell's original artwork.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mariska Hargitay has been attending red carpet events for her documentary, “My Mom Jayne” (which has offered a glimpse into her childhood and the secrets that were kept from her, including the revelation that her biological father is not Mickey Hargitay, People reports). However, the film's promotion has also provided a unique opportunity for fans to see more of the actress and her family. Hargitay is married to Peter Hermann, and the couple has been married since 2004, after meeting on the set of “Law & Order SVU.” The pair is also proud parents to three children, August, Andrew, and Amaya. Hargitay does not often post photos of her family on Instagram, and they are rarely photographed all together (although they have attended events and walked red carpets together before). However, when they recently attended the 2025 Tribeca Festival at Carnegie Hall on June 13, 2025, they posed on the red carpet for an absolutely gorgeous family photo. Ten days later, June 23, 2025, the family stepped out again to attend an event at the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Hargitay and Hermann became parents for the first time in 2006, when their son August Miklos Friedrich Hermann was born. They later adopted Amaya Josephine Hermann in April 2011, and six months later, in October 2011, they adopted their third child, Andrew Nicolas Hermann. Hargitay has opened up about having children later in life. She continued, “And now I'm going to savor this moment. I want to share my lessons and where there is pain that I can fix that really inspires me to lighten the load.” Hargitay has also shared a lesson that she learned from motherhood. “The thing that's made me a better parent is my kids,” she told People in 2018.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary Tuesday night after Andrew Cuomo conceded the race in a stunning upset, as the young, progressive upstart who was virtually unknown when the contest began built a substantial lead over the more experienced but scandal-scarred former governor. Though the race's ultimate outcome will still be decided by a ranked choice count, Mamdani took a commanding position just hours after the polls closed. With victory all but assured, Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist who ran an energetic campaign centered on the cost of living, told supporters, “I will be your Democratic nominee for the mayor of New York City.” Cuomo, who had been the front-runner throughout a race that was his comeback bid from a sexual harassment scandal, conceded the election, telling a crowd that he had called Mamdani to congratulate him. Cuomo trailed Mamdani by a significant margin in the first choice ballots and faced an exceedingly difficult pathway to catching up when ballots are redistributed in New York City's ranked choice voting process. He's running as an independent in the general election. “We are going to take a look and make some decisions,” Cuomo said. Cuomo and Mamdani were a study in political contrasts and could have played stand-ins for the larger Democratic Party's ideological divide, with one candidate a fresh-faced progressive and the other an older moderate. Cuomo characterized the city as a threatening, out-of-control place desperate for an experienced leader who could restore order. He brought the power of a political dynasty to the race, securing an impressive array of endorsements from important local leaders and labor groups, all while political action committees created to support his campaign pulled in staggering sums of cash. The party's progressive wing coalesced behind him and he secured endorsements from two of the country's foremost progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Unofficial results from the New York City's Board of Elections showed that Mamdani was ranked on more ballots than Cuomo. And the number of votes that will factor into ranked choice voting is sure to shrink. The race's ultimate outcome could say something about what kind of leader Democrats are looking for during President Donald Trump's second term. The primary winner will go on to face incumbent Adams, a Democrat who decided to run as an independent amid a public uproar over his indictment on corruption charges and the subsequent abandonment of the case by Trump's Justice Department. Comptroller Brad Lander, a liberal city government stalwart, made a splash last week when he was arrested after linking arms with a man federal agents were trying to detain at an immigration court in Manhattan. Among the other candidates are City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer. Mamdani's grassroots run has been hard not to notice. His army of young canvassers relentlessly knocked on doors throughout the city seeking support. Posters of his grinning mug were up on shop windows. You couldn't get on social media without seeing one of his well-produced videos pitching his vision — free buses, free child care, new apartments, a higher minimum wage and more, paid for by new taxes on rich people. That youthful energy was apparent Tuesday evening, as both cautiously optimistic canvassers and ecstatic supporters lined the streets of Central Brooklyn on a sizzling hot summer day, creating a party-like atmosphere that spread from poll sites into the surrounding neighborhoods. Outside his family's Caribbean apothecary, Amani Kojo, a 23-year-old first-time voter, passed out iced tea to Mamdani canvassers, encouraging them to stay hydrated. New York City feels alive again,” Kojo said, raising a pile of Mamdani pamphlets. Cuomo and some other Democrats have cast Mamdani as unqualified. Critics have also taken aim at Mamdani's support for Palestinian human rights. Cuomo resigned in 2021 after a report commissioned by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
