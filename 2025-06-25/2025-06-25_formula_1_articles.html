                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brad Pitt has described his involvement in F1 The Movie as “one of the most extraordinary experiences” of his illustrious career. Brad Pitt has described being involved in Apple Original Films' new movie about F1 as “one of the most extraordinary experiences” of his illustrious career, while paying tribute to the entire paddock for their help and support. Titled F1, the movie is being directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun: Maverick), Oscar-winning actor Pitt and seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, among other respected names. Filming of F1 has taken place at real events, including at 2024's season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with attention now turning toward its international release on June 25, 2025, and North America debut on June 27, 2025. “I grew up with Jackie Stewart [racing in F1 as] some of my earliest memories. In the '90s I really got heavily into MotoGP. Then I started veering into F1, and here we are.” He continues: “I've been trying to get a racing movie done for 20 years. “We got a great push behind us [for this film], people were more and more interested [in F1], so we could get [a company] like Apple to come in and really support us. “It was Joe Kosinski and Jerry Bruckheimer, just coming off [filming] Maverick, who said, ‘[We] want to make the most realistic racing movie we've seen to date', and I think that's what we've done.” “We're not sitting on a sound stage with wind machines… It's almost like when we get to the acting scenes, you kind of go, ‘Oh, okay, no driving today!' Hamilton offered a valuable, helping hand in this area, while also keeping track of the entire filming process to ensure that events and scenes were captured as accurately as possible. “Everyone has had a hand honing this thing, then Lewis coming in for the ultimate ‘smell test',” says Pitt. He's been keeping us straight, going, ‘No, that doesn't fly,' right down to the sound. You need more reverb on the straight' – he's that specific.” “I've got to thank them all [in F1],” he comments. “It's unbelievable the way they've let us embed into their season. We've tried not to get in the way and they've been really cool with us – I can't thank them enough.” Pitt signs off: “It's been one of the most extraordinary experiences I've had.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>F1 The Movie stars Damson Idris and Kerry Condon have explained how they prepared for their “radical” roles on and off track, with the film – also featuring Brad Pitt – released internationally on June 25. F1 The Movie stars Damson Idris and Kerry Condon have shared insight into how they prepared for their "radical" roles in the upcoming film, with the blockbuster released internationally on June 25. Directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun: Maverick), F1 features Oscar-winning actor Brad Pitt in the role of former F1 driver Sonny Hayes, who returns to the sport to partner rookie team mate Joshua Pearce, played by Idris, at the fictional APXGP team. “Every single rookie goes through the same feeling and not even just in Formula 1," Idris said. "They're always trying to prove themselves, even a young actor. “Funnily enough, Lamine Yamal, who plays football [for Barcelona and Spain], was kind of a big deal. The Snowfall actor also went on to praise his “insane” experience on track whilst filming F1, after being given the chance to drive on during F1 weekends, with much of the film shot during actual Grands Prix. “It was insane for me because I got to drive on the track. We'd have these 10-minute slots to get these scenes during actual Grands Prix, to have the ability to watch the drivers up close and see how they interact and live in that world. When you watch the movie, you could see that all that authenticity was put on the screen.” Additionally, Idris also confirmed that he took Copse corner flat-out during one of his preparation sessions for the role, showing his skills around Silverstone in front of Ferrari's Hamilton whilst driving the specially-modified F2 car featured in the movie. "That was a big one for me. I just really wanted to push myself. The reason why I had the confidence to do it was, you know, we would do F4 and F3, and I was flat in those. “So it was actually a lack of experience that made me go flat in the F2 [car]. I didn't know that there was any other way you were supposed to go through Copse. And then when they showed me all the data, they were like, ‘bloody hell, you were flat through Copse?!'. For Kerry Condon, however, her preparation for the role of Kate – APXGP's race director – took place off the track rather than on it. Whether it was chatting with Aston Martin technical guru Adrian Newey, or watching a race from the pit wall, Condon had a lot to learn as someone who was completely new to the sport. “They were so open-armed to us from the minute we arrived," Condon said. "The first race I went to was in Barcelona, just to meet people and observe everybody. Everyone was so nice and generous, particularly [former Aston Martin strategist] Bernie Collins. “I learned a lot from Bernie because of her Irish background. I thought that was going to be perfect. “[F1 TV's] Ruth Buscombe as well was very helpful. I just kind of found out a little bit about where they went to college and what they studied and the route that they took to get there. “I read the Adrian Newey book ‘How to Build a Car', which actually was quite easy to understand. I thought it was going to be a nightmare, but it was actually easy to understand. “And then little things like the notepad that I have when I walk to the pit wall, I asked Bernie what she would have written on the front page of her notepad. Just in case the camera caught a glimpse of my notepad or something.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>F1 The Movie London premiere interview highlights For F1 The Movie, Brad Pitt lived the high-speed life of a Formula 1 driver. He drove with seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton. He spent years shooting scenes at racetracks around the world.

In the latest episode of Beyond The Grid, Pitt tells host Tom Clarkson about making the movie, the “adrenaline” he felt driving on spectacular Formula 1 circuits, what he learned from his time with Hamilton and how getting close to F1 cars and drivers took his breath away. Plus, he reveals the true F1 stories which inspired the character of Sonny Hayes, describes the feeling of driving a real Formula 1 car, and hints at his hopes for a sequel.
