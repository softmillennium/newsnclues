Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) tried to tamper down fears of voter blowback against the proposed cuts to Medicaid spending in the GOP's budget reconciliation bill, claiming that voters will ultimately “get over it.” McConnell responded by saying “failure isn't an option” when it comes to the reconciliation package. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. “I know a lot of us are hearing from people back home about Medicaid. After McConnell's comments faced widespread pushback, a spokesperson for the senator claimed McConnell was referring to “people who are abusing Medicaid” and “the need to withstand Democrats' scare tactics.” “Mitch McConnell told Senate Republicans that Americans concerned about losing Medicaid will ‘get over it.' No one will ‘get over' losing a loved one because Republicans in Congress failed them,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) said in response to McConnell's comments. “Mitch McConnell just told 1.4 MILLION Kentuckians on Medicaid to ‘get over it' when they lose their health care. Several polls demonstrate that GOP lawmakers' concern about the public's reaction to Medicaid cuts are warranted. While the Republicans' push for stricter “work requirements” to obtain Medicaid is popular, garnering 65 percent support from voters in a recent KFF poll, support for that standard drops to just 35 percent when people are informed that the vast majority of Medicaid recipients already work, and that many individuals and families would be at risk of losing coverage due to new burdensome rules that are included in the reconciliation package. An Associated Press/NORC poll published this month also found that a majority of voters actually want funding for Medicaid to be increased. Even among GOP voters, only 33 percent believe Medicaid spending is currently too high.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is much to unpack with the portion of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding invitation that was leaked to the world. Printed in a wistful italic font and decorated haphazardly with doves, shooting stars, butterflies and the Rialto Bridge, the invitation appears homemade, but not in an artisanal sense. (The illustrations, which include two gondolas, have been compared with those available in Microsoft Word's generic image library). Instead, Bezos and Sanchez's invitation looks like a bit of an afterthought — which, considering the number of guests, the ongoing threat of protesters, which has already resulted in a last-minute venue change, and increasing media attention, may well be the case. Many took to social media to express their disappointment, criticizing the invitation for falling flat — expectations that have been largely set by assumptions of a billionaire's wedding budget. The decision makes more sense, however, when you consider the dressed-down approach typically associated with tech bros in this class bracket. Bezos himself is often found in jeans, polo shirts and sneakers — though for this occasion he is sure to shape up — and, according to a Wired profile from 1999, he once wore shirts with “hidden snaps under the collar for easy tie removal.” Speed over style and efficiency over glamor. But invitations are more than just carriers of logistical details. For King Charles and Queen Camila's coronation in 2023, British artist Andrew Jamieson hand-painted an intricate, garden-themed border in watercolor and gouache complete with folklore motifs and coats of arms of the Monarch. The design was then reproduced and printed over 2,000 times on recycled card with gold foil detailing. Similarly, Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, had each of their wedding invitations in 2018 printed using a machine from the 1930s. The pair even went as far as using American ink on English card to symbolize their transatlantic unity. Related article Venice's most guarded secret: Inside the Bezos-Sanchez wedding plans Fashion designers, too, have long harnessed the power of a memorable invite as important extensions of their world-building efforts. On Friday, while high-profile guests step out to celebrate the Bezos wedding (scheduled to run June 26-28), a fashionable set of attendees will gather in Paris for another hotly-anticipated event: The debut of a new chief designer at Dior. Jonathan Anderson — a certified hype-generator and master of storytelling on the runway — also distributed his official invitations this week. Guests received porcelain plates with a trio of baby pink eggs glued to the surface and “Dior” printed on the underside. Expect subversion, something a little weird, traditional craft turned cerebral. Anderson, of course, is not the first designer to capitalize on an operational necessity in this way. More recently, Gucci produced a special edition of the classic “Timor” calendar from Italian designer Enzo Mari and sent it to guests for its Milan Fashion Week show. Jacquemus, for example, hand-wrote its invites in 2018, and wrapped them in a cotton towel along with a loaf of freshly baked bread. For sentimental souls, any invitation is a memento of the day — but great invites, such as those designed by luxury fashion houses, can become prized possessions. With Anderson's Dior debut and the Amazon founder's nuptials overlapping, anyone who found themselves double booked (Kim Kardashian, Anna Wintor, perhaps?)</p>

Company's Starbase launch site in Texas near the Mexican border has seen test failures resulting in large explosions

Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has threatened legal action over falling debris and contamination from billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket launches across the border in the United States.

Mexico's government was studying which international laws were being violated in order to file “the necessary lawsuits” because “there is indeed contamination”, Sheinbaum told her morning news conference on Wednesday.

Last week, a SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during a routine ground test at the Starbase headquarters of Musk's space project on the south Texas coast near the Mexican border.

The explosion, which sent a towering fireball into the air, was the latest setback to Musk's dream of sending humans to Mars.

Mexican officials are carrying out a “comprehensive review” of the environmental impacts of the rocket launches for the neighboring state of Tamaulipas, Sheinbaum said.

The US Federal Aviation Administration approved an increase in annual Starship rocket launches from five to 25 in early May, stating that the increased frequency would not adversely affect the environment.

The decision overruled objections from conservation groups that had warned the expansion could endanger sea turtles and shorebirds.

A lawsuit would be the latest legal tussle between Mexico and a US corporate giant.

In May, Sheinbaum's government said it had sued Google for renaming the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America” for Google Maps users in the United States following an executive order by Donald Trump.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, Emil Bove, was pushed to repeatedly deny several accusations of corruption – one made by a whistleblower at the Justice Department – during his confirmation hearing Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Trump has nominated several of his personal attorneys to top legal posts in his administration, but his nomination of Bove to the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals marks the first time he has selected one of his lawyers to serve on the federal bench. In that short time, he has proven himself to be a reliable ally for the president and also been embroiled in a series of major controversies – including dropping federal charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams; investigating officials who worked on cases related to January 6, 2021; and pursuing Trump's deportation goals in ways that prompted a whistleblower to allege Bove intended to ignore court orders and mislead federal judges. Sen. Richard Blumenthal lambasted Bove for not further explaining those decisions when pressed during the hearing, including over questions of whether there was an element of quid pro quo in dropping the charges. Bove was also pushed repeatedly to address allegations made in a recent whistleblower complaint reported on Tuesday. The whistleblower complaint, filed by a recently fired DOJ attorney and sent to members of Congress, alleges that in a meeting in March, Bove “stated that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts ‘f**k you'” and ignore any orders to stop the hasty deportation of migrants to a prison in El Salvador. During his opening statements and in response to several questions from senators during Wednesday's hearing, Bove continued to deny allegations of wrongdoing. “I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge,” Bove said. If confirmed, Bove would be one of roughly a dozen judges with the power to review federal cases being appealed in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands. Related article Top Justice Department leaders and judicial nominee tried to mislead judges, whistleblower says Despite his involvement in high-profile cases and controversies, Bove has mostly avoided the limelight. Bove graduated from Georgetown Law School in 2008 and then went on to spend a decade working as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he focused on international terrorism and narcotics cases. During that time Bove successfully brought narco-terrorism charges against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in 2020. He also prosecuted Ahmad Khan Rahimi, the man responsible for a 2016 pressure cooker bombing in New York that left 30 people injured. Rahimi was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. “I wouldn't want to be one of his adversaries,” they said. He sat second chair, alongside now-Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, to represent Trump in his New York hush money trial. Trump was ultimately found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in that case, which he is still appealing. He also worked on Trump's federal criminal cases related to alleged mishandling of classified documents and allegations of interfering with the 2020 election. Bove's resume has many of the hallmarks of a federal judge, but he has never served on the bench, and it is unclear how he would rule on major issues. He is a brilliant writer and critical legal thinker. Just hours after Trump took office, Bove was tapped to assume the powerful position of interim deputy attorney general – the No. 2 job at the Justice Department, which had him running the sprawling agency while Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Blanche were awaiting confirmation. His brief tenure has earned him many detractors as he tried to reshape the department to align with Trump's vision and clashed with career officials. One of Bove's first actions at the department was to issue a memo threatening to prosecute state and local officials who resist the administration's federal immigration crackdown. He was met with instant resistance from entrenched bureaucrats who are not accustomed to change,” his former colleague told CNN. He then ordered the firing of eight senior officials and sent a memo demanding information about all current and former employees who had any involvement in January 6 investigations. The request became a point of contention between the FBI and DOJ, sparking two lawsuits that aimed to stop the collection or release of any such information, saying that its release would put FBI employees in danger. His most high-profile controversy has been dropping federal corruption charges against Adams. Adams was charged in September 2024 with five federal charges of bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy and soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals. In a memo to prosecutors in February, Bove cited two reasons as to why the case should be dropped: It had been tainted by publicity, and it was preventing Adams from doing his job, which included helping Trump with his immigration crackdown. Bove ended up personally arguing for the case to be dismissed. Judge Dale Ho ultimately agreed to do so in April 2025. Justice Connection, a coalition of former Justice Department officials, released a video on Monday with statements from formal federal prosecutors warning the public of Bove's alleged unlawful practices. “We don't bring charges or dismiss them based on political loyalties. Bove has also drawn scrutiny for his approach to executing the president's aggressive goals on immigration. On Tuesday, Erez Reuveni, the former acting deputy director for the Office of Immigration Litigation, sent a whistleblower letter to members of Congress and independent investigators in the executive branch regarding Bove's alleged conduct. Reuveni was an immigration attorney who lost his job after working on the case of mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia. But his former colleague says Bove's varied experience is what makes him perfect for the federal bench. He is exactly who you would want on federal bench.” Unlike some other judicial nominees, particularly those to appellate courts, Bove doesn't have a record of judicial writings that would ordinarily give lawmakers and the public a view into his legal beliefs and principles. On Wednesday, Bove testified that if confirmed to the bench he would adhere to a conservative judicial philosophy in which jurists read the law for its plain meaning without considering legislative history and other factors. Asked by Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley what his general approach would be when reviewing an “ambiguous” statute, Bove explained that he would employ a so-called textualist reading of the law in question – embracing a judicial philosophy championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a giant of the conservative legal movement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese and Hong Kong scientists succeed in animal trials, but potential problems include risk of devices being left in body and public suspicions Swarms of tiny robots, each no larger than a speck of dust, could be deployed to cure stubborn infected sinuses before being blown out through the nose into a tissue, researchers have claimed. The micro-robots are a fraction of the width of a human hair and have been inserted successfully into animal sinuses in pre-clinical trials by researchers at universities in China and Hong Kong. Swarms are injected into the sinus cavity via a duct threaded through the nostril and guided to their target by electromagnetism, where they can be made to heat up and catalyse chemical reactions to wipe out bacterial infections. There are hopes the precisely targeted technology could eventually reduce reliance on antibiotics and other generalised medicines. They have also been developed to deliver drugs and to remove bacteria from medical implants such as stents and hernia meshes. The latest development came from a collaboration of academics at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, and universities in Guangxi, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Yangzhou and Macau. Researchers in the emerging field acknowledge risks include some of the tiny micro-robots being left behind after treatment which could cause longer-term side effects. The latest breakthrough, based on animal rather than human trials, involves magnetic particles “doped” with copper atoms which clinicians insert with a catheter before guiding to their target under a magnetic field. The study, published in Nature Robotics, showed the robots were capable of eradicating bacteria from pig sinuses and could clear infections in live rabbits with “no obvious tissue damage”. The researchers have produced a model of how the technology could work on a human being, with the robot swarms being deployed in operating theatre conditions, allowing doctors to see their progress by using X-rays. Future applications could include tackling bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, stomach, intestine, bladder and urethra, they suggested. “Our proposed micro-robotic therapeutic platform offers the advantages of non-invasiveness, minimal resistance, and drug-free intervention,” they said. He predicted micro-robots could be available for treatments in three to five years but possibly not for another decade, as regulators still need to approve their use and the manufacturing processes, which differ from those of standard pharmaceuticals. “Maybe at the beginning [they will be afraid],” he said. “But they will get used to it pretty quickly.” Dr Andrea Soltoggio, a reader in artificial intelligence at Loughborough University, said: “The public may be suspicious about non-biological objects like nano-robots being inserted into our bodies. “But it is important to look at what nano-robots are designed for.</p>

Please make this work possible with a quick donation. The anti-poverty group Oxfam America has issued a forceful response to reporting that the Trump administration plans to give tens of millions dollars to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed aid organization which uses private U.S. military firms and whose rollout the United Nations and international aid groups have strongly objected to. Oxfam America president and CEO Abby Maxman said in a statement on Tuesday that the Trump administration is poised to shell out for an aid organization “formed to distribute food parcels without any grounding in the reality of the crisis in Gaza.” Never miss the news and analysis you care about. She also said the organization has pushed aid further out of reach for the vulnerable populations who can't walk long distances to its distribution sites. She also highlighted that the distribution sites have been marred by violence. The U.N.'s human rights office said on Tuesday that at least 410 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces “while trying to fetch from controversial new aid hubs in Gaza — a likely war crime,” according to a U.N. News article posted that same day. Jonathan Whittall, the head of U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told journalists on Monday that since Israel's total blockade was partially lifted in late May, “people have been killed almost daily while trying to get food.” In a statement shared with CBS on Tuesday, GHF pushed back on what it called “false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites.” The group also said that the “Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any U.N. convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents,” according to CBS, whose story focused on comments from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East commissioner general decrying GHF. In that same story, CBS reported that the Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in Gaza over the last day. And on Monday, over a dozen human rights organizations sent a letter to GHF calling for an end to the “privatized, militarized” GHF aid model and urging any parties involved with GHF and the international community in general to press for aid to be distributed through established international relief operations. “Individuals and corporate entities involved in the planning, financing, or execution of the GHF scheme may incur criminal liability — including under universal jurisdiction statutes — for aiding and abetting war crimes such as the forcible displacement of civilians, starvation as a method of warfare, and denial of humanitarian access,” the letter warned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 300 others, local officials reported. "Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded everywhere," he said. Eight were hospitalized, with half of them in critical condition. "As of now, more than 160 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, 11 people have died," President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on social media, adding: "The rubble is still being cleared, so the death toll may, unfortunately, increase." Around 1:30 p.m. local time on June 25, Lysak reported that the death toll in Dnipro rose to 19 and that more than 300 people were injured in the attack. Almost a hundred of the victims remain in hospital, according to Lysak. Ukraine's national railway company, Ukrzaliznytsia, said that a train traveling from Odesa to Zaporizhzhia was damaged in the attack. "Ukrzaliznytsia is preparing a replacement train in Dnipro to evacuate passengers to Zaporizhzhia," the company said in a statement. In an update, Ukrzaliznytsia said no passengers or railway workers were killed in the attack, though several people sustained injuries and are receiving medical care. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned on June 23 that Russia remains the alliance's most immediate and long-term threat. "They (Ukraine) do want to have the anti missiles. As they call them, the Patriots, and we're going to see if we can make some available," U.S. President Donald Trump said. "I consider him (Russian President Vladimir Putin) a person I think is misguided," U.S. President Donald Trump said speaking at a NATO press conference in The Hague on June 25. "We covered all the truly important issues," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. We spoke about how to protect our people. The leaders also reaffirmed support for Ukraine, stating that direct contributions to Ukraine's defense and industrial capacity will be counted toward the 5% total. Oleg Borsuk, a 61-year-old Ukrainian national, allegedly oversaw the development and modernization of satellite guidance systems (GPS/GLONASS) used in Russian missiles. Russia launched a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on June 24, striking civilian infrastructure and a passenger train, local officials reported. "Obviously we'll be discussing his difficulties, he's got a little difficulty," U.S. President Donald Trump said. According to U.S. law enforcement, the suspect worked as the director of a preschool in Pima County, Arizona, and committed a series of sexual offenses against four children aged 4 to 9 between 1984 and 1991. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russian forces launched 71 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys from multiple directions, including Bryansk, Millerovo, Kursk, and occupied Crimea.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's security service (SBU) has charged in absentia a former defense engineer with treason, accusing him of helping Russia target Ukrainian cities by developing navigation systems for cruise and ballistic missiles, the SBU said on June 25. According to the agency, Oleh Borsuk, a 61-year-old Ukrainian national, fled to Russia in 2009 after resigning from a defense plant in Cherkasy Oblast. He later became deputy general director of Moscow-based design bureau "Navis," a major player in Russia's military-industrial complex. Borsuk allegedly oversaw the development and modernization of satellite guidance systems (GPS/GLONASS) used in Russian missiles. In 2023 alone, under his leadership, nearly 3,200 satellite navigation units were produced, including those for Iskander tactical missile systems, the SBU said. These systems are also used in missiles like the Kh-101, Kh-59, and Kalibr — weapons frequently deployed in Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. Another devastating strike occurred on June 17, when a massive missile and drone assault on Kyiv killed 30 people and injured 172 others. One of the deadliest impacts was a direct hit on a residential building by a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, which caused the complete collapse of an entire section of the nine-story residential building. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. Anna holds a Bachelor's degree in International Communications from Taras Shevchenko National University and is currently an MA candidate in International Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Global security is perhaps the most critical issue today - especially as the infamous Doomsday Clock continues to tick toward midnight," Lavrov said during an address to staff, faculty, and students at Turkmenistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Institute of International Relations. "It is essential to prevent such a scenario, and we are actively engaged in efforts to avert a catastrophe." According to Lavrov, discussions about the potential outbreak of World War III have become disturbingly routine, particularly against the backdrop of rising revanchist sentiment in Europe. "It's become almost commonplace to talk about the possibility of World War III," he said. "That's especially alarming given the resurgence of aggressive, belligerent attitudes across Europe. As if two world wars - and countless smaller conflicts over the centuries - weren't enough for today's EU leaders." Lavrov also pointed to what he described as encouraging developments in global politics. "There are, however, some positive trends," he noted. "One of them is the emphasis on realism and common sense expressed by the Trump administration, which bases its foreign policy on national interests - both of the United States and of other sovereign nations." "That's a key difference from the previous Biden administration, which was entirely consumed by a neoliberal, hegemonic agenda," the minister concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Janetta McKenzie is director of the Pembina Institute's oil and gas program. In the past, building more fossil-fuel infrastructure – in particular, pipelines – was an obvious choice, because everything was fossil-fuel-powered, and it seemed like it always would be. Even demand for LNG is looking increasingly uncertain, with the majority of B.C. 's proposed LNG terminals set to come online in an oversaturated market full of low-cost competitors. Then there's whether oil and gas build-out benefits Canadians in the ways we've been told. Opinion: Canada can help its allies ditch their dependence on Russian energy Opinion: To be an energy superpower, Canada must set aside flawed green ideology Becoming an “energy superpower” means equipping ourselves to lead in that world. Building out a clean, modernized electricity grid – removing barriers to interprovincial electricity transmission, and implementing a predictable regulatory system that favours sustainable development – would enhance our domestic energy security, allowing provinces like Ontario and Quebec to generate more of their own power. Alberta, whose oil and gas sector is vulnerable to trade disruptions with the U.S., could benefit from removing barriers currently throttling investment in local renewable power, too. Building more fossil-fuel infrastructure used to be an obvious choice, but now Canadian decision-makers must look at global trends and make a call.Dan Riedlhuber/Reuters In 2025, an “energy superpower” does not invest taxpayer dollars or slacken regulatory guardrails to build new fossil-fuel infrastructure. Some fossil-fuel projects, such as cross-country pipelines, would cost tens of billions and take a decade to build. No private-sector company has put their hand up to take on this type of infrastructure. But it does mean addressing the elephant in the room: Oil and gas producers are responsible for about one-third of Canada's national emissions for 5 per cent of GDP. Oil sands production is incredibly emissions-intensive, and those emissions continue to grow. In 2023, the oil sands alone emitted 80 per cent more emissions than Canada's entire electricity system. Last month in Calgary, Canada's Energy and Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson claimed, “Every barrel of responsibly produced Canadian oil and every kilowatt of clean Canadian power can displace less clean, riskier energy elsewhere in the world.” But despite years of announcements, companies have not meaningfully invested in decarbonization absent policy requiring them to do so — despite millions of taxpayer dollars on the table for carbon-capture projects. We clearly need an efficient and effective industrial regulatory regime, despite calls from industry to deregulate. is doing with 18 energy and mining projects — there's an opportunity to improve our regulatory effectiveness. But red-tape reduction for its own sake would lead to new fossil fuel infrastructure built with lax environmental standards and inadequate constraints on pollution, and at high risk of becoming stranded assets in a declining global marketplace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York is facing the prospect of electing a staunchly socialist pro-Palestine mayor who wants to control food prices and almost double the minimum wage. Born in Uganda, his family moved to New York when he was seven. He has posted campaign videos speaking entirely in Urdu and mixed with Bollywood clips. He is a fierce critic of Israel's war in Gaza, putting him at odds with much of the Democratic establishment. His Muslim faith has also been weaponised by some Maga Republicans, including Charlie Kirk, a populist media personality and podcaster with access to Mr Trump's inner circle. “Twenty-four years ago a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11. Now a Muslim socialist is on pace to run New York City,” Mr Kirk tweeted. But it is Mr Mamdani's policies that have been most eye-catching. In videos posted during the primary race that routinely went viral – particularly on TikTok – he called for free bus rides, universal childcare for New Yorkers with children aged six weeks to five years, and rent controls. One of Mr Mamdani's most controversial policies is city-controlled supermarkets, where local authorities would get to decide how much food costs. John Catsimatidis, the chief executive of grocery chain Gristedes, said he would consider selling or moving his stores if Mr Mamdani is elected. His high-profile supporters include Emily Ratajkowski, the actress and model, Rachel Zegler, the Snow White actress who regularly posts pro-Palestinian comments on social media, and singer Lorde, who in 2017 cancelled a concert in Tel Aviv after pressure from activists. As well as being New York's most Left-leaning mayor, he would also become the city's first Muslim leader in a city that is home to about one million Muslims. Mr Mamdani wove his faith into his campaign, delivering speeches at mosques and speaking to voters while fasting for Ramadan. “It is Palestine that brought me into organising, and it is Palestine that I will always organise for,” he told a crowd in New York.“Anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism and in the anti-Zionist movement that I believe in and belong to, there is no room for anti-Semitism,” he added. Last week, Mr Mamdani said that “globalise the intifada” was a legitimate expression that could be used by Palestinian supporters, which earned him staunch criticism from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. “The very word has been used by the Holocaust Museum when translating the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising into Arabic, which is a word that means ‘struggle',” he said as he defended his position. The museum hit back: “Since 1987, Jews have been attacked and murdered under its banner. All leaders must condemn its use and the abuse of history.” “A massive win for Zohran Mamdani that shows that when Donald Trump is president, New York Democrats want to see their leaders fight with enthusiasm and courage, and that's what Zohran showed voters.” Mr Cuomo had looked unbeatable as he sought to make a political comeback after facing sexual assault allegations in 2021.</p>

Mamdani, an Indian-Ugandan immigrant who became a U.S. citizen in 2018, earned 43.5 percent of the first-preference vote. He took office as a New York state assemblyman in 2021, representing the 36th District that covers the Queens neighborhood of Astoria.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday used a profanity to criticize both Iran and Israel for what he said were violations of a ceasefire between the two adversaries. It was almost 20 years ago in his ESPN column that he originated the idea, but Donald Trump was a little later in discovering the powerful sorcery of occupying the Tyson Zone in politics. And yet, somehow, the F-word was a new bridge to cross. How Trump's Israel-Iran ceasefire agreement came together in a chaotic 48 hours Trump pivots from budget bill to big, beautiful Middle East settlement On Tuesday as he prepared to leave for a NATO summit in the Netherlands, Mr. Trump faced a barrage of questions about the ceasefire he had declared the previous night between Israel and Iran, which had been breached immediately and explosively. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” Mr. Trump snarled, physically leaning into the end of the sentence. He finished by barking “Do you understand that?” at the reporters crowding around, before stalking away to his helicopter. On one hand, Mr. Trump may have been simply expressing intense frustration about a long-running conflict that is intractable, destructive, bloody and, yes, incredibly frustrating on a geopolitical scale. There appeared to be an element of aggrieved surprise, as though he had thought he could quell a roiling sea just by saying so. He didn't seem to have accounted for 75 years of conflict in the Middle East, burning even hotter in the past few years, and still more in the past couple of weeks. What we saw on Tuesday was the President discovering in real time that some forces in the world will not be bent to his will, no matter how badly he wants to claim a big win. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!” The prim, limp politeness of that was overshadowed in strangeness only by the way he signed it, like an official, enforceable order, “DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!” And here he was trying to broker the biggest deal imaginable – what could be more consequential or difficult, after all, than peace in the Middle East – and the whole world could see it failing. It's plain that Mr. Trump sees the ability to end conflicts as a demonstration of authority and negotiating prowess. He has repeatedly asserted that Russia's invasion of Ukraine would not have happened on his watch, and in the last several days, he's taken to listing off all the accomplishments for which he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. On Monday, a Ukrainian parliamentarian who had nominated Mr. Trump for the Nobel for brokering negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv withdrew the nomination. Then a Republican congressman stepped in on Tuesday to nominate him for the hours-old ceasefire. Re-posting that nomination letter was among the manic blizzard of social-media activity Mr. Trump mashed out aboard Air Force One as it hummed toward The Hague, following his meltdown on the White House lawn. He posted a praise-filled message from the NATO Secretary-General, he wrote a long tirade that combined the alleged stupidity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a flex about his own cognitive testing, and he shared multiple posts about his approval ratings and various brownnosers declaring he should win the Nobel Peace Prize. Consider how many times the President – who grew up as a boy with a rich and ruthless father who paved New York City for him, before he became a rich and ruthless man himself – has been told “no” in his life. (Once at least, in November, 2020, and we know how that went.) They didn't do that raid this morning,” he said. He added, “So the ceasefire is very much in effect and I think we're going to keep it there for a very long time.” Now, the President figured he was on his way to NATO to “solve a new set of problems.“ He answered more questions, and then when he'd had enough, he turned away from the reporters to walk back to his private section of the plane.
