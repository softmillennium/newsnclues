                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, a Pediatric Investigation review sheds light on potential applications of AI in the early identification, risk assessment, and prevention of myopia. Uncorrected myopia can impair vision, disrupting education, career prospects, and quality of life. By 2050, nearly half of the global population is estimated to become myopic. High myopia is often associated with complications that can lead to visual impairment, affecting patients' quality of life and increasing the global medical and economic burden. Artificial intelligence (AI) has opened up new frontiers in the medical field and may be a solution to this global health concern. In a new literature review, Dr. Li Li, Dr. Jifeng Yu, and Dr. Nan Liu, all from the Department of Ophthalmology, Capital Medical University, China, have summarized the applications and challenges of AI in myopia, including detection, risk factor assessment, and prediction models. This study was published in the journal of Pediatric Investigation on 18 March 2025. Interestingly, AI models can be trained using ML/DL to detect myopia from fundus photos and optical coherence tomography images. By feeding a model with a large quantity of fundus images from myopic patients, the AI can be taught to discern minute changes in color and pattern in the retina that are associated with myopia. This allows the model to diagnose future patients from their fundus photos. In addition, self-monitoring equipment such as SVOne, a handheld device that uses a wavefront sensor to measure eye defects, can use AI algorithms to detect refractive errors in the eyes. Moreover, AI can be trained to detect behavioral changes associated with the onset of myopia. For example, the Vivior monitor uses ML algorithms to note changes in visual behaviors, such as time spent on near vision activities, in children aged 6-16 years. Furthermore, ML methods like support vector machine, logistic regression, and XGBoost can be employed to identify risk factors of myopia. "An XGBoost-based model can be fed large quantities of longitudinal data, allowing it to learn the outcomes and associated risk factors of myopia in numerous patients. This, in turn, allows the model to assess the risk factors of new patients based on their genetics, family history, environment, and physiological parameters," explains Dr. Li Li. Predicting the progression and outcome of myopia can help doctors adjust their clinical approach. Taken on a large scale, it can shape clinical practice and policymaking that help in myopia control. By feeding an AI model large quantities of biometric data, refractive data, treatment responses, and ocular images from numerous myopia patients, the AI can be taught to predict outcomes of myopia in new patients. Despite the great potential of AI in myopia, several challenges need to be overcome. Firstly, it is important to ensure that the dataset used to train an AI model is correct and of high quality. Secondly, most AI models are trained using data from large hospitals, which may not be representative of patients going to smaller clinics. This creates a discrepancy between real-world and training populations. Thirdly, an AI model is not a trained doctor and may not be able to provide a clinical basis for its diagnosis, which can cause the diagnosis to be rejected by medical professionals. Finally, with such vast quantities of patient data used to train AI models, it is important to ensure the privacy of patients' medical records. By building high-quality datasets, improving the model's capacity to process multimodal image data, and improving human-computer interaction capability, the AI models can be further improved for widespread clinical application," concludes Dr. Jifeng Yu.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As US health insurers promote a new joint plan to overhaul prior authorization (PA) as a major advance, clinician and patient advocates say insurers have provided few specifics about what will change and how they'll be held accountable. For example, the voluntary plan unveiled on Monday promises that insurers will reduce the PA burden on providers and patients, but no numbers are provided. And insurers only pledged to “work” toward overhauling the electronic PA system with a goal of implementation by 2027. “There are some incremental things that go above and beyond what they're required to do, but there are few concrete commitments,” California-based consultant and former healthcare executive Seth Glickman, MD, MBA, told Medscape Medical News. Glickman also highlighted what he called a “one-sided” accompanying report by the America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) trade association that defends PA as a “critical safeguard in patient care,” says it “is only selectively used,” and blames “a number of physicians” who don't follow evidence-based medicine. The American Society of Clinical Oncology has tracked more than 110 PA bills in 40 states. AHIP announced on Monday that leading commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid managed care coverage insurers covering 257 million Americans will voluntarily “simplify” PA. “For patients, these commitments will result in faster, more direct access to appropriate treatments and medical services with fewer challenges navigating the health system,” an AHIP press release said. However, a 2025 KFF report found that “virtually all enrollees in Medicare Advantage (99%) are required to obtain prior authorization for some services.” According to the AHIP survey, about 20% of current PA requests for medical services are approved in real time; the data for prescription medications were not provided. We're also wasting people's time,” Oz said, according to NBC Chicago. Medical organizations support the announced reforms — but also called for more than promises. Chet Speed, JD, chief policy officer of the American Medical Group Association, told Medscape Medical News that “the vast majority of PA denials are an inefficient, bureaucratic exercise.” As he noted, researchers have found that high rates of denials are overturned on appeal. Speed also highlighted a 2022 American Medical Association survey of 1000 physicians that found 94% of physicians said PA at least sometimes leads to delays in care, and 7% said it “resulted in a serious adverse event leading to a patient's disability, permanent bodily damage, congenital anomaly, birth defect, or death.” “Anecdotally, we have heard from medical groups and systems that this delay is especially problematic on Fridays when PA offices close for the weekend,” Speed said, “meaning patients stay in the hospital when a transfer to a post-acute setting would have been more clinically appropriate.” Kaye Pestaina, JD, director of the Program on Patient and Consumer Protections at KFF, told KFF Health News that she's not sure how the reform plan changes the fact that many patients don't realize they need PA until it's denied. Adam Gaffney, MD, MPH, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, Boston, was skeptical too. He told NBC News that the plan is “going to streamline it [PA] in some incremental ways only.” Sabin Dang, MD, a retinal specialist in St. Louis, told Medscape Medical News that the plan won't solve all PA problems. This is much better than forcing patients to wait a week “while they're suffering with decreased vision,” he added. Last year, Dang led a study that found 96.2% of PA requests for 2225 anti-VEGF drugs were approved, but most — 59.6% — remained unresolved after 24 hours. Most requests resulted in a delay of care, and an analysis showed that staff members needed to spend a median of 100 minutes on each request. The standardizing of PA technology will also be helpful, Dang said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pretreatment step could help transplanted pancreatic islets survive longer in patients with type 1 diabetes, according to a new preclinical study from Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. One combination of small molecules extended the cells' lives in female mice, and adding two molecules to the mixture boosted cell survival in male mice. The findings, published on June 24 in Cell Stem Cell, could allow physicians to treat more patients with fewer cells. In type 1 diabetes, autoimmune cells attack the pancreatic islets, destroying the insulin-producing beta cells and leaving patients dependent on insulin injections. The current FDA-approved transplant procedure replaces these cells with pancreatic islet cells from one or more deceased organ donors. Once in the liver, the islet cells begin producing insulin, just as they would in a healthy pancreas. Transplanting the cells under the skin, an option with some potential advantages, also has challenges with dying cells. Dr. Shuibing Chen, the Kilts Family Professor of Surgery and director of the Center for Genomic Health at Weill Cornell Medicine, noted research by others showing that pretreating a type of cell used to replenish blood cell populations during a six-hour period improves their survival after a transplant, so she explored a similar approach for islet cells. "With our new strategy, we should only need one donor per patient, or maybe one donor could contribute cells to two patients, lessening the waiting time for patients to receive the therapy," said Dr. Chen, who is also a member of the Hartman Institute for Therapeutic Organ Regeneration at Weill Cornell Medicine. Determining the best pretreatment approach typically requires several expensive and labor-intensive drug screens, but J. Jeya Vandana, graduate student in the Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology and first author of the paper, had an idea. "Jeya combined chemical screens with single cell RNA-sequencing technology so that we could check multiple readouts in one experiment," said Dr. Chen. With their system, which they call ChemPerturb-Seq, each cell in an experiment receives a unique barcode and is treated for 48 hours with a unique small molecule drug. All the data are made publicly available through a website called ChemPerturbDB, which is powered by an artificial intelligence assistant that is similar to ChatGPT. This combination of beta-lipotropin, insulin growth factor-1 and prostaglandin E2 boosted the survival of beta cells and human islets from donors when transplanted subcutaneously in a type-1 diabetes mouse model compared to controls. Jeya first transplanted everything into female mice, and the approach worked very well, but when she transplanted the pretreated cells into male mice, it failed." Dr. Shuibing Chen, the Kilts Family Professor of Surgery and director of the Center for Genomic Health at Weill Cornell Medicine The result was a cocktail called LIPHS, which included the three LIP molecules plus histamine and serotonin, that was successful in males. Armed with their new technique, Dr. Chen's group will conduct more studies to see whether the results hold for additional preclinical models. ChemPerturb-seq screen identifies a small molecule cocktail enhancing human beta cell survival after subcutaneous transplantation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As we age, extreme heat causes many heat-related illnesses that can lead to serious health issues. A new study from the University of California, Irvine's Joe C. Wen School of Population & Public Health adds to that list. The UC Irvine researchers have discovered that the combined effects of aging and heat waves are putting people's health at greater risk by weakening gut and immune system function, which heightens our risk of infection from a deadly, waterborne bacterium called Vibrio vulnificus that is increasingly found in warmer ocean waters. As many around the world experience record-breaking June heat waves, the study arrives at a crucial moment in the ongoing effort to understand how rising temperatures affect human health. While Vibrio vulnificus infections are already a growing concern in warming coastal regions, our findings show that extreme heat, especially with older individuals, may further compromise the immune system and gut microbiome in ways that make people more susceptible. It's a double hit: Aging weakens immune defenses, and heat stress accelerates that decline." Saurabh Chatterjee, corresponding author, professor of environmental & occupational health, and medicine As V. vulnificus infections and extreme heat events increase, key scientific gaps have made it difficult to assess infection risk. Until now, researchers have lacked a clear understanding of how prolonged heat affects the gut microbiome, immune response and infection vulnerability in older people. To address this, the UC Irvine team exposed both young and aged mice to climate-relevant heat and conducted microbiome sequencing along with tests for gut integrity and immune function. This work is the first to connect climate-driven heat stress with gut and immune disruption that raises susceptibility to V. vulnificus. It also identifies a potential avenue for treatment: Aged mice treated with a beneficial gut microbe (Roseburia intestinalis) demonstrated restored immune cell function and reduced signs of infection. Reintroducing key probiotics helped improve intestinal health and regulate the immune system. The results suggest that supporting gut health may be key to boosting immune resilience during heat exposure.

Aging and climate change-induced heat stress synergistically increase susceptibility to Vibrio vulnificus infection via an altered gut microbiome-immune axis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sweeping analysis of over 100 studies reveals aspartame is unlikely to alter glucose or hormone levels, challenging claims about its metabolic risks. Review:  The Effects of Aspartame on Glucose, Insulin, and Appetite-Regulating Hormone Responses in Humans: Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses. A recent study published in the journal Advances in Nutrition investigated the effects of aspartame on insulin, glucose, and appetite-related hormone responses. High free sugar consumption is associated with elevated energy intake, increasing the risk for obesity, overweight, and chronic conditions. One strategy to curb free sugar intake is to reformulate foods and drinks by reducing their sugar content. Many manufacturers achieve this using low-calorie sweeteners (LCSs). LCSs are considered safe, with studies suggesting benefits for decreasing body weight and energy intake compared to sugar intake. For instance, LCS intake has been associated with a higher risk of obesity and various metabolic conditions, albeit the evidence remains limited. Aspartame is recognized as safe for use in foods and beverages. Aspartame is converted into aspartic acid, methanol, and phenylalanine. Given this breakdown of metabolites found in dietary sources, the metabolic effects of aspartame may appear unlikely. However, some studies suggest differing effects for diverse health outcomes from aspartame intake. Controversy over aspartame's health effects continues, in part because some studies have suggested different outcomes when compared to other LCSs. In the present study, researchers investigated the effects of aspartame on insulin, glucose, and appetite-regulating hormone responses. PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases, as well as four trial registries, were searched for studies examining the effects of aspartame on insulin, appetite-regulating hormones, and glucose responses. Any controlled intervention study design was eligible for inclusion, regardless of location and setting. Observational, animal, and in vitro studies were excluded from the analysis. Data on methodological aspects and risk of bias (RoB) were extracted from each study. The Cochrane Collaboration RoB-2 tool was used for RoB assessment. A narrative synthesis of suitable experiments was performed based on the study design type, aspartame exposure, study duration, comparator, and outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed where at least 10 studies of the same design, exposure pattern, and outcome were available. The GRADE approach rated certainty as “very low” due to limitations in study design, inconsistency and heterogeneity among studies, indirectness, and possible publication bias. The review included studies in a range of populations, such as healthy adults, individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, phenylketonuria (PKU), and those with self-reported aspartame sensitivity. After de-duplication and title/abstract screening, full texts of 417 articles were screened. Overall, 101 articles were included, which reported on the effects of aspartame alone or in combination with other substances. Thirty-four studies examined the effects of aspartame alone on glucose responses with different comparators. Aspartame had no effects on blood glucose compared to vehicle or other LCSs. However, blood glucose levels were significantly lower following aspartame intake compared to sweet sugars, non-sweet-tasting carbohydrates, or other nutritive components. Notably, these reductions were most evident in acute, short-term studies. For insulin responses, 31 studies examined the effects of aspartame individually. Aspartame had no effect on blood insulin levels compared to the vehicle; however, blood insulin levels were significantly lower after aspartame intake compared to non-sweet-tasting carbohydrates, sweet sugars, or other nutritive components. Further, blood insulin was significantly elevated with aspartame compared to other LCSs. Few effects were found with appetite-regulating hormones. Few adverse events were reported across studies. Four crossover studies, which lasted up to 30 days (medium-term), found that high or low doses of aspartame did not affect blood glucose or insulin levels compared to sucrose or a placebo. Three crossover studies, which lasted more than 30 days (long-term), yielded results similar to those of medium-term studies. In parallel-group acute studies, aspartame was found to reduce blood glucose levels compared to sucrose or glucose, when provided alone or in combination with nutritive components or LCSs. Four parallel-group, medium-term studies yielded results that mirrored those in short-term studies to some degree, with aspartame reducing blood insulin and glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity compared to sugars. Ten parallel-group studies were performed over the long term. No differences were found between aspartame and the comparator(s) in any biochemical measure. Nine studies provided data on energy intake and reported no differences or lower energy intake and density with aspartame compared to sucrose. Likewise, nine studies examined appetite and found no differences between groups. The RoB assessment raised concerns for most studies. The certainty of evidence was “very low” for all primary outcomes. The diversity of included populations (such as individuals with diabetes, PKU, or aspartame sensitivity) likely contributed to this heterogeneity. In sum, most studies investigated blood insulin and glucose levels over the short term, and the meta-analyses revealed no effects of aspartame compared to vehicle or other LCSs. However, lower blood insulin and glucose levels were found with aspartame compared to sugars and other nutritive components, mainly in acute interventions. Long- and medium-term studies had few effects of aspartame intake. Few studies have assessed appetite-regulating hormones other than insulin, and few effects have been found in these studies. There was high heterogeneity across studies and populations. The inclusion of varied participant groups (e.g., those with metabolic diseases or sensitivities) was an additional factor influencing the overall certainty and generalizability of findings. Further long-term studies are needed to compare aspartame with other LCSs and assess various appetite-regulating hormones. Tarun is a writer based in Hyderabad, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite environmental promise, insect-based foods remain a niche as taste, price, and tradition keep meat and plant-based options on top. Can bugs ever break through to the mainstream? Review: Beyond the buzz: insect-based foods are unlikely to significantly reduce meat consumption. As the environmental impact of livestock farming grows, with meat consumption predicted to be responsible for 37% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions permissible under a 2°C climate target by 2030, pressure to curb meat intake is rising. Insects promise high protein with a lighter environmental footprint, attracting startup funding and policy enthusiasm. et acceptance across Europe and North America rarely exceeds 30% of consumers, and most would pay less, not more, for insect products. Environmental campaigns alone have not changed taste-driven habits grounded in culture, price, and convenience. Further research is needed to clarify whether insects can overcome these still truly complex social and market obstacles. Taste, tradition, and perceived health status keep steak at the center of many plates. Mouth-coating fats deliver a savory punch that insect flours struggle to mimic. In the EU, for instance, livestock farmers have received 1200 times more public funding than alternative protein groups, and lobbying from the meat industry has even influenced reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Convenience matters, too: supermarkets, fast-food chains, and meal-kit apps place animal products within easy reach, while insects remain online novelties or limited-edition snacks. Any alternative must satisfy this sensory, cultural, and economic bundle to win repeat purchases. Online delivery widens the gap: a single tap summons chicken wings, while insect products often require specialty websites and week-long shipping, eroding instant-gratification expectations. Surveys conducted across the United States (US), Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), and Italy reveal that fewer than 30% of adults would consider trying insect dishes, and even fewer would serve them at home. Disgust (a protective emotion linked to disease avoidance) surfaces when people picture antennae or feel the sensation of crunchy legs. In Western cultures, insects are often associated with disease, dirt, and decay, and their consumption is sometimes perceived as a marker of a “primitive” lifestyle. This is compounded by the potential use of food scraps as insect feed, a practice that Western consumers may not be receptive to. Food neophobia, the reluctance to taste unfamiliar items, amplifies this reaction, especially in older consumers. Social cues deepen the gap: Western media frame insect eating as a reality-show stunt, and dinner companions signal hesitancy with a single eyebrow raise. These intangible forces create a wall higher than any nutritional chart can climb. Children form taste memories early, and schools rarely feature insect dishes, so generational turnover alone cannot guarantee acceptance within crucial climate timelines. While the tactic lifts willingness to sample, it rarely sustains weekly demand. Crucially, approximately 90% of the current insect-based food market consists of products, such as snacks, pasta, or bars, that do not directly compete with meat. Shoppers still compare the bar to a plant-based counterpart that is cheaper, sweeter, and free of crunch memories. Since insects generally have a higher environmental impact than plants, incorporating them into these items is likely detrimental from a sustainability perspective. Eco-labels touting lower GHG emissions add marginal appeal, but everyday eaters prioritize taste and habit over distant climate metrics. Educational tastings at museums generate social-media buzz yet falter at the checkout line; repeated exposure helps some adventurous groups, but scaling that immersive experience to millions would drain marketing budgets faster than venture capital arrives. Few large grocers allocate chilled sections to insect analogues, so interested consumers cannot build a reliable routine. Production costs remain high because farms must maintain strict daily temperature and humidity controls, as well as feed controls, to prevent pathogens, which contrasts with soybeans that grow in open fields. Investment patterns reinforce these challenges: in 2022, the vast majority of funding for insect farming, approximately 95%, or 1.2 billion USD, was directed toward animal feed and pet food, with less than 1% supporting insect-based products for human consumption. Regulators add another layer, as the European Union (EU) now allows specific species in baked goods and pasta, but novel food approvals remain slow, and labeling disputes over words like "burger" or "sausage" mirror earlier battles faced by oat and almond beverages. Plant-based meat alternatives such as soy or pea burgers already occupy mainstream menus, from Burger King to grocery freezer aisles, and taste tests show steady improvements in juiciness and grill marks. Their environmental profiles surpass those of poultry and rival insect protein, while avoiding perceived health risks such as allergy concerns and visual stigma. Crucially, supply chains for legumes have enjoyed decades of agronomic optimization, allowing unit costs to decrease. As a result, shoppers seeking lower-impact proteins can satisfy ethical goals without confronting bug-related unease. If insects cannot deliver a clear sensory or price advantage, they risk fragmenting attention and investment that could accelerate broader dietary shifts toward plants. Existing studies focus heavily on hypothetical willingness to try insects rather than real cash transactions. Few studies track long-term consumption patterns or examine how community identity shapes food loyalty. Sensory science must still decode how to replicate the Maillard-rich (the chemical reaction responsible for browning and flavor) aroma of seared meat using insect oils or pastes, and economists need transparent cost curves from pilot to industrial scale. Comparative life-cycle assessments should include realistic scenarios where insects replace plant snacks, not beef steaks, to gauge net climate outcomes. Finally, sociologists could explore whether targeted niches such as high-protein sports powders or emergency rations offer footholds that do not compete head-on with beloved comfort foods. Current evidence shows that insect-based foods must overcome significant barriers before they can reduce meat consumption. They currently fall short in terms of taste familiarity, price, availability, and social acceptance, while competing directly with increasingly popular plant-derived substitutes. Investment patterns, regulatory caution, and consumer psychology all reinforce a cycle of limited scale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals how junk food during adolescence rewires critical brain regions, increasing the risk for poor decision-making and obesity well into adulthood. Study: Adolescent nutritional influences on the brain: implications for eating behaviors. The transition from childhood to adolescence also involves a shift from dependence on direct control mechanisms linked to food and sensory receptors to an increasing reliance on indirect control mechanisms that facilitate adjustments in one's eating behavior. In contrast to children whose eating behavior is primarily determined by hunger and fullness cues, adolescents' eating behavior is significantly influenced by multiple external factors, including personal beliefs, media, food preferences, and peer pressure. The modern food environment features easy-to-access, highly palatable foods with high levels of fat, sugar, and salt, often directly marketed to adolescents. These ingredients typically increase food cravings by bypassing the normal regulatory controls. Multiple studies have shown that compared to children, adolescents are more commonly inclined towards consuming hyper-palatable and ultra-processed foods (UPF), which are widely available in Western countries. These studies have also pointed out that adolescents are the highest consumers of high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) foods, which cause obesity and metabolic disease. According to U.S. data, ultra-processed foods account for approximately 65% of total energy intake among adolescents, who also have the highest intake of added sugars. In the last three decades, a rapid increase in the prevalence of adolescent obesity has been recorded, with rates having quadrupled during this period. The PFC region of the brain is involved in executive functions, including sustained attention, higher-order cognition, planning, decision-making, and inhibitory control. Impaired hippocampal activity leads to decreased memory of meals and increased response to food cues, resulting in elevated meal frequency, total energy intake, and weight gain. Animal studies suggest that the hippocampus' structural and functional development during adolescence is especially sensitive to diet quality, with human research showing correlations between poor dietary habits and memory impairments. Much of the mechanistic evidence for this comes from animal studies, with human evidence being largely correlational (e.g., brain imaging studies linking diet, PFC volume, and cognitive performance). This impaired development has a long-lasting impact on eating behavior, contributing to diet-induced obesity in adulthood. Adolescent rats fed an HFHS diet for just a month exhibited a reduced number of fast-acting parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which disrupts neuroplasticity. Notably, adolescent rodents exposed to a Western diet for as little as one week exhibited rapid onset of anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, a vulnerability not observed in adults. HFHS foods were found to promote impulsivity, especially during adolescence. For example, animal studies have shown that adolescent rodents exposed to these diets exhibit increased impulsivity and reduced inhibitory control, and that baseline sex differences in these effects may exist, although further research is needed to confirm this in humans. The review highlights that males may experience greater and more persistent impulsivity, while females show a gradual emergence of these behaviors. Many animal-based studies have shown that GABAergic communication in the PFC is influenced by diet. For instance, adolescent rodents fed a high-fat and sucrose diet independently for two months showed a decreased GABA concentration and a reduced number of iGABAergic PV+ interneurons in the PFC and hippocampus. These changes in the brain regions are associated with impaired cognition and behavioral control. Hyperpalatable foods activate the mesocorticolimbic pathway, encouraging further reward-seeking behavior. In humans, elevated reward responsivity to food has been associated with increased body mass index. The review notes that over-engagement with such foods during adolescence may cause lasting changes in reward signaling, with some animal studies showing epigenetic changes that persist into adulthood. Rodents fed with high-fat food demonstrated increased oxidative stress in the hippocampus, higher memory impairments, anxiety, and decreased social interaction. Similarly, rodents fed high-fructose corn syrup, a key ingredient in most soda drinks, exhibited impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory in both male and female rats. A previous study has also shown that the size and volume of the hippocampus are impacted by HFHS food consumption. Specifically, fat intake is associated with reductions in left hippocampal volume (linked to verbal memory), whereas increased dietary fructose is linked to increases in the right hippocampus (associated with spatial memory), reflecting possible lateralized hippocampal functions. Besides fat, higher dietary intake of fructose is associated with an increase in the volume of the right hippocampus, which could be due to delayed synaptic pruning or inflammation. However, the review cautions that the significance and consequences of such volume changes are not fully understood, and findings are sometimes contradictory (e.g., some studies find reduced hippocampal volume with fat intake, others see increases with fructose). Many studies have confirmed that early life HFHS diet impairs the structural and functional signaling of the hippocampus, which negatively impacts hippocampal-dependent memory and learning. In comparison to control-fed rats, the HFHS diet increases hippocampal lesions, which in turn elevate meal frequency and appetitive responding, ultimately leading to obesity. Additionally, animal research indicates that a Western diet during adolescence can increase blood-brain barrier permeability in the hippocampus, thereby further impairing cognitive function. Importantly, some of these diet-induced effects may not be fully reversible even after a healthy dietary intervention in adulthood, particularly when exposure occurs during critical periods of brain development in adolescence. Taken together, the habitual feeding behaviors developed during adolescence may trigger long-lasting alterations in brain circuitry that could influence health throughout the lifespan. While much of the mechanistic evidence is derived from animal studies, human epidemiological and neuroimaging data are generally consistent with these findings; however, direct causal pathways require further investigation.
