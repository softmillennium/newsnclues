                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donovan said he believes the US is not a priority for stars Pulisic, Robinson, Musah all withdrew from summer tournament Former US men's national team greats Landon Donovan and Tim Howard criticized some of the stars who asked to be left off the team's Gold Cup roster this summer, with Donovan saying he believes that the national team is “not a priority” for them. Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah all asked to be left off of the team for various reasons, with Pulisic citing the workload of two straight 50-game campaigns with Milan, while Robinson was ruled out with a case of knee tendinopathy (an overuse injury that he had been managing for much of the second half of the Premier League season). Fulham announced on Wednesday that Robinson would undergo a surgical procedure on his knee and would use the summer to recover. In Wednesday's episode of Unfiltered Soccer, the podcast co-hosted by Donovan and Howard, Donovan decried the absences despite his own experience with experiencing burnout over the course of his playing career. “I understand very clearly what it's like to need a break,” said Donovan, who took time away from soccer in 2013 – a decision that then-US head coach Jürgen Klinsmann said contributed to the decision to cut Donovan from the 2014 World Cup team. If they would actually come out and give reasons, it would help us, but none of them want to say anything publicly. I think it would help them publicly to say ‘this is why. Milan, home to Pulisic and Musah, was a focus given that the last game of their season was largely meaningless, with the team already mathematically out of European competition next season. “The problem I have with Christian in the last few weeks is he's still playing for Milan,” Donovan said. They had nothing to play for this weekend. In the case of Robinson, Donovan pointed out that the left-back withdrew from national team consideration ahead of this year's Nations League finals due to injury concerns, yet started for Fulham in games immediately before and after the international break. Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer “Why are you starting and playing 90 minutes the last two games for Fulham if your knee's so messed up?” What are you doing? Everyone has to make the decision that's best for them. I'm not going to say they don't care. Howard, along with Donovan, expressed dismay that Pochettino would not have a chance to have the full team together in a tournament setting before the World Cup, but that “I'm putting a ton of this on US Soccer.” Let me tell you about my priorities,” Howard said, referring to the federation's relationship with the clubs where US players ply their trade. This relationship between clubs and international federations is typically at least somewhat collaborative, with Fifa enforcing laws governing the availability of players to national teams. “I don't necessarily know that dialogue has been had with sporting directors. And by the way, if it has, then it just shows that US Soccer has no gravitas and no power. [In that case] those sporting directors basically said, ‘Who is this? I don't have time for this call.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As head coach of the U.S. Women's National Team, Emma Hayes has a plethora of immensely talented players at her disposal, not least the Thompson sisters. Angel City FC forward Alyssa, 20, and City defender Gisele, 19, are two of U.S. Soccer's brightest young stars, having already made 20 international appearances between them. Both called up for the USWNT's upcoming friendlies against China and Jamaica, Hayes recently gave an insight into what the Thompsons are like behind the scenes, and exactly what it is that makes them so special. You couldn't go into an elevator or a dinner hall or anywhere without them two being side by side,” Hayes told Ion. “But beyond their determination and their drive to be the very best, I love the way they reflect on what they need, and then they work at trying to put that in place. “She's always putting herself in strong positions on that right-hand side. But I'm bringing her in as a wide player because I want to see her attacking qualities, particularly against low blocks. So I'm getting a chance to do that this camp.” Alyssa has enjoyed an excellent start to the NWSL season, scoring five goals and providing a further two assists in nine games for City, who currently sit seventh in the league table on 14 points after 10 games. As such, she is already well on track for her most prolific goal-scoring season to date, and could well challenge for the golden boot given that she is currently only two goals behind leading scorer Esther Gonzalez with seven in 10 games. However, Alyssa and Gisele may not end up being the only Thompsons representing the USWNT in a few years' time. Younger sister Zoe, who plays for Tudela FC, was one of 60 players recently called up to the USWNT's Under-14s Talent ID Program. But while the Thompsons may yet end up with three representatives in the USWNT, for the time being, Alyssa and Gisele's primary focus will be on maximizing their opportunities to continue to impress Hayes, with one eye on reaching the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup roster, starting with Saturday's friendly against China in Minnesota.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police in the Mexican state of Jalisco are getting 678 new patrol cars, though only a few of them will be Cybertrucks They've recently added three specially outfitted Tesla Cybertruck patrol vehicles to their fleet, which will be deployed in high-traffic tourist areas during the tournament. One of these Cybertrucks was recently taken out onto the local city streets and tailed by a pair of F-Series trucks that police are also using. Read: Las Vegas Gets First Cybertruck Police Fleet In America Flashing red and blue lights have also been neatly incorporated into the front and rear bumpers, as well as the side skirts. “We also need to work a lot on the perception of security; we are going to deliver 678 patrol cars for the State Police, State Highway Police, and State Police, including some ‘Black Mambas,' which are this kind of tanks,” he said. Mexico isn't alone in adopting the Cybertruck for law enforcement. Earlier this year, Las Vegas announced it would receive 10 of the trucks, thanks to an anonymous donor. The 2026 World Cup is set to run from June 11 to July 19 across 16 host cities in the US, Mexico, and Canada, featuring 48 teams. While Jalisco's decision to roll out high-tech, bulletproof Cybertruck patrol vehicles might look impressive on paper, it also raises questions about whether this extravagant spending is really the most effective use of resources for an event of this scale.

Iran star Mehdi Taremi has received a call-up for upcoming World Cup qualifiers but should play for Inter Milan at the Club World Cup instead.

According to Iranian journalist Hatam Shiralizadeh via FCInterNews, the 32-year-old will probably skip June's international window.

With Iran already securing a spot at the 2026 World Cup, there's no need to risk Taremi in ‘dead rubber' matches next month.

Indeed, they'll take on Qatar and North Korea in games carrying no bearing on qualification.

Meanwhile, Simone Inzaghi could make good use of the ex-Porto striker in the summer tournament in North America.

It's not been an impressive maiden Serie A season for Mehdi Taremi, who joined Inter as a lethal goalscorer.

On the contrary, he has flopped at San Siro, making the Nerazzurri contemplate a summer sale.

However, he may still have a chance to redeem himself at the Club World Cup.

With Marko Arnautovic and Joaquin Correa set to leave, he'll be the only reliable backup option in attack.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CHICAGO (May 28, 2025) – Chicago Fire FC and U.S. Soccer today announced that Homegrown goalkeeper Chris Brady was added to the U.S. Men's National Team for training camp ahead of June international friendly matches. Brady will replace Patrick Schulte on the roster. Brady, 21, signed a first team contract in March 2020, becoming the 19th Homegrown Player in Club history as a 16-year-old. The Naperville native has played 6,816 minutes for the Fire since earning his first start in a 1-1 draw against the New England Revolution on Oct. 9, 2022. Brady has started all 77 matches in which he has played, registering 253 saves and 16 clean sheets. Most recently, Brady joined the U-23 USMNT for an international training camp in March 2024, going the full 90 minutes and earning a shutout in the 3-0 win against Guinea on March 22, 2024, at the Torremirona Sports Center in Girona, Spain. The U.S. Men's National Team reports to Chicago beginning June 1 before hosting Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With MatchWornShirt, fans can buy a signed, game-worn USWNT or USMNT jersey in a real-time auction. Ever wanted to own a jersey worn by Naomi Girma or Lynn Biyendolo? Now you can—US Soccer recently announced a new partnership with MatchWornShirt, an online auction marketplace for sports memorabilia. Through MatchWornShirt, fans can buy signed, game-worn jerseys directly from USWNT and USMNT games, bringing home a piece of authentic team history. MatchWornShirt's new partnership is with the U.S. Soccer Federation (U.S. Soccer), the United States National Soccer Team Players Association (USNSTPA), and the United States Women's National Team Players Association (USWNTPA). Fans will be able to bid on match jerseys in real time auctions as games take place, and jerseys come with digital certifications of authenticity. Jerseys are authentic—fans will be able to see the real wear and tear that comes from the game, like dirt or grass stains. MatchWornShirt started when cofounder and CEO Tijmen Zonderwijk wanted to buy an Ajax shirt, but couldn't find a good place to buy an authentic, game-worn jersey. He started the company as a way to fill that gap, growing from a small auction in the Netherlands to a global brand. “The energy around sports memorabilia in the U.S. has never been higher—and soccer in America is entering a golden era,” said Lilian Bours, Chief Marketing Officer of MatchWornShirt. “We're thrilled to give American soccer fans unprecedented access to their National Teams, deepening the emotional connection to their favorite players and celebrating the game's most iconic moments. We turn match days into memories–in wearable and collectible form.” “There's something incredibly special about fans being able to own a piece of the player, their grit, their pride, the moment itself,” said Becca Roux, Executive Director of the U.S. Women's National Team Players Association. “This kind of access deepens the connection between players and fans and is helping drive an entire industry forward. For the first time, USWNT fans will be able to own their own small part of the team's history. Now, the red, white, and blue jerseys that players wear while scoring goals and breaking records could be hanging in your closet just days later.</p>

In his latest View From The Front Row on Substack, FrontRowSoccer.com editor Michael Lewis says that it is time to stop complaining about the lack of veteran firepower in the U.S. men's national team for the upcoming friendlies and Concacaf Gold Cup.

Lewis said that this is the time for other players who have held lesser roles on the squad to step up and show that they belong in the running to make the team for the 2026 World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Follow live coverage of today's Conference League final between Betis and Chelsea Most of the 32 competing sides are expected to name strong squads, given the prize money and brand exposure on offer in a rapidly growing football market. One of FIFA's measures to address this involves an extra transfer period, from June 1-10, for Club World Cup teams to bring in players ahead of the tournament, given that the summer window proper only opens on June 16. Soon-to-be free agents on contracts that expire at the end of June could be available to their new employers for minimal fees. The Athletic has picked out some players who are in that situation and could be targeted by Club World Cup participants. Ronaldo's future was already a question mark, with his contract at Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr, who are not in the tournament, ending on June 30. It has now come squarely into focus after FIFA president Gianni Infantino said the 40-year-old “might play” at the Club World Cup and that “there are discussions with some clubs” during YouTuber iShowSpeed's stream last week. He posted a photo of himself in an Al Nassr jersey on X with the caption, “This chapter is over. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner's two-and-a-half seasons in capital city Riyadh have brought 93 goals in 105 matches, controversies, tantrums, and less-than-pleasant gestures to crowds but no major domestic or Asian titles. Alexander-Arnold confirmed on May 5 that he will be leaving Liverpool this summer as a free agent, and he is expected to join Real Madrid. But while the process of Madrid hoovering up big names after their contracts expire may have been seamless in previous years — as it has been with their signings of Kylian Mbappe, Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba — the Club World Cup has added a layer of complexity. Madrid's first-choice right-back Dani Carvajal is still recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury suffered last October. Madrid could negotiate with Liverpool on a fee that would allow them to sign Alexander-Arnold before the tournament begins. The 26-year-old England full-back will depart Anfield after nine years with the first team that brought 352 appearances, 23 goals, 86 assists and eight domestic, European and world trophies. Tah confirmed in April that he will be moving on from Bayer Leverkusen this summer, with the German club making it official in early May. No agreement for that to happen has been reached yet. No move has yet materialised, and he remains a free agent. The 32-year-old last played a competitive match in September 2023, for Juventus against Empoli. Before his suspension, Pogba was viewed as one of the most skilled midfielders in football. Consistency was an issue, but he made 423 combined appearances for Manchester United and Juventus — neither of whom have really replaced what he offered at his peak — and 91 for France. His trophy cabinet includes a World Cup, four Serie A titles and the Europa League, and players seldom lose the kind of natural ability Pogba has. Jorginho is another impending free agent with his next club already lined up. The Athletic reported this month that Brazilian club Flamengo, who will play in this Club World Cup, are in negotiations with Arsenal to find an agreement to let him leave the London side before his contract expires on June 30. The Brazil-born Italy international, 33, started just nine Premier League matches this season, dropping behind Thomas Partey and Mikel Merino in the holding-midfield pecking order. Aurier has been a free agent since leaving Turkey's Galatasaray in July last year. He has kept himself in shape, though, by joining up with a fitness coach who has worked with Karim Benzema, Ryan Gravenberch and Aaron Wan-Bissaka in recent years. Lacazette is set to leave Lyon for the second time in his career this summer after 11 years with their first team (2009-17 and 2022-25, either side of five seasons with Arsenal). He scored 201 times in 391 appearances for the Ligue 1 side, winning France's FA Cup equivalent once and their Community Shield twice. Di Maria is another high-profile impending free agent, with his contract at Benfica expiring after a productive two-season second spell at the Lisbon side that brought 32 goals and 25 assists in 88 matches and two winners' medals in the Portuguese cups. A world champion with Argentina in 2022, Di Maria is approaching the end of his career at age 37, but is more than capable of offering a team some added attacking punch from the bench. The winger has confirmed he is leaving Benfica this summer — but not when. It could be before or after the Club World Cup. Chukwuemeka's time at Chelsea seems to be ending after three years, following an unsuccessful loan to Borussia Dortmund for the second half of this season. A permanent move away seems to make sense for both player and club and getting it done before this tournament would give the talented midfielder, still only 21, a chance to get his career back on track.

The Parkville Board of Aldermen voted unanimously last Tuesday to temporarily loosen its short-term rental policy ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. “We recognize that around the FIFA World Cup tournament next summer, there's going to be a lot of people wanting to stay for a short-term time. And so we're going to temporarily lift the restrictions for a three-month period," said Community Development Director Stephen Lachky. Starting next May through July, those restrictions will be loosened to meet the need in short-term rentals during the FIFA World Cup. “We're ahead of the ball and ready for those international visitors that will be coming to the Kansas City region,” Lachky said. There will not be a cap on short-term rentals throughout the city. Property owners looking to rent out their space must apply for a permit, have at least one designated parking spot per dwelling unit, and collect a 5% tourism tax. The city believes this will help bring more traffic to the area, which leaders anticipate local businesses will benefit from. “To know that the city is definitely watching out for us — because the city has a lot on their plate, we have a lot going on and we're still on their radar. — it says something about the charm of Parkville," said Lauren Watson. Watson, general manager at Farm House Collection in downtown Parkville, said the change is a step forward for the city and businesses looking forward to welcoming soccer fans next year. This is definitely going to be enough for us. Applications for permits are on the city's website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Vicens, Juanma Lillo and Inigo Dominguez are all leaving before the Club World Cup, signalling a major refresh of the backroom staff. The Portuguese club, who came fourth in their league this season, have agreed terms with Vicens as they ambitiously look to challenge the top sides in their league. Lillo, a long-time mentor of Guardiola who coached the manager in Mexico towards the end of his playing days, first joined the coaching staff in 2020 and after leaving for a year returned in 2023. He brought Dominguez with him when he re-joined, but has expressed a wish to return to Spain and Dominguez will also depart. That leaves Guardiola with just fitness coach Lorenzo Buenaventura and goalkeeping coach Xabi Mancisidor as assistants who sit with him in the dugout. City's head of player support Manel Estiarte and performance analyst Carles Planchart are long-serving help who have been with the manager form his Barcelona days. City have announced that the new coaching structure will be confirmed in due course, and the hope will be that the new arrivals can be in position as quickly as possible. As revealed by the Manchester Evening News, Guardiola will get extra assistance for the tournament from City's Under-21 coach Ben Wilkinson and his No.2 Craig Mudd. They will be there to support the younger players who are asked to help the first team prepare for matches and recover for them, although it remains to be seen how many other coaches there will be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The transfer window is opening earlier than usual this summer ahead of FIFA's newly expanded Club World Cup - but what can we expect? Cristiano Ronaldo and Trent Alexander-Arnold could be among those on the move with FIFA keen for its new-look tournament to have a star-studded cast in the United States. There is no third-place play-off between the two losing semi-final teams. Cristiano Ronaldo attracts attention like few others on the planet - so it was no surprise to see FIFA president Gianni Infantino reveal discussions had taken place for him to sign for a Club World Cup team. His great rival, Lionel Messi, will be there with Inter Miami. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner fuelled speculation further by hinting he is leaving Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr in a cryptic post to his 654 million Instagram followers - though it is not yet clear at this stage which club he could join. Reports have linked him with Saudi club Al Hilal, who face Ronaldo's former team Real Madrid in their opening game. Real Madrid will have Dean Huijsen in Xabi Alonso's squad after agreeing a deal with Bournemouth for the centre-back to join in time for the Club World Cup. Chelsea could also be active in the mini-window with signing a forward one of their aims this summer. Ipswich's Liam Delap is a deal that could be done early due to his £30m release clause - but Manchester United and Newcastle United are also trying to sign him. Hugo Ekitike, Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko and Jonathan David are their other striker targets, with transfer strategy being discussed in more detail after the UEFA Conference League final against Real Betis. Manchester City are in the market for a No 10 this summer to replace Kevin De Bruyne with Morgan Gibbs-White and Dani Olmo among those they like. Tijani Reijnders, a central midfielder for AC Milan, is another City admire, while they are also looking to strengthen at full-back. As it stands, City appear in no rush to get deals done ahead of the tournament. Al Hilal are interested in Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, who raised concerns he could leave after the Europa League final defeat when he admitted the club could cash in on him. Ruben Amorim, his head coach, has said he wants to keep the midfielder. United are set to take advantage of the earlier window themselves by sealing a deal for Matheus Cunha from Wolves after activating his £62.5m release clause. It is not clear whether Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will be willing to discuss the sale of Romero after Spurs won the Europa League to qualify for next season's Champions League. Ange Postecoglou has urged Spurs to keep hold of Romero, though the head coach's future in north London is uncertain after a dismal Premier League campaign, which saw them finish 17th.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Milan could reportedly include Sebastiano Esposito in their squad for the summer's FIFA Club World Cup. Therefore, Sebastiano Esposito will return to San Siro in the coming days. With Marko Arnautovic and Joaquin Correa set to leave, Simone Inzaghi may soon find himself strapped for attacking options. Indeed, Inter can hardly sign a new center-forward in the next two weeks. As such, the 22-year-old could get an unlikely chance to prove his worth in North America. Relinquishing their top-flight status will have substantial implications for Gli Azzurri's transfer plans this summer. As things stand, Esposito will be the first casualty, even though Empoli had hoped to sign him permanently. However, it may give him a chance to launch his senior career at San Siro. There would be worse ideas than keeping Sebastiano as our 4th choice, loaning out younger brother, and splashing some cash on a new 3rd Striker, be it Bonny, Castro, Zirkzee or another…. I would prefer him to stay as 4th option, bring someone like David to fight with Lautaro and Thuram for starting 11, and spend more money somewhere else Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City's Under-21 manager Ben Wilkinson will join Pep Guardiola's backroom team for the Club World Cup. The 38-year-old is set to link up with City's first team alongside assistant Craig Mudd when they arrive in Florida for a camp ahead of the summer tournament. Guardiola's staff will be reduced by the time they head for America, with assistant Juanma Lillo leaving the club as well as both Inigo Dominguez and Carlos Vicens. The coaching shake up coincides with new director of football Hugo Viana's appointment and City's sluggish season. City are thought to be moving forward with new deals this week but Guardiola will need fresh voices ahead of next year. Having won last year's FA Youth Cup, Wilkinson has impressed since taking the Under 21s from Brian Barry-Murphy, who had become an integral member of staff during Guardiola's training sessions. Wilkinson's invitation to form part of Guardiola's staff for the summer points to a host of youngsters making the trip. His role will be similar to that of Barry-Murphy's previously, with an onus on setting up the academy players in the shape of opposition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Al Hilal are looking to sign Napoli striker Victor Osimhen and Manchester City are lining up a move for Lyon attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki. - Saudi giants Al Hilal are looking to sign Napoli striker Victor Osimhen for around €40m before the start of the Club World Cup on June 15, says Footmercato. Osimhen, 26, is set to leave the Serie A champions after spending the last year on loan at Galatasaray and has been linked with every top club in Europe, including Man United, Chelsea and Juventus. - A move for Lyon attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki is being prepared by Manchester City, reports the Telegraph. Clubs in Europe are believed to be confident that a release clause in Cherki's contract allows him to be signed for around €30m, with Liverpool and Chelsea also previously linked. - Napoli are set to reignite their interest in Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, says Calciomercato. Paris Saint-Germain's Lee Kang-In is also seen as a potential alternative. The 28-year-old is reportedly keen to continue his stay with the Blaugrana, who are hopeful of reducing his salary to assist their current financial situation. It is said that De Jong's representatives are holding talks with sporting director Deco, with the club hierarchy optimistic of reaching an agreement over a new deal soon. Martinez, 27, had 12 goals from 31 matches in Serie A and helped Inter reach the Champions League final against PSG. ESPN's Julien Laurens on what the future holds for Lyon midfielder Rayan Cherki. He had a release clause of €25 million in January, but that is not valid anymore. Now, Lyon will want closer to €40m, even though he only has one year left on his contract. City are yet to contact Lyon and it's unclear where they would play him (as a No. 10 or out wide); Chelsea have long been admirers and contacted his entourage last summer but never made an offer;  Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes likes his profile but is busy trying to finalize a deal to sign Florian Wirtz; while Manchester United are keen and he would be perfect as an No. 10 in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation ... but Cherki wants to play Champions League football. Meanwhile, Dortmund and Fulham tried to do a deal for him last summer, but the player turned them both down. Dortmund will come back for him, but Bayer Leverkusen have also contacted the Cherki camp and see him as a perfect replacement if Wirtz leaves for Liverpool. The "ESPN FC" crew discusses why Lamine Yamal has the right mentality to not let his new salary go to his head and continue starring for Barcelona. - Cristiano Ronaldo, 40, will depart Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr on a free transfer and join a club before June 15 to play in the Club World Cup. - Liverpool manager Arne Slot will dismiss interest in winger Cody Gakpo from Bayern Munich unless an offer of £75m arrives. - Real Madrid are interested in signing VfB Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller after a recommendation from legendary Toni Kroos. - Barcelona will sign a new goalkeeper this summer, regardless of whether Wojciech Szczesny stays and signs his one-year contract extension. Sources have told ESPN that Joan Garcia from Espanyol is a priority target as the long-term replacement for Marc-André ter Stegen. - Multiple clubs are considering a move for Ajax midfielder Jordan Henderson. The 34-year-old former Liverpool star is set to make a final decision on his future this month, with teams in both the Premier League and Serie A looking at him. - Bayern Munich winger Leroy Sane is a free agent next month and has been linked with a host of clubs, but now Tottenham have joined the race. - Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate says he is happy at the club, but there has been "no real progress" in talks over a new deal. - FC Porto are accelerating efforts to complete the signing of midfielder Gabri Veiga from Saudi Pro League club Al Ahli ahead of the upcoming Club World Cup. - Real Sociedad will only allow Take Kubo to leave the club this summer if his €60m release clause is met. Kubo, 23, has a contract with the Basque outfit until June 2029 but is reportedly considering his future. - Marseille have made West Ham United centre-back Nayef Aguerd, 29, their priority target this summer but face competition from Bayer Leverkusen and Atletico Madrid.</p>

Gianni Infantino came across as the ultimate dad dancer when he appeared in a video with YouTuber Darren Watkins, known to his subscribers as IShowSpeed, but his claim that one of the football world's biggest names could make an unexpected appearance at the Club World Cup might not have been too far wide of the mark. Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo won't struggle to find a club and could sign a deal in time for the Club World Cup, should that somewhat complicated pull be impossible for him to resist. As well as Saudi Arabian champions and AFC Champions League winners Al-Ahli, the former Manchester United and Real Madrid winger has been linked with Saudi Arabia's Club World Cup representatives, Al-Hilal. Los Angeles FC is another potential destination and will host Mexico's Club America on Saturday with the final Club World Cup place on the line. Brazilian outfit Botafogo are also known to be admirers of Ronaldo. Ronaldo left Sporting CP for Man United after joining the Lisbon club as a child and could be in line for a dramatic return, according to reports. Sporting overcame the departure of head coach Ruben Amorim to Old Trafford last autumn and the extraordinary scoring form of United and Arsenal target Viktor Gyokeres led them to their 21st league title. If Ronaldo does fancy a return to the Champions League with his first senior club, he would be confident of extending his lead as the competition's record scorer. Between spells with United, Real Madrid and Juventus, the 40-year-old scored 140 goals in 183 Champions League games.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Napoli's success in winning the Italian Serie A title this season gave them a jolt of confidence and ambition for next season. One of their dream for next season would be to sign Kevin De Bruyne, who is leaving Man City, but the Partenopei might not have Antonio Conte in the dugout. Not keen on replicating their previous failure in competing after winning the league title, Napoli are already gearing up to improve their squad. As it was confirmed by the club's president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, who revealed to the media that his team wants to sign Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgium international is leaving Manchester City this summer as his contract runs out, and they have agreed to end their tenure. De Bruyne has several suitors, but Napoli are not backing down and seem confident in their attempt to snatch the midfielder. Meanwhile, De Bruyne has yet to announce his decision and might need time before deciding which path he will take next season. However, Napoli's confidence in signing De Bruyne for next season might have a slight obstacle as the club could change their coach again. The Partenopi's decision to take Antonio Conte as head coach earned them the Scudetto title this season, but things might be changing again. As reported by Italian media, via Football Italia, there's a strong signal that Conte might be opting to end his adventure in Naples after just one season. The tactician reportedly hasn't been happy with how things were going at Napoli and has been making his displeasure visible since January. The tactician's potential departure seems more likely following De Laurentiis' recent statement during Napoli's trophy parade. If the former Inter and Chelsea boss does leave, reports claim that Napoli will try to replace him with Massimiliano Allegri.</p>

Cristiano Ronaldo's chapter at Al-Nassr could be over if you are to believe his social media post, but the Portuguese legend doesn't seem to be headed for retirement at 40. He was able to win the 2023 Arab Club Champions Cup, defeating Al-Hilal for his only club trophy with Al-Nassr, but he may not have to wait long for a chance at a trophy at whichever club he ends up at next. A stay in the Saudi Pro League could happen with Al-Hilal reportedly being interested in Ronaldo's services, but it leads to the bigger question of whether Ronaldo could play in the upcoming Club World Cup. Slated to kick off June 14 with Al Ahly facing Inter Miami, it could certainly happen. Not only are there reasons for clubs to pursue Ronaldo, someone who has been there and done that in a range of tournaments, but there's also the fact that this could provide one last stand of Ronaldo facing his greatest rival, Lionel Messi, in the United States. Every team can utilize that window, but it creates a chance for those teams to get their business done early and use the tournament as part of their preseason training. Technically, a player could move to a team during this mini window and then depart after the Club World Cup for another side as a player can be registered for three clubs over the course of a season but can only play for two. So, Ronaldo could sign with a team and then move after the tournament if he would prefer to do so, even if that move is actually continuing his stay with Al Nassr. So many clubs taking part in the Club World Cup would love to have Ronaldo on their side, but a few of the bigger contenders could be Al-Hilal and Al Ahly of Egypt. If it's a short term agreement, some of the bigger European sides may not be looking to make a deal like that due to the impact that it could have on team cohesion but other clubs around the world could view Ronaldo as a mercenary to help them have a chance to compete with top clubs for winning this competition. There's also the personal aspect as a move to Al-Hilal would set up Ronaldo facing his former club Real Madrid. Also, being a team owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, there would be no issues ensuring Ronaldo is compensated in a similar way to what he is now. When it comes to Al-Ahly, they've expressed interest in wanting to beef up their squad ahead of the tournament as well, and while they may not have the financial muscle of the Saudi Arabian sides, the increased financial compensation from the tournament allows clubs to compete in areas where historically they wouldn't be able to. It also could set up a mouth-watering intro to the tournament where Ronaldo and Messi face off one last time, an event that would be priceless and unimaginable a year ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bayern Munich is nearing its final tournament of the season, the FIFA Club World Cup. They are set to face off against Auckland City, Boca Juniors, and SL Benfica this summer in the United States. As the tournament comes closer, let's take a look at how Bayern might line up their depth chart between the sticks. According to a report captured by @iMiaSanMia, the clubs plans for goalkeepers is basically already finalized. Per the report, Manuel Neuer will be first in line to take up the position (shock). Jonas Urbig, a very talented youth who has proved himself to be a more than good enough backup, will be second behind him. Chances are he may be played for the smaller games. That leaves three goalkeepers - Daniel Peretz, Sven Ulreich, and teenager Leon Klanac. He will be given this time off to prepare for his move, and focus on pre-season prep. Sven Ulreich will also not be participating, due to private reasons that no one really has any information about. And finally, Leon Klanac, a product of the youth system, will be Bayern's third and last option to go in goal. What do you think of the depth chart? Should Neuer be pushed down a level? Looking for some final thoughts on the Florian Wirtz saga? What about a conversation with one of our BPW staffers who actually spoke to Wirtz?
