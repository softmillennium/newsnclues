                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AMD has acquired Enosemi, a startup designing custom materials to support silicon photonics product development. AMD and other chipmakers have shown an increasing interest in the tech. Late last year, AMD reportedly teamed up with several Taiwan startups for a silicon photonics R&D collaboration. “As AI models grow larger and more complex, the need for faster, more efficient data movement is accelerating,” Brian Armick, SVP of tech and engineering at AMD, wrote in a blog post. “Enosemi has collaborated with us as an external development partner on photonics, and this acquisition extends that successful relationship. Now, as part of AMD, the team will help us immediately scale our ability to support and develop a variety of photonics and co-packaged optics solutions across next-gen AI systems.” Prior to its exit, Enosemi raised $150,000 in VC funding from backers including New Mexico Vintage Fund. Novack's LinkedIn profile now lists him as a silicon design engineering fellow at AMD. (AMD reached an agreement to sell ZT Systems' server-manufacturing business for $3 billion earlier this month.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla's Cybertruck sales dropped significantly in recent quarters, leading to a rapid buildup of unsold inventory. One such location, per Crains Detroit Business, is a Detroit shopping center that is now in violation of city code for storing dozens of Cybertrucks and other unsold Teslas in its parking lot. No doubt the parking lot looks like a dystopian graveyard with rows upon rows of shiny silver Cybertrucks taking up space where shoppers once came to visit the now-closed Bed, Bath and Beyond and Torrid. Crain's reports that the shopping center landlord has been informed of the violation, but enforcement could take some time. While still outselling other electric trucks, Tesla's Cybertruck has underperformed CEO Elon Musk's hopes for its success after eight recalls within a year and the automaker's brand devaluation due to Musk's political involvement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nancy Mace, the South Carolina Republican congresswoman, often tells her staff that she's a self-taught coder—just one aspect of how Mace presents her tech expertise, as befits her role in shaping the GOP's policies on technology and work as chair of the House subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation. “I would say [it was] at least a weekly comment, if not daily,” says one of several former Mace staffers who spoke with WIRED. They also claim she requested that staffers make their own burner accounts to defend her online. “We had to make multiple accounts, burner accounts, and go and reply to comments, saying things that weren't true—even Reddit forums,” a former staffer says. “It would be a slap in the face to taxpayers across the country for me to spent [sic] time on their dime commenting on my bosses [sic] personal life,” Sydney Long, Mace's communications director, writes in an email to WIRED. She is married to her job and that is all the media should care about.” Mace's office did not answer a detailed list of questions on the programming languages in which she is proficient and what types of devices she uses for coding. Mace, who staff said once identified as a “never Trumper,” has become one of the president's staunchest allies on Capitol Hill. (This legislation, Mace confirmed, purposefully targeted Representative Sarah McBride from Delaware, the first openly transgender member of Congress.) She also has a guiding hand on technology policy; earlier this year, for example, she reintroduced a bill she previously cosponsored in 2023, the Modernizing Government Technology Reform Act, which, if passed and signed into law, would require a sweeping audit of legacy federal IT systems. During the speech, she alleged three other men had committed various other crimes, including sexual abuse, sex trafficking, and taking videos of sexual acts without their consent. (Because Mace's comments were made on the House floor, she may be sheltered by the Constitution's speech and debate clause, which protects lawmakers from lawsuits related to their legislative actions.) In late 2023, before Mace's house speech, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division began an investigation into Mace's “allegations of assault, harassment, and voyeurism.” In an unrelated deposition, which was conducted by Bryant's lawyers, the congresswoman's passion for technology and alleged use of “Twitter burner accounts” came up at length. The terms hack and hacking appear a combined 13 times during the deposition given by Wesley Donehue, whose firm did consulting work for Mace's 2022 and 2024 reelection campaigns before he says he fired her as a client. “You need to know that Nancy Mace is quite the—when I use the word ‘nerd' or ‘geek,' it's always favorable, but a computer nerd or a computer geek,” Donehue said in the deposition, first reported by FITSNews, a conservative-leaning South Carolina outlet. In a post on X, Donehue claimed he stopped working with Mace because, he said, “​​I don't have time for her constant egotistical bullshit and drama in my life.” Donehue did not return a request for comment. At another point in the deposition, Donehue alleged that Mace tried to get into Bryant's phone because she found out he was using an unspecified dating app. And then when she got back from the Caribbean, she hacked into other apps—and I don't know what those other apps are—and seemingly found hundreds of photos and videos.” (In her February House speech, Mace alleged that Bryant “put my thumbprint on his phone” and then gave her "legal access” to his phone. During the speech, she also said, “Patrick Bryant must have forgotten that in my younger days, in my youth, I used to be a computer programmer … know enough about technology.”) Mace's staffers shared a similar assessment to that of what Donehue alleged: The congresswoman was often using rudimentary tools available for anyone with a professional account on social media sites, such as automating comments on her Facebook page for anyone thanking her.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For accounting departments, no software is more important than the general ledger system. Until a few years ago, Bek believed that VCs wouldn't dare to invest in startups building new general ledger software. It's not only difficult to get customers to switch from their existing accounting software, but building a new general ledger business is also very challenging, he explained. Bek changed his mind when he discovered Rillet, a three-year-old company leveraging machine learning and generative AI to automate accounting reports. Rillet founder Nicolas Kopp (pictured above) says thanks to machine learning and AI, his company's software enables accounting and finance teams at medium-sized companies to close their monthly or quarterly books in hours, a process that previously took weeks. Since launching its product last year, Rillet's revenue has grown five-fold, and it has brought on nearly 200 customers, including fast-growing companies like Windsurf, the AI coding assistant reportedly sold to OpenAI for $3 billion, and Decagon, an AI customer support startup reportedly valued at $1.6 billion. In the past, companies of that size would likely have installed NetSuite, general ledger software developed in the late 1990s that is still very popular with middle-sized companies. It was this statistic that helped Sequoia decide to invest. “What I was watching for is that they start replacing NetSuite. The fresh funding comes 10 months after the company raised a $13.5 million seed and pre-seed round from First Round Capital, Creandum and Susa Ventures. According to Kopp, Rillet competes with NetSuite and other legacy platforms, but currently doesn't have a clear rival that leverages AI and machine learning to replace accounting systems for mid-size companies. Digits, another AI accounting startup, recently launched its autonomously-powered general ledger, but unlike Rillet, it targets small businesses that use QuickBooks and Xero.

The Sandisk WD Black SN8100 is the pinnacle of SSD design, bringing fantastic performance and power efficiency in one nice package. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Aside from chart-topping performance in almost every category, including the all-important random read performance, it's also one of the most efficient drives we've ever tested. Sandisk doesn't skimp anywhere and even promises an 8TB SKU later this year, making it essentially impossible to find a better all-around drive. It's going to be overkill for most things, but sometimes that's part of the fun. However, Sandisk indicates that an 8TB SKU is expected later this year. This is a point in the drive's favor, as 8TB remains desired by enthusiasts and is often a difficult capacity to hit. The company nailed it with that model, and it has become the de facto choice if you want a fast 8TB drive. Sandisk waited to bring out its answer to Phison's early adopter E26 controller drives, and the performance specifications do not disappoint. The drive can reach up to 14,900 / 14,000 MB/s for sequential writes and up to 2,300K / 2,400K random read and write IOPS. While these numbers aren't record-setting per se, Phison had to work very hard with its controller technology – creating the so-called Max14um SSD platform – to reach or surpass 14,000 MB/s. It's fair to expect that the WD Black SN8100 can push these more consistently. The drive supports hardware encryption through TCG Opal 2.02. Sandisk backs the drive with a 5-year, 600TB of writes per TB capacity warranty. Models are offered with and without heatsinks. In general, we recommend a heatsink for any drive of this caliber, and $20 is a fair price for an upgrade. Sandisk is almost second-to-none in terms of its software and support. The drive comes with free downloads for Acronis True Image, an OEM version of the popular backup software for cloning and imaging, as well as the WD Dashboard. This all-in-one SSD toolbox has you covered for features, health information, firmware updates, and more. In this department, Sandisk has come a long way to matching Samsung's Magician and software offerings, which makes the WD Black SN8100 feel like a premium product. The WD Black SN8100 is single-sided at all of the launch capacities, which means it can be used in laptops and other devices that can't fit some double-sided drives. You had to go with the Samsung 990 Pro to get the highest level of performance from the last generation of drives if you needed a single-sided solution. Drives built on Silicon Motion's SM2508 controller are an exception, but until today, the main example of that was the OEM Micron 4600. The WD Black SN8100 uses Kioxia's 218-Layer BiCS8 TLC flash along with DDR4 memory for metadata caching. We've seen this flash before on the excellent WD Black SN7100, a drive with fantastic power efficiency. The 4600 uses Micron's flash instead, which makes it very interesting to compare these two drives. Fewer planes could mean better power efficiency and also better optimization for small I/O, which is generally preferred among enthusiasts. This makes the WD Black SN8100 feel more agile – insanely so for a drive of this caliber, to be frank – which will make it hard to beat even with the same controller if you're looking for an all-around solution. One possible drawback to mention here is the use of DDR4 rather than a lower-power option, such as the 990 Pro's LPDDR4. In the grand scheme of things, this won't have much impact on power consumption, but it does mean that there is some small room for improvement. Luckily, this isn't a serious negative, as the controller has proven itself to be very powerful and efficient. This helps more at smaller capacities to eke out maximum performance rather than just push at higher capacities, given that even the E26's 2,400 MT/s is sufficient to saturate x4 PCIe 5.0 with eight flash channels. A higher interface rate can also lead to latency improvements, which are always welcome, providing a more responsive experience. Not to leave Phison out in the cold, this also applies to its 7nm Phison E31T controller, which we tested with BiCS8 flash in the past. Especially as the SM2508 is not a proprietary part.

AMD's recently announced mid-range RX 9060 XT 16GB has been put to the test in Geekbench across Vulkan and OpenCL, where it allegedly leads its predecessor by up to 30%. This test was likely and inadvertently made public by a reviewer, consistent with previous product launches. We strongly advise viewing these tests with skepticism, firstly due to their preliminary nature and secondly because synthetic benchmarks only provide a partial glimpse of a GPU's real-world capabilities. After weeks of rumors and leaks, AMD finally lifted the veil off its budget RX 9060 XT GPUs at Computex last week. The RX 9060 XT family comes in 8GB ($299) and 16GB ($349) flavors, both using the same 200mm^2 Navi 48 GPU core with 32 Compute Units or 2,048 Stream Processors. AMD has transitioned to a PCIe 5.0 x16 (64 GB/s) interface for these GPUs, as opposed to the PCIe 4.0 x8 (16 GB/s) on last-generation RX 7600 XT cards. Likewise, the RX 9060 XT features a 3.13 GHz boost clock speed, extendable via manual or factory overclocking, along with a 150W/160W Total Board Power (TBP). We've compiled publicly available test results for various relevant GPUs in Vulkan and OpenCL using Geekbench's repository. This marks a solid 31.21% improvement over its last-generation counterpart, the RX 7600 XT, in Vulkan. As expected, this anomaly stems from the inherent design differences between the two GPUs, and we'll only get a clear picture once independent reviews go live.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As we enter the colder months in Australia, covid is making headlines again, this time due to the emergence of a new variant: NB.1.8.1. Last week, the World Health Organization designated NB.1.8.1 as a “variant under monitoring”, owing to its growing global spread and some notable characteristics which could set it apart from earlier variants. So what do you need to know about this new variant? More than five years since covid was initially declared a pandemic, we're still experiencing regular waves of infections. Genomic sequencing has confirmed NB.1.8.1 is among the circulating strains in Australia, and generally increasing. Of cases sequenced up to May 6 across Australia, NB.1.8.1 ranged from less than 10% in South Australia to more than 40% in Victoria. By late April 2025, it comprised roughly 10.7% of all submitted sequences—up from just 2.5% four weeks prior. While the absolute number of cases sequenced was still modest, this consistent upward trend has prompted closer monitoring by international public health agencies. According to the WHO, NB.1.8.1 was first detected from samples collected in January 2025. “Recombinant” is where a new variant arises from the genetic mixing of two or more existing variants. Like its predecessors, NB.1.8.1 carries a suite of mutations in the spike protein. It's early days for this variant, so we don't have much data on what these changes mean yet. But a recent preprint (a study that has not yet been peer reviewed) offers some clues about why NB.1.8.1 may be gathering traction. Using lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested—suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains. These factors could explain its rise in sequencing data. But importantly, the WHO has not yet observed any evidence it causes more severe disease compared to other variants. Reports suggest symptoms of NB.1.8.1 should align closely with other Omicron subvariants. Common symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, fever, mild cough, muscle aches, and nasal congestion. There's potential for this variant to play a significant role in Australia's winter respiratory season. Public health responses remain focused on close monitoring, continued genomic sequencing, and promoting the uptake of updated covid boosters. Even if neutralising antibody levels are modestly reduced against NB.1.8.1, the WHO has noted current covid vaccines should still protect against severe disease with this variant. The most recent booster available in Australia and many other countries targets JN.1, from which NB.1.8.1 is descended. Ahead of winter and with a new variant on the scene, now may be a good time to consider another covid booster if you're eligible. For some people, particularly those who are medically vulnerable, covid can still be a serious disease. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

A new trial suggests a combination vaccine may offer equal or better protection against both flu and covid-19 compared to current vaccines. During a radio interview this past Sunday, RFK Jr. argued that autism was worse than the pandemic because "COVID killed old people."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jennifer Richman, a spokesperson for LexisNexis, told TechCrunch that an unknown hacker accessed the company's GitHub account. Richman said LexisNexis received a report on April 1, 2025 “from an unknown third party claiming to have accessed certain information.” The company would not say if it had received a ransom demand from the hacker. LexisNexis uses swathes of consumer information to help companies detect potentially fraudulent transactions, as well as to perform risk assessment and due diligence on would-be customers. Last year, The New York Times reported that car manufacturers were among several companies that shared data on vehicle driving habits with LexisNexis without car owners' explicit permission. Law enforcement agencies also use LexisNexis for obtaining personal information on suspects, such as names, home addresses, and call records. Earlier this month, the Trump administration scrapped a plan that would have restricted data brokers from selling Americans' personal and financial information, including Social Security numbers. White House official Russell Vought wrote in a Federal Register notice that the Biden-era rule, which would have required data brokers to follow the same federal privacy rules as credit bureaus and renter-screening companies, was “not necessary or appropriate,” despite long-standing calls by privacy advocates to close the loophole.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tech companies are betting heavily that nuclear power can help deliver the electricity they need to realize their AI plans. But data centers need power tomorrow, and the nuclear industry isn't known for its speed. Trey Lauderdale thinks AI can give nuclear the speed that it needs. “They're like the coaches of our flag football team,” he said. Diablo Canyon, near Lauderdale's home in San Luis Obispo, has around 2 billion pages worth, he said. Lauderdale said the deal led to inquiries from other nuclear power companies. When Atomic Canyon first started, its AI engineers tested various models with underwhelming results. “We quickly realized the AI hallucinates when it sees these nuclear words,” Lauderdale said. So Lauderdale talked his way into a meeting with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which conducts nuclear research and also happens to have the world's second fastest supercomputer. Atomic Canyon's models use sentence embedding, which is particularly suited to indexing documents. It tasks them with making a nuclear power plant's documents searchable using retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. For now, Atomic Canyon is sticking to document search, in part because the stakes are lower. Eventually, Lauderdale envisions Atomic Canyon's AI creating “a first round draft” of documents, complete with references. “You are always going to have a human in the loop here,” he said. Lauderdale didn't put a timeline on that effort, though.

An alleged picture of the socket that is expected to host Intel's next-generation Diamond Rapids (Xeon seventhgeneration) family of server CPUs has emerged, as spotted by HXL on X. Last August, test tool listings for partners indicated that Intel's future Diamond Rapids processors will reportedly require a new Oak Stream platform with its LGA9324 socket. Prototype cooler designs from Dynatron suggest Intel will fragment Diamond Rapids into AP and SP flavors, and so we might see a toned-down socket under the Oak Stream family for Diamond Rapids-SP. Currently, Intel's largest socket, LGA7529, features at least 7,529 contacts, while AMD's SP5 offers 6,096. Xeon 6900P CPUs, utilizing the LGA7529 socket, offer up to 128 P-cores, support 12 DDR5 memory channels, and can reach a TDP of 500W. With a nearly 30% increase in pin-counts, expect more I/O, memory channels, increased TDPs, and even core counts. While we don't have a banana for scale, visually, this is a massive socket, dwarfing LGA1851 (used by Arrow Lake) by almost five times. What this means is that Intel is probably validating Diamond Rapids as we speak with their partners, and who knows if benchmarks or even an actual CPU sample surfaces soon? Rumored to be built using 18A, the launch of Diamond Rapids hinges greatly on its High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) readiness, with Panther Lake targeting HVM by late 2025. This isn't an apples-to-apples comparison since Panther Lake's Compute Tile (Likely 18A) is expected to span between 100-150mm^2, while Compute Tiles on Intel's Xeon processors can be as large as 600mm^2. Even though Intel hasn't confirmed an exact release window for Diamond Rapids, we can expect these CPUs to arrive sometime in 2026, rivaling AMD's Venice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jesse Armstrong hadn't planned on making another project about billionaires. The Succession creator was taking a break after finishing HBO's Emmy-winning series about the ludicrously wealthy siblings fighting for control over their father's media conglomerate, which ended in May 2023. But while writing a review of journalist Michael Lewis' book Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon, about crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, Armstrong got sucked into listening to podcasts featuring tech elites. It inspired him to write and direct his first feature: Mountainhead, a movie about three tech billionaires and their less rich, deeply insecure friend, all of whom have far too much power at their disposal. “I couldn't get the … tech voice, tech man voice, a billionaire, out of my head,” Armstrong says, noting that to him, that voice embodies both “supreme confidence in their analytical abilities” and “arrogance.” Armstrong is being nice here. The film, which will start streaming on HBO May 31, stars Steve Carell as venture capitalist Randall; Jason Schwartzman as Hugo Van Yalk, whose nickname “Souper” is a reference to a soup kitchen—and his lower net worth; Cory Michael Smith as Venis, a Zuck-Elon figure unleashing hyperrealistic deepfakes on his platform Traam; and Ramy Youssef as Jeff, who plans on profiting big from releasing AI that can counter the chaos his pal Venis is wreaking on the world. Mountainhead came together in just a few months, against the backdrop of President Donald Trump's second term in office, much of which has been dominated by Elon Musk's DOGE mission. While Carell says there were upsides to the tight turnaround—“everyone's just trusting their gut”—Schwartzman says quickly attaining fluency in the “tech voice” Armstrong was going for was a challenge for him. While Armstrong acknowledges that some people might react to his latest project by asking, “Why should I care about these rich assholes,” he refrains from outright making a judgment about them. The film sees Randall grappling with a terminal cancer prognosis that he refuses to accept, demanding his doctor find a solution, and later banking on the idea of having his consciousness immortalized by tech. It's a storyline that mimics real-world transhumanism movements, where entrepreneurs like Bryan Johnson are determined not to die. “I think people are naturally afraid of death,” Carell says. It's too bad that part doesn't feel like satire.

Nvidia suppliers building its Blackwell AI server racks have reportedly solved a series of technical hurdles, allowing them to accelerate production of the GB200 AI rack. Shipments of the GB200 were delayed due to technical issues that emerged at the end of last year, disrupting production. Nvidia's Taiwanese partners announced at Computex 2025 that shipments of the GB200 racks had commenced at the end of Q1 2025, the FT wrote, stating that "production capacity was now being rapidly scaled up." One engineer at an unnamed partner manufacturer of Nvidia reportedly told FT that internal testing revealed connectivity problems, requiring supply chain collaboration with Nvidia two or three months ago. FT reports that supply chain partners have spent "several months" tackling other challenges with the GB200 racks, including overheating and leaks in the liquid cooling systems. Other issues cited by engineers reportedly include "software bugs and inter-chip connectivity problems stemming from the complexity of synchronising such a large number of processors."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company revealed its dual-GPU plans to us at Computex When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. All of Sparkle's Arc Pro B60 graphics cards carry Intel's BMG-G21 graphics processing unit with 2560 stream processors (20 Xe cores, 160 ray tracing, and 160 XMX cores), mated with 24GB of GDDR6 memory using a 192-bit interface. The boards are aimed at a wide range of applications, including AI inference, computer-aided design, professional graphics, and media encoding/decoding. To ensure that the cards are tailored for various deployments, they come with different cooling systems, including a blower cooler that can be used both for desktop workstations and rack servers; a passive cooler for servers; and a liquid cooler. For some reason, Sparkle only demonstrated its Arc Pro B60 cards with a blower and passive cooler, but the liquid-cooled board was referenced, listed as ‘Prototype B.' So, while it is likely that the liquid-cooled Arc Pro B60 for datacenters will have similarities with this model, we do not know what the final product will look like. When asked about dual-GPU Intel Arc Pro graphics boards for AI inference applications, the company's representative answered that these boards are in the works and will be available later, if there is demand. Of course, there is a major caveat with all Intel Arc Pro B60 graphics cards, as BMG-G21 is generally an entry-level GPU, so do not expect such cards to challenge the best graphics cards for high performance, either for AI or graphics applications. Sparkle plans to start sales of its Arc Pro B60 graphics cards in the coming months. At this point, we do not have any information about their pricing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a fringe anti-vaxxer who somehow became head of America's health agencies under President Donald Trump, met with the president of Argentina and discussed establishing a new alternative to the World Health Organization, according to a tweet from Kennedy on Tuesday. And while the substance of their meeting is important, all anyone can notice on social media is their bizarre photoshoot. That's the Secretary of Health and Human Services holding a chainsaw that belongs to Milei and reads “las fuerzas del cielo” in Portuguese. Translated into English, it means “the forces of heaven.” Milei, a far-right ally of President Trump, campaigned on promises to deliver austerity to his country and slash government spending, often wielding his chainsaw. And ever since, people who meet with Milei will often hold the chainsaw themselves. Billionaire oligarch Elon Musk waved the chainsaw around earlier this year at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where Musk looked absolutely blitzed out of his mind. That conference in February, it should be noted, was the same CPAC gathering where two other speakers (including Steve Bannon) did Nazi-style salutes that mimicked Musk's gestures on Jan. 20. It's particularly odd for Kennedy to be posing with a chainsaw, considering he was investigated for using a chainsaw to hack the head off a dead whale two decades ago. Apparently the Milei and Trump governments want to create some kind of woo-woo public health body that competes with the World Health Organization. “I had a wonderful meeting with Argentine President @JMilei about our nations' mutual withdrawal from the WHO and the creation of an alternative international health system based on gold-standard science and free from totalitarian impulses, corruption, and political control,” Kennedy wrote. But some far-right figures have claimed that WHO colluded with China to hide the “real” origins of the covid-19 pandemic. The Trump regime's gallery of health-adjacent weirdos insist covid-19 was created in a lab and unleashed upon the world either intentionally or accidentally. Kennedy has been busy in recent weeks, firing vital employees of the agencies he runs, including the FDA and CDC, and rolling out new policies. Those are, of course, the most prestigious medical journals, but Kennedy called them “corrupt,” according to Politico. Kennedy would instead like American scientists to publish their work in “in-house” journals. As luck would have it, FDA head Marty Makary and NIH director Jay Bhattacharya recently launched their own medical journal called the Journal of the Academy of Public Health.

"They're going crazy over MAHA," Trump said to cheers at the White House on Thursday. Trials suggested the dual shot was as or more effective than separate vaccines. During his testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, RFK opined on abortions, vaccines, and MLK Jr. Even if measles vaccination rates stay the same, there could still be over 850,000 cases according to new research. During a radio interview this past Sunday, RFK Jr. argued that autism was worse than the pandemic because "COVID killed old people."
