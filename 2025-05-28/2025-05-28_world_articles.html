                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UN experts said that the law is explicitly written to target Palestinian children. A group of UN human rights experts is raising alarm over a recently-passed Israeli law that allows children as young as 12 years old to be sentenced to life in prison, saying that the legislation is likely a violation of international human rights law. The experts say that the law, passed late last year, is crafted specifically to target Palestinian children, as Israeli authorities often accuse Palestinian children of terrorism while not charging Israeli children the same way — one fixture of Israel's apartheid system. “[A]uthorizing up to life imprisonment for children as young as 12 years old is not consistent with international law,” the experts wrote in a statement this month. Israel often accuses children of terrorism for actions like throwing stones at Israeli soldiers or at cars, with Israeli forces killing many children for stone throwing over the decades and Israeli lawmakers passing a minimum sentence of three years for the act. Israeli officials have also long framed all Palestinians, including children, as terrorists. According to a recent report by Defense for Children International-Palestine (DCIP), the proportion of children in administrative detention — meaning that they are being held without charges — has reached a record high amid Israel's genocide. Citing numbers from the Israeli Prison Service, DCIP reports that nearly 40 percent of Palestinian children detained in Israeli prisons are being held without charges. “These figures highlight Israel's continued criminalization of Palestinian childhood and its deepening disregard for fundamental legal protections,” the group wrote, adding that children and their families are frequently forbidden from contacting their lawyers by Israeli authorities. That law, passed last year, allows child welfare benefits to be taken away if children are convicted of terrorist offenses. Experts say that the legislation is “overbroad” and not backed by evidence that such a punishment would deter supposed terrorist acts. “We note that Israeli law does not withdraw benefits from children convicted of other serious offences, suggesting that the Amendment does not legitimately aim to suspend benefits that may be unnecessary while the child is in detention, but serves an ulterior punitive purpose,” the experts wrote. This legislation, too, is aimed at punishing Palestinian children and their families, experts say, and is likely a violation of international law. However, Israel has continued to act with impunity, and UNICEF reported on Tuesday that Israel has killed or injured at least 50,000 children since October 2023 — with other estimates of casualties being far higher.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas allowed four employees with DOGE, which is associated with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, to access the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which is used by the federal government to distribute trillions of dollars in payments. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by Democratic-led states. The four members of DOGE with access to the Treasury system are Thomas Krause, Linda Whitridge, Samuel Corcos, and Todd Newnam, according to the judge, who also noted that another team member, Ryan Wunderly, was allowed to access it in April. “There is little utility in having this Court function as Treasury's de facto human resources officer each time a new team member is onboarded,” Vargas wrote. “For the avoidance of doubt, however, Defendants are not required to obtain a judicial determination that a particular individual has satisfied the Training, Vetting and Mitigation Procedures before such person may be granted access to Treasury Payment Systems,” the order concluded. James, a Democrat, had argued that President Donald Trump “does not have the power to give away Americans' private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress,” adding that DOGE has “no authority to access Americans' private information and some of our country's most sensitive data.” Lawyers for the Trump administration have argued in court filings that what the states had requested in their lawsuit is an overreach of their authority. “Plaintiffs confirm in their opposition that they seek something remarkable: A court order commanding that a segment of an executive agency be cordoned off from properly named ‘political appointees,' while giving access to select ‘civil servants,'” they wrote. In that case, the states' lawsuit could proceed against Musk and DOGE because it made a plausible claim that Musk's cost-cutting activities were “unauthorized by any law,” according to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan's ruling in a Washington federal court. The attorneys general of New Mexico, Oregon, and 12 other states filed their lawsuit in February, alleging that Trump has given Musk “unchecked legal authority” without authorization from the U.S. Congress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British officials face being banned from the United States if they are found to have breached the free speech rights of American citizens. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said foreign officials “complicit in censoring” American citizens and media companies will be denied entry to the US. The announcement is understood to have taken British officials by surprise. Diplomats were seeking clarity from the White House last night. Announcing the measure, Mr Rubio said: “For too long, Americans have been fined, harassed, and even charged by foreign authorities for exercising their free speech rights. He went on to highlight online, saying: “It is similarly unacceptable for foreign officials to demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies or engage in censorship activity that reaches beyond their authority and into the United States.” Britain's online harms laws have drawn the ire of free speech advocates and economists, who warn their broad provisions to tackle harmful online content could lead to excessive censorship and deter investment from American tech giants. The Online Safety Act is despised by Donald Trump's administration because of the massive fines it can levy on US tech companies. Under the law, social media giants face fines of up to £18 million or 10 per cent of their annual revenue if they fail to remove harmful content from their platforms. “In some instances, foreign officials have taken flagrant censorship actions against US tech companies and US citizens and residents when they have no authority to do so,” Mr Rubio said. “We will not tolerate encroachments upon American sovereignty, especially when such encroachments undermine the exercise of our fundamental right to free speech.” In the aftermath of the Southport attack in which Axel Rudakubana murdered three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club, officials threatened to arrest, prosecute and extradite American officials who violated hate speech laws. Campaigners raised her case with Mr Rubio as part of a wider effort to challenge what they regard as draconian hate speech laws across Europe. Asked for a statement, a spokesman for the Foreign Office referred to remarks Sir Keir Starmer made in February when visiting the US:  “We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the UK, and it will last for a very, very long time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of President Donald Trump's top immigration officials was recently paid an undisclosed amount to consult for a major immigrant jail operator that is poised to profit from the administration's fascist immigration crackdown, new reporting finds. Financial filings show that Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, consulted for GEO Group in the two years prior to his appointment in January, per The Washington Post. According to the filing, GEO paid Homan more than $5,000 for his consulting work. Because ethics rules allow officials to report within a range of values, it's possible GEO paid Homan far more. The consulting fees raise questions over whether the consulting amounts to a conflict of interest for Homan, who oversees deportations and border enforcement as border czar. Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats said that Homan's consulting represents a “serious conflict of interest.” “This news raises even more questions, and the corruption concerns are too large to ignore.” Durbin has recently spoken out against the Trump administration's practice of detaining huge numbers of immigrants without due process or oversight after a visit to two GEO Group-managed prisons in Louisiana, where people like Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk were incarcerated by immigration officials over their pro-Palestine advocacy. Prisons managed by the $4 billion company have received complaints of neglect, assault, and other abuses, while the company's cost-cutting measures involve such practices as paying incarcerated people less than $1 a day for labor. Much of this expansion is expected to be carried out by GEO and CoreCivic. The Trump administration has already awarded GEO with hefty contracts to reopen two facilities that had previously shut down. GEO estimates that the contract for a Newark detention center, awarded in February, will be worth $1 billion over its 15-year term, and will generate $60 million in revenue for the company each year. Meanwhile, Republicans have proposed a boost of $150 billion to immigration enforcement in their marquee reconciliation bill, including $59 billion for immigration detention and transportation, meaning that GEO and other companies could be poised for a major windfall.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Advocates for pregnant people said they are alarmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr's unprecedented and unilateral decision to remove Covid-19 booster shots from the recommended immunization schedule. A vaccine's inclusion on the schedule is important for patient access, because many private health insurance plans determine which vaccines to cover based on the schedule. “Covid-19's impact on pregnancy is deeply personal to me,” said Dr Amanda Williams, interim chief medical officer at March of Dimes, a non-profit focused on the health of mothers and babies, in a statement. “During the height of the pandemic, I cared for a healthy patient who was 32 weeks pregnant and tragically died from Covid-19 despite state-of-the-art medical care. The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), experts on high-risk pregnancy, said in a statement that it “strongly reaffirms its recommendation that pregnant patients receive the Covid-19 vaccine”, and that the vaccine is safe to receive at any time during pregnancy. “We also understand that despite the change in recommendations from [health and human services], the science has not changed,” said Dr Steven J Fleischman, ACOG president. “It is very clear that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,” said Fleischman. Kennedy made the announcement on Tuesday on social media, flanked by Trump administration appointees to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – neither of whom are typically involved in such decisions. That agency's advisory committee, which is structured similarly to the CDC's, was also bypassed. Infants younger than six months old are at the highest risk of severe disease among children, with the risk to children younger than four years old on par with that of 50-to-64-year-old adults, according to the Journal article. “Kennedy's unilateral decision to change the CDC's recommended immunization schedule for Covid-19 vaccines demonstrates once again why he is completely unqualified to be the HHS secretary,” said Dr Robert Steinbrook, research director at consumer rights group Public Citizen, said in a statement. “In Congressional testimony on May 14, Kennedy said, ‘I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me.' Yet two weeks later he is making arbitrary public health decisions, defying norms, and with no accountability.” CDC data shows only about 14% of pregnant people received the most recently updated Covid-19 vaccine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iranian foreign minister says there can be no further talks if UK and European position is zero uranium enrichment After five rounds of talks between Iran and the US mediated by Oman, the two sides remain at loggerheads over Iran's continued ability to enrich uranium, which Tehran regards as a sovereign right and which the US fears leaves open a path to an Iranian nuclear bomb. After Mandelson's comments, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, posted on social media on Wednesday: “If the UK position is ‘zero enrichment' in Iran, there is nothing left for us to discuss on the nuclear issue.” I said there explicitly that we continued our consultations with three European countries during this period, but if their position is zero enrichment, we will no longer have any talks with them about nuclear issues.” He continued: “They must determine their own position, and we are not joking with anyone on the issue of enrichment.” On Tuesday, Mandelson had said: “Iran since the theocratic revolution has never been in a weaker state than it is now. But it still retains enrichment facilities which can produce … a nuclear bomb. We support what Steve Witkoff [the US special envoy to the Middle East] has been doing in his negotiations, which are making some progress.” The British Foreign Office said when asked for comment: “We remain committed to taking every diplomatic step to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, including through snapback [of sanctions] if necessary. That is the UK's longstanding position, which has not changed. “We have urged Iran to engage with President Trump's offer of a negotiated solution and we continue to liaise closely with our allies and partners on this in support of regional stability and to secure peace in the Middle East.” No date has been set for a sixth round of talks, but in a potentially important concession Iran has announced it may be willing to have US, and not only UN, inspectors visit and monitor its controversial nuclear programme. One idea is for an interim minimal agreement to be reached in which some US economic sanctions are lifted and inspections are fully restored.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite a criminal conviction, Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik tightens his grip on power in Republika Srpska — using Kremlin support to defy Bosnia's peace order and push the country toward its worst crisis since the 1990s war. Despite a criminal conviction, Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik tightens his grip on power in Republika Srpska — using Kremlin support to defy Bosnia's peace order and push the country toward its worst crisis since the 1990s war. BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina — When a court convicted Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik of defying an international peace envoy in February, it was supposed to end his career in politics. He faced not only jail time, but a ban on holding public office. Despite an international warrant for his arrest, Dodik has repeatedly visited one of his biggest backers, Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Moscow, using those visits to fan the flames of ethnic separatism at home. But it also reflects a local struggle: After years of growing tensions, Dodik is now in open confrontation with the central government and using Russia to bolster his position. Experts say that risks dragging the country into the greatest crisis since it was torn apart by civil war and genocide in 1992-1995. Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment by publication time. This year alone, Dodik has already made two visits to Russia. Then, he returned on May 9, as Russia marked Victory Day. Dodik was first elected the region's prime minister in 1998. Since then, he has come to dominate its politics. During that time, he has often relied on threats of secession to garner support among the region's ethnic Serb majority, according to Aleksandar Savanovic, a political sciences professor at the University of Banja Luka, the regional capital. Until 2022, such threats were “a good way to win elections without real plans to create Republika Srpska as an independent state,” he said. Then, around the time when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Dodik saw an opening to solidify Moscow's support for his regime. “It was a good moment to protect his power,” he said. Since then, Dodik has held multiple meetings with Putin and has become one of the Russian invasion's most vocal supporters in Europe. Ismet Fatih Cancar, a former advisor to the minister of security of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an expert on international security in the Balkans, emphasizes that similar ethnic allegations of repressions against Bosnia's Serb population underpin Dodik's secessionist aims. Those claims date back to the 1990s, when Serb nationalists' attempt to preserve an ethnically homogenous state fueled a civil war and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina. But Cancar believes they are “completely out of reality.” “I think Bosnians very well understand what's happening in Ukraine because we went through the same thing in the 1990s,” he said. Although separatist rhetoric is not new in Republika Srpska, the tipping point came in 2023, when Dodik supported the passage of a controversial measure to suspend the rulings of Bosnia's Constitutional Court inside Republika Srpska. Since 2021, German politician Christian Schmidt has held that position. Dodik signed the measure Schmidt annulled into law anyway. Prosecutors filed an indictment against him the following month. In February, following a lengthy trial, a court in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, found Dodik guilty of defying the high representative's orders, sentencing him to one year in jail and banning him from office for six years. “I don't know a single person in Banja Luka who supports Mr. Dodik, even in his political party,” he said. Even President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, usually a reliable ally, is currently distracted by his own domestic political crisis, Topic added. And Dodik's gamble that U.S. President Donald Trump would adopt a more accommodating stance on his nationalistic policies has not paid off. She believes that Dodik's visits to Russia were an attempt to shore up support among his remaining allies and supporters. “He used these opportunities to create a pro-Russia narrative in Republika Srpska,” Topic said. Signs of support for Russia are common in Banja Luka. A stand selling T-shirts to tourists features one with Putin's face alongside those displaying Serb nationalistic slogans. There is a Putin-themed restaurant in town, and Russia opened a branch of its embassy here in the summer of 2024. In 2018, local officials announced that they would begin construction of a Russian cultural center. On a recent visit to the planned site, construction was in full swing. At its center is an Orthodox Church covered in a web of scaffolding. Officials recently said that the complex will be complete this summer. Russia's influence in the region may not be merely diplomatic and financial. Moldovan authorities said that Russia used camps in the region to train agitators to provoke instability in Moldova around its October presidential election. Officials in Republika Srpska have denied the existence of such camps. Bosnia and Herzegovina's Defense Ministry did not respond to requests for comment or interviews with officials. Now, no one is sure how the current crisis may play out. While few believe there will be a return to violence, experts told the Kyiv Independent that tensions can continue to escalate and small-scale conflict is possible. In March, he announced that Republika Srpska would form an independent border police force, a potential major escalation. “If we accept this as a status quo, (Dodik) will take this as a form of support or silent acquiescence to what he's done and will move on the offensive,” said Cancar, the international security expert. “And then at that point,” Cancar added, “all bets are off.” We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

BERLIN, May 28. /TASS/. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz reiterated that there are no restrictions any longer on the range of strikes inside Russian territory with the weapons that are supplied to Ukraine.

"There will be no restrictions on the range. This will enable Ukraine to defend itself effectively, including by striking military targets outside its territory," he said at a news conference following talks with Vladimir Zelensky in Berlin.

On May 26, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that his country was lifting all restrictions on the range of weapons supplied to Kiev. According to the politician, the UK and France made the same decision. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the decision is potentially dangerous and runs counter to the attempts to reach a settlement. On the evening of May 26, German Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil (Social Democratic Party) denied that Berlin had changed its policy about restrictions on the range of strikes inside Russian territory that Ukraine makes using German weapons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. MARIE-LOUISE JAMES is a visiting doctoral researcher at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, working on a Ph.D. on the history of nostalgia. The term, originally coined in the late seventeenth century, described an illness that came in response to change and dislocation. Symptoms included fever, appetite loss, and heart palpitations. Today, society no longer sees nostalgia as a disease. Instead, it is thought of as a fuzzy, seemingly benign feeling about an idealized past. American policies based on the premise of restoring past greatness—the mythical and opaque “again” of Make America Great Again—have worsened lives both within and outside the United States. The most notable example came on April 2, 2025, when U.S. President Donald Trump rolled out a suite of massive, ostensibly reciprocal tariffs designed to restore the glory days of American manufacturing—resulting in a market crash. “We're bringing back an industry that was abandoned,” Trump triumphantly told voters, as bonds and stocks tanked. But he is not the first world leader to try cutting off his country in hope of turning the clock back. And various European states have embraced the politics of nostalgia. Although these governments were motivated by different economic contexts and global pictures, they were united by the belief that closing off the nation to preserve traditions would bring about economic and even spiritual health. Countries that embraced nostalgic policies either abandoned them or fell into ruin. China, for instance, was so weakened by its cutoffs that in the nineteenth century it became more and more subject to the diktat of Western imperialists. Europe's post–World War I yearning for an agrarian past helped lead to fascism. Washington, then, would be wise to not follow these courses. Otherwise, it, too, might discover that nostalgia can quickly turn malignant. In 1688, a young Swiss physician named Johannes Hofer wrote a dissertation on a “state of mind” that was gripping his country—the “grief for the lost charm of the Native Land.” The Swiss already had a word for this kind of longing in everyday use: Heimweh, meaning homesickness. But Hofer gave it a medical name, combining the ancient Greek word for “returning home” with the one for “pain”: nostalgia. Hofer accompanied this new scientific term with a clinical account of nostalgia's origins and progression. It mostly afflicted young people who left their rural communities to make a living either in more urbanized parts of the country or abroad as mercenaries. It was thus seen as a condition of dislocation and inadaptation. In 1433, Chinese admiral Zheng He returned home after his spectacular treasure fleet voyages. His impressive dragon ships had reached shores as far as the East African coast, where they dispersed sophisticated and elegant gifts in return for wild animals—cheetahs, giraffes, lions, oryxes—as well as spices and some cotton cloth. But the emperor concluded that this effort to globalize had been nothing more than an indulgence in exoticism, bringing no real benefits. Instead, he decided that any attempt to create tributaries would simply be costly, dragging Zhang and his subordinates into innumerable faraway conflicts as indigenous rulers tried to draw on the massive power of China in clashes with their rivals. It would involve entanglements that risked compromising China's core values and historic mission. The Portuguese Jesuits, for example, made themselves popular at court by bringing ornate clocks. But China knew that it was wealthier than anywhere else in the world, and that it could thus afford to turn inward. But they all stressed that history regularly required a reversion or restoration. China's attitude persisted even as it lost its economic position. The Manchu Qing dynasty's expansion efforts were focused eastward, in nearby Central Asia, not overseas. The steam engine remained untouched, left in its packaging crate. “Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its borders,” the Qianlong emperor famously told Macartney. “There is therefore no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce.” China was not the only Asian country that tried to freeze itself in time. Japan remained connected to the world for longer than its neighbor. But in 1603, it was consumed by its own version of globalization anxiety. The shogunate enacted its Sakoku—or “chained country”—provisions, barring Japanese people from going abroad. If Japanese people left anyway, they were prohibited from coming back. The government also cut off almost all diplomatic relations with other countries. Japan still maintained some trade with China through the port of Nagasaki and permitted some foreign books, mostly from the Protestant Netherlands. Some Japanese officials acknowledged that Sakoku might deprive their country of innovations. Officials also wanted to stop the drainage of silver, which had lowered prices and thus increased the cost of taxes and tribute payments. But there was above all a cultural component: an assertion of the values of a traditional society threatened by change. Both China and Japan thought that isolation would protect their civilizations. But in each case, their nostalgic policies greatly endangered them. Japan defended itself much more effectively than did China. But after the country was opened up by U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry, whose fleet of warships forced their way into the country in 1853, it took dramatic measures to modernize its economy. Soon, it adopted its own new ideology—one that called for imperialist expansion. Europe, unlike China and Japan, did not try to avoid economic development. Although Europe never cut itself off, nostalgia still crept into its politics. The widespread misery of that era made the old image of rural life appear more attractive than ever, resulting in specifically peasant political movements—such as the French Agrarian and Peasant Party—that promised a return to an idyllic, agrarian past. In western Europe, these parties never developed substantial enough support to win outright power. But the rural ideal was strong enough that it formed a key component in building new coalitions of a populist right. The left-wing French Radical leader Edouard Herriot, for example, declared that the peasants were “our silent master” and the “greatest of French philosophers.” To keep them happy, his government embraced price stabilization, subsidies, and market support to grow and protect agriculture. But it was in Germany that the most striking—and devastating—use of agrarian romanticism occurred. “We must recognize that without our own land, without our own peasantry, there can be no economic prosperity in Germany, that all notions of export and import and of the global economy are nothing to us but concepts that may be useful but can never replace our own living space and our own peasantry,” Adolf Hitler declared in one typical 1932 election speech. “These are the foundation of every healthy economy.” When Hitler wooed rural audiences in the south of Germany, he even wore antiquated peasant dress, with traditional rural jackets and, sometimes, lederhosen. The combination of racism and nostalgia was hardly uncommon. But Darré's agrarian policies ultimately had little effect on the material power of Germany. After being appointed minister for agriculture, Darré pushed for Germany to conquer territory so that the country's city dwellers would have fields to plow and settle, but he was hardly the driving force behind Germany's efforts to expand its borders. His efforts focused on creating a compulsory corporatist guild-style organization of farmers and pushed through a law prohibiting farms from being split up or sold by German peasants. He also continued his propaganda work, commissioning photographers to portray the glamor of handsome farmers working in the fields, glistening with sweat. But in reality, farmers continued to feel overburdened, abandoned by a government that wanted to industrialize quickly, largely for military reasons. The number of agrarian workers in Germany continued to drop. The lederhosen portraits were banned as unbecoming after Hitler became chancellor in 1933. After World War II, Europeans began to understand how critical nostalgia had been in the rise of fascism and the destruction of democracy. They therefore embarked on an alternative: encouraging a move out of the countryside while paying the remaining farmers substantial subsidies. But it was ultimately more an effort to keep the dwindling losers of globalization on its side while still moving the economy forward. Today, however, it consumes just over 25 percent of the EU's budget. Yet nostalgia never fully left the picture, and now it has come roaring back into mainstream politics. Italy, whose household appliances, textiles, and clothing trade were most vulnerable to the China shock, fell first, bringing about western Europe's first postwar populist government by making Silvio Berlusconi prime minister in 1994. But no country appears more afflicted by nostalgia than the United States. Anger about globalization and the country's growing diversity is, after all, part of what propelled Trump to the White House. China, Lutnick said, had created an “army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones”—jobs that would once have belonged to Americans. Now, he said, “that kind of activity” would return. Trump replaced most of his tariffs with a flat ten percent levy after the stock market tumbled. But no matter how high the rate, tariffs are unlikely to restore lost jobs, especially as the automation revolution looms. Furthermore, AI now threatens office workers in a way analogous to robots in factories during the first wave of industrialization during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Political nostalgia, however, can make people overlook the negative consequences that follow revanchist economic policies. As the world changes around voters, the familiar image of men working in the mines while their wives prepare meals at home is so comforting to many Americans that they are willing to make radical sacrifices to get it back. It is why U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent can argue that any tariff-induced pain is really a “detox period,” and why Trump can talk of tariffs as an “operation” and as “medicine.” The economics of nostalgia never work, and its inevitable failure only breeds a cultural nostalgia that may be even more dangerous than the cutoffs. As Japan slipped behind western Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for example, it became more and more insistent on its unique cultural identity, helping lead it down the path of imperialism. When the United States doesn't get its jobs back—and in fact loses more as a result of the disruption caused by tariffs—Washington, too, might double down on assertions of American superiority. The government might wage more culture wars rather than agreeing to any kind of retreat. After all, someone must be to blame for the failure of economic policies that so many Americans endorse. Nostalgia, then, becomes both the cause of problems and a coverup for them. It is not surprising that people are worried about the radically transformative technology of today. But history suggests policymakers cannot afford to be stricken by the malady of nostalgia. But as a policy prescription, it poisons discourse and breaks apart the body politic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spanish emergency services say four women and three girls died when a small boat carrying migrants capsized while arriving in a port at one of Spain's Canary Islands on Wednesday. Spain's maritime rescue service, which located the boat some 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) from shore, said the boat tipped over as rescuers started removing minors as it arrived at a dock on the island of El Hierro. Emergency services for the Canary Islands said four women, a teenage girl and two younger girls perished in the accident. One of the girls was found by a rescue diver. Local media reports said the small boat appeared to be packed with over 100 people. Spanish rescuers and members of the Red Cross pulled people out of the water. The Spanish archipelago located off Africa's western coast has for years been a main route for migrants who risk their lives in dinghies and rubber boats unfit for long journeys in the open sea. Nearly 47,000 people who made the crossing last year reached the archipelago, surpassing previous records for a second time. Most were citizens of Mali, Senegal and Morocco, with many boarding boats to Spain from the coast of Mauritania. The arrivals include thousands of unaccompanied minors. Some 10,800 people had arrived via the Atlantic to the Canary Islands by mid-May, which was down by 34% compared to the same period in 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now it's looking to dominate another market entirely — inside your car As a kid, John Giamatteo had a single dream: to one day lead an NFL team to the Super Bowl, just like his underdog-turned-icon hero, Joe Namath. But by his sophomore year of high school, he knew it wasn't going to happen. He'd virtually stopped growing, ending up at 5-foot-9, and his coach dropped him from quarterback to defence. That's going to be your journey,'” Giamatteo recalls more than 40 years later. That journey led him to begin his career at Nortel Networks in the 1980s. Now the native of Long Island, N.Y., has the first quarterback gig of his career, leading another notorious Canadian tech company: BlackBerry Ltd. Before we go any further, yes, BlackBerry is still a thing. Through its QNX subsidiary, it's now a leading supplier to automakers of the sophisticated operating systems that underpin autonomous and advanced driver-assistance functions. A year and a half later, BlackBerry is on its most stable footing since the iPhone and Android blew up its business in the late 2000s. Giamatteo and his team have slashed $150 million in annual costs, refinanced its debt, cut the headcount by 37%, shed more than a quarter of its real estate space and sold its once-promising cybersecurity business, Cylance, for a huge discount. BlackBerry has also narrowed its net loss to near break-even—though the bigger story is that adjusted operating earnings have soared, and it's generating cash again. But company followers are happy with the rebirth in motion. “The tough decisions that needed to be made have been made,” says Niall O'Keeffe, co-founder of Fifthdelta, a U.K. hedge fund manager that bought into BlackBerry in 2021. Giamatteo, he says, has put BlackBerry “back on offence, where it's generating cash and can actually invest in the fast-growing areas.” It “has completely turned the corner,” says BlackBerry's chair, Dick Lynch, who oversees a board that has largely turned over in the past couple of years. “It's always going to be, ‘What will you do next year? One part of that answer is: Deliver solid revenue growth at QNX. But it also means confronting a decision in the not-too-distant future that could cut much of BlackBerry's ties to Waterloo. “Anything is on the table if it makes sense for shareholders.” As CEO, Chen had his own car and driver (paid for by BlackBerry), flew by private jet for work (or, if a jet wasn't available, in first class—a stipulation in his contract), and travelled with an entourage that included a security detail and chief of staff. Giamatteo, meanwhile, is perfectly happy to fly coach on cross-country hops (he's based in Dallas but typically visits Canada at least once a quarter). His hotel of choice is distinctly middlebrow, too: Hilton's Homewood Suites or La Quinta. “He's a kind of Bruce Springsteen of the executive world,” says chief people officer Jennifer Armstrong-Owen, who joined Giamatteo at BlackBerry after working with him at Seattle-based RealNetworks in the 2000s, one of several former co-workers who followed him on his Canadian adventure. With his slicked-back salt-and-pepper hair, fondness for business-casual attire and distinctive accent reminiscent of fellow Long Islander Billy Crystal, Giamatteo comes off as a congenial what-you-see-is-what-you-get everyman (one who says “holy cow” a lot). When he was hired in 2013, fresh off his turnaround of database software vendor Sybase, Chen received stock awards worth more than $84 million, with a salary of $1 million and a guaranteed annual bonus of $2 million. When his contract was renewed in 2018, he got another $106.3 million worth of stock awards. Giamatteo, meanwhile, is paid $700,000 annually and can earn up to that amount in bonus, though it's not guaranteed. His stock award upon becoming CEO was worth just $6 million. “I like to think of myself as a pretty simple person,” says Giamatteo, who has three adult daughters with his wife, Stephanie. I generally don't get too involved in that kind of media stuff.” Indeed, it took a year to persuade him to sit down with Report on Business magazine for his first media interview as CEO. That might not be due solely to Giamatteo's modesty. In April 2024, four months after his appointment, a former executive sued both Giamatteo and BlackBerry for sexual harassment, discrimination and wrongful termination. “I'm very pleased that all of the claims against me were dismissed with prejudice, which is a statement,” he says (this means the claims can't be refiled). When his two older siblings moved out, they stayed in Bellmore, too. The Giamatteos were staunch Italian Catholics, and every weekend they piled into the station wagon and headed to church, where John was an altar boy. In 1986, during his second year of undergrad at St. John's University, a private Catholic school in Queens, Giamatteo had two life-altering experiences: He spent a term in Europe, which opened his eyes to the world beyond Bellmore; and he applied for a summer internship at Nortel, at his sister-in-law's suggestion. He spent the summer at Nortel's Wall Street office, and after graduating from St. John's, he returned as a financial analyst supporting regional sales teams. AT&T had been busted up earlier that decade, and all those recently hatched “Baby Bells” were upgrading their networks with digital switching and transmission technology. Giamatteo gained notice in the early 1990s after he internally championed a team member's suggestion that Nortel aggressively lowball its bid for a big switching contract. The gambit worked, and it influenced how Nortel bid on contracts elsewhere. It wasn't meant to be at Nortel, however. After an accounting scandal consumed the company, Giamatteo moved to Seattle in 2005, becoming chief operating officer of streaming pioneer RealNetworks, where he lasted five years before his young family got tired of the rain. In 2010, they uprooted for Dallas, where he became COO of an insurance software provider called Solera Global Technology. Giamatteo demonstrates new technology by Seeing Machines, a QNX partner, which helps keep drivers focused by detecting when they've fallen asleep, are using their phone, or have stopped watching the road. “We needed someone who had the maturity, could build the systems to take things we were doing and grow it,” says Dale Fuller, then AVG's chair. He had the natural skills to be a leader.” AVG went public, but the board passed over Giamatteo in favour of a higher-profile outsider as CEO. Disappointed, he hit the road again, landing in 2013 at cybersecurity giant McAfee as president and chief revenue officer of its consumer business. Private equity firm TPG bought control of McAfee in 2017 and signed senior leaders to three-year contracts. Then BlackBerry called looking for someone to run its cybersecurity division. He figured the CEO post would open up before long, since Chen was in his mid-60s. “He'd been a bridesmaid for a long time,” says John Dimitropoulos, who worked with Giamatteo at Nortel, RealNetworks and McAfee, and is now BlackBerry's chief strategy officer. “He said to me, ‘I think this is the one. By the time Giamatteo joined BlackBerry in 2021, Chen's lustre was long gone. The veteran Silicon Valley turnaround artist had arrived eight years earlier, initially skeptical he could fix the floundering smartphone franchise but lured with that rich stock award. Its touchscreen phones, based on the new BlackBerry 10 operating system, were a flop. During Chen's first few months, BlackBerry shed thousands of employees, wrote down unsold phone inventory and sold off most of its real estate. Chen was loath to let the phone business die on his watch, but after three years of further declines, he gave up. Fortunately, the business remained a significant source of cash. CrackBerry users who clung to their devices kept paying service fees that yielded $3.5 billion during Chen's tenure. And its server software, originally used by organizations to manage their BlackBerrys, and later other mobile devices, remained a viable, albeit declining, business known today as BlackBerry Unified Endpoint Management. Meanwhile, BlackBerry copied other fallen tech stars by shaking down companies it claimed were using its trove of intellectual property, suing if necessary to get them to pay for licences. Those efforts generated another $1.4 billion in revenue over the eight fiscal years ended Feb. 28, 2023. The company even won a $940-million arbitration award from chipmaker Qualcomm in 2017 after overpaying upfront royalties for phone sales that never materialized. While those revenues kept BlackBerry alive, it couldn't remain a corporate fungus feeding off decaying assets forever. Chen believed its traditional strength in cybersecurity was a solid foundation for expansion. In 2014 and 2015, BlackBerry paid a combined $765 million for three companies that today make up the core of its Secure Communications business: secure messaging company Secusmart; AtHoc, maker of a crisis communications platform for government agencies; and Good Technology, a rival device-management business. “I would not call us in a turnaround mode anymore,” Chen told Bloomberg TV. Lead director Prem Watsa, who'd recruited Chen and was chair of the compensation, nomination and governance committee, negotiated a five-year contract extension for the CEO. Later that year, BlackBerry bought Cylance for $1.4 billion, its biggest acquisition ever. But BlackBerry's results remained choppy, and none of the acquired businesses seemed to blossom. Plus, the senior ranks were in constant flux: A former Boeing and Cisco executive joined as president in 2019 and left that same year. Cylance founder Stuart McClure got $29 million in restricted equity to stick around after the acquisition because the board deemed his leadership critical. He bolted after just a few months, leaving behind his earn-out. Chen's tumultuous decade-long tenure at Blackberry ended when his contract expired on Nov. 3, 2023.CHRIS WATTIE/Reuters Few employees ever got the chance to meet him, since he worked from an office in San Ramon, Calif. (Chen didn't respond to an interview request.) Meanwhile, Chen's pay package generated unwelcome attention, which picked up after BlackBerry's stock price quadrupled and then retreated over a few days in January 2021. Retail investors, spurred by social media investment mavericks like WallStreetBets, were speculating wildly in shares of faded companies like GameStop, AMC and, yes, BlackBerry. “No one had ever seen that sort of thing before,” says Lynch. “It was a disruption to the evidence of what progress we were actually making.” CFO Tim Foote, who led investor relations at the time, had built BlackBerry's credibility with institutional investors, only to see many sell into the rally. Even worse, the meme-stock surge unlocked three million of Chen's restricted stock units that were meant to vest when they hit certain price thresholds—but from a fundamentals-driven share-price appreciation, not a bogus rally. That wasn't his fault, but the optics were terrible. At BlackBerry's annual meeting in June 2022, goaded by proxy advisers including Glass Lewis & Co., shareholders flunked the company in a non-binding say-on-pay vote. They also nearly voted out Watsa, whose Fairfax Financial is BlackBerry's largest investor. That prolonged sale process suppressed licensing revenue, which diminished cash flow. So did weaker financial performance by its cybersecurity business. Cash and short-term investments dwindled, and BlackBerry faced a deadline to repay $365 million in debentures in late 2023 (which it partly financed by issuing higher-yielding notes after Giamatteo took over). The stock reached its lowest level in 20-plus years, down 40% from when Chen joined. If he was terminated—or even if the board reduced his authority, duties or responsibilities, or made a material change to strategy that he disagreed with—it would force the vesting of a $90-million cash payment. In its weakened state, BlackBerry couldn't afford to ditch him. “It totally neutralized the board,” says another company insider. They were stuck with him” until his contract expired on Nov. 3, 2023. By that time, the board had a good idea who its next CEO would be. It had quietly initiated a process to select someone who understood the business and its complexities, and who would “be credible in all aspects, to all audiences,” as Lynch puts it. It was mid-October 2024, and analysts were gathered at the New York Stock Exchange for BlackBerry's first investor day of the Giamatteo era. The morning event kicked off with a video that started with one question on a big screen: “Do you know what the company BlackBerry does today?” What followed were responses from random people on the streets of New York. “Uhhh, I didn't know they still existed,” one man said. A young woman recoiled in disbelief that BlackBerry was even still alive. “When people hear the name BlackBerry,” he told the crowd, “quite often one question comes to mind: ‘BlackBerry, are you still around? Giamatteo's down-to-earth leadership style has already lightened the mood inside BlackBerry. He readily mixes with employees and is “not this iconic thing you're never going to talk to who stands on a pedestal. He's just in the group—no entourage, no security,” says QNX's COO, John Wall. Phil Kurtz, BlackBerry's chief legal officer, adds that when Giamatteo holds town halls, he feeds off employees' energy rather than just broadcasting remotely to the masses. “He wants and accepts very candid feedback,” says Kurtz. That's more than 255 million vehicles with QNX on board. And as automakers increasingly shift to building computers on wheels, QNX sits in pole position. When they started digging, he says, “we got very excited.” Car makers were abandoning their own software-development efforts and choosing QNX. The product was cheap—automakers pay an average of about $10 per car—so those that chose QNX were unlikely to replace it. QNX was founded in 1980, building the nucleus of powerful operating systems. By the time BlackBerry bought the Ottawa-based company in 2010 for $200 million (it had been owned since 2004 by car stereo maker Harman International), it was also making digital infotainment systems for upscale cars. That's not what interested Lazaridis, however: He wanted QNX engineers to build BlackBerry's next mobile-device OS. BlackBerry “couldn't have cared less” about QNX's automotive venture, says Kurtz, who worked on the deal. While its handset business disintegrated in Waterloo, Apple set up shop next to the QNX facility in Ottawa and began picking off dozens of its engineers to work on its autonomous electric vehicle project, Titan. The defectors included QNX founder Dan Dodge, a University of Waterloo prodigy who preached that software was the key to modern life. Meanwhile, car makers were adopting Google's Android OS for their infotainment needs, and Wall was concerned his business would disappear, “just like what happened to BlackBerry.” There was an off-ramp, however: Wall's group saw that it could develop other systems inside increasingly digitized vehicles. QNX was conceding the infotainment war to conquer a much bigger opportunity. The long-term fundamentals remain sound, despite some automaker delays and industry uncertainty due to Trump's tariff war. BlackBerry is also exploring further uses for QNX tech in the medical, industrial and rail sectors. As Giamatteo became CEO in late 2023, BlackBerry abandoned a plan to take QNX public but retain majority control. Investors weren't keen on it, says Giamatteo, and he didn't think it was the solution to creating near-term value. With the entire company under his charge, he established QNX and cyber as two standalone units, and focused on stopping the rapid decline in BlackBerry's cash reserves, in part by eliminating roles in finance, legal, HR and IT. As Giamatteo and his team dug deeper, they isolated the cybersecurity unit's biggest problem: Cylance. It had come to market with anti-virus software driven by artificial intelligence that protected devices from the cloud. Revenues grew robustly, reaching $151 million the first full year BlackBerry owned it. But as people worked remotely in the pandemic, making networked devices more vulnerable to attacks, market demand shifted toward products that provided detection, response and remediation—known as EDR—capabilities. While Cylance tried to stop malware invasions, EDR also fought the problem from inside, like battling a rodent infestation. Cylance shifted to serving smaller companies, but sales kept declining. It tried to catch up by building its own EDR offerings but that was expensive, and larger competitors vastly outspent it on marketing. By last October's investor day, Cylance was on track to generate $90 million in revenue and lose more than $50 million that fiscal year. BlackBerry couldn't afford to keep that up, Giamatteo told analysts. Without Cylance, it was a cash cow, generating $52.3 million in operating profits last year. In late 2024, BlackBerry announced it was selling Cylance to U.S.-based Arctic Wolf Networks, paying $144.6 million, barely 10% of what BlackBerry had shelled out for it. Nonetheless, analysts were pleasantly surprised—it was like found money for an asset they'd deemed worthless. Blackberry's standout division is QNX, whose sophisticated operating system dominates the software-defined vehicle (SDV) space even more than it once did the handset market. Secure Communications doesn't, and it's dragging down BlackBerry's valuation. BlackBerry could sell it and invest the proceeds in QNX, acquire another company, buy back shares or retire its $200-million debt. Or it could hang on and try to squeeze out some growth—though opportunities are limited. Its best hope is Secusmart, whose SecuSuite secure messaging platform features tight protocols and locked-down features that make it a strong alternative to Signal for sensitive government communications—a fact BlackBerry has promoted around Washington, D.C., in the wake of the Signalgate scandal. Or BlackBerry could wait out the current market volatility and keep banking cash from Secure Communications. Of course, selling Secure Communications would greatly shrink BlackBerry's presence in Waterloo, and it's a good bet the remaining company would take a new name (probably QNX). Giamatteo doesn't seem particularly sentimental about the prospect. For now, he says, selling is not part of the plan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The negotiating teams of Russia and Ukraine are working to finalize a list of conditions for a temporary truce, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. "So far, we have not moved to the stage of a temporary truce and cease-fire. First, the texts of the memorandum will have to be agreed upon and a list of conditions for a temporary truce will have to be drafted. That's what our negotiating teams are currently doing," the Kremlin spokesman said, according to a video published by Izvestia. "And the special military operation continues. We will get ready for the next round [of negotiations]." Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Russian delegation, said after the May 15 talks in Istanbul that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to present each other with a vision of a possible future truce. Later, the presidents of Russia and the United States, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, agreed to develop the memoranda by Moscow and Kiev. Russia and Ukraine will prepare a document on a future peace treaty, which may include a ceasefire and key principles for conflict resolution. Peskov said the document required careful review and preparation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Holed up in a Cannes hotel suite overlooking the French Riviera – the bay outside swarming with megayachts, a good portion of which likely belong to the U2 front man's famous friends – the rock star known to some as Paul David Hewson is clad in black, head to toe. Except, that is, for his stylish pair of rosé-all-day sunglasses. A perspective that is on full, glorious, it's-a-beautiful-day display in his new documentary, Bono: Stories of Surrender. Three days from now, Bono will walk the red carpet as Stories of Surrender makes its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, where hundreds of click-happy paparazzi will shout his name while heat-exhausted fans clamour on the sidelines. In other words, a normal evening out for the world's most famous Irishman. But this morning in his hotel, well, Bono is feeling a little out of place, no matter his shade of eyewear. After publishing the autobiography, Bono eschewed a traditional book tour for what he calls his “quarter-man show” without his U2 bandmates – a sold-out run of performances at New York's Beacon Theatre in which he mixed personal-history monologues with stripped-down renditions of U2 singles. A few years after the show closed, Bono turned to his long-time friend, the Australian filmmaker Andrew Dominik (The Assassination of Jesse James, Killing Them Softly, a series of Nick Cave documentaries), to transform the work into yet another medium for Apple TV+, shooting in stark black-and-white. Q+A: Wondering about the 2025 Cannes Film Festival's best movies and biggest controversies? Andrew was very demanding and wouldn't let me get away with anything. But not strong enough for him: ‘It's performative, mate! Bono is well-aware that the new film is something of a vanity project – he cops to it right in its opening. But the musician also knows that he didn't get to where he is, headlining world tours and bending Apple to his whims, by shying away from the spotlight. And the stories Bono shares on screen are far beyond the kind of navel-gazing, self-serving nostalgia trips that might be expected from other stars of his stature. The film opens with a haunting recollection of Bono's eight-hour emergency heart operation from 2016, before rewinding to his teenage battles with his emotionally unavailable, widower father and the lucky break he scored in 1976 when he connected with three high-school mates: Larry Mullen Jr., Adam Clayton and David Howell Evans, better known as the Edge. And if Bono himself seems more committed to promoting and pushing the doc than any other project in recent memory, well, that's true, too. A few days before the Cannes premiere, Bono turned 65. Next year, U2 will celebrate 50 years, a milestone that will be commemorated with a new book, at least one new documentary and a new Netflix drama series written by Anthony McCarten of Bohemian Rhapsody fame. Memory, its power and presence, is simply in Bono's atmosphere. “Part of writing the book Surrender was to retrieve memories that I lost, and then doing the play I ended up discovering ones that had really changed me, too,” Bono says. “I began to really appreciate my father, in playing him. Despite insisting he's no actor, Bono delivers a strong performance in his film. Explains Bono: “Lots of singers are mimics – it's our musical ears. Despite his assertion that he's no actor – seeming to forget, unlike my children, his performance as a rock-star lion in Sing 2 – Bono proves himself to be a great performer in Stories of Surrender. “Lots of singers are mimics – it's our musical ears. We all vie to have the best Bob Dylan impersonations, though Mick Jagger's is probably the best,” Bono says with a laugh. It was just if I can follow that level of songwriting.” Stories of Surrender doesn't focus much on the singer's long and sometimes controversial (i.e., white saviour) history of activism – work that brought him, back in 2010, to guest edit an edition of The Globe and Mail about “the African Century” alongside Bob Geldof. But the film's release has caused Bono to re-examine and recontextualize his legacy in that realm, too. “Being Irish, we definitely approach the injustice of the world's poor from a horizontal position – we're looking across to them, not down,” he says. “Ireland is a kind of encouragement for people, because if you were the poorest country in Europe, how did you get out of it?” “I‘ll say one thing: There are 51 reasons to be grateful for Mark Carney,” Bono says with a smile, before going on to rhapsodize about the Canadian Prime Minister's Irish roots. They're definitely from seeds that grew into very different trees, but I‘m grateful for both!” Bono poses with his children, Irish musician Elijah Hewson (L) and Jordan Hewson as they arrive for the screening in Cannes.BERTRAND GUAY/AFP/Getty Images Sitting alone in the room with Bono – well, “alone” is a relative term when there are assistants and publicists and camera operators swirling about – one cannot help but recall the stripped-down atmosphere of Stories of Surrender itself. “Part of this was asking, had I just gotten used to a certain maximalism?” Bono says. “At the Beacon, we were able to get to that level of intimacy because I had all this time with an audience who were just a yard away. Not that Stories of Surrender is some bygone, analogue experiment. Apple TV+ subscribers can watch the doc in its traditional form starting May 30, or strap on an Apple Vision Pro headset to get a more immersive, 3-D experience that feels akin to inviting Bono directly into your living room. Although that element gave Bono just a bit of skeptical pause, given that the last time he partnered with Apple on a quote-unquote innovative project, it resulted in U2's album Songs of Innocence showing up unsolicited in iTunes libraries around the world. “Apple suggested the VR element for this film – they offered us their labs to play: ‘We have this technology, do you want to try something?' I think as corporations get to that scale, they start experimenting,” Bono says. One of the charges that critics have tried, sometimes successfully, to stick on Bono is that it is impossible for a star of his magnitude and influence to see outside of his own bubble. “I have to be careful about this film, I can only watch it so often – that's the imposter syndrome you're witnessing. I‘m trying to tell my own story, to regain some of the dimension and the pencil shavings that you lose when you become a bit famous,” he says. Can I return some of myself to the band? Bono: Stories of Surrender is available to stream on Apple TV+ starting May 30. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moscow has only intensified its war effort despite calls by Kyiv, the U.S., and European partners for an unconditional ceasefire as a first step toward a peace deal. "When the U.S. sends signals that it wants to do something positive with Russia, then Russia ramps up its mobilization," Zelensky said, according to the NV outlet. While Ukraine estimates that Russia has suffered close to 1 million casualties during the full-scale war, it has been largely able to offset the losses by fresh contract soldiers. In late 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to increase the size of Russia's Armed Forces to about 2.4 million, including 1.5 million military personnel. Russia also aims to conscript 160,000 men for compulsory military service this year, marking the largest conscription campaign in 14 years. Although Russian conscripts are typically not deployed in active combat, Moscow has relied on financial incentives and pardons to recruit civilians for the war in Ukraine. Following the unpopular September 2022 mobilization, which saw over 261,000 Russians flee the country, Putin has avoided another large-scale draft, instead using alternative methods to bolster troop numbers. Men aged between 25 and 60 can be drafted into Ukraine's Armed Forces, while those aged 18-24 may volunteer to serve, according to the latest legislation. Zelensky said earlier this year that Ukraine has around 800,000 soldiers deployed against 600,000 Russian troops. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. DAVID G. VICTOR is Professor of Innovation and Public Policy at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego, a Professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution. Over the last few months, an elaborate plan to ensure China prevails in the global economic competition has taken shape. Wild threats of tariffs and restrictions on foreign supply chains are terrifying investors, who are beginning to sit on their capital and look for new opportunities away from the chaos. Washington needs to rediscover the value of innovation. Every area of future economic growth in which the United States is poised to lead—such as software, AI, oil and gas drilling, robotics, and electric vehicle production—depends on innovations that are impossible to nurture without reliable long-term support from the federal government. Both U.S. political parties once saw public investment in scientific education, training, and innovation as central to the country's future prosperity. Today, neither party reliably understands or champions that message. Instead, they adopt well-intentioned but misguided bipartisan policies aimed at cutting the United States' dependence on China and join together to bash Beijing, driving the rest of the world toward greater reliance on China. Stripping it for parts just as China is seeking to build an innovation apparatus that rivals the United States' would be suicidal. When economies are young, they have lots of ways to grow. Since World War II, at least a quarter of all U.S. economic growth has been driven by innovations that make it possible for the economy to deploy capital and labor more effectively. The U.S. economy is a prime example of how recipes for growth change over time. As the U.S. economy moved toward manufacturing, innovations such as electric power grids—perfected through decades of investment, tinkering, and research often backed by government funding—helped expand the United States' industrial output. The full story of how innovation shapes economies is complex, but a successful innovation system nearly always has three key elements. First, it establishes and nourishes a pipeline of new ideas. The United States has led innovation for decades because of its massive federal support for research, which began during World War II. Money from Washington is spent by research universities, national labs, and institutes; the ideas generated are spun into companies that power economic growth and competitiveness. The private sector has stepped in to supplement federal funding for R & D, especially in industries such as biotech and computing. This federal-funding system worked well because it married the government's prodigious resources to a relatively stable vision. On top of that, the government has proved reasonably good at determining how to best allocate those resources. Even as the United States' two main political parties differed on the ideal size and role of government, both saw immense value in backing innovation. When the Reagan administration tried to slash government spending, for example, total federal support for R & D stayed largely unchanged. Even during his first administration, when President Donald Trump proposed budgets that would have eviscerated R & D funding, Democratic and Republican lawmakers restored the money, keeping the nation's innovation system intact. This continuity of intent seems a lot less likely during Trump's second term. Republicans have chosen to align with the president to shrink the size of government and slash budgets, including for innovation. Democrats, reeling from their election loss, seem to care more about funding priorities other than science. Just in the past few months, with barely any oversight from Congress, federal funding for innovation has fallen off a cliff. Cuts are so severe that federally funded biological research labs are euthanizing animals used to investigate worthy topics such as the safety of new drugs and the effects of pollution on workers. This funding chaos has particularly imperiled the second key ingredient of a functioning innovation system: people. Science is an enterprise steeped in hope and characterized by delayed gratification. The typical scientist, after earning an undergraduate degree, spends another four to six years in Ph.D. training, followed by a few years of poorly paid postdoctoral employment. Despite the lack of short-term financial incentives, many of the world's best minds pursue science because their training—from tuition for advanced coursework through research apprenticeships—is largely paid for by research grants and universities themselves. When grants dry up, so does the well of talented people pursuing innovation. Since late February, university and government labs uncertain about their future funding have been forced to make layoffs. U.S. high schools and universities do not produce enough fledgling scientists and engineers to fully stock the country's innovation system, and to maintain the United States' research edge, the country must draw foreign talent. Across the United States, about half of all graduate students in STEM fields hail from other countries; in engineering, there are twice as many foreign graduate students as there are U.S. citizens and permanent residents. China has been the United States' most important supplier of scientific talent. Although the COVID-19 pandemic reduced these numbers, 300,000 Chinese students still currently attend U.S. universities. There are already signs, however, that this vital exchange is drying up. Co-authorship on papers in science and engineering among U.S. and Chinese scientists, for example, has been declining slowly since its 2020 peak. The United States does need to reduce its dependence on Chinese talent: in any market, overreliance on any single supplier is almost always a recipe for insecurity. Meanwhile, harassment of Chinese citizens, including scientists, at U.S. borders and on campuses has become more prevalent, a phenomenon that anecdotally has led Chinese families to be more wary of sending their children to the United States. Such reluctance would be a catastrophe for U.S. research universities—and a gift to rival high-quality English-language universities such as in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Both rivals and partners of the United States are adopting new policies to woo foreign scientists such as boosting employment and startup visas. Because innovation seeks to boost production with fewer inputs, it nearly always benefits from scale. Big markets offer cumulatively greater opportunities for innovation that makes products better through experience. In the first decade of this century, support from the German government (which was keen to cut dependence on nuclear power and imported energy and build local industries while also cutting emissions) created another big market for solar power. As the German and global markets grew, innovations led to still better-performing solar panels. The frontier of the solar industry then moved to China, where massive innovations in manufacturing drove down costs even further and helped make solar energy even more competitive with coal and gas. Over decades, this global approach has allowed solar panels, once a fringe technology, to become the cheapest way to generate electricity in many places. Although onshoring policies may eventually bring more solar production to the United States, as recently as 2023 about 80 percent of equipment used for U.S. solar projects was imported—mainly from China. A month later, it reversed the order after pressuring New York state to greenlight an unrelated natural gas pipeline project; by then, the damage to the credibility of U.S.-based contracts had already been done. And these risks for investors explain why, according to a Bloomberg tracking service, half the planned projects to build clean energy technology factories in the United States are now getting delayed or frozen outright. Mounting political and legal opposition may be able to roll back many of the administration's most noxious policies. European governments' attempts to reckon with this reality has inspired myriad political and economic reforms, including increased defense spending, more coordinated and less costly green energy policy, and trade agreements enabling access to new markets, all of which will make the continent more competitive. Starting in the 1990s, Beijing adopted an innovation strategy aimed at transforming its economy and, since 2000, has expanded its total spending on R & D by a factor of 20. Much of that investment flows through state-connected institutions, but the private sector's role has increased, as well. Chinese scientists are already revealing where they see their postgraduate future: at home. Two decades ago, about 95 percent of Chinese graduate students who studied in the United States stayed stateside for their first job after graduate school. Analysts who study innovation have often disparaged China for its focus on process improvements—for example, finding more efficient ways to use robots on production lines—rather than the invention of entirely new concepts. But process innovations have helped turn Chinese auto and battery factories into world leaders in those industries, just as they did when China's solar industry began to boom. These less lauded achievements play a key role in making the economy more productive, which is crucial as skilled labor gets more scarce and costly in China. Moreover, they are the stepping stones to more revolutionary technologies. For example, Chinese manufacturers of nuclear plants are world leaders in process improvements that make it possible to build nuclear reactors at low cost, despite the fact that the original innovations for most Chinese commercial reactors trace back to the United States. To be sure, China's R & D boom faces its own headwinds. Beijing is attempting to adopt reforms to reduce the Chinese economy's massive debt and overcapacity, including by stabilizing the national property market, whose stumbles have sapped consumer confidence. It is not too late to save the U.S. innovation system. But doing so will take a concerted effort across the public and private sectors. Universities are pushing back against the onslaught of cuts and federal intrusion into their research programs, which has helped. Scientists cannot be one another's only advocates. U.S. policymakers have not taken innovation seriously as a national priority. Just seven percent of congressional legislators belong to the High Tech Caucus, the only group in Congress dedicated to innovation. Reviving government support for science and technology requires far more than boosting membership in caucuses, however. In the absence of any credible strategy for reducing U.S. dependence on China, the prevailing anti-China consensus will continue to reward politicians who are hostile to foreign contact rather than managers who can make the most of it. Both parties instead must make the case that federal funding for research is not a partisan hobbyhorse but a source of long-term economic and political strength. Successful innovation often causes imbalances in how the spoils are distributed, and when important segments of the country feel left behind, they can turn against innovation itself. In some cases, carefully coordinated voluntary restrictions on exports, such as batteries from China to the United States and cars from China to Europe, will be necessary. At the same time, leaders must also find ways to keep the two innovation engines of the U.S. and China more closely connected, including by encouraging scientific collaboration in safe areas that are unlikely to raise national security concerns—something that leading Chinese and U.S. scientists already favor.China is making great strides in innovation. Reconstituting it from ruins will be even harder.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on May 27 announced that he would soon grant pardons to reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, who were convicted of bank fraud, tax evasion, and other financial crimes. Trump said that he planned on pardoning the couple within 24 hours. During a Tuesday call with Savannah Chrisley, the couple's daughter, Trump said, “Your parents are going to be free and clean and I hope that we can do it by tomorrow.” Trump said that the couple “was given pretty harsh treatment ... I hear they're terrific people, this should not have happened.” President, I just want to say thank you for bringing my parents back,” son Grayson Chrisley told Trump during that call. Savannah Chrisley, who was left as sole caretaker of her younger brother as sister, has long pushed for the release of the couple. In a pardon petition, the family alleged that the conviction was based on an illegal raid and relied on compromised evidence. Savannah Chrisley also campaigned for Trump as a prison reform advocate. The Chrisleys spent the money on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate, and travel—and used new fraudulent loans to pay back old ones. “After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from more than $20 million of these fraudulently obtained loans.” “To evade collection of half a million dollars in delinquent taxes owed by Todd Chrisley, the Chrisleys opened and kept the corporate bank accounts only in Julie Chrisley's name. The couple is best known for their reality TV show “Chrisley Knows Best,” which followed the family, centering around Todd—who presented himself as a successful real estate tycoon. The pardons come after Trump announced that he would pardon Scott Jenkins, former sheriff of Virginia's Culpeper County, who received a 10-year prison sentence following a federal bribery conviction. In January, the president also issued broad pardons for some of those arrested in connection with the events of Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
