            Spanish emergency services say four women and three girls died when a small boat carrying migrants capsized while arriving in a port at one of Spain's Canary Islands on Wednesday.
    


            Spain's maritime rescue service, which located the boat some 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) from shore, said the boat tipped over as rescuers started removing minors as it arrived at a dock on the island of El Hierro.
    


            The movement of people on the boat caused it to tip and then turn over, dumping the occupants into the water, the service said.
    


            Emergency services for the Canary Islands said four women, a teenage girl and two younger girls perished in the accident. One of the girls was found by a rescue diver.
    


            A helicopter evacuated two more children, a girl and a boy, to a local hospital in serious condition after they nearly drowned, the service added.
    


            Local media reports said the small boat appeared to be packed with over 100 people. Spanish rescuers and members of the Red Cross pulled people out of the water.
    


            The Spanish archipelago located off Africa's western coast has for years been a main route for migrants who risk their lives in dinghies and rubber boats unfit for long journeys in the open sea. Thousands have been known to die on the way to European territory.
    


            Nearly 47,000 people who made the crossing last year reached the archipelago, surpassing previous records for a second time. Most were citizens of Mali, Senegal and Morocco, with many boarding boats to Spain from the coast of Mauritania.
    


            The arrivals include thousands of unaccompanied minors.
    


            Some 10,800 people had arrived via the Atlantic to the Canary Islands by mid-May, which was down by 34% compared to the same period in 2024.

The US presidential envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has accused former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev of warmongering, following Medvedev's warning that tensions with the US could escalate into World War III.

Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, made the remarks in response to comments by US President Donald Trump.

“Stoking fears of WWIII is an unfortunate, reckless comment by [Medvedev] and unfitting of a world power,” Kellogg wrote on X on Wednesday. He added, “President Trump is working to stop this war and end the killing.”

Kellogg said the US is awaiting Russia's submission of a memorandum outlining its terms for a ceasefire, as agreed during the first direct Russia-Ukraine talks in three years, held in Istanbul earlier this month.

Medvedev was reacting to a social media post in which Trump accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of “playing with fire,” and claimed that, without his own efforts, “lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia.”

“Regarding Trump's words about Putin ‘playing with fire' and ‘really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one REALLY BAD thing – WWIII. I hope Trump understands this!” Medvedev posted on X on Tuesday.

Medvedev, who is known for his hawkish rhetoric, previously warned that Ukraine has “one last chance to preserve… some kind of statehood” by accepting Russia's terms. He also cautioned that failed negotiations could lead to “a more terrible stage of war.”

Trump has pushed for an immediate ceasefire between Moscow and Kiev and has threatened to impose new sanctions on Russia if progress is not made. He has also criticized Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, accusing him earlier this year of “gambling with World War III.”

The US president has frequently raised concerns about the potential for a broader global conflict. “There's no profit for anyone in having World War III, and you're not so far away from it,” he said during a business summit in Miami in February.

At the Istanbul talks, Russia and Ukraine agreed to a major prisoner exchange and pledged to submit detailed ceasefire proposals. Putin has reiterated that, for a full ceasefire to be achieved, Ukraine must halt its mobilization, stop receiving weapons from abroad, and withdraw its forces from Russian territory. He also insists that Kiev must abandon plans to join NATO and formally recognize Crimea and four other regions as part of Russia.

Luxembourg MEP Fernand Kartheiser has argued that the EU's confrontational approach to Russia during the Ukraine conflict has led to its own isolation.

The lawmaker made the remarks in an interview with RT released on Tuesday while on a trip to Russia that he was forced to fund personally due to the European Parliament's restrictions.

“Some people in the European Parliament… have an attitude toward Russia that identifies it as a big threat,” Kartheiser said. “They think that if we put pressure on Russia and isolate it diplomatically, that might help to find solutions in the context of the conflict in Ukraine… it is not the discussion that we should have.”

Kartheiser noted that the entire EU approach toward the Ukraine conflict and Russia has been counterproductive.

“What we have now internationally is that basically everybody talks to Russia. We even have the US coming back and having high-level contacts… the anti-Russia stance is diminishing,” he stated. “So this policy of isolation of Russia basically has failed. The only ones who are isolated in a way are the EU itself.”

The lawmaker's visit to Moscow at the invitation of the Russian State Duma aimed to discuss bilateral relations and the situation in Ukraine. The visit, however, drew criticism from hawkish EU lawmakers. The European Conservatives and Reformists group threatened to expel Kartheiser, claiming he had “crossed a red line.” The MEP called the threat “a regrettable part of the picture” and lamented that some EU lawmakers remain opposed to re-engaging with Moscow.

“The discussion that we should have is what kind of relationship do we want with Russia in the future? We have to open the dialogue again. That is most important,” he said, adding that there are politicians whose opinions towards Russia are shifting, while many ordinary Europeans would also like to see ties restored.



The MEP emphasized that if the EU “wants to be taken seriously as an actor in international relations,” it must abandon the anti-Russia policy and “have some kind of relationship” with the country again.

“If we, Western Europeans, are expected to take a larger responsibility for our own security, one way to assure this is by negotiating an agreement with Russia, ensuring at the same time our security as Western Europeans and guaranteeing the security of Russia's western border. So, negotiation and diplomacy before rearmament and arms race,” he concluded.

Israel has dismissed a report in the New York Times claiming that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to disrupt nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran by attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, calling it “fake news.”

The article, published on Wednesday, cited unnamed officials who said Israeli leaders fear that US President Donald Trump might permit Iran to retain its nuclear enrichment capabilities – which Israel strongly opposes. The report also suggests that US intelligence believes Israel could launch a strike on Iran with as little as seven hours' notice, even if a diplomatic agreement is reached.

Netanyahu's office responded to the article with a brief statement: “Fake news.”

According to the article, Israeli officials, including Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer and Mossad head David Barnea, met with US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, among other officials, to express concerns over the negotiations.

The ongoing US-Iran talks aim to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, while lifting the sanctions Trump imposed in 2018, which he claims left Iran's economy on the brink of collapse. A major sticking point is Washington's demand for Iran to abandon its enrichment facilities, which Tehran refuses to do. The US and its allies have expressed concern about Iran's enrichment activities, which they fear could provide the country with a head start to quickly produce weapons-grade uranium.

On Monday, US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem spoke to Netanyahu about the need for unity and patience in the negotiation process, saying Trump asked her to convey “how important it is that we stay united and let this process play out.”

Israel is not a participant in the negotiations between the US and Iran. Despite the belligerent rhetoric, the US and Iran have held several rounds of talks in Oman which both sides have described as constructive. Witkoff noted, however, that while Washington seeks a diplomatic solution, it has a “very, very clear red line” of not “even 1% of an enrichment capability.”

Iran currently enriches uranium to 60%, well above the 3.67% cap in the defunct 2015 nuclear deal and near weapons-grade levels. Tehran insists that its program is peaceful despite warnings from the US and Israel of an imminent nuclear breakthrough.

Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi recently called US demands to dismantle Iran's nuclear facilities “unrealistic” and vowed that enrichment would continue with or without a deal.

US health secretary calls leading medical journals such as Lancet ‘corrupt' and pushes to create state-run alternatives

Robert F Kennedy Jr has threatened to ban government scientists from publishing in the world's leading medical journals, which he branded “corrupt”, and to instead create alternative publications run by the state.

“We're probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, Jama and those other journals, because they're all corrupt,” the US health secretary said on the Ultimate Human podcast. He accused the publications of being controlled by pharmaceutical companies.

Instead, Kennedy outlined plans to launch government-run journals that would become “the preeminent journals” because National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding would anoint researchers “as a good, legitimate scientist”.

The three publications Kennedy targeted are among the most influential medical journals globally, established in the 19th century and now central to disseminating peer-reviewed medical research worldwide. The Lancet and Jama each report more than 30m annual website visits, while the New England Journal of Medicine claims more than 1 million weekly readers.

Kennedy has similarly accused the agencies he now oversees – including the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – as “sock puppets” for the pharmaceutical industry.

The second Trump administration has taken an axe to scientific research, with NIH funding cut by more than $3bn since the year before. Kennedy has also purged an estimated 20,000 health department staff from the government.

Adam Gaffney, a public health researcher at Harvard Medical School, told the Washington Post: “Banning NIH-funded researchers from publishing in leading medical journals and requiring them to publish only in journals that carry the RFK Jr seal of approval would delegitimize taxpayer-funded research.”

The health secretary's comments followed the release of a White House report last week that challenged medical consensus on vaccines and suggested pharmaceutical influence has prevented proper study of chronic disease causes in children.

Kennedy justified his position by citing decade-old concerns from journal editors themselves about pharmaceutical influence, including former New England Journal of Medicine chief Marcia Angell's 2009 warning that “it is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published” due to financial ties with pharmaceutical companies.

The funding cuts and personnel changes have prompted some US scientists to consider relocating abroad, with countries including France, Germany, Spain and China actively recruiting American researchers.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Defense lawyers argued prosecutors had improperly suggested Combs was involved in destruction of evidence

Sean “Diddy” Combs's lawyers on Wednesday morning called for a mistrial in the hip-hop mogul's federal sex-trafficking trial, alleging misconduct by prosecutors in the case – but their request was quickly denied by the judge.

Defense lawyers moved to have the case declared a mistrial by arguing that prosecutors had improperly suggested and implied through questioning that Combs was involved in the destruction of evidence tied to the investigation into rapper Scott Mescudi's (also known as Kid Cudi) car being firebombed.

Judge Arun Subramanian quickly denied the motion for a mistrial.

The abrupt development came shortly after testimony had resumed in court in New York, with prosecutors planning to call several witnesses to the stand, including an alleged victim identified by the pseudonym “Mia”.

Mia has been described as one of Combs's former employees, who prosecutors say will testify that Combs “forced himself on her sexually” while she was working for him.

The government's first witness on Wednesday was Los Angeles police officer Christopher Ignacio, who responded to Mescudi's call on 22 December 2011, the day Mescudi alleged Combs broke into his home after discovering that Mescudi had been dating Combs's on-again, off-again girlfriend, singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura.

Ignacio said he and his partner responded to a radio call for a possible burglary at Mescudi's home around 8.20am that morning. When they arrived, Ignacio said that he noticed a black Cadillac Escalade in front of the house that sped off as their patrol car pulled up.

Ignacio told the court that he noted the license plate, later when he ran the plate, he found that the car was registered to Bad Boy Productions Inc, one of Combs's companies.

Ignacio testified that the front door was unlocked and nothing was reported stolen. Mescudi later arrived at the house and filed a trespassing report, Ignacio said. Under cross-examination, Ignacio agreed with Combs's attorney that the incident amounted to trespassing, not burglary.

Last week, Mescudi testified that a few weeks later, his car was firebombed with a molotov cocktail. He said he suspected Combs was involved.

After Ignacio's testimony Wednesday morning, the prosecution called up Lance Jimenez, an arson investigator with the Los Angeles fire department who responded to Mescudi's home in January 2012 to investigate the fire set to Mescudi's Porsche.

Jimenez said that the Porsche had a cut canvas roof, burn patterns throughout the interior, and that he saw a bottle and a burned “designer” handkerchief inside the car.

The damage was “severe” Jimenez said, but told the court that it was less extensive than it could have been as the molotov cocktail didn't shatter as the cloth fell out.

Jimenez described the fire set inside Mescudi's car as a “targeted” crime.

Arson is one of the acts listed in the racketeering conspiracy allegations against Combs.

Combs, 55, faces federal charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution. Arrested in September 2024, Combs has pleaded not guilty to all five counts.

Earlier this week, one of Combs's former employees, Capricorn Clark, gave a full day of testimony, telling jurors that in 2011 Combs kidnapped her and forced her to accompany him to Mescudi's home the morning of the alleged break-in in December 2011. According to Clark, Combs said that he was going “to kill” Mescudi.

Clark told the court that Combs, accompanied by one of his security guards, entered Mescudi's home with a gun, while she remained in the car. 

Clark also testified that she witnessed Combs violently assault Ventura upon learning of her brief relationship with Mescudi.

During her time working for Combs, Clark said that Combs repeatedly threatened her life, subjected her to lie detector tests, and once pushed her in 2006 at his Miami home, among other things.

Since the trial began on 12 May, more than 15 witnesses have testified, including Ventura, Mescudi, singer Dawn Richard, two of Combs's former assistants, Ventura's former best friend and her mother, an exotic dancer, a male revue manager, a hotel security officer, a special agent from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a forensic psychologist, a makeup artist, the general manager of a Beverly Hills hotel and a computer forensics agent from HSI.

The trial is expected to continue for about six more weeks. If convicted on all counts, Combs could face up to life in prison.

Natalie Phelps, who has stage 4 colorectal cancer, has raised the alarm over how patients in the agency's clinical trials are facing setbacks in treatment

A 43-year-old woman and mother of two with advanced cancer is experiencing life-or-death delays in treatment because of the Trump administration's cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Natalie Phelps, who has stage 4 colorectal cancer, has spoken publicly, raising the alarm about a setback in care for herself and others who are part of clinical trials run by the agency. Her story has made it into congressional hearings and spurred a spat between a Democratic senator and the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr. Behind the scenes, she and others are advocating to get her treatment started sooner.

So far, Phelps has been told that her treatment, which should have started around mid-June, will not begin until after mid-July.

“I've done everything I can do,” Phelps, who lives in Washington state, told the Guardian. “There's nothing else I can do. I'm really just out of options. There's very limited treatments approved for colorectal cancer.”

Phelps is one of many Americans whose lives have been disrupted or altered by the ongoing cuts to government services made by the Trump administration's so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge. Some NIH scientists have lost their jobs, and others have seen their grants ended. Researchers told the Associated Press that cuts to the agency and its programs would end treatment for cancer patients and delay cures and treatment discoveries.

Phelps was diagnosed in 2020, soon after giving birth to her second child, and after her symptoms were dismissed by doctors for months. Since then, she's gone through 48 rounds of chemotherapy. She had an 18-hour surgery to remove her primary tumor, plus two follow-up liver surgeries. She's had radiation therapy to her brain, leg and pelvis.

Dr Steven Rosenberg's cell-based immunotherapy trial at the NIH offered hope. The treatment uses a person's own cells to fight cancer and has seen some promise for patients with colon, rectal and GI cancers. This was deemed an exciting step by the medical community because the process had previously worked on blood cancers, but not solid cancers, the Washington Post reported.

But these promising developments are coming alongside cuts to federal agencies, including ones that have affected these trials, Rosenberg has publicly confirmed. The trial itself was not cut, but it is experiencing delays because of staff reductions.

Phelps passed the initial medical steps to enter the trial in March, then flew to Bethesda, Maryland, at the end of April this year. There, they drew her blood to use to engineer T-cells for her treatment, which she previously was told takes about four weeks. Instead, she was told it would now take eight weeks, which the doctors said was because of funding cuts imposed by Doge.

“That got me motivated enough to start to really panic, because my cancer between March and April really exploded and progressed to my lymph nodes and my bones,” she said. “My oncologist was very anxious about the difference between four and eight weeks could make, waiting for those treatment products.”

One month can make a huge difference in late-stage cancer treatment, but the delay also brought up major decisions for Phelps. She wouldn't be able to do chemo for a month before the treatment began. With a delay, she could maybe do chemo for a bit, then stop a month before.

Then there was the size of her tumors – which would become the subject of the spat in a congressional hearing. She needed a tumor of at least one centimeter in size to start the trial, or an exemption – her disease was spreading in the number of tumors, not in one large tumor. The tumor would help scientists track how the treatment was working.

If she underwent chemo before doing a final scan needed to start the trial, tumors could shrink, affecting her eligibility. But if she waited for two months and did nothing, the disease could keep spreading. Her oncologist thought maybe the trial would have to be placed on the back burner, given the extended timeline.

Phelps posted on social media, explaining her predicament. After seeing her videos, friends suggested she reach out to her members of Congress, who could intervene with the agency and help her get treated sooner.

The office of Pat Murray, a Washington Democratic senator, got involved. On 14 May, Murray questioned Kennedy during a Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee hearing, sharing Phelps' story and asking how many staff have been cut from the NIH's clinical center. Kennedy said to reach out to his office for specifics on Phelps and claimed no cuts had been made to clinical trials. “I don't think that should happen to anybody,” he said.

Later in the hearing, though, Kennedy said his office had looked into the case and claimed that Phelps was “medically ineligible” for the trial, so her case had nothing to do with staff reductions. “That was a canard,” he told the committee, and he told Murray: “You don't care. You don't care about Natalie.” The exchange became a Fox News headline.

It was a “spurious statement” to say she was medically ineligible, Phelps said – she was waiting for one final scan to see if her tumor was one centimeter, but had met all other criteria. She had a scan the day after the hearing, which showed her tumor had now grown large enough to qualify.

“It's been so much extra stress. The night after the hearing, I threw up all night. I barely made it to my scan because I was so stressed out,” she said. “It's been very intense emotionally and an extreme added stress that nobody needs. Cancer just shouldn't be political.”

In a Senate appropriations hearing the next week, Kennedy again argued with Murray, saying it was “untrue” that Phelps' care was delayed. In statements after the second exchange, Murray said her staff has been in “constant touch” with career staff at the NIH and the FDA to get help on Phelps' case.

“I still have no answer about how many NIH clinical staff have been fired,” Murray's 20 May statement says. “I still have no answer why Natalie was told by her NIH doctor that her care was being delayed due to staffing cuts. For weeks, my staff has been demanding answers about agency staffing cuts.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said cancer research is a “high priority” for the NIH and HHS.

“Ongoing investments reflect our dedication to addressing both urgent and long-term health challenges,” the agency said. “There have been no cuts to clinical trials.”

But Rosenberg, the doctor leading the trial Phelps is in, confirmed to the Washington Post in April that two patients were delayed care because of staff cuts and “purchasing slowdowns”, and these delays were confirmed before big layoffs hit the agency.

Rosenberg didn't respond to requests for comment this week. He previously told the Cancer Letter, an oncology publication, that Phelps was, at the time of the hearing, not eligible because of her tumors' size, but was scheduled for additional scans to see if they had grown. He confirmed that, if determined eligible, her case would be delayed by a month because of reductions in force.

Phelps wasn't alone, he told the publication – nearly all of the trial patients were seeing a delay of about a month, which he attributed to a “loss of technicians” as part of reductions in force done by the Trump administration. It isn't just delays, either.

“We've had to drop the number of pa­tients we treat by about half. We're just having to turn away more patients,” Rosenberg said.

Phelps is still waiting to hear when she can start treatment. As of last Thursday, she was told she had a spot in the queue and the agency was seeing if her treatment could be moved up. On Tuesday, she was told it would now be 21 July. The NIH told her the agency tried to hire back staff, but it hasn't worked out.

“I have nothing to lose at this point. I'm pleading for my life. I'm begging for help,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Australia's bid to secure UNESCO World Heritage status for a site with indigenous rock art has been dealt a blow after a UN advisory body warned it was at risk from nearby industrial pollution.

The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) advised UNESCO to refer the nomination back to the Australian government so it could “prevent any further industrial development adjacent to, and within, the Murujuga Cultural Landscape.”

Located on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia state, the Murujuga rock art, which is of cultural and spiritual significance to local indigenous Australians, was nominated for heritage listing in 2023.

The Burrup Peninsula is also a key industrial hub, home to two gas plants run by Woodside, and fertilizer and explosives plants run by Norway's Yara International.

The Australian government yesterday extended the lifetime of Woodside's largest gas plant in the region, the North West Shelf, until 2070. The extension would generate up to 4.3 billion tonnes of additional carbon emissions.

Scrutiny over the impact of Australia's resources industry on indigenous heritage sites has been magnified since Rio Tinto destroyed the Juukan Gorge rock shelters as part of a mine expansion in 2020.

Australia has said the Murujuga petroglyphs were in “good condition overall” and presented findings from a study of the site that said there were no suggestions “acid rain or deposition is contributing to damage of the rock art.”

Despite this, ICOMOS recommended preventing further industrial development near the site, and called for a “decommissioning and rehabilitation plan for existing industrial activities.”

ICOMOS, citing media reports quoting rock art experts and information received about the proposed North West Shelf extension, concluded that “the conservation conditions of the petroglyphs are extremely vulnerable and threatened by industrial acidic emissions.”

The ICOMOS draft decision was a “setback” for the Australian government, Deakin University cultural heritage expert Luke James said.

“ICOMOS has identified some concerns around protection and management,” James said. “It is now up to the Australian government to demonstrate to the committee that these are surmountable, or it will need to wait at least a year — and do further work — for another chance at inscription.”

Woodside in a statement said it continued to support the heritage listing of the rock art, and would work with the Murujuga traditional owners and government to prepare its response to ICOMOS' recommendation.

“We believe the World Heritage nomination should proceed on the strength of the evidence and stand as proof that cultural heritage and industry can responsibly coexist when collaboration, transparency and rigorous scientific monitoring are in place,” it said.

The UNESCO World Heritage Committee is to meet in July.

Whistle-blower loses appeal

Army whistle-blower David McBride, who leaked allegations of war crimes in Afghanistan to the media, yesterday lost a court bid to have his prison sentence reduced. The three Australian Capital Territory Court of Appeal judges unanimously rejected the 61-year-old former army lawyer's appeal against the severity of a five-year and eight-month prison sentence imposed a year ago. His “oath obliged the appellant to discharge his duties ‘according to the law,'” the judges said.

PANAMA

State of emergency imposed

The government on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in one province after US banana giant Chiquita Brands laid off about 5,000 workers following a strike that had ground its production to a halt. The declaration allows the government to speed past bureaucratic hurdles to address economic or social crises quickly. Chiquita, which employed more than 7,000 workers, laid off about 5,000 of them last week for what it called unjustified abandonment of work.

Armies clash on border

The army and Cambodian soldiers yesterday briefly fired at each other in their disputed border area, the two sides said. The Cambodian soldiers entered a disputed area and its soldiers approached the area to negotiate, but due to misunderstanding, the Cambodian side opened fire and the army retaliated, it said. Cambodian Army spokesman Mao Phalla said the Cambodian troops were conducting a routine patrol along the border when the other side opened fire. The clash lasted about 10 minutes until local commanders spoke to each other and ordered a ceasefire. Both sides said they had no casualties or no immediate information on its casualties.

Man executed for spying

Tehran has executed a man convicted of spying for Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, the judiciary said yesterday. “After identification, arrest and judicial proceedings against Pedram Madani, who was spying in favor of the Zionist regime, and following the complete process of criminal procedure and the final confirmation and upholding of the verdict by the Supreme Court, he was brought to justice and executed,” the judiciary's Mizan Online reported. Madani was accused of transmitting classified information and holding meetings with Mossad officers abroad, including in Brussels, the report said.

The EU is on track to reach its 2030 climate targets, Brussels said yesterday, but uncertainty remains over the bloc's ambitions to cut greenhouse gas emissions much further by 2040.

The European Commission expects emissions to fall by 54 percent by 2030 compared with 1990, very close to its 55 percent target, it said, after analyzing member states' energy and climate plans.

“Emissions are down 37 percent since 1990, while the economy has grown nearly 70 percent — proving climate action and growth go hand in hand. Now we must build on this momentum,” EU Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth Wopke Hoekstra said.

Brussels also pointed to disparities between member states, and highlighted the problems of protecting forests and carbon storage.

The commission singled out Belgium, Estonia and Poland, which have not submitted their energy and climate plans, urging them to “do so without delay.”

“We have reasons to be proud, although we cannot be satisfied. We've come a long way, but we're not where we need to be yet,” European Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jorgensen said.

The EU has set a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050 and Brussels wants to agree on an interim target for 2040 — with the commission seeking to cut emissions by 90 percent compared with 1990 levels.

However, negotiations are stalling between EU countries on the 2040 target and the commission has shied away from formally proposing the 90 percent cut to member states.

For some countries, such as the Czech Republic and Italy, the target is unrealistic. The bloc has this year focused on ramping up European businesses' competitiveness against fierce competition in the US and China.

The commission is considering greater flexibility in its calculations for 2040, including through the purchase of carbon credits on international markets.

The EU's executive arm insists it would submit a formal proposal before the summer and stresses that the bloc would be ready for the next UN COP30 climate conference, which is to be held in November in Belem, Brazil.

The delays have raised concerns among environmental groups, which have called for Europe to take the lead on tackling climate change after US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement after he returned to the White House in January.

The organizations are also fearful of a wholesale unravelling of the European Green Deal, a landmark package of measures that defined European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's first term in office, but has since come increasingly under fire.

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg on May 27 criticized former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for comments that alluded to the threat of World War III, calling them ""reckless"" and ""unfitting of a world power.""

""President (Donald) Trump... is working to stop this war and end the killing. We await receipt of (the Russian) Memorandum... that you promised a week ago. Cease fire now,"" Kellogg said on X.

The envoy's remarks came in response to a tweet from Medvedev that referenced Trump's recent warnings to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""Regarding Trump's words about Putin 'playing with fire' and 'really bad things' happening to Russia. I only know of one really bad thing — WWIII,"" Medvedev wrote. ""I hope Trump understands this!""

Medvedev's comments refer to Trump's recent posts on Truth Social, in which he reacted to Russia's weekend aerial attacks on Ukraine, including the largest drone assault since the start of the full-scale invasion. In the posts, Trump called Putin ""crazy"" and warned him that he was ""playing with fire.""

The U.S. president has increasingly voiced frustration with stalled peace efforts, signaling readiness to walk away from the process. Despite repeated threats of sanctions, Trump has not imposed any additional pressure on Moscow to push it toward a ceasefire agreement.

Russia has repeatedly rejected Kyiv and its Western partners' proposal for an unconditional ceasefire. Following Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Istanbul on May 16, the Russian leadership said it would present a memorandum toward a peaceful settlement.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia's delays in presenting the document are a ""mockery of the whole world.""

Russia mobilizes around 40,000-45,000 men for its military every month, while Ukraine mobilizes about 25,000-27,000, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on May 27.

Moscow has only intensified its war effort despite calls by Kyiv, the U.S., and European partners for an unconditional ceasefire as a first step toward a peace deal.

""When the U.S. sends signals that it wants to do something positive with Russia, then Russia ramps up its mobilization,"" Zelensky said, according to the NV outlet.

While Ukraine estimates that Russia has suffered close to 1 million casualties during the full-scale war, it has been largely able to offset the losses by fresh contract soldiers.

In late 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to increase the size of Russia's Armed Forces to about 2.4 million, including 1.5 million military personnel.

Russia also aims to conscript 160,000 men for compulsory military service this year, marking the largest conscription campaign in 14 years. 

Russia conducts conscription twice a year, in spring and fall, requiring eligible men to serve for one year. Although Russian conscripts are typically not deployed in active combat, Moscow has relied on financial incentives and pardons to recruit civilians for the war in Ukraine.

Following the unpopular September 2022 mobilization, which saw over 261,000 Russians flee the country, Putin has avoided another large-scale draft, instead using alternative methods to bolster troop numbers.

Unlike Russia, Ukraine faced serious manpower shortages in late 2024 amid a heavy Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The Ukrainian leadership has sought to alleviate the crisis by broadening the mobilization pool and offering new incentives for volunteers.

Men aged between 25 and 60 can be drafted into Ukraine's Armed Forces, while those aged 18-24 may volunteer to serve, according to the latest legislation. Zelensky said earlier this year that Ukraine has around 800,000 soldiers deployed against 600,000 Russian troops.

            Despite a criminal conviction, Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik tightens his grip on power in Republika Srpska — using Kremlin support to defy Bosnia's peace order and push the country toward its worst crisis since the 1990s war.
          

Despite a criminal conviction, Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik tightens his grip on power in Republika Srpska — using Kremlin support to defy Bosnia's peace order and push the country toward its worst crisis since the 1990s war.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina — When a court convicted Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik of defying an international peace envoy in February, it was supposed to end his career in politics.

He faced not only jail time, but a ban on holding public office.

But three months later, little has changed.

Dodik remains at the helm of Republika Srpska, one of two autonomous entities that make up the nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Despite an international warrant for his arrest, Dodik has repeatedly visited one of his biggest backers, Russian President Vladimir Putin, in Moscow, using those visits to fan the flames of ethnic separatism at home.

Dodik's embrace of the Russian strongman emphasizes the Kremlin's outsized role in destabilizing Bosnia and Herzegovina.

But it also reflects a local struggle: After years of growing tensions, Dodik is now in open confrontation with the central government and using Russia to bolster his position.

Experts say that risks dragging the country into the greatest crisis since it was torn apart by civil war and genocide in 1992-1995.

“The situation is tense and unpredictable,” said Nebojsa Vukanovic, a member of the political opposition in Republika Srpska.

Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

This year alone, Dodik has already made two visits to Russia.

He first turned up in Moscow in March. Then, he returned on May 9, as Russia marked Victory Day.

In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, he described Putin as a “person who understands perfectly well where the world is” and praised the invasion of Ukraine.

Though the trips were international, experts believe the motivation is domestic.

With roughly 1.2 million people, Republika Srpska comprises a third of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The vast majority of the region's residents are ethnic Serbs.

Dodik was first elected the region's prime minister in 1998. Since then, he has come to dominate its politics.

During that time, he has often relied on threats of secession to garner support among the region's ethnic Serb majority, according to Aleksandar Savanovic, a political sciences professor at the University of Banja Luka, the regional capital.

Until 2022, such threats were “a good way to win elections without real plans to create Republika Srpska as an independent state,” he said.

Then, around the time when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Dodik saw an opening to solidify Moscow's support for his regime.


""Bosnians very well understand what's happening in Ukraine because we went through the same thing in the 1990s.""
    

Savanovic suggests the Bosnian Serb leader believed the Kremlin would look favorably on a more brazen secessionist policy. “It was a good moment to protect his power,” he said.

Since then, Dodik has held multiple meetings with Putin and has become one of the Russian invasion's most vocal supporters in Europe. Much to the chagrin of Western leaders, his comments regularly echo false Kremlin talking points – including the “extermination of the Russian population in Ukraine” and Ukraine's “bombings” in the country's eastern regions.

Ismet Fatih Cancar, a former advisor to the minister of security of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an expert on international security in the Balkans, emphasizes that similar ethnic allegations of repressions against Bosnia's Serb population underpin Dodik's secessionist aims.

Those claims date back to the 1990s, when Serb nationalists' attempt to preserve an ethnically homogenous state fueled a civil war and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

But Cancar believes they are “completely out of reality.”

“I think Bosnians very well understand what's happening in Ukraine because we went through the same thing in the 1990s,” he said.

Dodik isn't the only one who stands to gain from efforts to destabilize Bosnia and Herzegovina. Cancar thinks Russia would also benefit “from having another conflict that will divert attention from Ukraine.”

Although separatist rhetoric is not new in Republika Srpska, the tipping point came in 2023, when Dodik supported the passage of a controversial measure to suspend the rulings of Bosnia's Constitutional Court inside Republika Srpska.

That threatened to undermine the foundations of peace in the country.

Under the Dayton Accords, which ended the civil war in 1995, a high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina is tasked with overseeing the civilian implementation of the agreement. Since 2021, German politician Christian Schmidt has held that position.

Controversially, the high representative has the power to impose and annul laws.

On July 1, 2023, Schmidt did just that: He annulled the Republika Srpska judicial measure against the Constitutional Court and amended the criminal code to make defying the “constitutional order” a crime.

Dodik signed the measure Schmidt annulled into law anyway. Prosecutors filed an indictment against him the following month.

In February, following a lengthy trial, a court in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, found Dodik guilty of defying the high representative's orders, sentencing him to one year in jail and banning him from office for six years.

On April 23, state police attempted to arrest Dodik, but were repelled by Republika Srpska police.

“This is a serious political and constitutional crisis,” the Office of the High Representative said in a statement to the Kyiv Independent. It considers the law and Dodik's actions a “de facto coup d'etat” that threatens constitutional order and Bosnia and Herzegovina's bid for EU membership.

Walking the streets of Banja Luka, it's not difficult to understand the danger.

The city is filled with advertisements for Dodik's political party, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats. Billboards bear his image and push his narrative. One reads: “They tried me because they couldn't put a million Serbs in the courtroom!”

Their effect is less clear.


""Putin is, in this logic of Serbian peoples, the biggest politician in the world.""
    

According to Savanovic, Dodik's defiance of the country's peace mechanisms has actually alienated his supporters, many of whom do not want a return to the conflict of the 1990s.

“I don't know a single person in Banja Luka who supports Mr. Dodik, even in his political party,” he said.

“He expected more support from the people,” said Tanja Topic, a journalist and the head of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in the city.

Internationally, the picture is hardly rosy. Even President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, usually a reliable ally, is currently distracted by his own domestic political crisis, Topic added. And Dodik's gamble that U.S. President Donald Trump would adopt a more accommodating stance on his nationalistic policies has not paid off.

She believes that Dodik's visits to Russia were an attempt to shore up support among his remaining allies and supporters.

“He used these opportunities to create a pro-Russia narrative in Republika Srpska,” Topic said. “Putin is, in this logic of Serbian peoples, the biggest politician in the world.”

Signs of support for Russia are common in Banja Luka. A stand selling T-shirts to tourists features one with Putin's face alongside those displaying Serb nationalistic slogans. There is a Putin-themed restaurant in town, and Russia opened a branch of its embassy here in the summer of 2024.

In 2018, local officials announced that they would begin construction of a Russian cultural center.

On a recent visit to the planned site, construction was in full swing. At its center is an Orthodox Church covered in a web of scaffolding. The metal skeletons of two onion domes lay in the dust nearby. Officials recently said that the complex will be complete this summer.

Russia's influence in the region may not be merely diplomatic and financial.

Last fall, reports that Moldova had uncovered a pro-Kremlin hybrid warfare operation shined a spotlight on Republika Srpska. Moldovan authorities said that Russia used camps in the region to train agitators to provoke instability in Moldova around its October presidential election.

Officials in Republika Srpska have denied the existence of such camps. Bosnia and Herzegovina's Defense Ministry did not respond to requests for comment or interviews with officials.

But the scandal emphasized the high stakes of Russian influence in Republika Srpska.

Now, no one is sure how the current crisis may play out.

While few believe there will be a return to violence, experts told the Kyiv Independent that tensions can continue to escalate and small-scale conflict is possible.

Dodik, meanwhile, shows no sign of backing down. In March, he announced that Republika Srpska would form an independent border police force, a potential major escalation.

“If we accept this as a status quo, (Dodik) will take this as a form of support or silent acquiescence to what he's done and will move on the offensive,” said Cancar, the international security expert.

That could mean the Republika Srpska's slow integration into Serbia and restrictions on the movement of people, goods, and services along Bosnia and Herzegovina's internal boundaries.

“And then at that point,” Cancar added, “all bets are off.”

His new documentary, Bono: Stories of Surrender, is rooted in exploring the man who is Bono, rather than perpetuating the myth that is U2.SAMEER AL-DOUMY/AFP/Getty Images

No one rocks rose-coloured glasses like Bono. 

Holed up in a Cannes hotel suite overlooking the French Riviera – the bay outside swarming with megayachts, a good portion of which likely belong to the U2 front man's famous friends – the rock star known to some as Paul David Hewson is clad in black, head to toe. Except, that is, for his stylish pair of rosé-all-day sunglasses. Which are, of course, the perfect lens through which to view Bono's relentlessly sunny outlook. A perspective that is on full, glorious, it's-a-beautiful-day display in his new documentary, Bono: Stories of Surrender.

Three days from now, Bono will walk the red carpet as Stories of Surrender makes its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, where hundreds of click-happy paparazzi will shout his name while heat-exhausted fans clamour on the sidelines. In other words, a normal evening out for the world's most famous Irishman. But this morning in his hotel, well, Bono is feeling a little out of place, no matter his shade of eyewear.

“I‘ve certainly got some imposter syndrome here, impersonating an actor on the Croisette, walking the plank that is the red carpet,” Bono says, not at all convincingly. “It was strange making this film, because I thought maybe I wouldn't be very good at acting? I found it quite overwhelming, having to go to all those places.”

Those “places” are the sometimes anxious, sometimes heartwarming depths of Bono's youth in north Dublin – the home where he lost his mother, fought with his father, met his wife and formed U2 – which he previously chronicled in his 2022 memoir, also titled Bono: Stories of Surrender. 

After publishing the autobiography, Bono eschewed a traditional book tour for what he calls his “quarter-man show” without his U2 bandmates – a sold-out run of performances at New York's Beacon Theatre in which he mixed personal-history monologues with stripped-down renditions of U2 singles. A few years after the show closed, Bono turned to his long-time friend, the Australian filmmaker Andrew Dominik (The Assassination of Jesse James, Killing Them Softly, a series of Nick Cave documentaries), to transform the work into yet another medium for Apple TV+, shooting in stark black-and-white.

“Andrew's work with non-actors was the draw. You know Eric Bana was a comedian before he was in Andrew's Chopper, right? He became the Eric Bana he is now with Andrew's guidance,” Bono says. “It's not just a film of a concert, and it's not just a film of my performance. Andrew was very demanding and wouldn't let me get away with anything. I had to film the scene where I say goodbye to my father five times in one day, and these are very strong feelings I was having. But not strong enough for him: ‘It's performative, mate!'” 

Bono is well-aware that the new film is something of a vanity project – he cops to it right in its opening. But the musician also knows that he didn't get to where he is, headlining world tours and bending Apple to his whims, by shying away from the spotlight. 

And the stories Bono shares on screen are far beyond the kind of navel-gazing, self-serving nostalgia trips that might be expected from other stars of his stature. The film opens with a haunting recollection of Bono's eight-hour emergency heart operation from 2016, before rewinding to his teenage battles with his emotionally unavailable, widower father and the lucky break he scored in 1976 when he connected with three high-school mates: Larry Mullen Jr., Adam Clayton and David Howell Evans, better known as the Edge.

If the film seems atypically rooted in exploring the man who is Bono, rather than perpetuating the myth that is U2, that's because it is. And if Bono himself seems more committed to promoting and pushing the doc than any other project in recent memory, well, that's true, too. 

The musician rarely sits down for one-on-one interviews these days, and it is unclear how many times he might have previously taken the time to personally autograph copies of his memoir for journalists who didn't even ask for one (although I will forever treasure the “Thanks Barry!” that he scrawled inside my copy, the “arry” in my name written over the “ono” from the book's title page). 

This project seems to have ignited something in Bono – a desire to chase the past in order to figure out his future. It is not so much a midlife-crisis project as it might be a figuring-out-what's-next project. He still hasn't found what he's, well, you know. 

The timing makes sense. A few days before the Cannes premiere, Bono turned 65. Next year, U2 will celebrate 50 years, a milestone that will be commemorated with a new book, at least one new documentary and a new Netflix drama series written by Anthony McCarten of Bohemian Rhapsody fame. Memory, its power and presence, is simply in Bono's atmosphere. 

“Part of writing the book Surrender was to retrieve memories that I lost, and then doing the play I ended up discovering ones that had really changed me, too,” Bono says. “I began to really appreciate my father, in playing him. Just by turning my head to the left or the right, I discovered him. One side is my younger self. By turning my head, I became my father.”

Despite insisting he's no actor, Bono delivers a strong performance in his film. Explains Bono: “Lots of singers are mimics – it's our musical ears.""Andreas Rentz/Getty Images

Despite his assertion that he's no actor – seeming to forget, unlike my children, his performance as a rock-star lion in Sing 2 – Bono proves himself to be a great performer in Stories of Surrender. Whether he is personifying his father, his bandmates or even Luciano Pavarotti, the man has a talent for not only spinning his own narrative but deftly weaving in others'. 

“Lots of singers are mimics – it's our musical ears. We all vie to have the best Bob Dylan impersonations, though Mick Jagger's is probably the best,” Bono says with a laugh. “Making music, you step into the shoes of the people who you most look up to. Even my activism, if I think about it, was probably shaped by John Lennon growing up in my teenage years. Here was a guy who was ready to look ridiculous for peace! I knew I could do the ridiculous part. It was just if I can follow that level of songwriting.”

Stories of Surrender doesn't focus much on the singer's long and sometimes controversial (i.e., white saviour) history of activism – work that brought him, back in 2010, to guest edit an edition of The Globe and Mail about “the African Century” alongside Bob Geldof. (“At ease,” he says upon learning that he was technically close to being my boss.) But the film's release has caused Bono to re-examine and recontextualize his legacy in that realm, too. 

“Being Irish, we definitely approach the injustice of the world's poor from a horizontal position – we're looking across to them, not down,” he says. “Ireland is a kind of encouragement for people, because if you were the poorest country in Europe, how did you get out of it?”

Unlike so many other stars attending Cannes, who seem to be allergic to the words “tariff” or “Trump,” Bono is also eager to talk politics, even when unprompted. 

“I‘ll say one thing: There are 51 reasons to be grateful for Mark Carney,” Bono says with a smile, before going on to rhapsodize about the Canadian Prime Minister's Irish roots. The 52nd reason? His family come from the same county as the Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel. They're definitely from seeds that grew into very different trees, but I‘m grateful for both!”

Sitting alone in the room with Bono – well, “alone” is a relative term when there are assistants and publicists and camera operators swirling about – one cannot help but recall the stripped-down atmosphere of Stories of Surrender itself. The tiny, bare-bones stage of the Beacon is, after all, a world away from the high-tech, high-everything orb of the Sphere in Las Vegas, where U2 recently wrapped up a residency in which they performed the entirety of 1991's Achtung Baby. 

“Part of this was asking, had I just gotten used to a certain maximalism?” Bono says. “At the Beacon, we were able to get to that level of intimacy because I had all this time with an audience who were just a yard away. There's a little bit of taking your clothes off in front of the whole school about this.”

Not that Stories of Surrender is some bygone, analogue experiment. Apple TV+ subscribers can watch the doc in its traditional form starting May 30, or strap on an Apple Vision Pro headset to get a more immersive, 3-D experience that feels akin to inviting Bono directly into your living room. Although that element gave Bono just a bit of skeptical pause, given that the last time he partnered with Apple on a quote-unquote innovative project, it resulted in U2's album Songs of Innocence showing up unsolicited in iTunes libraries around the world. 

“Apple suggested the VR element for this film – they offered us their labs to play: ‘We have this technology, do you want to try something?' I think as corporations get to that scale, they start experimenting,” Bono says. “We know some of those experiments didn't go right – I was in charge of one of them, and it was my suggestion actually. But you're seeing successful experiments.” 

One of the charges that critics have tried, sometimes successfully, to stick on Bono is that it is impossible for a star of his magnitude and influence to see outside of his own bubble. But Stories of Surrender seems to be Bono's backward way of bursting that notion.

“I have to be careful about this film, I can only watch it so often – that's the imposter syndrome you're witnessing. I‘m not acting. I‘m trying to tell my own story, to regain some of the dimension and the pencil shavings that you lose when you become a bit famous,” he says. “Can I get it back? Can I return some of myself to the band? To my family?”

He slides his glasses back and nods to himself, satisfied with answering his own question. It is Bono's world – he can see it however he wants.

Bono: Stories of Surrender is available to stream on Apple TV+ starting May 30.

Visitors at the central pavilion of the Venice Biennale, which usually hosts part of the main exhibition, in Venice, Italy, on June 8, 2024.MATTEO DE MAYDA/The New York Times News Service

Many of a certain age will remember a time when Canadians travelling through Europe were advised to sew something on their backpacks signifying their national identity.

Mainly, it was to demonstrate that they weren't Americans. 

Back in the 1960s and 70s, the U.S. didn't have a particularly revolting president who was upending the conventional global order and threatening to take over democratic entities. No, the issue then was a distaste for Americans largely because of their attitude: the air of superiority and privilege they brandished. Many Europeans felt Americans were gauche and vulgar.

Canadians, on the other hand, were friendly and harmless. That seemed to be our universal reputation, and, I'm here to report, it remains very much intact.

I've just returned from a three-week holiday in Scotland and Ireland, including Northern Ireland, and it was a revelation. There were few, if any, residents of the places we visited who weren't well educated on the efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to infuriate as many of America's allies as possible. They were also surprisingly well informed about Canada, and its new Prime Minister Mark Carney. 

You've got a real smart one in Mr. Carney, an Irish woman named Isabel, age 86, said to me on the train to Dublin. Canada was going to need its new Prime Minister to deal with the horrible person next door, but we should be in fine hands, she felt.

Isabel was travelling with her 60-something daughter, Alison, who had to urge her mother on more than one occasion to pipe down. There was a group of Americans sitting right behind them. It seems implausible they didn't hear some of what Isabel had to say.

This scenario played out in various ways on numerous occasions in our travels. While this is an admittedly anecdotal survey, it's difficult to fathom that the intense anti-Americanism we encountered was some kind of statistical fluke. On a food tour of Dublin that my wife and I went on, the guide asked the 10 of us where we were all from. Eight identified as Americans. We said we were from Canada.

It's funny how many people I'm getting these days who say they are from Canada, the guide said with a smirk, emphasizing and drawing out the word say. The Americans on this tour, however, felt no impetus to lie about where they were from.

It's hard to describe the profound sense of connection I had with the people of Ireland and Scotland (the Northern Irish too). There were shared values that were tangible, a kinship that made us immediately feel comfortable and at ease. There was also a feeling of trust that you don't always get when travelling south of the border.

This is not to say there aren't fine Americans, too - many of whom are mortified by what is taking place in their country. We sat beside two during breakfast one day in Dublin. They were both long-time Democrats who are appalled by Mr. Trump, disgusted by what the craven, deceitful creature has done to U.S. relations around the world.

We are so sorry, the woman told me, upon learning we were from Canada. She said she was hoping and praying that the madness only lasts three more years before the U.S. can get someone in power who can restore the country's reputation, at least partially. But who knows how extensive the damage will be by then.

After three weeks spent talking to people in the British Isles and Ireland, it's a fair bet that any overtures by Mr. Carney to strengthen ties, economic and otherwise, with the European market will be met with enthusiasm. We have things they need, they have things we need. But mostly there are people there who are not led by someone inclined to light a match and see the world as we know it go up in flames.

This, of course, is not to say Europe is perfect and isn't susceptible to simplistic overtures by populists with horrible ideas. (See: Brexit.) But there was a common decency among many of the people we talked to, a sense that folks would have our backs if things with the U.S. got truly messy.

Many of the people I talked to continue to be shocked that, as they say, 77 million Americans decided it was a good idea to take another ride on the Titanic. For the people of Scotland and Ireland, the last U.S. election was all the proof they needed that they don't understand Americans and likely never will.

How they could ever let that man run their country again was beyond her, our new friend Isabel said, adding that she hoped Mr. Trump wouldn't take the rest of us down with him.

King Charles inspects an honour guard at the Senate of Canada building in Ottawa before reading the throne speech during the royal visit on May 27.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

This visit by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, which culminated in him opening the 45th Parliament and delivering the government's Throne Speech, was put together at the last minute, fit into a busy section of the royal calendar, and was over 24 hours after it began. 

It may have come as a response to serious political and economic threats from the United States, but the King's first visit as Canada's monarch displays notable symmetry with a more long-planned visit 68 years ago, when Queen Elizabeth II's first visit to Canada as monarch was also a brief stop in Ottawa to open Parliament.

King Charles delivers Throne Speech asserting Canada's sovereignty, pledging major transformation in economy

‘Nothing happens by coincidence': Royal couple's style choices make a statement

In 1957, the U.S. was such a cultural and economic behemoth that the Canadian government wanted to ensure that the young Queen travelled to her northern realm before going to the United States. The solution was a four-day trip to Ottawa to do something never done before: have a monarch of Canada open Parliament. Like now, the world watched every moment. 

The focus on the Canadian Crown was such that when Elizabeth made her broadcast to the nation on the eve of leaving Ottawa for the U.S., she emphasized that she was going in her role as the Queen of Canada, along with her Canadian prime minister, John Diefenbaker. 

In that national broadcast, the Queen made clear the importance with which she held her Canadian title: “I shall be going in other capacities, as well, but when you hear or read about events in Washington, I want you to reflect that it is the Queen of Canada and her husband who are concerned in them.” 

Then as now, one pressing issue in the Throne Speeches of both monarchs was the need for “reliable trading partners and allies around the world,” as King Charles said.

He continued: “When my dear late mother addressed your predecessors seven decades ago, she said that in that age, and against the backdrop of international affairs, no nation could live unto itself.” 

That both visits were also focused on one of the Crown's most important duties helps reinforce the message that the monarchs see Canada as part of their home. “Every time I come to Canada … a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream – and from there straight to my heart,” the King said in the Throne Speech.

Both openings of Parliament by a monarch — 1957 and 2025 — used visual cues such as the state landau, Mounties on horseback and royal salutes to reinforce the concept of the Canadian Crown. In particular for this occasion, everything seemed to be chosen to highlight Canada's heritage, including the red wool uniforms and pith helmets of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment, which the King inspected before going into the Senate. 

On Monday, the King had his Order of Canada pinned to his suit. On Tuesday, he donned the full insignia of the Order around his neck while the medals on his chest included his Canadian Forces' Decoration with three additional service bars. 

The Canadian nature of both visits extends into the realm of style. For her arrival to Canada on Monday, Camilla wore the diamond-and-platinum maple leaf brooch that has been a fixture on the lapels of royal outfits since Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) wore it on her first visit in 1939, on the eve of the last truly existential crisis faced by Canada: the Second World War.

For the opening of Parliament, Camilla donned another maple leaf brooch, that of her regiment, the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. 

That maple leaf motif was also omnipresent in 1957. Not only were there maple leaves embroidered on the coronation gown that Elizabeth II wore to Parliament, but she emphasized her role as Queen of Canada at a state dinner by wearing a Norman Hartnell evening gown adorned with green maple leaves, which is now part of the collection of the Canadian Museum of History. 

While royal styling was similar, other things were subtly different. The thrones used by King Charles III and Queen Camilla were commissioned for Canada's 150th birthday in 2017 and designed to fit the Beaux Art setting of the temporary Senate. Their walnut frames include a piece from a tree felled outside Windsor Castle, and are adorned with sprays of maple leaves and the cypher of Elizabeth II, who was monarch when they entered use. Her son and daughter-in-law were the first to sit on them. 

This 24-hour blitz also reset a regal visit clock that had stalled during the later years of Elizabeth's reign. Her last visit to Canada was in 2010, when she was 84. Now, 15 years later, her son has completed his first trip as monarch. Already 76 and undergoing weekly cancer treatment, his reign will not reach the epic length of his mother's, yet the King seems determined to do as much as he can, as fast as possible. This year, he alone accounts for nearly one-quarter of all official royal engagements even though he's one of 10 working members of the family. 

King Charles III will likely undertake his first visit to the United States in 2026, to mark the 250th anniversary of its independence from his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, George III. 

Already, the British press is saying that such a visit will only come after a major tour of Canada, tentatively pencilled in for next year after being delayed twice because of the King's cancer and then Canada's election cycle. 

Visiting Canada before venturing to the United States — as Queen Elizabeth II did in 1957 — makes sense if for no other reason than loyalty. Canada kept true to its oath to the Crown while the Americans rebelled. That loyalty also flows from the monarch to Canada. As a constitutional monarch, the King has vowed to serve the interests of the people of Canada for the rest of his life. He did in Ottawa, when he came to the defence of “the country that Canadians and I love so much.” 

He didn't stop there, exhorting us to “seize this opportunity by recognizing that all Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away.”

King Charles III delivered the Speech from the Throne, opening the 45th Parliament of Canada on Tues. May 27 in Ottawa. The King's speech touched on Canada's unique identity, new challenges including President Trump and Canada's sovereignty.

The chance of exceeding the 1.5 degree benchmark of limiting global warming stands at 70%, the UN's weather agency says.

The chance that average warming from 2025 to 2029 is to exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) benchmark stands at 70%, the United Nations (UN) said.

As a result, the Earth is expected to remain at historic levels of warming.

This comes after the planet experienced the two hottest years ever recorded in 2023 and 2024, according to a report published by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN's climate agency.

WMO deputy secretary-general Ko Barrett said the past ten years have been the ""the warmest on record,"" adding a warning that no respite is expected.

""This means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,"" Barrett warned.

The 1.5-degree target was set as part of the 2015 Paris climate accords, which aimed to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celcius above pre-industrial levels.

It was calculated in relation to the 1850-1900 average, before humanity began industrially burning coal, oil and gas, all of which emit carbon dioxide (CO2), the greenhouse gas largely responsible for climate change.

A growing number of climate scientists now hold the 1.5-degree target to be impossible to achieve due to the increasing levels of CO2 emissions.

The WMO forecasts that the global mean near-surface temperature for each year between 2025 and 2029 will be between 1.2 and 1.9 degrees Celcius above the pre-industrial average.

Peter Thorne, director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units group at the University of Maynooth, was cited by the AFP news agency as saying he expects the probability of passing 1.5 degrees Celcius on a long-term basis in the late 2020 or early 2030s to reach 100% in the next two to three years.

According to the WMO, the chance of at least one year between 2025 and 2020 being warmer than 2024, the warmest year on record, stands at 80%.

There is also an above-zero chance of at least one year in the next five exceeding 2 degrees of warming, despite it being ""exceptionally unlikely,"" the report said.

Adam Scaife of the British Met Office — which compiled the report based on forecasts from multiple global centers — said it is the first time such a possibility arises in the organization's computer predictions, which he calls ""shocking.""

""That probability is going to rise,"" he added.

Also approved was a draft law that would abolish the possibility for particularly well-integrated immigrants to become German citizens after three years' residency, a law introduced by the previous coalition government.

This comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Berlin for talks with Chancellor Merz on German support for Kyiv and efforts toward a ceasefire amid Russia's full-scale invasion.

Here is a roundup of top news stories from Germany on Wednesday, May 28:

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz pledged Wednesday to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems as he met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Speaking alongside a visiting Zelenskyy in Berlin, that under an intensified cooperation agreement Germany ""will strive to equip the Ukrainian army with all the capabilities that truly enable it to successfully defend the country."" 

That would include upgraded domestic missile production. Some of the advanced weapon systems that Kyiv's Western partners have supplied to Ukraine during the more than three-year war were subject to range and target restrictions.

There have been concerns that if the weapons struck Russia, the Kremlin might retaliate against the country that provided them and suck NATO into Europe's biggest conflict since World War II.

""Ukraine will be able to fully defend itself including against military targets outside its own territory"" with its own missiles, Merz added at the joint news conference. 

However, he declined to say whether Germany will supply its advanced Taurus long-range cruise missile to Ukraine, which long a request by Kyiv and a step that Berlin has resisted.

Both Merz and Zelenskyy criticized the Kremlin's effective rejection of an unconditional ceasefire proposed by the US, which Kyiv accepted, and its delay in responding to proposals for a settlement.

Zelenskyy called for deeper defense cooperation across Europe and with the United States while in Berlin, stressing the need for long-range capabilities and sustained military funding to ensure Ukraine's resilience.

""We need sufficient long-range capabilities. That's why we must be certain of the financing of our army and the stability of Ukraine,"" he said.

He said the cooperation projects already exist. ""We simply want (the missiles) to be produced in the quantity we need,"" Zelenskyy said at the news conference.

Germany's labor office said on Wednesday that the number of unemployed increased in May by 34,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.96 million, a higher rate than expected by analysts.

The number of unemployed is 197,000 higher than in May last year, the Federal Employment Agency said.

The seasonally adjusted employment rate remained unchanged in May from the previous month at 6.3%, the highest level since December 2015 excluding the pandemic.

The new figures come as the number of unemployed people in Germany approaches the 3 million mark for the first time in a decade.

A total of 634,000 job vacancies were registered with the Federal Employment Agency in May, around 67,000 fewer than a year ago.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with newly appointed German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin to seek increased military support amid intensified Russian airstrikes.

Since taking office three weeks ago, Merz has launched diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire and maintain Western backing for Ukraine, as European leaders criticize Russia for stalling peace talks.

The German Cabinet has approved draft bills on curbing possibilities for certain groups of refugees to bring their families to Germanyand abolishing fast-track citizenship for ""well-integrated"" migrants.

The restrictions on family reunification would affect immigrants in Germany with so-called ""subsidiary protection status"" — that is, people who lack complete refugee status but are allowed to remain in the country owing to the threat of political persecution in their homelands. 

Rules allowing certain migrants to apply for German citizenship after three years instead of the normal five were introduced by the previous coalition government.

The two draft bills, proposed by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, must still be passed by the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament.

The planned suspension of rules allowing some refugees to bring their families to Germany is viewed very critically by some human rights groups.

A case like that of Mohammed (last name not given to DW), who fled the Syrian civil war, highlights the problems the suspension might cause to many people who have left their home countries to seek shelter in Germany.

Mohammed made the decision to make the dangerous journey to Germany through Libya and across the Mediterranean to Italy together with his son, who suffers from cerebral atrophy, in the hope of getting medical treatment and one day being reunited with the rest of the family in Germany.

Two and a half years later, he is still waiting for his wife and two daughters to receive permission to join him.

""Before I came to Germany, I didn't know it would be so difficult,"" he told DW.

Germany plans to suspend family reunification

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin on Wednesday, with their talks expected to focus on German military support and efforts to end the war unleashed by Russia's full-scale invasion launched in February 2022.

Germany has been the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States.

Zelenskyy's visit comes shortly after Merz announced that Ukraine's allies, including Germany, are no longer putting any range restrictions on weapons they are supplying to Ukraine to allow the country to attack military sites well within Russia. 

However, he has so far not stated whether Germany will supply Ukraine with 

Russia has recently stepped up its missile and drone attacks on its neighbor despite ongoing US-led efforts to obtain a ceasefire followed by a lasting peace.

Judges have dismissed a climate case brought against RWE by a Peruvian farmer asking the energy giant to help fund defenses against potential flooding due to melting glaciers.

The chairman of an association representing the Turkish community (TGD) in Germany, Gökay Sofuoglu, has said he believes the planned abolition of rules allowing accelerated naturalization for some migrants will not have serious consequences.

The TGD chairman told newspapers from the Funke media group that the change ""does not affect many people. And those who are affected will just wait another two years.""

His remarks come as the Cabinet is to discuss a draft bill put forward by conservative Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt that foresees repealing rules introduced by the former coalition government allowing particularly well-integrated migrants to apply for German citizenship after three years.

Despite not condemning the change, Sofuoglu said it was a shame, as the possibility of fast-track citizenship had encouraged people to volunteer in groups such as the Red Cross or fire brigades, moves that would have denoted them as ""well-integrated"" and thus eligible for quick naturalization.

He also voiced the opinion that Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt was letting himself ""be driven too much by the AfD,"" or the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which espouses a very harsh migration policy. 
 
Under standard naturalization procedures, people are eligible to apply for German citizenship if they have been living legally in Germany for five years.

German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt will present a bill to Cabinet on Wednesday that would see curbs placed on the possibility for some migrants to have family members follow them to Germany.

Under the draft bill, which is in line with the coalition deal of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), this possibility would be suspended for two years in the case of refugees with limited protection status.

The new rules would affect refugees who have not received asylum or full protection in Germany but who are allowed to stay in the country because they could face political persecution, torture or death sentences in their home countries. Such refugees include many who have fled civil war in their countries. 

Altogether 388,074 such refugees were living in Germany at the end of March, about three-quarters of them from Syria, according to government figures.

The draft bill provides for exemptions in particularly urgent cases. 

Dobrindt, from the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), has defended the bill in comments to the mass-circulation Bild daily.

""Until now, 1,000 people per month have been able to follow their families to Germany. That is now over,"" he said.

""We must significantly reduce the pull factors to Germany. This is another way of showing that migration policy in Germany has changed,"" he added.

However, the opposition Green Party has sharply criticized the plans, with Green politician Marcel Emmerich saying that more compassion could be expected from parties such as Merz's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the CSU that have ""Christian"" in their names.

In remarks to the dailies Stuttgarter Zeitung and Stuttgarter Nachrichten, he called the draft bill ""a policy that tears families apart, drives people into isolation, heightens psychological pressure and massively hinders integration.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin to discuss further military support. Follow DW for updates.

Here are the latest developments on Russia's war in Ukraine from Wednesday, May 28:

According to Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia has proposed holding the next round of peace talks with Ukraine on June 2 in Istanbul.

""The Russian side, as agreed, has promptly developed a relevant memorandum, which sets out our position on all aspects of reliably overcoming the root causes of the crisis,"" he said.

Lavrov added that the Russian delegation, led by Vladimir Medinskiy, is prepared to present the memorandum to the Ukrainian side and to provide necessary clarifications during the direct talks in Istanbul next Monday.

Ukraine has not yet commented on the announcement.

On May 16, delegations from Ukraine and Russia convened in Istanbul for the first direct talks in over three years.

However, the only tangible outcome of the negotiations was the largest prisoner of war exchange, in which each side exchanged 1,000 prisoners.

The Kremlin has responded to comments made by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Wednesday about plans for the joint production of long-range weapons with Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the decision by Merz was a further provocation of the war in Ukraine. 

""This is a very dangerous trend, an irresponsible position that Germany is taking,"" Peskov said.

Merz said at a news conference with visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that weapons produced during the collaboration could be used to attack targets within Russia.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Berlin will help Kyiv develop new long-range weapons that can hit targets in Russian territory.

""There will be no range restrictions, allowing Ukraine to fully defend itself, even against military targets outside its own territory,"" he said, adding that the weapons could be produced ""both in Ukraine and here in Germany.""

His remarks made at a joint press conference with visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came after Merz earlier this week said in a TV interview that Ukraine's allies were not longer putting range restrictions on arms provided to Kyiv. 

Merz said on Wednesday that defense ministers from both countries would sign a memorandum of understanding for the production of long-range weapons systems.

However, he declined to provide technical details or name the manufacturers involved.

Merz hailed the project as ""the beginning of a new form of military-industrial cooperation between our countries that has great potential.""

Western allies of Ukraine have previously voiced fears that attacks within Russia using weapons supplied from abroad could draw Moscow's ire toward the manufacturing countries.

Notably, since taking office, Merz has been tight-lipped about supplying Kyiv with German long-range Taurus missiles despite advocating their delivery while in opposition.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday accused Russia of stalling peace talks, saying Moscow had no intention of halting its more than three-year-long invasion.

""They will constantly look for reasons not to end the war,"" Zelenskyy said at a joint press conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Among other things, Zelenskyy criticized Russia for not having agreed to a location for the next round of negotiations.

Moscow has recently seemed to reject an offer made by Pope Leo XIV to hold peace talks in the Vatican, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying his country had ""no plans"" regarding the location or time of future negotiation.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday said that NATO should invite Kyiv to a summit of the Western military alliance in June, warning that if his country were not there, it would be a victory for Russia.

""If Ukraine is not present at the NATO summit, it will be a victory for Putin, but not over Ukraine, but over NATO. Therefore, the decision lies with our partners,"" Zelenskyy told a press conference in Berlin alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that NATO chief Mark Rutte wanted Ukraine to attend the summit, but no invitation has yet been issued.

German ministers are planning joint consultations with the Ukrainian government this year, Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in Berlin after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 

Merz said Germany and Ukraine had established closer ties since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022. 

""We want to expand this further and, towards the end of the year, we will have German-Ukrainian government consultations again for the first time in many years,"" said Merz.

At a press conference with Zelenskyy, Merz emphasized that Germany could cooperate with Ukraine in many sectors, including energy, infrastructure, construction and medical technology.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged his country's continued support of Ukraine amid Russia's invasion but has also said ties with Kyiv should be extended into a future beyond the war.

Speaking at a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Merz also said his government would work toward ensuring that the gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 is not recommissioned.

""We will continue to increase the pressure on Russia,"" Merz said. ""We will do everything in this context to ensure that Nord Stream 2 cannot be put back into operation.""

He also said that Europe would continue to step up pressure on Russia in a bid to stop the war.

At the same time, Merz highlighted the role of the US in bringing about peace, thanking the US president for what he had done in this regard in the past few weeks.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin as Ukraine seeks further military support for its war with Russia.

Since entering office, Merz has taken part in efforts to secure a ceasefire between Ukraineand Russia, while also pledging Germany's support for Ukraine.

Berlin has been the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the US.

A day before traveling to Germany, Zelenskyy reiterated his willingness to hold peace talks at the highest level, including a trilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimiar Putin. 
 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Russia has gathered 50,000 troops near Ukraine's northern Sumy region.

Speaking to reporters, he added Kyiv had taken steps to prevent Moscow from conducting a large-scale offensive there.

""Their largest, strongest forces are currently on the Kursk front,"" Zelenskyy said. ""To push our troops out of the Kursk region and to prepare offensive actions against the Sumy region.""

The build-up of troops comes as Russia appears to be preparing for a summer offensive in Ukraine while Kyiv waits for Moscow to present a memorandum laying out its conditions to proceed with ceasefire talks.

Putin has said he wants a ""buffer zone"" along Russia's border with Ukraine. Zelenskyy has said Kyiv believes that Russia seeks to establish a buffer zone of about 10 kilometres (6 miles).

Sumy lies on the border of Russia's Kursk region. Russia has captured at least four border villages in the area recently, and has been moving slowly forwards over the past several weeks on parts of the frontline in eastern Ukraine near the city of Kostyantynivka.

However, Zelenskyy said that the Russians had been pushed back in that area by 4 km (2.5 miles) over the last two days.

Ukraine launched almost 300 drones in one of the largest attempted attacks atRussia, including dozens targeting the capital Moscow, Russian authorities said.

""Anti-aircraft defense systems destroyed and intercepted 296 aerial drones,"" the Russian defense ministry said in a statement, with at least 42 being shot down over the Moscow region, according to Governor Andrey Vorobyov.

This comes after Moscow's record drone attack on the country over the weekend, which Kyiv said killed at least 13 people.

Ukraine said that Russia launched more than 900 drones in the three days up to Monday.
 

US President Donald Trump's envoy, Keith Kellogg, said a Russianofficial stoking fears of a third World War was ""unfortunate"" and ""reckless.""

""President Trump is working to stop this war and end the killing,"" Kellogg posted on the platform X. He also called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. 

This comes after Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, commented on Trumps remarks, in which he said President Vladimir Putin was ""playing with fire"" over Ukraine.

""I know of one REALLY BAD thing — World War III. I hope Trump understands this,"" Medvedev said on his X account.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Germany on Wednesday for talks with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the German government has confirmed.

The talks will focus on military support for the war-torn country and efforts to achieve a ceasefire in the war with Russia. 

The two leaders are scheduled to hold a press conference later today, with Zelenskyy later meeting German business representatives and, later on, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

It is the Ukrainian leader's first trip to Germany since Friedrich Merz became chancellor on May 6.

Tom Homan disclosed consulting fees from GEO group, one of the largest immigrant jail operators in the U.S.

One of President Donald Trump's top immigration officials was recently paid an undisclosed amount to consult for a major immigrant jail operator that is poised to profit from the administration's fascist immigration crackdown, new reporting finds.

Financial filings show that Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, consulted for GEO Group in the two years prior to his appointment in January, per The Washington Post. 

The for-profit operator is one of the largest private prison companies in the U.S. and contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — the agency Homan headed for 18 months under Trump's first term. GEO operates the vast majority of the immigrant jails in the U.S. (along with CoreCivic) and raked in hundreds of millions in funding from ICE contracts in 2021.

According to the filing, GEO paid Homan more than $5,000 for his consulting work. Because ethics rules allow officials to report within a range of values, it's possible GEO paid Homan far more.

The consulting fees raise questions over whether the consulting amounts to a conflict of interest for Homan, who oversees deportations and border enforcement as border czar. The White House has denied wrongdoing and said that Homan will recuse himself from the government's dealings with GEO.

Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats said that Homan's consulting represents a “serious conflict of interest.”

“The GEO Group is a major private prison contractor whose largest source of revenue is contracts with ICE,” Sen. Dick Durbin (Illinois), the Senate Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, told the Post. “This news raises even more questions, and the corruption concerns are too large to ignore.”

Durbin has recently spoken out against the Trump administration's practice of detaining huge numbers of immigrants without due process or oversight after a visit to two GEO Group-managed prisons in Louisiana, where people like Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk were incarcerated by immigration officials over their pro-Palestine advocacy.

The prisons operated by GEO are notorious for abuse. Prisons managed by the $4 billion company have received complaints of neglect, assault, and other abuses, while the company's cost-cutting measures involve such practices as paying incarcerated people less than $1 a day for labor.

GEO's stock value doubled after Trump was elected, and the company is slated to benefit even more under the Trump administration. Homan has called for the number of beds in immigrant jails to nearly triple, from 34,000 to 100,000, while saying that mass deportation is “more important to this country than anything.” 

Much of this expansion is expected to be carried out by GEO and CoreCivic. 

Per the Post, GEO's chief executive, David Donahue, has bragged to investors that the company faces an “unprecedented opportunity” with the new administration.

The Trump administration has already awarded GEO with hefty contracts to reopen two facilities that had previously shut down. GEO estimates that the contract for a Newark detention center, awarded in February, will be worth $1 billion over its 15-year term, and will generate $60 million in revenue for the company each year. Another contract for a facility in Michigan will bring in $70 million in revenues annually, the company estimates.

Meanwhile, Republicans have proposed a boost of $150 billion to immigration enforcement in their marquee reconciliation bill, including $59 billion for immigration detention and transportation, meaning that GEO and other companies could be poised for a major windfall.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

WASHINGTON—The U.S. State Department ordered American embassies worldwide to pause student visa interviews effective May 27, a senior department official confirmed to The Epoch Times.

The temporary suspension, outlined in an internal cable signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is part of the department's effort to strengthen the vetting process, particularly in relation to social media screening.

The internal cable directs consular sections not to add any appointment slots for student and exchange visitor visas (F, M, and J categories) “until further guidance is issued” in the coming days.

The senior official confirmed the authenticity of the internal communication leaked to the media on the morning of May 27.

During a press briefing that same day, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce emphasized the department's commitment to screening visa applications, without commenting directly about the leaked cable.

“We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country,” she told reporters.

When asked what has changed in the vetting system, Bruce declined to reveal details of the methods used.

“We're not going to lay out here with the media, the nature of the steps that are taken, the methods that we use,” she said.

“We've always vetted people trying to come in. We've always looked at visas seriously,” she said, questioning why it had become such a controversial issue.

“Whether they be students, or if you're a tourist who needs a visa, or whoever you are, we're going to be looking at you.”

Bruce also declined to say whether the pause would delay foreign students' arrival for the fall semester. “I can't speak about what the individual experience will be.”

Rubio added that “the overwhelming majority of student visas” will not be revoked, emphasizing that most international students are not connected to organizations that intend to harm the United States or oppose its government and way of life.

“I just think it's crazy to continue to provide visas so people can come here and advocate for policies that are in direct contradiction of our national interest.”

The administration has already canceled around $2.6 billion in federal grants after the university declined to accede to a list of government demands to change policies concerning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and anti-Semitism. The university has sued the administration, alleging the move violates the Constitution's free speech protections.

President Donald Trump on May 27 announced that he would soon grant pardons to reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, who were convicted of bank fraud, tax evasion, and other financial crimes.

The reality stars of the show “Chrisley Knows Best” were convicted of defrauding Atlanta-area community banks out of more than $30 million through fraudulent loans in June 2022. The pair was also convicted of tax evasion.

Trump said that he planned on pardoning the couple within 24 hours.

During a Tuesday call with Savannah Chrisley, the couple's daughter, Trump said, “Your parents are going to be free and clean and I hope that we can do it by tomorrow.”

Trump said that the couple “was given pretty harsh treatment ... I hear they're terrific people, this should not have happened.”

“Mr. President, I just want to say thank you for bringing my parents back,” son Grayson Chrisley told Trump during that call.

Savannah Chrisley, who was left as sole caretaker of her younger brother as sister, has long pushed for the release of the couple. In a pardon petition, the family alleged that the conviction was based on an illegal raid and relied on compromised evidence.

Savannah Chrisley also campaigned for Trump as a prison reform advocate. She spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2024.

Since being incarcerated, the Chrisleys have become known as federal prison reform advocates, pushing for better conditions in federal prisons.

In November 2022, Todd was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison while Julie received a seven-year sentence. The couple has appealed their conviction and maintained their innocence.

A release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia at the time said that the couple had specifically defrauded Atlanta-area banks of more than $36 million in personal loans.

“The Chrisleys, with the help of their former business partner, submitted false bank statements, audit reports, and personal financial statements to Georgia community banks to obtain the loans. The Chrisleys spent the money on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate, and travel—and used new fraudulent loans to pay back old ones.

“After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from more than $20 million of these fraudulently obtained loans.”

Additionally, the U.S. attorney's office said, they conspired to defraud the IRS with the assistance of Peter Tarantino, the couple's accountant, who was also convicted.

“To evade collection of half a million dollars in delinquent taxes owed by Todd Chrisley, the Chrisleys opened and kept the corporate bank accounts only in Julie Chrisley's name. But after the IRS requested information about bank accounts in Julie Chrisley's name, the Chrisleys transferred ownership of the corporate bank account to a relative to further conceal their income from the IRS.”

Between 2013 and 2016, the couple did not file a tax return, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

The couple is best known for their reality TV show “Chrisley Knows Best,” which followed the family, centering around Todd—who presented himself as a successful real estate tycoon. The show was filmed in the suburbs of Atlanta, before moving to Nashville during later seasons.

“Growing Up Chrisley,” a spin-off focusing on Chase and Savannah Chrisley, premiered in 2019.

The pardons come after Trump announced that he would pardon Scott Jenkins, former sheriff of Virginia's Culpeper County, who received a 10-year prison sentence following a federal bribery conviction.

In January, the president also issued broad pardons for some of those arrested in connection with the events of Jan. 6, 2021.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Over the last few months, an elaborate plan to ensure China prevails in the global economic competition has taken shape. The plan's chief architects, however, are not China's leaders—they are U.S. politicians. The Trump administration's cuts to federal agencies are undermining the United States' ability to innovate, the driver of its economic growth. Hostile immigration policies are making it harder for U.S. firms, industries, and universities to attract the best ideas and talent from around the world and leverage them to boost America's prosperity. Wild threats of tariffs and restrictions on foreign supply chains are terrifying investors, who are beginning to sit on their capital and look for new opportunities away from the chaos. China, meanwhile, is becoming more competitive in the very fields the United States is kneecapping.

Washington needs to rediscover the value of innovation. Every area of future economic growth in which the United States is poised to lead—such as software, AI, oil and gas drilling, robotics, and electric vehicle production—depends on innovations that are impossible to nurture without reliable long-term support from the federal government. Both U.S. political parties once saw public investment in scientific education, training, and innovation as central to the country's future prosperity. Today, neither party reliably understands or champions that message. Instead, they adopt well-intentioned but misguided bipartisan policies aimed at cutting the United States' dependence on China and join together to bash Beijing, driving the rest of the world toward greater reliance on China.

Walling off the Chinese economy from the West will fail. Washington has no choice but to participate in a globalized economy it can no longer unilaterally control. The United States has spent decades and trillions of dollars to build the world's best innovation system. That system, in turn, has become the primary source of the country's economic and military strength. Stripping it for parts just as China is seeking to build an innovation apparatus that rivals the United States' would be suicidal.

When economies are young, they have lots of ways to grow. Some herd massive numbers of low-paid workers into fields and factories; others tap into natural resources. Once an economy is mature, however, there is only one dependable recipe for sustained growth: innovation. As labor and natural resources become scarcer and more costly, innovation makes it possible to do more with less. Since World War II, at least a quarter of all U.S. economic growth has been driven by innovations that make it possible for the economy to deploy capital and labor more effectively.

The U.S. economy is a prime example of how recipes for growth change over time. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the country grew by cutting trees, expanding to occupy western lands, and marshaling huge numbers of workers (including immigrants and enslaved people) into agriculture and then factories. When the frontiers of cheap land and labor closed by the late nineteenth century, innovation started to fill the void. As the U.S. economy moved toward manufacturing, innovations such as electric power grids—perfected through decades of investment, tinkering, and research often backed by government funding—helped expand the United States' industrial output. And as the economy later shifted to emphasize services, which today accounts for 80 percent of the United States' economic output, revolutionary innovations in, for example, computing kept the country competitive.

The full story of how innovation shapes economies is complex, but a successful innovation system nearly always has three key elements. First, it establishes and nourishes a pipeline of new ideas. The United States has led innovation for decades because of its massive federal support for research, which began during World War II. Money from Washington is spent by research universities, national labs, and institutes; the ideas generated are spun into companies that power economic growth and competitiveness. The private sector has stepped in to supplement federal funding for R & D, especially in industries such as biotech and computing. Yet in nearly every industry, the United States' most transformative innovations over the last eight decades depended on government funding, because the government was the most patient and reliable actor willing to take on risks for the public benefit.

This federal-funding system worked well because it married the government's prodigious resources to a relatively stable vision. On top of that, the government has proved reasonably good at determining how to best allocate those resources. Even as the United States' two main political parties differed on the ideal size and role of government, both saw immense value in backing innovation. When the Reagan administration tried to slash government spending, for example, total federal support for R & D stayed largely unchanged. Even during his first administration, when President Donald Trump proposed budgets that would have eviscerated R & D funding, Democratic and Republican lawmakers restored the money, keeping the nation's innovation system intact.

This continuity of intent seems a lot less likely during Trump's second term. Republicans have chosen to align with the president to shrink the size of government and slash budgets, including for innovation. Democrats, reeling from their election loss, seem to care more about funding priorities other than science. Just in the past few months, with barely any oversight from Congress, federal funding for innovation has fallen off a cliff. The administration has terminated about a thousand grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health, the nation's most important funder of biomedical research, with more to come. Cuts are so severe that federally funded biological research labs are euthanizing animals used to investigate worthy topics such as the safety of new drugs and the effects of pollution on workers. Some of the nation's leading research universities have seen their federal research funding targeted for reasons that have nothing to do with research.

This funding chaos has particularly imperiled the second key ingredient of a functioning innovation system: people. Science is an enterprise steeped in hope and characterized by delayed gratification. The typical scientist, after earning an undergraduate degree, spends another four to six years in Ph.D. training, followed by a few years of poorly paid postdoctoral employment. Despite the lack of short-term financial incentives, many of the world's best minds pursue science because their training—from tuition for advanced coursework through research apprenticeships—is largely paid for by research grants and universities themselves.

When grants dry up, so does the well of talented people pursuing innovation. Since late February, university and government labs uncertain about their future funding have been forced to make layoffs. Most of the burden of this uncertainty has fallen on young scientists. The catastrophic possibility of a lost generation of scientists now looms over the country's innovation system.

Magnifying the loss is the government's hostility to foreigners, especially Chinese. The success of the American innovation system has made it highly dependent on imported talent to perform much of the basic fieldwork of modern science. U.S. high schools and universities do not produce enough fledgling scientists and engineers to fully stock the country's innovation system, and to maintain the United States' research edge, the country must draw foreign talent. At the University of California, San Diego, where I work, about five percent of the undergraduate population, 25 percent of engineering master's students, and 45 percent of students enrolled in engineering Ph.D. programs are not U.S. citizens. Across the United States, about half of all graduate students in STEM fields hail from other countries; in engineering, there are twice as many foreign graduate students as there are U.S. citizens and permanent residents.

The U.S. innovation system needs the best foreign talent, and until recently, it got it. In 2023, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranked the United States as the most attractive place for foreign university students to study. Of all the world's footloose international students, 15 percent come to the United States, the largest share of any country in the world. China has been the United States' most important supplier of scientific talent. Throughout the 2010s, in any given year, nearly 400,000 Chinese students were studying in the United States, mostly in STEM fields. (By comparison, a paltry 12,000 young U.S. scientists and engineers studied in China in a given year.) Although the COVID-19 pandemic reduced these numbers, 300,000 Chinese students still currently attend U.S. universities. There are already signs, however, that this vital exchange is drying up. Co-authorship on papers in science and engineering among U.S. and Chinese scientists, for example, has been declining slowly since its 2020 peak.

The United States does need to reduce its dependence on Chinese talent: in any market, overreliance on any single supplier is almost always a recipe for insecurity. But it will take a couple of generations to rebalance the contribution of Chinese students to U.S. research. Meanwhile, harassment of Chinese citizens, including scientists, at U.S. borders and on campuses has become more prevalent, a phenomenon that anecdotally has led Chinese families to be more wary of sending their children to the United States. Such reluctance would be a catastrophe for U.S. research universities—and a gift to rival high-quality English-language universities such as in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Both rivals and partners of the United States are adopting new policies to woo foreign scientists such as boosting employment and startup visas. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is ramping up efforts to limit the enrollment of international students at U.S. universities.

A third key component for a successful innovation system is access to big markets. Because innovation seeks to boost production with fewer inputs, it nearly always benefits from scale. Big markets offer cumulatively greater opportunities for innovation that makes products better through experience. In clean energy technology, for instance, the globalization of markets has been a catalyst for advancements. Early innovations in solar power, backed by the United States and Japan in the 1970s in an attempt to reduce their dependence on imported oil, helped make solar energy viable in a few niche applications. In the first decade of this century, support from the German government (which was keen to cut dependence on nuclear power and imported energy and build local industries while also cutting emissions) created another big market for solar power. As the German and global markets grew, innovations led to still better-performing solar panels. The frontier of the solar industry then moved to China, where massive innovations in manufacturing drove down costs even further and helped make solar energy even more competitive with coal and gas. Over decades, this global approach has allowed solar panels, once a fringe technology, to become the cheapest way to generate electricity in many places.

But just as it has exemplified the benefits of globalized markets, the solar industry demonstrates the damage that nationalism can do to technological innovation. Rising tariffs and bottlenecks in supply chains created, in part, by chaotic trade policies are driving up solar costs in the United States. Although onshoring policies may eventually bring more solar production to the United States, as recently as 2023 about 80 percent of equipment used for U.S. solar projects was imported—mainly from China.

Investors now have to fear the arbitrary cancellation of their projects, too: in April, for instance, the Trump administration halted the energy giant Equinor's previously approved offshore wind project in New York. A month later, it reversed the order after pressuring New York state to greenlight an unrelated natural gas pipeline project; by then, the damage to the credibility of U.S.-based contracts had already been done. Clean energy hinges on investment. And these risks for investors explain why, according to a Bloomberg tracking service, half the planned projects to build clean energy technology factories in the United States are now getting delayed or frozen outright.

Mounting political and legal opposition may be able to roll back many of the administration's most noxious policies. But the signal to the rest of the world is clear: across the board, including as a backer of innovation, the U.S. government has suddenly become a lot less reliable. European governments' attempts to reckon with this reality has inspired myriad political and economic reforms, including increased defense spending, more coordinated and less costly green energy policy, and trade agreements enabling access to new markets, all of which will make the continent more competitive.

While the United States eviscerates its innovation system, China is staying the course. Starting in the 1990s, Beijing adopted an innovation strategy aimed at transforming its economy and, since 2000, has expanded its total spending on R & D by a factor of 20. Much of that investment flows through state-connected institutions, but the private sector's role has increased, as well. When all the sources of public and private funding are added together, the United States remains the world's biggest spender on R & D, but China is poised to pull ahead. In 2025, China's total R & D spending could surpass the United States' for the first time. In the early 1990s, Chinese university programs did not rank at the top of any major STEM field. Today, according to U.S. News and World Report rankings, eight of the world's top ten engineering programs are in China.

Chinese scientists are already revealing where they see their postgraduate future: at home. Two decades ago, about 95 percent of Chinese graduate students who studied in the United States stayed stateside for their first job after graduate school. Today, that “stay rate” has dropped to around 80 percent and is likely to fall further, possibly quickly.

Chinese returnees are going back to a country whose economy has been fine-tuned to turn innovation into production. Analysts who study innovation have often disparaged China for its focus on process improvements—for example, finding more efficient ways to use robots on production lines—rather than the invention of entirely new concepts. But process innovations have helped turn Chinese auto and battery factories into world leaders in those industries, just as they did when China's solar industry began to boom. These less lauded achievements play a key role in making the economy more productive, which is crucial as skilled labor gets more scarce and costly in China. Moreover, they are the stepping stones to more revolutionary technologies. For example, Chinese manufacturers of nuclear plants are world leaders in process improvements that make it possible to build nuclear reactors at low cost, despite the fact that the original innovations for most Chinese commercial reactors trace back to the United States. China is now building more reactors than the rest of the world combined by applying those innovations at scale. The economy, it turns out, cares less about who was first and more about where technologies get built.

To be sure, China's R & D boom faces its own headwinds. For innovation to truly transform the country, the broader economy must be in sound shape. Beijing is attempting to adopt reforms to reduce the Chinese economy's massive debt and overcapacity, including by stabilizing the national property market, whose stumbles have sapped consumer confidence. But the diverging trajectories of the China and the United States are nonetheless clear.

It is not too late to save the U.S. innovation system. But doing so will take a concerted effort across the public and private sectors. Universities are pushing back against the onslaught of cuts and federal intrusion into their research programs, which has helped. But although trust in science remains high among the highly educated, it is much lower in the rest of the U.S. public. Scientists cannot be one another's only advocates.

U.S. policymakers have not taken innovation seriously as a national priority. Just seven percent of congressional legislators belong to the High Tech Caucus, the only group in Congress dedicated to innovation. Reviving government support for science and technology requires far more than boosting membership in caucuses, however. In the absence of any credible strategy for reducing U.S. dependence on China, the prevailing anti-China consensus will continue to reward politicians who are hostile to foreign contact rather than managers who can make the most of it.

Both parties instead must make the case that federal funding for research is not a partisan hobbyhorse but a source of long-term economic and political strength. Republican Party leaders' unwillingness to break with Trump to defend the U.S. innovation apparatus has been particularly damaging, but there is still time for them to reverse course by listening more to business leaders—who themselves must organize to advocate for the long-term economic health of the country and not just short-term priorities such as tax cuts.

Those who want to salvage the United States' innovation agenda must not make the same error that the architects of globalization did. Successful innovation often causes imbalances in how the spoils are distributed, and when important segments of the country feel left behind, they can turn against innovation itself. As U.S. leaders work to promote innovation, they must respond to these imbalances with adjustments to limit China's outsize role as a global supplier. In some cases, carefully coordinated voluntary restrictions on exports, such as batteries from China to the United States and cars from China to Europe, will be necessary. At the same time, leaders must also find ways to keep the two innovation engines of the U.S. and China more closely connected, including by encouraging scientific collaboration in safe areas that are unlikely to raise national security concerns—something that leading Chinese and U.S. scientists already favor.China is making great strides in innovation. For now, the United States remains the global leader, thanks to the extraordinary innovation apparatus it has painstakingly built since World War II. Defending it will not be easy. Reconstituting it from ruins will be even harder.

HAROLD JAMES is Professor of History and International Affairs at Princeton University and the author of Seven Crashes.

MARIE-LOUISE JAMES is a visiting doctoral researcher at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, working on a Ph.D. on the history of nostalgia.

 Harold James and Marie-Louise James

Nostalgia is a killer. The term, originally coined in the late seventeenth century, described an illness that came in response to change and dislocation. Symptoms included fever, appetite loss, and heart palpitations. The prognosis, if left untreated, was death.

Today, society no longer sees nostalgia as a disease. Instead, it is thought of as a fuzzy, seemingly benign feeling about an idealized past. But the profound economic disruptions of the last few months might push analysts to revisit the idea that nostalgia is a grave, even life-threatening condition. American policies based on the premise of restoring past greatness—the mythical and opaque “again” of Make America Great Again—have worsened lives both within and outside the United States.

The most notable example came on April 2, 2025, when U.S. President Donald Trump rolled out a suite of massive, ostensibly reciprocal tariffs designed to restore the glory days of American manufacturing—resulting in a market crash. “We're bringing back an industry that was abandoned,” Trump triumphantly told voters, as bonds and stocks tanked. “We're going to put the miners back to work,” he said. “You could give them a penthouse on Fifth Avenue and a different kind of a job, and they'd be unhappy. They want to mine coal; that's what they love to do.”

Trump's announcement prompted a great deal of intellectual, as well as economic, shock. But he is not the first world leader to try cutting off his country in hope of turning the clock back. From the fifteenth to the nineteenth century, China sealed up its empire out of fear of outside influence. Japan did the same for much of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, during its shogunate era. And various European states have embraced the politics of nostalgia. Although these governments were motivated by different economic contexts and global pictures, they were united by the belief that closing off the nation to preserve traditions would bring about economic and even spiritual health.

Each of these cases ended poorly; history has demonstrated the danger of weaponizing nostalgic sentiments. Countries that embraced nostalgic policies either abandoned them or fell into ruin. China, for instance, was so weakened by its cutoffs that in the nineteenth century it became more and more subject to the diktat of Western imperialists. Japan's isolation also made it increasingly vulnerable to incursion from increasingly powerful Western countries. Europe's post–World War I yearning for an agrarian past helped lead to fascism. Washington, then, would be wise to not follow these courses. Otherwise, it, too, might discover that nostalgia can quickly turn malignant.

In 1688, a young Swiss physician named Johannes Hofer wrote a dissertation on a “state of mind” that was gripping his country—the “grief for the lost charm of the Native Land.” The Swiss already had a word for this kind of longing in everyday use: Heimweh, meaning homesickness. But Hofer gave it a medical name, combining the ancient Greek word for “returning home” with the one for “pain”: nostalgia. Hofer accompanied this new scientific term with a clinical account of nostalgia's origins and progression. It mostly afflicted young people who left their rural communities to make a living either in more urbanized parts of the country or abroad as mercenaries. It was thus seen as a condition of dislocation and inadaptation. Caused by “continuous vibration of animal spirits” in the brain, the nostalgic pathology admitted, as Hofer wrote, “no remedy other than a return to the homeland.” Hofer's newfound diagnosis was soon applied to the entire nation, with deadly nostalgia being branded as Schweizer Heimweh, or “Swiss homesickness.” In the two centuries following Hofer's dissertation, analysts also diagnosed “Swiss nostalgia” in societies across the rest of Europe (and in the Americas)—the causes being globalization, migration (often forced), and industrialization.

At the other end of the Eurasian landmass, however, nostalgic flare-ups were plaguing politics centuries before Hofer dreamed up the concept. The trend began in China. In 1433, Chinese admiral Zheng He returned home after his spectacular treasure fleet voyages. His impressive dragon ships had reached shores as far as the East African coast, where they dispersed sophisticated and elegant gifts in return for wild animals—cheetahs, giraffes, lions, oryxes—as well as spices and some cotton cloth. But the emperor concluded that this effort to globalize had been nothing more than an indulgence in exoticism, bringing no real benefits. Instead, he decided that any attempt to create tributaries would simply be costly, dragging Zhang and his subordinates into innumerable faraway conflicts as indigenous rulers tried to draw on the massive power of China in clashes with their rivals. It would involve entanglements that risked compromising China's core values and historic mission. Globalization, in other words, simply meant that other countries would take advantage of China's prosperity.

The imperial court thus opted for isolationism. It stopped funding such missions. It decided largely to stop buying foreign goods. It still let foreigners come from time to time to admire China, perhaps bringing along the odd gift. The Portuguese Jesuits, for example, made themselves popular at court by bringing ornate clocks. But China knew that it was wealthier than anywhere else in the world, and that it could thus afford to turn inward. Its belief that it would be better off by doing so was born both of a sense of cultural superiority and of the historical logic of varying philosophies. The Daoist, Wuxing, Buddhist, Confucian, and neo-Confucian traditions were all unique and at times contradictory. But they all stressed that history regularly required a reversion or restoration.

China's attitude persisted even as it lost its economic position. The Manchu Qing dynasty's expansion efforts were focused eastward, in nearby Central Asia, not overseas. The country thus remained isolated as the Industrial Revolution allowed the economies in Europe and in the United States to grow at a dramatic rate, until they far surpassed China's empire in both GDP and military power. The imperial court was aware that the West was innovating; a 1793 expedition by George Macartney brought a British planetarium and a steam engine to China. But the gift of the planetarium was regarded as an interesting curiosity and the transformative power of carbon energy, embodied in the steam engine, was unappreciated. The steam engine remained untouched, left in its packaging crate. “Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its borders,” the Qianlong emperor famously told Macartney. “There is therefore no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce.”



China was not the only Asian country that tried to freeze itself in time. Japan remained connected to the world for longer than its neighbor. But in 1603, it was consumed by its own version of globalization anxiety. The shogunate enacted its Sakoku—or “chained country”—provisions, barring Japanese people from going abroad. If Japanese people left anyway, they were prohibited from coming back. The government also cut off almost all diplomatic relations with other countries. Japan still maintained some trade with China through the port of Nagasaki and permitted some foreign books, mostly from the Protestant Netherlands. But by and large, it sequestered itself.

Some Japanese officials acknowledged that Sakoku might deprive their country of innovations. Yet they decided it was worth it because the corrupting influence of the wider world was too great. The country's new isolation was partially motivated by a desire to check the power of commercial magnates, the daimyo lords who had profited from commercial links at the expense of the central government. Officials also wanted to stop the drainage of silver, which had lowered prices and thus increased the cost of taxes and tribute payments. But there was above all a cultural component: an assertion of the values of a traditional society threatened by change. Japan, in particular, was afraid of Christian missionaries, who the ruling class believed were promoting the development of autonomous communities that would undermine the power of the central shogunate.

Both China and Japan thought that isolation would protect their civilizations. But in each case, their nostalgic policies greatly endangered them. The two societies fell behind as their economies grew feebler and their polities more vulnerable. They missed out on the dramatic surges in innovation and productivity brought by the Industrial Revolution. The United Kingdom's advanced military technology, for instance, meant the defeat of China during the First Opium War (1839–42)—shocking China's leadership. The country was forced to hand over Hong Kong to the United Kingdom and give the British highly favorable access to Chinese markets. During the ensuing “century of humiliation,” as the Chinese later called it, other European powers were also able to extract wealth from the defeated empire. The eventual results were dramatic new ideological movements within China designed to restore the country's power, including communism, whose adherents seized power in the 1940s.

Japan defended itself much more effectively than did China. But after the country was opened up by U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry, whose fleet of warships forced their way into the country in 1853, it took dramatic measures to modernize its economy. The country abolished feudalism and the shogunate during the Meiji Restoration. Soon, it adopted its own new ideology—one that called for imperialist expansion.

Europe, unlike China and Japan, did not try to avoid economic development. Rather than shutter out the rest of the world, European countries embraced new technologies that allowed them to build up powerful governments and militaries—with the purpose of building vast colonial empires.

Although Europe never cut itself off, nostalgia still crept into its politics. As the continent urbanized, many began to fret about the dwindling numbers of farmers and peasants, particularly during the Great Depression, which began in 1929. The widespread misery of that era made the old image of rural life appear more attractive than ever, resulting in specifically peasant political movements—such as the French Agrarian and Peasant Party—that promised a return to an idyllic, agrarian past.

In western Europe, these parties never developed substantial enough support to win outright power. But the rural ideal was strong enough that it formed a key component in building new coalitions of a populist right. In fact, farmers constituted such a large part of the electorate that these movements even acquired power within the center and the left. The left-wing French Radical leader Edouard Herriot, for example, declared that the peasants were “our silent master” and the “greatest of French philosophers.” To keep them happy, his government embraced price stabilization, subsidies, and market support to grow and protect agriculture.

But it was in Germany that the most striking—and devastating—use of agrarian romanticism occurred. The National Socialist Party rose to power in large part by capitalizing on agricultural depression, with the Nazis relying heavily on rural propaganda to win the votes of German farmers. “We must recognize that without our own land, without our own peasantry, there can be no economic prosperity in Germany, that all notions of export and import and of the global economy are nothing to us but concepts that may be useful but can never replace our own living space and our own peasantry,” Adolf Hitler declared in one typical 1932 election speech. “These are the foundation of every healthy economy.” When Hitler wooed rural audiences in the south of Germany, he even wore antiquated peasant dress, with traditional rural jackets and, sometimes, lederhosen.



The principal architect of the Nazis' rural political program was Walther Darré. The author of the tract “New Aristocracy of Blood and Soil,” Darré had a reputation for being both a student of technical farm matters and a feverish proponent of German expansion, which he believed was necessary for Germans' well-being. In his view, pure-blooded Germans should abandon the poisonous big industrial cities for a healthy life of the land.

The combination of racism and nostalgia was hardly uncommon. In fact, historically, the two are frequently enmeshed. In an interwar update to his famous tome The Decline of the West, the German writer Oswald Spengler argued that “the center of gravity of production” had been shifting away from Europe since “the respect of the colored races for the white has been ended by the World War.” This, he concluded, “is the real and final basis of the unemployment that prevails in the white countries.” Similar sentiments are echoed by the fictional character Tom Buchanan, a former sportsman and white supremacist, in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.

But Darré's agrarian policies ultimately had little effect on the material power of Germany. After being appointed minister for agriculture, Darré pushed for Germany to conquer territory so that the country's city dwellers would have fields to plow and settle, but he was hardly the driving force behind Germany's efforts to expand its borders. His efforts focused on creating a compulsory corporatist guild-style organization of farmers and pushed through a law prohibiting farms from being split up or sold by German peasants. He also continued his propaganda work, commissioning photographers to portray the glamor of handsome farmers working in the fields, glistening with sweat. But in reality, farmers continued to feel overburdened, abandoned by a government that wanted to industrialize quickly, largely for military reasons. The number of agrarian workers in Germany continued to drop.

It wasn't long before Hitler sidelined Darré. The lederhosen portraits were banned as unbecoming after Hitler became chancellor in 1933. The Nazi leader lost patience with rural policies—and with Darré—once he no longer needed peasant voters. By 1937, Hitler openly expressed his contempt for “peasant philosophy stuff” and refused to receive Darré or entertain his requests. After 1939, his only response to farmer demands was to send forced laborers to work in their fields. The rural dream at the heart of German nostalgia ultimately ran counter to the Nazis' drive to assert a racial hierarchy rooted in technology and industrialization.

After World War II, Europeans began to understand how critical nostalgia had been in the rise of fascism and the destruction of democracy. They therefore embarked on an alternative: encouraging a move out of the countryside while paying the remaining farmers substantial subsidies. In a certain sense, the latter move was a kind of polite nostalgia, like that of Herriot. But it was ultimately more an effort to keep the dwindling losers of globalization on its side while still moving the economy forward. In the 1980s, the Common Agricultural Policy (as it is called) accounted for over 70 percent of the European Community budget. Today, however, it consumes just over 25 percent of the EU's budget. The continent's economies were able to rapidly recover from the devastation of both the Great Depression and World War II while its people accepted that peasant life was firmly in the past rather than something that one could resuscitate at full capacity.

Yet nostalgia never fully left the picture, and now it has come roaring back into mainstream politics. It is, for example, again fueling European populism. This time, however, the nostalgic sentiment surrounds the loss of manufacturing. Italy, whose household appliances, textiles, and clothing trade were most vulnerable to the China shock, fell first, bringing about western Europe's first postwar populist government by making Silvio Berlusconi prime minister in 1994. Since then, this nostalgic infection has spread. Now, even Europe's industrial motor, Germany, is tottering as the populist Alternative for Germany grows in popularity, particularly in the eastern parts of the country most conspicuously left behind.

But no country appears more afflicted by nostalgia than the United States. Anger about globalization and the country's growing diversity is, after all, part of what propelled Trump to the White House. And especially since winning his second term, Trump has worked to make good on his atavistic promises. The president explicitly sold his sweeping tariffs as restorative: April 2, he told Americans, would mark “the day American industry was reborn” and “the day America's destiny was reclaimed.” His commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, likewise depicted the tariffs as Washington seizing back its glorified past. China, Lutnick said, had created an “army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones”—jobs that would once have belonged to Americans. Now, he said, “that kind of activity” would return.



Trump replaced most of his tariffs with a flat ten percent levy after the stock market tumbled. But no matter how high the rate, tariffs are unlikely to restore lost jobs, especially as the automation revolution looms. Furthermore, AI now threatens office workers in a way analogous to robots in factories during the first wave of industrialization during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Political nostalgia, however, can make people overlook the negative consequences that follow revanchist economic policies. As the world changes around voters, the familiar image of men working in the mines while their wives prepare meals at home is so comforting to many Americans that they are willing to make radical sacrifices to get it back. It is why U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent can argue that any tariff-induced pain is really a “detox period,” and why Trump can talk of tariffs as an “operation” and as “medicine.”

That medicine, however, is quackery. The economics of nostalgia never work, and its inevitable failure only breeds a cultural nostalgia that may be even more dangerous than the cutoffs. As Japan slipped behind western Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for example, it became more and more insistent on its unique cultural identity, helping lead it down the path of imperialism. When the United States doesn't get its jobs back—and in fact loses more as a result of the disruption caused by tariffs—Washington, too, might double down on assertions of American superiority. The government might wage more culture wars rather than agreeing to any kind of retreat. After all, someone must be to blame for the failure of economic policies that so many Americans endorse. Nostalgia, then, becomes both the cause of problems and a coverup for them.

It is not surprising that people are worried about the radically transformative technology of today. The twin forces of globalization and technology are upending jobs, communities, families, and social relations. The idea of going back to an airbrushed, idealized version of the world is thus highly attractive. But history suggests policymakers cannot afford to be stricken by the malady of nostalgia. As an individual feeling, it may be comforting. But as a policy prescription, it poisons discourse and breaks apart the body politic. Recovery takes a painfully long time—and returning to an imaginary lost homeland is not an option.

• Trump today: President Donald Trump said he'll know in two weeks if President Vladimir Putin is “tapping us along,” and warned of a shift if Russia is not serious about peace in Ukraine. Speaking after a swearing-in ceremony at the White House, Trump also said he believes Harvard University should cap the number of foreign students it enrolls.
    


• New sanctions on Russia: Trump is considering moving ahead with new sanctions on Moscow in the coming days as he vents his fury at the state of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, according to people familiar with the matter.
    


            • Immigration crackdown: Trump asked the Supreme Court yesterday to make it easier for his administration to deport people to South Sudan and other countries that are not their homeland, the latest in a series of controversial immigration policies the administration has put before the conservative-majority high court.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson signaled today that House Republicans were “eager and ready” to formalize the White House's so-called DOGE cuts as soon as President Donald Trump's team makes the official request to Congress.
    


                    “The House is eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings so we can deliver even more cuts to big government that President Trump wants and the American people demand,” Johnson posted on X.
                





            Johnson's comments come hours after a video circulated of Elon Musk, the billionaire who led the Department of Government Efficiency, directly criticizing the White House and House Republicans for its pricey domestic megabill.
    


            “I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk told “CBS Sunday Morning.”



            The precise timing of the White House's proposed claw back of federal dollars is not yet clear. House Republicans expect to receive the White House's formal request “very soon,” according to one GOP lawmaker familiar with the discussions.
    


            It is expected to target programs like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a small chunk of the federal budget that provides some public funding for NPR and PBS. It is also expected to formalize DOGE cuts to foreign aid programs — an issue that has been dicey with GOP leaders in Congress who oversee the State Department.
    


            President Donald Trump appeared to indicate that a luxury Boeing 747 airplane gifted from Qatar is in the process of being retrofitted by the US military.
    


            Asked when the plane would become a new Air Force One, Trump said efforts to transform it were already underway.
    


            “Well, it's here already. It's in the country. It's being refitted for military standard,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
    


            Trump started touting the plane while heralding deals he made while on his trip to the Middle East earlier this month.
    


            “By the way – got a beautiful, big, magnificent, free airplane for the United States Air Force. Okay? Very proud of that, too,” the president said.
    


            He continued, “They tried to say, ‘Oh, it's Trump's airplane.' Oh, yeah, sure, it's too big. It's, frankly, it's too big, much too big.”
    


            Trump has repeatedly cast the plane as a possible replacement for Air Force One, sparking controversy over ethical and security concerns, as well as legal questions about the details of the transaction.
    


            Last week, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth accepted the plane from Qatar, and a Defense Department spokesperson said it would be fitted with “proper security measures and functional-mission requirements.”
    


            Pressed Wednesday on how much it would cost to prepare it for presidential transport, Trump replied: “Oh, I don't know, whatever it is, a lot – hell of a lot less than building a new one. We're waiting too long from Boeing. Boeing has got to get its act together.”
    


            Vice President JD Vance leaned into the politics of Bitcoin during remarks at a conference in Las Vegas, casting the Trump administration as a “champion” and “ally” of the cryptocurrency industry.
    


            “I'm here today to say loud and clear with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House,” the vice president said.
    


            Vance also used his remarks to implore cryptocurrency supporters to show up for the 2026 midterm elections, making an ask to the crowd to “carry” their momentum “forward.”
    


            “The first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond,” he said.
    


            The vice president railed against the Biden administration's regulations of Bitcoin, saying the Trump  White House would end the “weaponization of federal regulations.”
    


            The crypto industry, created as a rejection of traditional finance, has long complained about being unfairly “debanked” as part of a coordinated federal effort. Banking regulators have disputed that narrative. Banks are required to ensure their clients comply with a maze of rules, and those lenders have to assess risk on a case-by-case basis. Crypto, in particular, raises red flags for traditional lenders because transactions are anonymous, making it especially useful for illicit transactions.
    


            Vance also championed the firing of a Biden-era chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who was openly hostile toward crypto. In one of his first speeches as chair, he described crypto as an asset class that is “rife with fraud, scams, and abuse in certain applications.” His stern stance toward digital assets made him a frequent rhetorical punching bag for the crypto industry.
    


            “Maybe the most important thing that we did for this community, we reject regulators and we fired Gary Gensler, and we're gonna fire everybody like him,” Vance said.
    


            When President Donald Trump was asked on Wednesday if he had plans to pardon the men convicted of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020, he responded: “I'm going to look at it.”
    


                    “It's been brought to my attention. I did watch the trial. It looked to me like somewhat of a railroad job. I'll be honest with you, it looked to me like some people said some stupid things,” Trump said in the Oval Office.
                





            He continued, “You know, they were drinking, and I think they said stupid things, but I'll take a look at that. And a lot of people are asking me that question from both sides. Actually, a lot of people think they got railroaded. A lot of people think they got railroaded.”
    


            Six men were originally charged with participating in the kidnapping plot. Two pleaded guilty, and two more were found guilty by a jury.
    


            President Donald Trump said that he urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to disrupt US-led nuclear talks with Iran, telling reporters Wednesday that he cautioned his counterpart that such a move would be “inappropriate.”
    


            Asked about reports that he warned Netanyahu against disrupting the talks during a phone call last week, Trump said, “Well, I'd like to be honest. Yes I did.”
    


            He added: “It's not a warning – I said I don't think it's appropriate.”
    


            Trump said that his team is having “very good discussions” with Iran, which have taken place over the last several weeks led by special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and moderated by Oman.
    


            “I said, I don't think it's appropriate right now, because if we can settle it with a very strong document, very strong with inspections. … I told him this would be inappropriate to do right now because we're very close to a solution,” he said.
    


            Trump indicated that any agreement with Iran would be “very strong,” saying, “I want it very strong where we can go in with inspectors. We can take whatever we want, we can blow up whatever we want, but nobody getting killed. We can blow up a lab, but nobody's going to be in the lab, as opposed to everybody being in the lab and blowing it up.”
    


            Trump offered a caveat that the situation “could change at any moment – could change with a phone call.”
    


            But, he added of Iran, “Right now, I think they want to make a deal. And if we can make a deal, I'd save a lot of lives.”
    


            President Donald Trump doubled down on his attacks against Harvard University, saying Wednesday that the Ivy League school should have a cap on the percentage of foreign students.
    


                    “I think they should have a cap of maybe around 15%, not 31%. We have people want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can't get in because we have foreign students there,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
                





            Harvard has broadly refused many government demands, including that it hand over foreign students' entire conduct records and allow audits to confirm it has expanded “viewpoint diversity.”
    


            The Trump administration last week canceled Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, a move that a federal judge put it on hold. And The Trump administration on Tuesday directed federal agencies to cancel all remaining contracts with the university.
    


            “Harvard has to show us their lists,” Trump said Wednesday. “They have foreign students, about 31% of their students are foreign-based, almost 31%. We want to know where those students come… Are they troublemakers? What countries do they come (from)?”
    


            Trump suggested, without evidence, that some of the international students included in Harvard's records will be “very radical people.”
    


            “They're taking people from areas of the world that are very radicalized, and we don't want them making trouble in our country,” Trump said.

            President Donald Trump on Wednesday brushed off comments from Elon Musk that the “big, beautiful bill” passed by the House did not contain enough cuts, saying he expected more changes to the legislation as it goes through the Senate.
    


                    “We have to get a lot of votes. We can't be cutting,” Trump said when asked to respond to statements Musk made in a CBS interview. “We need to get a lot of support, and we have a lot of support.”
                





            The president also said he's not happy with certain parts of the bill, and there will be negotiations on it.
    


            “We will be negotiating that bill, and I'm not happy about certain aspects of it, but I'm thrilled by other aspects of it. That's the way they go, it's very big. It's the big, beautiful bill. But the beautiful is because of all of the things we have, the biggest thing being, I would say, the level of tax cutting that we're going to be doing,” Trump said.
    


            Musk, who led the Department of Government Efficiency before stepping back, made the critical comments about the bill in an interview with CBS that aired Tuesday night.
    


            “I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk said.
    


            President Donald Trump downplayed any frustration with Israel's handling of its war with Hamas as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu readies a new offensive in Gaza.
    


            “No, we're dealing with the whole situation in Gaza. We're getting food to the people of Gaza. It's been a very nasty situation, very nasty fight. October 7 was a very nasty day, the worst that I think I've ever seen. It was a horrible day, and people aren't going to forget that either. So we'll see how that all works out,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the growing humanitarian crisis and Israel's plans.
    


            Wednesday marks 600 days of Israel's war against Hamas following the deadly October 7 attacks. And the military operations show no signs of abating despite rising international condemnation.
    


            Steve Witkoff, the president's special envoy for the Middle East who has been a key negotiator on the Trump administration's behalf, expressed some optimism as he previewed plans to send both sides a “new term sheet” aimed at resolving the conflict, as a peace deal has remained elusive.
    


            “I think that we are on the precipice of sending out a new term sheet that hopefully will be delivered later on today. The president is going to review it, and I have some very good feelings about getting to a long-term resolution,” Witkoff said.
    


            President Donald Trump said he'll know in a fortnight whether his Russian counterpart is “tapping us along,” vowing a change in course if he determines Vladimir Putin is not serious about achieving peace in Ukraine.
    


            But Trump declined to specify what actions he might consider to punish Russia, insisting instead his new harsh language toward Moscow should speak for itself. And he voiced concern that potential new sanctions on Russia could jeopardize a deal.
    


            “The words speak pretty loud,” he said. “We're not happy about that situation.”
    


            Trump in recent days has grown increasingly frustrated at the state of the conflict, which he once vowed to end within 24 hours of taking office. On Wednesday, he laid out a near-term timeline for determining how to proceed.
    


            “I'll let you know in about two weeks,” Trump said when questioned in the Oval Office whether Putin wants to end the war.
    


            “We're going to find out whether or not he's tapping us along or not, and if he is, we'll respond a little bit differently,” Trump went on.
    


            Trump's two-week timeline has been a recurring feature of his presidency when he is asked about pending decisions. He frequently uses the timeframe when questioned about actions he could take.
    


            Trump said Wednesday he still believes Russia “seem to want to do something,” but suggested uncertainty in how serious the country is about ending the war. And he appeared cautious about slapping new sanctions on Moscow amid ongoing talks.
    


            “I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,” he said.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi swore in Judge Jeanine Pirro as acting US attorney for Washington, DC, from the Oval Office today.
    


            The swearing in was preceded by remarks from President Donald Trump about Pirro. Bondi previously swore in Pirro while Trump was in the Middle East.
    


            After the ceremony, Pirro brought up the shooting that killed two Israeli embassy staffers last week outside a museum in Washington, DC.
    


            Pirro outlined how she intends to approach the job, saying that “we need to send a message that justice will be honored in the District of Columbia.”
    


                    “Just last week, here in our nation's capital, two people on the brink of beginning their life had hopes and dreams that were never realized, because a cold-blooded murderer made a decision to shoot them down on the streets on a cold, rainy night in our nation's capital,” Pirro said.
                





            “My voice and should be heard loud and clear: no more. No more tolerance of hatred. No more mercy for criminals. Violence will be addressed directly with the appropriate punishment,” she added.
    


            Pirro is a longtime Trump ally who was a regular presence at Mar-a-Lago even before he ran for president the first time.
    


This post has been updated with additional remarks from Pirro.



            A plaque honoring officers who defended the US Capitol during the January 6, 2021 attack has become a “very politically divisive issue,” the chief of the US Capitol told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview Wednesday.
    


            When asked about the plaque – which was approved in 2022 and has not yet been hung by Republican leaders in the House – Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said he thought the issue was so divisive “that I don't imagine there's any discussions even going on.”
    


            Manger, who took up the role in the wake of the January 6 attack, will retire this week after nearly 50 years in law enforcement.
    


                    “I will tell you that my cops, many of them, were here on January 6,” Manger said Wednesday. “They don't need anybody to tell them what happened or what it was, because they were here and they experienced it. They know the truth. They know what happened on January 6, and they know how bravely they responded.”
                





            The United States will restrict US visas from those who are responsible for alleged censorship of Americans, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced today.
    


            “We will not tolerate encroachments upon American sovereignty, especially when such encroachments undermine the exercise of our fundamental right to free speech,” Rubio said in a statement.
    


            The policy comes as the Trump administration has been actively revoking visas from foreign nationals in the US who were involved in protests against the war in Gaza. They also detained a Tufts University student for writing an op-ed critical of the conflict. A federal judge ordered her immediate release earlier this month the case raised concerns about her First Amendment and due process rights.
    


            In his statement, Rubio said “it is unacceptable for foreign officials to issue or threaten arrest warrants on U.S. citizens or U.S. residents for social media posts on American platforms while physically present on U.S. soil.”
    


                    “It is similarly unacceptable for foreign officials to demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies or engage in censorship activity that reaches beyond their authority and into the United States,” he added.
                





            It is unclear how the policy will be applied and who will decide what amounts to “censorship.” CNN has reached out to the State Department for further information.
    


            Elon Musk raised concerns about President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package, saying in a video released Tuesday that he believes it would raise the US budget deficit and undercut efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


                    “I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” the tech billionaire and Trump donor told “CBS Sunday Morning.” “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both.”
                





            Trump's “big, beautiful bill” includes trillions of dollars in tax cuts and a big boost to the US military and to national security spending – largely paid for by overhauls to federal health and nutrition programs and cuts to energy programs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would pile another $3.8 trillion to the deficit. It narrowly passed the House last week, and now heads to the Senate, where it will likely face many changes.



            Musk's comments come amid a media tour ahead of a SpaceX test flight Tuesday evening. Musk is stepping away from full-time government work to focus on his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, which have struggled in part as a result of Musk's alliance with the Trump administration.
    


            He noted the move in an interview with Ars Technica on Tuesday, hours before SpaceX's Starship test flight.
    


            “I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics, it's less than people would think, because the media is going to over-represent any political stuff, because political bones of contention get a lot of traction in the media,” he said when asked whether he feels his focus on politics over the past year has “harmed” SpaceX. “It's not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks.
    

In an interview with ""CBS Sunday Morning,"" Elon Musk raised concerns about President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful"" bill, warning it could increase the US budget deficit and undermine the Department of Government Efficiency. The bill narrowly passed the House last week and now heads to the Senate, where major changes are expected. Musk also announced he's stepping back from full-time government work to focus on his companies. #elonmusk #donaldtrump #bigbeautifulbill #doge #cnn #news


            The White House plans to officially swear in Jeanine Pirro today, after President Donald Trump named her interim US attorney for Washington, DC earlier this month.
    


            The swearing-in ceremony for Pirro, who has been acting as the top federal prosecutor in Washington, is scheduled to take place in the Oval Office at noon. Attorney General Pam Bondi swore in Pirro earlier this month, while Trump was on a trip in the Middle East.
    


            Prior to being named to the role, Pirro appeared on Fox News' “The Five” program and previously on her own weekend evening show called “Justice with Judge Jeanine.” She used her platform and her legal background to bellicosely defend Trump and deride his critics.
    


            President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he plans to release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government conservatorship — but he also said the two mortgage giants could still count on a government bailout in a crisis.
    


            Such a move would end 17 years of federal government control over the two companies, which play a central role in America's housing finance system by providing liquidity to the mortgage market.
    


                    “Our great Mortgage Agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, provide a vital service to our Nation by helping hardworking Americans reach the American Dream — Home Ownership,” Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday. “I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES, and I will stay strong in my position on overseeing them as President.”
                





            “These Agencies are now doing very well, and will help us to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” he added.
    


            The announcement came less than a week after Trump said he was giving “very serious consideration” to bringing Fannie and Freddie public.
    


            Fannie and Freddie essentially grease the wheels of America's home lending market by buying mortgages from lenders and repackaging them for investors. The government conservatorship of the two companies was initiated in 2008 after Fannie and Freddie played a role in America's housing market crash. The conservatorship was never meant to be permanent, but  untangling them from the government could be tricky.
    


            Privatizing Fannie and Freddie could spook investors who buy up mortgage loans, leading them to demand a higher return for their investments and pushing up mortgage rates, experts warn.
    


            Vice President JD Vance visited the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC, yesterday to honor Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, who were killed last week leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum.
    


            The Israeli ambassador to the US posted photos on X and thanked the vice president for visiting.
    


                    “Thank you @VP Vance for coming to the Embassy to honor our dear colleagues and friends, Sarah and Yaron. The care and compassion you and the Trump administration have shown in the wake of this murderous attack are testaments to the enduring friendship between our two countries and peoples, and our mutual battle against terrorism,” Ambassador Yechiel Leiter wrote.
                





            Vance is seen in one photo writing inside a book at the young couple's memorial table inside the embassy, where their picture is up on a posterboard next to a vase of flowers.
    


            The ambassador previously said Lischinsky, 30, and Milgrim, 26, who worked at the embassy, were about to be engaged.
    


            The Department of Justice is investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism and a hate crime.
    


            Thousands of Palestinians overran a newly established aid site in southern Gaza yesterday that is part of a controversial new Israeli- and US-approved aid distribution mechanism that began after months of blockade.
    


            Videos from the distribution site in Tel al-Sultan, run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), showed large crowds storming the facilities, tearing down some of the fencing and appearing to climb over barriers designed to control the flow of the crowd.
    


            Several residents trying to access the aid told CNN they were grateful for the food they received, but described walking long distances to reach the distribution center, hours-long lines and general confusion.
    


            A diplomatic official called the chaos at the site “a surprise to no one.”
    


            The GHF acknowledged the pandemonium, saying “the GHF team fell back to allow a small number of Gazans to take aid safely and dissipate. This was done in accordance with GHF protocol to avoid casualties.” A security source said American security contractors on the ground did not fire any shots and that operations would resume at the site on Wednesday.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces said their troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound and that the situation was brought under control. They denied carrying out aerial fire toward the site.
    


            “It's a big failure that we warned against,” said Amjad al-Shawa, director of Palestinian Non-Governmental Organizations Network.

            The US State Department has instructed US embassies and consulates around the world to pause new student visa appointments as it moves to expand “social media screening and vetting” to all applicants for student visas, according to a diplomatic cable seen by CNN.
    


            It's the latest move from the Trump administration that could deter international students from studying at universities in the United States.
    


            The cable signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio comes as the Trump administration has revoked scores of student visas and has attempted to stop foreign students from studying at Harvard University — a move that has been halted by a judge for the time being.

            The sky is still dark and the sidewalks are eerily empty when Soledad heads to work.
    


            The sound of sparrows chirping on a   rainy morning is punctuated by the occasional crackle of tires rolling on wet pavement. The city is still waking up. Soledad is, too, walking in the drizzle to a bus stop near her apartment.
    


            In about 30 minutes, she'll punch in and begin her day working as a janitor in a government building where she keeps bathrooms and kitchens clean. A short bus ride from her neighborhood leaves just enough time to grab a quick cup of coffee before her shift begins.
    


            At a downtown DC bakery, the cashier flashes a warm smile when she recognizes Soledad walking in. “¿Como está?” she asks. How are you?
    


            Soledad pauses. So many worries are weighing on her. “Pues, aquí,” Soledad says. Well, I'm here.
    


            Because yes, she is here, in a city where she's lived for more than two decades. But she doesn't know how much longer she will be.
    


            Soledad has what's known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, which provides legal work permits and blocks the government from deporting her and many other immigrants who otherwise would be undocumented. That protection's days could be numbered; already the Trump administration has said it plans to end TPS for hundreds of thousands of people. Before long, Soledad fears TPS for Salvadorans like her could be next. She agreed to share her perspective with CNN, but asked to be identified only by her first name, and for her face not to be shown, because she fears speaking out could affect her case.
    


            Reminders of the looming threats are everywhere. As she walks from the bus stop to her janitor job, Soledad often passes the White House, where President Trump and administration officials have made no secret of their mass deportation plans.
    


            And at a recent meeting of local activists, the 49-year-old Salvadoran immigrant says she posed a question she'd never expected to ask: “Is Washington a sanctuary city, or isn't it?”
    


                    “It makes you feel like you've been left alone, like you've been abandoned.”

            During the previous Trump administration, DC's leaders were vocal about protecting immigrant residents. Lately, Soledad says, their silence has spoken volumes.
    


            “It makes you feel like you've been left alone, like you've been abandoned,” Soledad says.
    


            There's not one official definition for “sanctuary city,” and different governments have different meanings for the term. Some see the label as more of a symbolic gesture than a move that actually impacts people's lives. But immigrant rights advocates have long argued that local officials play a critically important role. A city policy can be the difference between someone simply getting a traffic ticket or ending up in deportation proceedings.
    


            “Right now the immigrant community has two ways to defend ourselves. One is the courts, and the other one is local officials,” says Jaime Contreras, executive vice president of the Service Employee International Union's 32BJ Capital Area District. “And if local officials are running away from our community, that…has a devastating effect.”
    


            Nearly one in four residents of Washington and its surrounding metro area are immigrants, according to Census data. And in the past, Mayor Muriel Bowser frequently called Washington a “proud sanctuary city.”



            In a budget plan released Tuesday, Bowser took a dramatically different tack, proposing a repeal of the DC law that prohibits the city's Department of Corrections from cooperating with federal immigration authorities “absent a judicial warrant or order issued by a federal judge.” CNN is reaching out for further comment on why that measure, dubbed the “Detainer Amendment Act of 2025,” was included in Bowser's budget.
    


            The lines in her budget proposal, which don't mention the issue directly but would overhaul one of the city's sanctuary policies, are a marked contrast to the way she discussed immigration issues during Trump's previous administration, and the latest in a series of shifts from Bowser.
    


            Another recent change: the apparent removal of multiple city websites that used the “sanctuary city” term.
    


            Asked about the pages' apparent removal in recent months, first reported by Axios, a spokesman for the mayor referred to her remarks in a February press conference but declined to comment further. At that event, when asked by a reporter why she'd stopped using the term “sanctuary city,” Bowser called the phrase “misleading.”
    


            “I think it's misleading to suggest to anyone that if you're violating immigration laws, this is a place where you can violate immigration laws,” she said. “You are vulnerable to federal immigration enforcement.”
    


            Asked what message she'd send to undocumented immigrants in the city, Bowser instead offered what sounded more like a response to conservative critics.
    


            “We don't have a migrant crisis in our city, so I don't want anybody to think that we have been overrun and we have a migrant crisis, because we don't,” she said.
    


            Bowser's shifting response on immigration matters is one of a number of ways the mayor, a leading figure in the Democratic resistance during Trump's first term, is now striking a less defiant tone.
    


            The changing approach comes as Trump repeats attacks on DC and its leadership, threatening to “take over” the city.
    


            The mayor has a good reason to tread carefully, according to Abel Nuñez, executive director of the Central American Resource Center in Washington, an organization that serves the city's Latino community.
    


                    “There's no reason to poke the bear. … You have to choose what your battles are.”
                


                    —Abel Nuñez, executive director of the Central American Resource Center in Washington
                


            DC's status as a federal district puts the city and its more than 700,000 residents in a uniquely precarious position, Nuñez says. In 1973, Congress passed a statute allowing DC residents to elect local leaders to run day-to-day affairs, but lawmakers have threatened to reverse that arrangement.
    


            “That can be taken away at any moment. We get treated like children. That's just the reality of it,” Nuñez says. “We're allowed to manage our own affairs until they don't see fit for us to do so.”
    


            And no leader would risk her city's entire future for one group, he says.
    


            “There's no reason to poke the bear. … You have to choose what your battles are. Dying on the hill of the ‘sanctuary city' moniker, I don't think that's the right thing to do. I agree with the mayor,” Nuñez says. “You need to tone it down, shut down the website, do the things you need to do so that you can quietly negotiate.”
    


            But some advocates for immigrants are more critical.
    


            Contreras, who represents thousands of cleaners, security officers and maintenance workers at the SEIU, says workers will remember their local leaders' actions the next time elections come around.
    


            “Some of these elected officials…benefitted for years from having the support of a certain community, the immigrant community, in particular,” he says. “And then, when it comes time to defend our community, they run away from the issue as opposed to leaning in and saying, ‘Wait a minute, these are human beings, these are workers, these are not criminals.' They run away from us, and that is frustrating and insulting.”
    


            And for immigrants in the community, the impact isn't just emotional, he says.
    


            “It has a devastating effect on how they go about their day. They have to be looking over their shoulders all the time. They see a police officer, they get scared. They see a crime, they're not going to report it. For safety reasons, it's just not good,” he says.
    


            Minutes after stepping to the podium earlier this month for his final press conference as DC's interim US attorney, Ed Martin said he had a warning for the city's citizens.
    


            The district's status as a sanctuary city is “crippling” local law enforcement efforts to make DC safer, Martin said.
    


            “There needs to be a robust discussion now about DC's sanctuary status, and its justice system and its judges, and if that means that home rule is on the table, then so be it,” he said.
    


            In the past, DC officials have used the sanctuary city term to describe things like the Metropolitan Police Department's policy of not asking people about their citizenship or residency status, or city funding for immigrant legal services. In 2020, the City Council passed a “Sanctuary Values Amendment Act,” which limits the city's Department of Corrections from cooperating with federal immigration authorities “absent a judicial warrant or order issued by a federal judge.”
    


            Many of the largest cities in the country have sanctuary policies in place. Supporters of the measures argue they keep communities safe by fostering trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement. Critics — including President Trump — say they endanger public safety.
    


            The second Trump administration has made cracking down on sanctuary cities a pillar of its enforcement strategy, with the president calling them “death traps” that protect criminals. A federal judge recently ruled against the administration's efforts to block federal funding to sanctuary cities, finding that portions of Trump's executive orders were unconstitutional.
    


            Meanwhile the Justice Department has threatened to prosecute state and local officials who resist the federal immigration crackdown.
    


            Republican leaders in Congress also have criticized sanctuary cities, most notably in a March hearing before a House committee,  where lawmakers grilled mayors of prominent sanctuary cities: Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York. DC's mayor wasn't asked to appear.
    


            But officials have homed in on the capital's sanctuary policies in other ways.
    


            Trump's “Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful” executive order, issued in late March, created a federal task force whose mission includes “monitoring the district's sanctuary-city status and compliance with the enforcement of federal immigration law.” The order also calls for the task force to direct “maximum enforcement” of federal immigration law, and to redirect available law enforcement resources “to apprehend and deport illegal aliens in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.”
    


            And Republicans in the House and Senate have introduced legislation aiming to remove DC's sanctuary laws, arguing they have “devastating, real-life consequences.”



                    “President Trump's efforts to enforce immigration laws should not be undermined by local leadership anywhere in the United States, let alone Washington, DC.”
                


                    —Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tennessee
                


            As he introduced the Senate's version of the bill last month, Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tennessee, called DC's policies “unconscionable.”
    


            “President Trump's efforts to enforce immigration laws should not be undermined by local leadership anywhere in the United States, let alone Washington, DC,” he said.
    


            It wasn't long ago that many immigrants saw Washington as one of the safest places to live, according to Antonia Peña, who represents nannies, house cleaners and care workers as a leader of the DC chapter of Care in Action.
    


            The district's policies, including its minimum wage and its protections for workers, were among the best in the region, she says. “And in terms of immigration, Washington has always been considered a sanctuary.”
    


            But now, she says, given the pressures DC is under from the federal government, many immigrants are starting to see the city differently.
    


            “Washington right now is becoming the area with the least protection, legally speaking,” she says.   “And that is what we've been explaining to people, talking about it and accepting it in a way, because this is a huge impact under this administration, something that no one expected.”
    


            Already high costs were making many workers reconsider living in the city, she says. “Now this is going to become one more reason to move out of DC,” she says.
    


            Just a few months into the new Trump administration, leaders of immigrant advocacy organizations in DC say fears are running high.
    


            “The need is so big and the threats are so big. … I'm running out of resources, because we're tapped out,” says Rev. Julio Hernández of the Congregation Action Network.
    


            Recently, he says he's gotten calls about people who've been evicted because some landlords no longer want to rent to undocumented immigrants. Many are worried the district's police department could be federalized, he says, converting the officers who patrol communities into immigration agents.
    


            “There is a big concern of what could come,” Hernández says. “The feeling is, if there's more funding, then there will be a greater increase in immigration raids. And DC is a pretty easy target. … If they lose their self-rule,      we feel there's an even bigger danger for the city and for its residents.”
    


            Protesters pack into a park for a rally in DC's Mount Pleasant neighborhood on a spring    evening. Soledad is in the crowd.
    


            In the past, she might have joined the speakers on stage, sharing her story. But today, she's watching from the sidelines. Organizers of this protest told her they were worried noncitizens could be targeted for speaking out.
    


            So Soledad doesn't tell this crowd about the years she's spent fighting for immigrant rights, or about her 15-year-old daughter, a star student — and US citizen — who's often stood alongside her.   Instead, she listens.
    


            Some speakers at the rally are wearing masks to protect their anonymity.
    


                    “With the silence of our elected officials, I feel they are giving away our rights.”
                


                    A speaker at a recent protest pushing DC leaders to protect the city's sanctuary status
                


            “How is it possible that being an immigrant in DC means living in fear?” one speaker asks.
    


            “It wasn't until I moved to DC that I felt like I belonged in this country,” another says.
    


            “With the silence of our elected officials, I feel they are giving away our rights. … We are the only people that can keep us safe.”
    


            Organizers and participants at this protest say DC's leaders should do more to fight back against Trump's immigration crackdown.
    


            “We fought hard to create the sanctuary policies, and we're not going to let Congress eliminate them without a fight,” Oliver Merino of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center tells CNN affiliate WJLA. “The community wants the mayor, the city council, to step up and to publicly say they will protect our sanctuary policies that keep our community safe.”
    


            An organizer onstage says that members of the City Council were invited to the event, but none of them showed up.
    


            One by one, each council member's name is read from a list, then their photo is taped to a railing onstage.
    


            “Is he here or is he missing?” the organizer asks, craning her neck and looking out at the crowd like a sailor scanning the horizon.
    


            It doesn't take long for the crowd to answer: “MISSING!”
    


            A few council members' photos fall off the railing in the evening breeze.
    


            “Even the papers are scared,” someone quips in the crowd.
    


            Asked via email whether DC remains a sanctuary city, the offices of the city's 13 sitting council members didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            It's no surprise to find critics of the president's immigration crackdowns in DC. Trump won less than 7% of votes cast here in the last presidential election.
    


            But DC isn't like other liberal cities, according to Rick Su, a distinguished professor of law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Many cities that get in standoffs over immigration with the federal government have states to protect them, he says.
    


Takeaways from the congressional hearing grilling ‘sanctuary city' mayors on immigration



            “The funny thing and the scary thing is that DC is essentially…a creature of the federal government, of Congress, of the president,” Su says.
    


            Though it's unclear whether Congress really wants to take on the challenge of running the city again, Su says, lawmakers could pass another statute to retake control.
    


            Given that reality, Su says it appears the city's leaders are currently pursuing a policy he's dubbed “silent sanctuary.”



            “We can still do our thing,” Su says city leaders are likely thinking, “as long as we keep a very friendly and…submissive public face.”
    


            Soledad walks in front of the Supreme Court carrying a tote bag emblazoned with the three red stars and two red stripes of DC's flag.
    


            She sets it down near the building's steps and pulls out several banners and a megaphone she's tucked inside. Soledad and dozens of others are holding a vigil to support Temporary Protected Status, which the Trump administration has said it's ending for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. In a matter of weeks, a Supreme Court decision will clear the way for the administration's plan to take effect while legal challenges over the matter continue in court.
    


            But on this evening in early May, Soledad and the other protesters say they're pushing to bring attention to their cause before it's too late.
    


            Even though it's been raining all afternoon, a sizeable crowd has gathered, and the sun is coming out. But many of those gathered are worried – not just about the court's looming decision, but about reports and rumors that have been swirling in the city all week.
    


            Homeland Security Investigations agents served more than 100 notices of inspection at businesses around the DC area. The agency said it was an effort to ensure compliance with immigration and employment laws.
    


            Bowser told reporters the district's police weren't involved, and that she was “disturbed” by what she'd heard had unfolded.
    


            “It appears that ICE is at restaurants or even in neighborhoods,” she said, “and it doesn't look like they're targeting criminals. It is disrupting.”
    


            A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups slammed the mayor for appearing at an event with Trump while reports of the enforcement effort left immigrant communities in the city terrified.
    


            Soledad is worried ICE agents could show up at this protest, and she knows others are concerned about that, too.
    


            Recently she's been more cautious about speaking out. At a protest she attended earlier this month, she loaned out her megaphone to amplify someone else's voice.
    


            With each day that passes, though, she's growing more concerned about what could happen if she doesn't speak out than what will happen if she does. For her and so many others whose lives are at stake, she says, staying quiet simply isn't an option.
    


            She can't imagine being forced to abandon the life she's worked hard to build or having to take her daughter away from the only home she's ever known.
    


            “Un pueblo únido jamás será vencido,” she shouts into the megaphone. A people united will never be defeated.
    


            Following her lead, the crowd repeats the popular protest mantra. Then Soledad belts out a less common line that's become her favorite chant:
    


            “Un pueblo callado jamás será escuchado.”
    


            The people who are silent will never be heard.

Follow:


            Elon Musk raised concerns about President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package, saying in a video released Tuesday that he believes it would raise the US budget deficit and undercut efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            “I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” the tech billionaire and Trump donor told “CBS Sunday Morning.” “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both.”
    


            Trump's “big, beautiful bill” includes trillions of dollars in tax cuts and a big boost to the US military and to national security spending – largely paid for by overhauls to federal health and nutrition programs and cuts to energy programs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would pile another $3.8 trillion to the deficit. It narrowly passed the House last week, and now heads to the Senate, where it will likely face many changes.



            Musk's comments come amid a media tour ahead of a SpaceX test flight Tuesday evening. Musk is stepping away from full-time government work to focus on his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, which have struggled in part as a result of Musk's alliance with the Trump administration.
    


            He noted the move in an interview with Ars Technica on Tuesday, hours before SpaceX's Starship test flight.
    


            “I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics, it's less than people would think, because the media is going to over-represent any political stuff, because political bones of contention get a lot of traction in the media,” he said when asked whether he feels his focus on politics over the past year has “harmed” SpaceX. “It's not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”
    


            Musk also noted last week that he'll spend “a lot less” money on politics in the future, but it's still not clear whether the remarks signal any change in his pledge to commit $100 million into political groups controlled by the president. Musk previously spent more than $290 million to help get Trump and GOP congressional candidates elected in November. Musk-linked groups also shelled out more than $20 million on a Wisconsin Supreme Court race earlier this year that his preferred candidate ultimately lost.
    


            Musk also continued to defend the work DOGE has been doing in Washington, telling the Washington Post on Tuesday that the team has become a “whipping boy.”
    


            “DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,” he said. “So, like, something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.”
    


            CNN has previously reported that DOGE is poised to continue its work even as Musk steps back, with staffers to remain in place, embedded across federal agencies, for months or years to come.

            Stellantis named its North American chief, Antonio Filosa, as its new chief executive on Wednesday, as it seeks to revive the performance and shares of the multinational automaker.
    


            Filosa, an Italian national, replaces Carlos Tavares, who stepped down in December after a fall in profits and sales. He will officially be CEO from June 23, when he will also announce a new leadership team, the company said.
    


            The tasks are daunting as the global car industry seeks to navigate the chaotic trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.
    


            For Filosa and Stellantis (STLA), the focus is on trying to revive profits in the major US market. The company also needs to rationalize Stellantis' portfolio of 14 brands, which analysts say could mean axing some of them.
    

The automaker says shutdowns in Canada and Mexico are short-term, but the future remains unclear. CNN's Valeria Leon reports from an auto assembly plant where production is paused.

            The board's choice was unanimous and was based on Filosa's “proven track record of hands-on success during his more than 25 years in the automotive industry,” the company said.
    


            Shares in the carmaker — the world's fourth largest by sales — whose brands include Chrysler, Peugeot and Jeep, were slightly higher in morning trade, a muted reaction for a much-anticipated appointment.
    


            The Milan-listed shares have lost more than two-thirds of their value since early last year.
    


            Filosa has been leading Stellantis in North America since October. In 2023, he was also appointed global head of Jeep, a role he quit this year.
    


            Some investors said Filosa had relatively limited experience in North America and that an outsider would be better positioned to shake up the business.
    


            However, Fabio Caldato, a portfolio manager at AcomeA SGR, which holds Stellantis shares, said Filosa had the right profile, with his specific knowledge of the US market, as well as of the local culture from a negotiating perspective.
    


            “His operational rather than financial curriculum is further proof of Stellantis' quest to have a CEO prepared to handle both its business revival and its wider transition to electrification,” he said.
    


            Analysts at Italian broker Intermonte were more cautious, saying Filosa's appointment was not expected to have a strong impact, as his experience in North America was limited.

Russia launched a large strike on the city of Kharkiv and the nearby area overnight Wednesday, according to State Emergency Service of Ukraine.

BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz pledged Wednesday to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any Western-imposed limitations on their use and targets as the Kyiv government fights to repel Russia's invasion.

Some of the advanced weapon systems that Kyiv's allies supplied to Ukraine during the 3-year-old war were subject to range and target restrictions — a fraught political issue stemming from fears that if the weapons struck deep inside Russia, the Kremlin might retaliate against the country that provided them and draw NATO into Europe's biggest conflict since World War II.

Standing beside visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Merz said that under an intensified cooperation agreement, Germany “will strive to equip the Ukrainian army with all the capabilities that truly enable it to successfully defend the country,” including upgraded domestic missile production.

After the United States, Germany has been the biggest individual supplier of military aid to Ukraine.

“Ukraine will be able to fully defend itself, including against military targets outside its own territory” with its own missiles, Merz said at a joint news conference.

Hours after Merz's pledge, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov invited Ukraine to hold direct peace talks with Moscow in Istanbul on June 2.

In a video statement, he said Russia would use the meeting to deliver a memorandum setting out Moscow's position on “reliably overcoming the root causes of the crisis.” He also said that any Russian delegation would again be headed by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.




“We hope that all those who are sincerely interested in the success of the peace process in more than just words will support a new round of direct Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Istanbul,” Lavrov said. 

President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he is holding off on new sanctions on Russia because he doesn't want to interfere with attempts to negotiate an end to its invasion of Ukraine.

“If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that,” Trump said, adding that he will know in about two weeks if Russia is willing to reach a deal to end the war.

Low-level delegations from Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks in three years in Istanbul on May 16. The talks, which lasted two hours, brought no significant breakthrough, although both sides agreed to the largest prisoner exchange of the war that was carried out last weekend and freed 1,000 captives on each side.

Merz declined to say whether Germany will supply its advanced Taurus long-range cruise missile to Ukraine — long a request by Kyiv and a step that Berlin has resisted.

The decision not to commit to giving Taurus missiles to Ukraine was a “big disappointment,” said lawmaker Roderich Kiesewetter, a senior member of Merz's party, the Christian Democratic Union.

Merz loves “very strong personal statements,” but is not able to back them up with support from his coalition partners, Kiesewetter told The Associated Press.

“We have a Moscow connection in Germany,” Kiesewetter said, suggesting some politicians are in favor of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia to end the war, along with lifting some sanctions.

Asked about Germany's offer to fund long-range missile production in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded that the move was an obstacle to reaching a peace agreement.

Both Merz and Zelenskyy criticized the Kremlin's effective rejection of an unconditional ceasefire proposed by the U.S., which Kyiv accepted. Kyiv says Moscow has been slow to respond to proposals for a settlement.

Merz said last Monday that Germany and other major allies were no longer imposing range limits on weapons they send to Ukraine, although he indicated their use was limited to Russian military targets. Ukraine has launched its own long-range drones at sites that support Russia's military efforts, including refineries and chemical plants.

Then-U.S. President Joe Biden last year authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied missiles for limited strikes in Russia. The decision allowed Ukraine to use the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS against Russia.

In Berlin, Zelenskyy called for deeper defense cooperation across Europe and with Washington, stressing the need for long-range capabilities and sustained military funding to ensure Ukraine's resilience.

“We need sufficient long-range capabilities. That's why we must be certain of the financing of our army and the stability of Ukraine,” he said.

He said the cooperation projects already exist. “We simply want (the missiles) to be produced in the quantity we need,” Zelenskyy told reporters.

Zelenskyy said Ukraine is ready to hold peace talks at the highest level, including a trilateral meeting with himself, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump.

“Both the American side knows this, and the Russian side knows this,” he said. Zelenskyy said he would accept any configuration of talks, whether that includes one trilateral meeting or separate meetings with Trump.

Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Russia is grateful to Trump for his mediation efforts. 

“At the same time, there is a big number of nuances to be discussed that can't be neglected and which neither party is going to sacrifice, because of its national interests,” Peskov told reporters. “Just like the United States, Russia has its national interests that are of primary importance to us.”

Meanwhile, fighting has continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where Ukraine's army is shorthanded against its bigger adversary. Zelenskyy claimed Tuesday that Russia is mobilizing up to 45,000 men every month, while Ukraine mobilizes between 25,000-27,000.

Both sides are continuing to conduct deep strikes. Russia launched its biggest drone attack of the war against Ukraine on Sunday.

Russian air defenses downed 296 Ukrainian drones over 13 Russian regions late Tuesday and early Wednesday, Russia's Defense Ministry said, in what appeared to be one of the biggest Ukrainian drone assaults of the war.

Ukraine is increasing its domestic production of drones and missiles, according to Zelenskyy. He said late Tuesday that Ukraine wants European countries to help it invest in the manufacture of attack drones, air defense interceptors, cruise missiles and ballistic systems.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that air defenses shot down Ukrainian 33 drones heading toward the capital.

Moscow regional Gov. Andrei Vorobyov said 42 drones were downed. He said that drone fragments damaged three residential buildings in the village of Troitskoye, but no one was hurt.

More than 60 flights were canceled Wednesday in Moscow as the capital's airports were forced to ground planes amid drone warnings, said the federal aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya.

Overnight, Russian forces launched an attack on Ukraine using five Iskander ballistic missiles, one guided air-launched missile and 88 drones, Ukraine's air force said. Air defense units shot down 34 drones, and 37 drones were jammed.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Strongly pro-Taiwan U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth is visiting the self-governing island democracy to discuss regional security and relations with the U.S. 

Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, will hold a series of high-level meetings with senior Taiwan leaders to discuss U.S.-Taiwan relations during her visit Wednesday and Thursday, said the American Institute in Taiwan, which acts as the de-facto American embassy in Taiwan in liu of formal diplomatic relations. 

Trade, investment and “other significant issues of mutual interest” also are on the schedule, the institute said.

“The visit underscores the United States' commitment to its partnership with Taiwan and reaffirms our shared commitment to strengthening a Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” the institute said.

China routinely protests such visits, which it views as a violation of U.S. commitments. 

Duckworth and her staff are the second U.S. congressional delegation to visit Taiwan in as many days, demonstrating concerns in Washington over the island's security in the face of Chinese threats to invade, as well as its importance as a trade partner, particularly as the producer of 90% of the world's most advanced computer chips.

Taiwan also faces 32% tariffs under the Trump administration, a figure the government in Taiwan is attempting to negotiate to a lower level without angering sectors such as agriculture that fear lower tariffs could open their markets to heightened competition from abroad. 




Duckworth is visiting at the same time as Lourdes A. Leon Guerrero, the governor of Guam, the U.S. Pacific territory that would almost certainly be a key player in any Chinese military moves against Taiwan. 

Taiwan and China split during a civil war in 1949 and Beijing still considers the island its own territory to be annexed by force if necessary. China refuses all contact with the government of President Lai Ching-te, whom China brands as a separatist, and seeks to maximize diplomatic pressure on Taiwan.

While China sends military aircraft, ships and spy balloons near Taiwan as part of a campaign of daily harassment, special attention has been given this week to the location of the Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier, whose hull was bought from Ukraine and then fitted out by China more than a decade ago. China has two aircraft carriers including the Liaoning, a third undergoing sea trials and a fourth under construction.

“What I can tell you is that the activities of the Chinese warship in the relevant waters are fully in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.

Col. Hu Chung-hua of the Taiwanese Defense Ministry's' intelligence department told reporters Wednesday that the carrier was currently in waters southeast of Taiwan and has been under close surveillance by Taiwan's monitoring stations since leaving its home port in China. 

There are concerns the carrier might stage military drills close to Taiwan that could be a further step toward a blockade, an act the U.S. would be required to respond to under its own laws. While the U.S. provides much of Taiwan's high-tech military hardware, the law is unclear whether it would send forces to aid Taiwan in the event of a conflict. 

Hu said the ministry would not comment on the possibility of drills near Taiwan, but considers all options while monitoring the Chinese military.

The ministry “anticipates the enemy as broadly as possible and defends against the enemy strictly. We also carefully evaluate and act accordingly,” Hu said. 

China is considered a master of “grey-zone encounters” that bring tensions just to the point of breaking out into open conflict.

Col. Su Tong-wei of the ministry's operation of planning said the armed forces were constantly evaluating threat levels to consider whether to “activate a response center, or to increase our defense readiness to perform an immediate readiness drill.” 

“We will also react accordingly to safeguard national security,” Su said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department has halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for foreign students hoping to study in the U.S. while it prepares to expand the screening of their activity on social media, officials said. 

A U.S. official said Tuesday the suspension is intended to be temporary and does not apply to applicants who already had scheduled their visa interviews. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an internal administration document. 

A cable signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press says the State Department plans to issue guidance on expanded social media vetting.

“Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consulate sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor visa appointment capacity” until the guidance is issued, the cable says. 

Asked about the suspension at a briefing Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the U.S. uses every available resource to vet people applying for visas.

“We will continue to use every tool we can to assess who it is that's coming here, whether they are students or otherwise,” Bruce said. 

The move, first reported by Politico, is the latest in the Trump administration's crackdown on international students. 

Last week, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, removing the college from the program that allows schools to sponsor foreign students for visas. That effort was quickly challenged in court and for now is blocked by a federal judge.




This spring the administration also revoked the legal status of thousands of international students already in the country, leading some to leave the U.S. out of fear of deportation. After many students filed successful legal challenges, the administration said it was restoring the students' legal status. But the government also expanded the grounds for terminating international students' legal status going forward.

_




President Donald Trump's previous administration stepped up scrutiny of all visa applicants, introducing reviews of their social media accounts. The policy remained during President Joe Biden's administration.

An extended pause in scheduling student visas could lead to delays that may disrupt college, boarding-school or exchange students' plans to enroll in summer and fall terms.

A downturn in enrollment of international students could hurt university budgets. To make up for cuts in federal research funding, some colleges shifted to enrolling more international students, who often pay full tuition.

Detectives have detained a person of interest in a shooting at a Connecticut mall on Tuesday that wounded five people and prompted an evacuation and a massive police response. Officers responded to the Brass Mill Center for reports of a disturbance, said Waterbury Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo. All of the victims were being treated at hospitals.

WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) — Detectives have detained a person of interest in a shooting at a Connecticut mall on Tuesday that wounded five people and prompted an evacuation and a massive police response.

Officers responded to the Brass Mill Center for reports of a disturbance at around 4:40 p.m., said Waterbury Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo. All of the victims were being treated at hospitals.

Waterbury Police said on social media post Tuesday night that the victims have non-life-threatening injuries.

Spagnolo said police believe the shooter used a semiautomatic pistol. He said the suspect knows the victims and that the shooting was preceded by a dispute that quickly escalated.

“We do not believe this was a random act of violence,” Spagnolo said at a briefing outside the mall, adding that there is no further threat to the public. 

No additional details about the person of interest were provided by Waterbury Police.

Spagnolo credited patrons and mall staff for sheltering in place and keeping safe during the shooting. 

“I think they mitigated a lot of what could have been a really bad incident here,” Spagnolo said. “These acts occur. Unfortunately it's the society we live in at time. But we can't let it get us down.”

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said state police will be assisting with the investigation.

“Our hearts break for the Waterbury community, the victims, and their families who have been impacted by this incident,” the Democrat said in a statement.

The Brass Mill Center is located off Interstate 84 in Waterbury, about 30 miles (about 50 kilometers) southwest of Hartford, the state capital.

A U.S.-backed group that is slated to take over aid distribution in Gaza says it plans to launch operations imminently despite opposition from the U.N. and the unexpected resignation of its executive director, who said it was clear the organization could not meet humanitarian principles.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — A U.S.-backed group approved by Israel to take over aid distribution in Gaza says it has started operations, despite opposition from the U.N. and most humanitarian groups and the unexpected resignation of its executive director.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the linchpin of a new aid system that would wrest distribution away from aid groups led by the U.N., which have carried out a massive operation moving food, medicine, fuel, tents and other supplies across Gaza since the war began in October 2023. 

The new mechanism limits food distribution to a small number of hubs under guard of armed contractors, where people must go to pick it up. Currently four hubs have been set up, all close to Israeli military positions. 

Israel has demanded an alternative plan because it accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid. The United Nations and aid groups deny there is significant diversion. They reject the new mechanism, saying it allows Israel to use food as a weapon, violates humanitarian principles and won't be effective. 

Israel blocked food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza for nearly three months, pushing the territory toward famine. Last week, it allowed in a trickle of supplies, saying it would let the U.N. distribute it only until GHF was running. 

The Hamas-run Interior Ministry on Monday warned Palestinians in Gaza against dealing with GHF.

So, how will this plan work, who's behind it and why are aid groups pushing back? 




GHF said it moved trucks of food to its hubs on Monday and began distribution, without giving details on how much aid was distributed. It said the flow of supplies would be “increasing each day.” It has said it plans to reach more than 1 million Palestinians by the end of the week. Gaza has a population of around 2.3 million. 

The Israeli military said two of the four hubs started distributing food, both in the Rafah area in the southernmost end of Gaza, where few Palestinians are located. On Tuesday, thousands of Palestinians walked from tent camps outside the city of Khan Younis, crossing Israeli military lines, to reach the distribution points. 

At one point on Tuesday, chaos erupted as Palestinians overwhelmed a hub outside Rafah, breaking through fences. Nearby Israeli troops fired warning shots, sending people fleeing in panic. The military later said the situation was brought under control but at least three injured Palestinians were seen being brought from the scene.

GHF publicly launched early this year and is run by a group of American security contractors, ex-military officers and humanitarian aid officials. It has the support of Israel and the United States. 

Until resigning, Jake Wood was the face of the foundation. Wood is a U.S. military veteran and co-founder of a disaster relief group called Team Rubicon. He said Sunday night he was resigning because it was clear the organization would not be allowed to operate independently.

It's unclear who will now run GHF. 

A proposal circulated by the group earlier this month and obtained by the AP included several names, including the former director of the U.N. World Food Program, David Beasley. Neither Beasley nor GHF have confirmed his involvement.

It's also unclear who is funding GHF. It claims to have more than $100 million in commitments from a European Union government but has not named the donor. The U.S. and Israel have said they are not funding it.

The GHF's plan to centralize distribution through hubs is similar to ones designed by Israel.

It says each of its initial four hubs would serve meals for roughly 300,000 people. It has said it will eventually be able to meet the needs of 2 million people. It said it will create more hubs within 30 days, including in the north, but did not specify their exact locations. 

Aid will be delivered with the help of private subcontractors transporting supplies in armored vehicles from the Gaza border to the hubs, where they will also provide security. It said the aim is to deter criminal gangs or militants from redirecting aid.

One of the hubs is in central Gaza, close to the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land held by Israeli troops, according to a map issued by the Israeli military. The three others are in the area of Rafah, south of the Morag Corridor, another military-held strip.

Almost the entire population is currently in northern Gaza — where no hub is currently located — or in central Gaza. They would have to cross through Israeli military lines to reach the hubs near Rafah.

Just before his resignation, Wood spoke of some adjustments, but it is not clear if Israel agreed to them. 

In a letter to Israeli officials obtained by the AP, Wood said that until at least eight hubs are operating, the existing U.N.-led system will continue providing food in parallel to GHF. He also said the U.N.-led system would continue in the future to distribute all non-food humanitarian aid — everything from medical supplies to hygiene items and shelter materials. GHF was not capable of handling those supplies, Wood acknowledged.

In the letter, sent to Israel's military body in charge of aid coordination in Gaza, COGAT, Wood said GHF and Israel had agreed on those terms. There was no confirmation from COGAT, however.

The U.N. and aid groups say that the plan would “weaponize aid” for Israel's military and political purposes.

They say Israel would have power to determine who receives aid and to force the population to move to where it is being distributed, emptying large parts of the territory. That would potentially violate international laws against forced displacement.

“We cannot take part in a system that violates humanitarian principles and risks implicating us in serious breaches of international law,” said Shaina Low, communication adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, a leading aid group operating in Gaza.

Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that under the aid mechanism, Gaza's population would eventually be moved to a “sterile zone” in Gaza's far south. He said it was for their protection while Israeli forces fight Hamas elsewhere. He also said once the Palestinians enter the area, “they don't necessarily go back.”

Israel also says that after Hamas is defeated, it will implement a plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump to relocate the territory's population outside Gaza, though it portrays migration as “voluntary.” The Palestinians, along with nearly all of the international community, have rejected the idea.

GHF said in a statement it is independent and apolitical and will not be part of any mass displacement. It said its system is fully consistent with humanitarian principles including impartiality and independence. 

Israel had previously told aid groups it intends to vet aid recipients and use facial recognition technology. GHF has said food will be given according to need, without eligibility requirements. However, aid groups say recipients will have to pass close to or through Israeli military positions to reach the hubs, exposing them to vetting.

The U.N and aid groups also say the GHF plan cannot possibly meet the needs of Gaza's large and desperate population. 

Plans for distributing non-food aid remain uncertain. Also, GHF has said each meal it distributes would have 1,750 calories. That is below the 2,100-calorie per day standard for meals in emergency situations used by the U.N.'s World Health Organization, UNICEF and World Food Program.

Aid workers say the change is simply not necessary.

The U.N. and other aid groups “have shown absolutely that they can meet the needs of that population, when allowed to,” UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said. “We need to just keep reverting back to what works.”

Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Washington Jeanine Pirro announces charges during a news conference Thursday against a man accused of shooting two Israeli embassy workers in Washington, D.C., Wednesday night.

Jeanine Pirro took the oath of office to serve as the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C. during an event in the Oval Office on Wednesday.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi administered the oath alongside President Donald Trump. Pirro is serving as the interim U.S. attorney following the resignation of Ed Martin, Trump's initial pick to serve in the role.

""We need to send a message that justice will be honored in the District of Columbia,"" Pirro said after taking the oath. ""My voice should be heard loud and clear: No more. No more tolerance of hatred. No more mercy for criminals.""

""Violence will be addressed directly with the appropriate punishment, and this city will again become a shining city on a hill in an America that President Trump has promised to make great again and will make safe again,"" Pirro added.

‘The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, discuss the revelations in Jake Tapper and Alex Thompsons new book ‘Original Sin.'

FIRST ON FOX: A pro-energy group is renewing its call for an investigation into over half a dozen Biden administration executive actions related to climate that it believes should be deemed null and void due to them being signed by an autopen without any public comment from former President Joe Biden confirming his knowledge of them. 

Power the Future, a nonprofit organization that advocates for American energy jobs, reviewed eight Biden executive orders that it says were significant shifts in domestic energy policy and said it found no evidence of the president speaking about any of them publicly, raising concerns that the orders were signed by autopen and that he was not aware of them. 

""These are not obscure bureaucratic memos; these were foundational shifts in American energy policy, yet not once did Joe Biden speak about them publicly,"" Daniel Turner, founder and executive director of Power The Future, told Fox News Digital. 

The executive orders reviewed by Power the Future include an Arctic drilling ban in 2023, a 2021 executive order committing the federal government to net-zero emissions by 2050, an executive order mandating ""clean energy"" AI centers and an offshore drilling ban executive order shortly before leaving office in 2025.

Finding no evidence of Biden publicly speaking about the executive orders on climate, Power the Future sent letters this week to the DOJ, EPA, DOI, DOE, along with the House and Senate Oversight Committees, calling for an investigation to determine who made the decisions, drafted the executive orders and ultimately signed them. 

""In light of the growing evidence that actions purportedly taken by the former president may not have been approved or signed by him, but instead promulgated by a small coterie of advisers in his name without his knowledge or over his signature using an ‘autopen,' the need for congressional access to information has grown in importance with these revelations,"" the letter to GOP House Oversight Chair James Comer states. 

""Congress deserves to know how or whether these executive actions were authorized, and whether the former President was aware of such orders before they were implemented by the federal bureaucracy. Were these actions taken on behalf of the president and purporting to execute his authority undertaken with the president's knowledge and approach? It appears incumbent upon Congress to inquire, about all parties involved in these actions, who instructed them to do what, when.""

WHAT IS AN AUTOPEN? THE SIGNING DEVICE AT THE HEART OF TRUMP'S ATTACKS ON BIDEN PARDONS

Fox News Digital reached out to Biden's office for comment but did not hear back by press time.

The presidential autopen has been a topic of conversation with Republicans in recent weeks and months as questions continue about Biden's mental acuity during his presidency, particularly the last few years, which have faced increased scrutiny after the release of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book ""Original Sin.""

""Power The Future remains concerned that key policies of major economic and national security significance directed by the White House during the Biden administration may have been undertaken without presidential awareness and approval, but perhaps instead by a small coterie of staff,"" the letter states.

""Although this likelihood has become more apparent by claims made in a recent book titled Original Sin, those claims merely support information that had already emerged.""

An autopen is a device that physically holds a pen and is programmed to replicate a person's signature. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel determined in 2005 that the president is permitted to use an autopen to sign bills into law, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued a ruling in February that said the absence of ""a writing does not equate to proof that a commutation did not occur.""

In March, President Donald Trump claimed that Biden's pardons of lawmakers who served on the House Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, and others, are ""VOID,"" alleging that they had been signed via an autopen and that Biden did not even know about them.

DAVID MARCUS: OLD MAN BIDEN'S AUTOPEN PARDONS SHOULD BE NULL AND VOID

Despite Trump's concerns over the validity of Biden's pardons due to the alleged use of an autopen, constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley told Fox News Digital that the odds of successfully legally challenging them in court are ""vanishingly low."" 

""Presidents are allowed to use the autopen, and courts will not presume a dead-hand conspiracy,"" Turley said. 

Power the Future's letter references House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who in January shared that Biden, during a meeting, appeared to forget that he signed an order to pause LNG exports.

A report published by an arm of the Heritage Foundation claimed that the majority of official documents signed by Biden were allegedly an autopen signature.

""During the Biden administration, hundreds of billions of dollars were funneled towards pet green projects, while the American fossil fuels industry was punished, and there is no evidence that Biden ordered it, directed it, or was even aware it was happening in his name,"" Turner told Fox News Digital, adding that the American people ""deserve to know"" who was signing the executive orders ""behind closed doors.""

""This autopen scandal is evidence that these green EOs are invalid, and the instigators should be thoroughly investigated by the DOJ for violating the trust of the American people and perpetuating a great fraud on the nation.""

'Common Sense' Department: Hillary Clinton claims Republican women have become a handmaiden to the patriarchy— pretty ironic since this is the same Clinton that lost, suggesting White women voted against her per their husbands direction.

Why do liberals like Hillary Clinton despise conservative women? Is it because we don't obey the media and academia puppeteers who demand we vote for Democrats? Is it because we do not necessarily think that abortion is the only issue of importance, and that perhaps national security, a sound economy and safe streets are equally critical?

Or are they just jealous of people ready to compete on their own, without the safety net of DEI, even if they have two X chromosomes?   

Whatever the cause, attacks on Republican women, and especially those who voted for Donald Trump, have become especially nasty. Consider, for instance, the New York Times' fashion section. A reader recently wrote to Vanessa Friedman, self-appointed fashion guru and notorious Trump hater, asking, ""Can I Wear a Sheath Dress Without Looking Like a MAGA Woman?"" 

HILLARY CLINTON BASHES REPUBLICAN WOMEN, SAYS GOP FEMALE PRESIDENT WOULD BE 'HANDMAIDEN TO THE PATRIARCHY'

Friedman replied with a catty description of MAGA style as a ""cross between a Fox newscaster and Miss Universe"" that ""underscores an almost cartoonish femininity that speaks to a relatively old-fashioned gender stereotype."" And yes, a sheath dress is part of the ""look."" 

If you insist on wearing a simple, convenient (and attractive) sheath dress, says the fashion critic, you can avoid looking MAGA by keeping ""your hair natural or messy."" She continues, ""Keep your makeup minimal and your heels low. Maybe wear boots or even flats or sneakers instead of pumps…"" In other words, don't go for attractive, or feminine, because you might end up wearing your ""politics on [your] sleeve,"" and looking like an ""A.I.-generated member of a crowd.""

Friedman is no newcomer to Trump Derangement Syndrome or hating on conservative women. In 2016, she wrote a plaintive article bemoaning Hillary Clinton's loss to the newly-elected Donald Trump, saying fashion designers had so been looking forward to dressing the former Secretary of State (and presumably dismayed they were left with gorgeous ex-fashion model Melania.) She gushed over Clinton's ubiquitous shapeless pants suits, while fretting that Melania's clothes appeared ""bought off the rack""; the horror! 

In the Times' theater of the absurd, Friedman plays court jester. Of course, the style critic plays to a crowd that cannot define what a woman is; how in the world would they know how to dress one? 

Friedman is not the only Mean Girl. Not long ago, Hillary Clinton was asked at a ""conversation,"" at New York's 92nd Street Y, what advice she might give to the first woman to become president of the U.S. 

HILLARY CLINTON IS BACK AND DOING WHAT SHE DOES BEST -- TRASHING WOMEN

Clinton paused, and then answered, ""Well, first of all, don't be a handmaiden to the patriarchy, which kind of eliminates every woman on the other side of the aisle, except for very few."" 

Get it? Democrat women are powerful warriors, fending for themselves and not bowing to the ""patriarchy,"" while Republican women are mere handmaidens, meekly bearing children and serving their dictatorial toxically masculine husbands. 

Considering that Hillary Clinton climbed to national prominence on the back of her husband Bill Clinton's political career, cynically stood by him despite numerous affairs and credible accusations of rape, it was a remarkably un-self-aware remark.  

It reminds us of Mark Cuban's equally insulting slap at GOP women, when he told the loony hosts of ""The View"" last year that former President Donald Trump is ""never"" around any ""strong and intelligent women.""

He went on to say, ""They're intimidating to [Trump]. He doesn't like to be challenged by them. Nikki Haley will call him on his nonsense with reproductive rights and how he sees and treats and talks about women. I mean, he just can't have her around.""   

It was an extraordinarily idiotic comment from Cuban. He must have forgotten that Trump picked Haley to be his ambassador to the UN and that he was also the first-ever candidate to have a woman – Kellyanne Conway -- run his campaign. And, one of the first to employ a female press secretary. I'd love to have Cuban sit down with Susie Wiles, Pam Bondi, Kristi Noem and Alina Habba and repeat those remarks; he might want to bring protection.

GOP women shake Democrat rafters in the same way that conservative Blacks or Hispanics do; they are terrified that these groups will begin to question their allegiance to liberal orthodoxy. If they do, the Democratic Party is toast.

In a recent podcast, former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer warned that Democrats' loss of Hispanic voters over recent election cycles could doom the party. In 2016, he noted, Hillary Clinton won over 70% of the Hispanic vote; last year, Kamala Harris bested Trump with a much narrower margin, receiving 56% of that group's vote. Harris eked out the win, but the slide in Latino support is worrisome for a political party dependent on women and minorities. 

In 2024, Democrats' slippage with Black and Hispanic voters was nearly plugged by the so-called gender gap, with roughly 55% of women turning out for Harris and 45% voting for Trump. Men were on the flip side. Since 1996, women have preferred Democrat candidates; the gender gap has ranged from 7 to 12 points; in the last election it ticked down. Interestingly, the gap prevailed long before abortion was on the ballot. 

Imagine the alarm bells that would sound if women began turning away from the increasingly left-wing Democrats. As more women enter the workforce, they may rebel over Democrats' insistence on ever-higher taxes and begin to focus more on economic issues.

Last year, a month before the election, a KFF survey found inflation the most pressing concern for women; abortion tied with immigration as number three.

Another problem for Democrats: young mothers are increasingly paying attention to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s MAHA initiatives. They don't want their babies eating carcinogenic food dyes or filling up with microplastics. Kennedy's assault on Big Food may turn out to be the Trump administration's most successful outreach to women yet.

King Charles delivered a throne speech in Canadian Parliament, marking a historic first since the 1970s, when his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, also delivered an address to the Canadian people.

If diplomacy is theater, Justin Trudeau walked onstage in costume to greet royalty.

The former Canadian prime minister made a head-turning entrance at Tuesday's regal proceedings in Ottawa, attending King Charles III's historic Speech from the Throne, not in the expected leather brogues or polished Oxfords but rather in a pair of turquoise and orange Adidas Gazelles. 

A sartorial choice that might fly in more casual settings, perhaps less so in the Senate chamber, especially when royalty are in the room.KING CHARLES III VISITS CANADA AS SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR COUNTRY COVETED BY TRUMP

While Trudeau made headlines for his choice of footwear, King Charles III and Queen Camilla were in Canada for a significant two-day visit, his first since becoming monarch in 2022. 

The king, 76, is currently undergoing cancer treatment and has kept a limited schedule, but the decision to travel to Ottawa was widely seen as a symbolic gesture of support for Canada during a time of tension.

The visit follows repeated comments by President Donald Trump suggesting that Canada could become the 51st state of the United States, remarks that were publicly rejected by Canadian leaders. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the king to open Canada's 45th session of Parliament, making him the first monarch to do so since Queen Elizabeth II in 1977. Carney has previously stated that Canada ""is not for sale now, not for sale ever,"" a message echoed by Canada's envoy to the U.K., Ralph Goodale, who said the king's visit ""reinforces the power and the strength of that message.""CARNEY SAYS CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE, TRUMP REPLIES, 'NEVER SAY NEVER'

During his address in the Senate chamber, King Charles emphasized Canada's independence and resilience. ""The true north is indeed strong and free,"" he said.

Charles, who also held private meetings with Carney and Governor General Mary Simon, serves as Canada's head of state, as he does for 14 other commonwealth realms. The visit comes at a time when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is pursuing closer ties with the Trump administration on trade and international issues, including Ukraine.

While the ceremonial aspects of the visit drew attention, the event reinforced Canada's current position on the world stage and the role of the monarchy in reinforcing that status.

Fashion-wise, Trudeau's sneakers were at least en vogue, literally. British Vogue recently dubbed the Adidas Gazelle a perennial fashion staple, noting its '70s-inspired silhouette and quiet-cool profile. 

In an April 2024 article titled ""Why Our Obsession With Adidas Gazelles Shows No Sign of Fading,"" Joy Montgomery called the shoe a ""fashion trainer"" with timeless appeal, but that doesn't necessarily translate to royal protocol.

One onlooker quipped, ""Justin Trudeau's shoes, today, at Parliament! Also in Parliament today – King Charles,"" tweeted @margareta_matis. 

Emily Ferguson chimed in with a glancing blow: ""Retirement runners perhaps..?"" 

As if the message was unclear, Dimitris Soudas, former communications chief to Stephen Harper, delivered his verdict with silence: ""I don't know what to say."" 

In a room filled with governors general, premiers, Indigenous leaders, and military honors, Trudeau's Adidas suede also made its presence known.

King Charles opened the speech with a land acknowledgment and moved swiftly to emphasize Canada's ""unique identity"" and ""enduring sovereignty,"" subtle echoes of Prime Minister Carney's recent message to Trump. 

Charles's address, written mostly by the Canadian government but peppered with his own flourishes, pointed to ambitious economic goals.

""Every time I come to Canada … a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream, and from there straight to my heart,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Trudeau found himself seated next to Harper, his old political rival, and the two were seen in animated conversation, hands flying. It is unknown what they were discussing.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on how the United States and Iran remain at odds over uranium enrichment and Israel's possible strike on Tehran on ‘Special Report.'

Iran has hanged a man convicted of spying for Israel, Iranian state media reported on Wednesday.

According to the reports, Pedram Madani was hanged after Iran's supreme court upheld a death sentence issued by a lower court.

President Donald Trump is holding the swearing-in ceremony for Jeanine Pirro, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

The ceremony is set to begin at noon. 

Pirro is replacing Ed Martin, whose term expired because he couldn't secure enough votes in the Senate for the permanent position.

“I am pleased to announce that Judge Jeanine Pirro will be appointed interim United States Attorney for the District of Columbia,” Trump announced in a Truth Social post. “Jeanine was Assistant District Attorney for Westchester County, New York, and then went on to serve as County Judge, and District Attorney, where she was the first woman ever to be elected to those positions.”

Trump described Pirro as a “powerful crusader for victims of crime” while in office and someone who “excelled in all ways.”

TRUMP MAKES FOX NEWS'S JEANINE PIRRO DC'S TOP PROSECUTOR

“In addition to her Legal career, Jeanine previously hosted her own Fox News Show, Justice with Judge Jeanine, for ten years, and is currently Co-Host of The Five, one of the Highest Rated Shows on Television. Jeanine is incredibly well qualified for this position, and is considered one of the Top District Attorneys in the History of the State of New York. She is in a class by herself. Congratulations Jeanine!” he concluded.

Pirro, a longtime and vocal Trump ally with a penchant for controversy, will likely meet nearly as much opposition as Martin.

President Donald Trump's “one big, beautiful bill” includes a novel federal tax provision that would help nationalize school vouchers for private education tuition and home schooling programs.

The legislation that already cleared the House includes a proposal that resembles the Educational Choice for Children Act, a wide-ranging bill introduced this year by Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE), Rep. Burgess Owens (R-UT), and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) in both chambers.

It would leverage the federal tax code to provide vouchers for students to attend private secular or religious schools, including in Democratic-led states where voters have rejected similar initiatives.  

The vouchers would be financed through charitable contributions from individuals to entities known as Scholarship Granting Organizations. In return, donors would receive a full federal tax credit equal to the amount of their contribution, creating a strong financial incentive to give. 

The SGO would allocate the donated funds as scholarships, which students could apply toward various educational expenses such as private school tuition, textbooks, and homeschooling materials. 

The program would cap total tax credits at $5 billion annually from 2026 through 2029 and would mark the first nationwide, federally funded tax credit initiative for private school education. It would also allow those who donate corporate stocks to avoid capital gains tax on those donations. 

“For years, I've advocated for school choice with my Educational Choice for Children Act. I am pleased to see it included in the big, beautiful bill,” Cassidy said in a statement. “Expanding President Trump's tax cuts is about preserving the American Dream. Giving parents the ability to choose the best education for their child makes the dream possible.”

Supporters of private and charter schools praise the move but urge Congress to go further by pairing it with a charter school expansion tax credit as part of the broader package.

“It was a tremendous victory to see the tax credit envisioned by the ECCA included, but it was incomprehensible to me that the bill would not seek to use this perhaps once-in-a-generation opportunity to expand the charter school movement across the country,” said Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) in a statement sent to the Washington Examiner. 

Kiley introduced the High-Quality Charter Schools Act in April. This act would provide a tax credit for charitable donations that would develop and expand the number of charter schools, giving even more students access to school choice options. 

Last week, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced the Senate version of legislation to address the high demand for charter schools.

“President Trump is delivering on his commitment to putting families first—this is promises made, promises kept. Together with the Educational Choice for Children Act, this legislation brings parents, educators, and communities together in the fight to ensure every child has a fair shot at success,” Scott said in a statement. 

Opponents of a federal tax break for private school choice warned during a Thursday webinar hosted by AASA, the School Superintendents Association, that the plan could widen gaps in access to quality education and drain resources from already struggling public schools. 

Denise Forte, president and CEO of EdTrust, a nonprofit organization, called the proposal “nothing short of theft.”

“It's taking dollars away from programs that would strengthen all schools, expand access to early childhood, make sure that our kids have access to mental health counselors, to other mental health supports — resources our students need that you are not going to get from the private marketplace,” Forte said during the webinar. 

Amy Hanauer, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, noted that no other federal charitable program offers a tax incentive as generous as the one proposed in this plan. The institute estimates that the bill could reduce federal tax revenue by $23.2 billion over the next decade.

Hanauer explained the bill sets up a special tax loophole for the wealthy, letting them dodge capital gains taxes when they donate stocks to private schools. 

“The result would be a profitable tax shelter for wealthy people who agree to help funnel public funds into private schools, that is to say, they would get more money by donating their stock than by selling it,” Hanauer said.

Data from the 2022 Census show that about 12% of K-12 students in the United States go to private schools, while the vast majority, 84%, are enrolled in public or charter schools.

The legislation now moves to the Senate, where the school choice measures could pass through the budget reconciliation process. Only 51 votes are needed in the chamber because Republicans hold 53 seats.

CHARTER SCHOOL LEADER PUSHES FOR $5 BILLION TAX BREAK IN TRUMP MEGABILL: ‘FIX THIS OVERSIGHT'

Eva Moskowitz, CEO of New York City's largest charter network, has urged Congress to seize this “once-in-a-generation” chance to pass sweeping school choice reform.

“Congress has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put families first and deliver on the President's promise of universal school choice,” she said in a statement. “It's hard to imagine a more meaningful policy than one that places parents, not bureaucrats, in charge; empowers American taxpayers, and unlocks private philanthropy to provide high-quality schools for every kid that needs it.”

The Justice Department sued North Carolina and its elections board on Tuesday, accusing officials of failing to maintain accurate voter rolls in violation of federal law.

Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, appointed by President Donald Trump to head up the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement Tuesday evening that the agency “will not hesitate to file suit against jurisdictions that maintain inaccurate voter registration rolls.” The move marks the latest legal salvo aimed at bolstering election integrity ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 

Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, the 19-page suit echoes concerns raised last year by state and national Republican groups that challenged 225,000 registrations tied to the flawed form ahead of the November 2024 election. The DOJ says those voters were improperly added in violation of the Help America Vote Act.

“Clean voter rolls are the foundation of secure elections and a prerequisite for any subsequent election integrity policy debate,” a DOJ official told the Washington Examiner. “It's not acceptable for states to phone it in when it comes to obeying basic regulations.”

At the heart of the case is a state voter registration form that the DOJ says sidesteps federal safeguards by not requiring new voters to provide either a driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. In its complaint about the North Carolina State Board of Elections protocol, the DOJ points out that the fields required under HAVA “are not identified in the video as required fields that must be completed.”

The complaint also cites Trump's March 25 executive order on safeguarding elections, noting that “only eligible citizens can vote in elections.” The lawsuit names the State Board of Elections, its five individual members, and new director Sam Hayes, who took over after the Republican-controlled board ousted former director Karen Brinson Bell.

That leadership change followed GOP gains through 2024's Senate Bill 382, which shifted appointment powers from Gov. Josh Stein (D-NC) to Republican State Auditor Dave Boliek. Stein is challenging SB 382 in court, though the state Supreme Court ruled Friday for it to remain in effect during the appeal.

The state elections board Executive Director Sam Hayes told the Washington Examiner late Tuesday the lawsuit was under review, adding that “the failure to collect the information required by HAVA has been well documented. Rest assured that I am committed to bringing North Carolina into compliance with federal law.”

The new federal case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Louise Wood Flanagan, a former President George W. Bush appointee.

NORTH CAROLINA PULLS 747,000 PEOPLE OFF OF VOTER REGISTRATION ROLLS

The voter form issue also played a key role in a six-month legal fight over a state Supreme Court seat. Republican candidate Jefferson Griffin challenged over 65,000 ballots after narrowly losing to Democrat Allison Riggs.

 A federal judge declined to intervene, and Griffin ultimately conceded.

A federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump's attempt to punish law firm WilmerHale for its association with the Mueller investigation was unconstitutional and ordered the government not to enforce his March executive order against it.

Trump had issued several executive orders targeting law firms that participated in political activities against him or associated with those that did.

Judge Richard J. Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said Trump had imposed “a kitchen sink of severe sanctions” on WilmerHale, which sued the administration over the order.

“The cornerstone of the American system of justice is an independent judiciary and an independent bar willing to tackle unpopular cases, however daunting. The founding fathers knew this!” he wrote.

“Accordingly, they took pains to enshrine in the Constitution certain rights that would serve as the foundation for that independence,” he added. “Little wonder that in the nearly 250 years since the Constitution was adopted no executive order has been issued challenging these fundamental rights.”

Several law firms have made deals with the Trump administration to avoid its punishing eye, many offering legal services. WilmerHale was not one of them, though it participated in the Mueller investigation.

“The Court's decision to permanently block the unlawful executive order in its entirety strongly affirms our foundational constitutional rights and those of our clients. We remain proud to defend our firm, our people, and our clients,” WilmerHale said in a statement shared with the Washington Examiner.

Leon denied the government's allegations that the targeting of WilmerHale was routine and apolitical, saying, “Please — that dog won't hunt!”

“Taken together, the provisions constitute a staggering punishment for the firm's protected speech,” he wrote. “The order is intended to, and does in fact, impede the firm's ability to effectively represent its clients!”

Judges have already rejected executive orders aimed at Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block. One prominent law firm, Paul, Weiss, had its executive order rescinded after pledging to dedicate the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services to support administration initiatives such as eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and not denying representation to clients based on their political views.

JUDGES PAUSE TRUMP ORDER PUNISHING LAW FIRMS LINKED TO MUELLER INVESTIGATION

Leon believes Trump's actions are an attempt to intimidate the law firms.

“The Order shouts through a bullhorn: If you take on causes disfavored by President Trump,you will be punished!” Leon wrote.

He is taking self-enrichment to a scale never seen before in America.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

During his first presidency, Donald Trump collected millions of dollars of other people's money. He charged the taxpayer nearly $2 million to protect him during the hundreds of times he visited his own properties. He accepted millions of dollars of campaign-related funds from Republican candidates who sought his favor. His businesses collected at least $13 million from foreign governments over his first term in office.

When it was all over, Trump apparently decided he had been thinking too small. In his first term, he made improper millions. In his second term, he is reaching for billions: a $2 billion investment by a United Arab Emirates state-owned enterprise in the Binance crypto exchange using the Trump family's stablecoin asset. An unknown number of billions placed by Qatar in a Trump-family real-estate development in that emirate, topped by the gift of a 747 luxury jet for the president's personal use in office and afterward. Government-approved support for a Trump golf course in Vietnam while its leaders were negotiating with the United States for relief from Trump tariffs. Last week, Trump hosted more than 200 purchasers of his meme coin, many of them apparently foreign nationals, for a private dinner, with no disclosure of the names of those who had paid into his pocket for access to the president's time and favor.

The record of Trump real-estate and business projects is one of almost unbroken failure; from 1991 to 2009, his companies filed for bankruptcy six times. Few if any legitimate investors entrusted their money to Trump's businesses when he was out of office. But since his return to the White House, Trump has been inundated with cash from Middle Eastern governments. Obscure Chinese firms are suddenly buying millions of dollars' worth of Trump meme coins. So are American companies hard-hit by the Trump tariffs and desperately seeking access and influence. After Trump invited major holders of his crypto funds to dinner, Wired quoted a crypto analyst about the coin's value proposition: “Before, you were speculating on a TRUMP coin with no utility. Now you're speculating on future access to Trump. That has to be worth a bit more money.”

Nothing like this has been attempted or even imagined in the history of the American presidency. Throw away the history books; discard feeble comparisons to scandals of the past. There is no analogy with any previous action by any past president. The brazenness of the self-enrichment resembles nothing seen in any earlier White House. This is American corruption on the scale of a post-Soviet republic or a postcolonial African dictatorship.

Paul Rosenzweig: American corruption

One of Trump's tricks, throughout his career in office or competing for it, has been to depict the U.S. political system as corrupt from top to bottom. Here's how the method works.

In August 2015, Fox News hosted the first of the 2016 Republican-primary debates. Trump then led the polls, but he was still generally dismissed as a novelty candidate, certain to fade as summer turned to autumn and the contest became more serious. After all, Trump had briefly led the polls of prospective candidates in 2011 too, but never entered the race. Trump was asked a question that must have looked deadly when it was drafted by the Fox hosts:

Mr. Trump, it's not just your past support for single-payer health care. You've also supported a host of other liberal policies; you've also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi. You explained away those donations, saying you did that to get business-related favors. And you said recently, quote, “When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.”

The trap set for Trump in this seemingly damning choice is either to justify his support for liberal causes or to condemn himself as a crook who paid bribes for corrupt favors. Trump answered:

I will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people. Before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. And that's a broken system.

The moderator tried to close the trap: “So what did you get from Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi?”

Trump nimbly pivoted and thrust the likely Democratic Party nominee into the trap instead: “I'll tell you what. With Hillary Clinton, I said, ‘Be at my wedding,' and she came to my wedding. You know why? She had no choice! Because I gave.”

Suddenly, a potentially damning image—of Trump grinning for the cameras alongside Bill and Hillary Clinton—was converted from a vulnerability into a weapon. Trump did not care if listeners thought ill of him, so long as they thought equally badly of everyone else. If all were crooked, then the most shameless crook might present himself instead as a brave truth-teller.

“Everybody does it” became Trump's all-purpose excuse. The excuse worked, to the extent it did, because of widespread disinformation about the “everybody,” the “does,” and the “it.” If Trump and his supporters can defame others, they can dull voters' awareness of the astounding and horrible uniqueness of Trump's corruption.

Listen: The most corrupt presidency in American history

Not all past presidents were great men. Many were highly flawed.

But one flaw is strikingly rare in the men who reached the presidency, even the worst of them. Very few, if any, of our past presidents used the office to gain improper wealth. Their conduct has given rise to plenty of scandals, but almost none of those scandals originated in self-enrichment of the kind that Trump has practiced since 2016.

Ask any American about the worst case of corruption in the nation's history pre-Trump, and they will likely recall the Watergate scandal that toppled President Richard Nixon in 1974. Two years earlier, burglars hired by Nixon's reelection committee had broken into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. They were caught. To prevent them from admitting their connection to Nixon, the president tried to mobilize government agencies to suppress the investigation and abused campaign funds to buy the burglars' silence. Officials obstructed justice and committed perjury to protect the president. In the end, some 48 people were convicted of Watergate-related crimes.

But Watergate was a scandal produced by the struggle for political power. Nixon hoped that the Democratic headquarters might yield material that would help his reelection, and his associates organized the funds to pay the operatives who got caught. Power was the prize; money was only a means.

Watergate was about “corruption” in the sense of abuse of power, not in the sense of peculation and self-dealing. Nixon certainly cared about money, and he was willing to cut corners to keep it. The investigation into Watergate found that he had underpaid his income tax by $432,000 during his presidency. But the money was not gained by bribery or extortion, and the sums were relatively trivial. When Nixon left office, he was in desperate financial straits. He sold his vacation property in Florida and submitted to more than 28 hours of television interviews with the British journalist David Frost to earn a $600,000 fee and a percentage of any profits. He recouped his fortune largely from the nine books he wrote after leaving the presidency, not from ill-gotten gains stashed away during his time in office.

Money scandals, there have been. But the presidents at the center of them have almost always been motivated by misplaced loyalty to others, rather than their personal greed. Warren Harding was no moral exemplar: Sworn to enforce the nation's laws on alcohol prohibition, he served liquor in the White House at the regular poker games he hosted. He was also a serial adulterer; one of his lovers claimed that he'd fathered a daughter with her. But even Harding's harshest critics—such as Theodore Roosevelt's daughter Alice, who despised him—regarded him as lax and stupid, rather than corrupt. “Harding,” she wrote, “was not a bad man. He was just a slob.” Though not a crook himself, he was surrounded by crooks. His secretary of the interior was convicted of accepting bribes to lease government oil reserves to private interests, the scandal that became known as “Teapot Dome” after a landmark feature of the main oil field in question. Harding's attorney general would later be twice indicted in another scandal, though the jury could not agree on a verdict at either trial, and was suspected of other wrongdoing too, including selling pardons to wealthy men.

Herbert Hoover, who served in Harding's Cabinet, delivered the final verdict:

Harding had a dim realization that he had been betrayed by a few of the men whom he had trusted, by men whom he believed were his devoted friends. It was later proved in the courts of the land that these men had betrayed not alone the friendship and trust of their staunch and loyal friend but they had betrayed their country. That was the tragedy of the life of Warren Harding.

Ulysses S. Grant likewise indulged and protected crooks, including a close aide and friend, Orville Babcock. Babcock served as the equivalent of a chief of staff in the White House, and was accused of participating in the “Whiskey Ring,” as a criminal conspiracy to underreport liquor sales became known. Grant attested to Babcock's innocence and helped him escape punishment. Yet Grant did not profit from the whiskey scheme, or from any of the other “rings” that tainted his presidency.

Not unlike Harding, Grant could be naively trusting of former comrades in arms. He believed that men who had been brave in war must also be honest in peace—and that anyone who claimed otherwise was a slanderer.

Again, neither Grant, nor Harding, nor Nixon operated a personal business from the White House. Other presidents and their associates did on occasion accept gifts unwisely. President Dwight Eisenhower lost his chief of staff because the man had accepted an expensive coat and a valuable rug from a favor-seeker. But the gratuities were small and personal, and seldom involved cash. No predecessor of Trump's ever violated the explicit constitutional prohibition on accepting gifts of considerable value from a foreign power.

Many presidents have tolerated or endured profit-seeking by relatives. Plenty of political families have a Hunter Biden. Jimmy Carter ranks among the most financially scrupulous men ever to have held the presidency, yet he had his embarrassing brother, Billy, who was investigated by Congress for influence-peddling on behalf of the terrorist Libyan regime of Muammar Qaddafi (he was a registered lobbyist for Libya).

By one hostile tally, Grant bestowed government perks on 42 of his relatives, a degree of nepotism that helped make corruption an important issue in the election of 1872. The Republican senator and legendary civil-rights champion Charles Sumner was disgusted with Grant's patronage and instead endorsed his opponent, Horace Greeley. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's son James also traded on his father's position. In 1938, The Saturday Evening Post published a detailed exposé of James's insider dealing.

The Trump family's exploitation of the presidency, however, has no precedent in the Grants or the Roosevelts or any of the presidential families that followed.

One difference is scale. James Roosevelt made a lot of money by Depression standards, but he did not score dynastic wealth. The Grant relations got government jobs—very cozy, but again, not dynastic wealth. Billy Carter was paid $220,000, which, even adjusting for half a century of inflation, seems hardly worth the brouhaha. The Trumps, by contrast, are using the second-term presidency to accumulate billions of dollars.

The second difference is the degree of separation from the president himself. Hunter Biden traded on his father's name, but the Republican-chaired committee that went looking into the matter found no link either to President Biden's decisions or to his personal bank account. But President Trump remains the beneficial owner of the Trump enterprises nominally run by his sons. The ill-gotten gains flow directly to him.

The third difference is the utter lack of conscience in this presidential family. When George H. W. Bush ran for president in 1988, he wrote a letter to his sons warning, “You'll find you've got a lot of new friends.” Those friends, the elder Bush predicted, would ask for favors. “My plea is this: please do not contact any federal agency or department on anything.” Franklin D. Roosevelt was not so strict. Yet when James's business affairs blew up into a scandal, James published his income-tax returns, submitted to press interviews, and resigned from his role as a White House adviser. He moved to California, volunteered for active duty in the Marine Corps in 1940, and was decorated with the Navy Cross for valor in battle. As for Harding, he came to feel ashamed of his own presidency. According to Nicholas Murray Butler, the then-president of Columbia University and an important figure in Republican politics in the early 20th century, Harding confessed to him: “I am not fit for this office and should never have been here.” This is even more true of Trump, but Trump would never have the self-knowledge or grace to admit it.

Derek Thompson: The story of the Gilded Age wasn't wealth. It was corruption.

The Framers of the U.S. Constitution were haunted by many fears, but nothing terrified them more than corrupt foreign interference in the affairs of the young republic. They had read in their Thucydides and their Polybius how foreign bribery undermined the Greek city-states. The American Founders were keenly aware of their proximity to the empires of Britain, France, and Spain, each richer and stronger than the nascent United States. The emoluments clause of the Constitution, which forbade officeholders from receiving any kind of foreign gift without permission from Congress, was their safeguard to answer that terror of interference.

Today, the United States is rich and powerful. Rather than wait for a foreign government to offer emoluments, a corrupt U.S. president can extract them. The emoluments clause depends on congressional enforcement, backed by the ultimate sanction of impeachment and removal. And if Congress does not enforce it? Then public opinion remains the only sanction. Cynics deny that public opinion matters, but Trump is not one of them. His belief in how much popular disgust for corruption matters is precisely why he and his supporters worked so hard to promote dark legends about rivals: the Bushes, the Clintons, the Bidens. Those stories were not based on nothing, but the closer anyone looked, the less there was to see.

The Trump story, by contrast, is almost too big to see, too upsetting to confront. If we faced it, we'd have to do something—something proportional to the scandal of the most flagrant self-enrichment by a politician that this country, or any other, has seen in modern times.

Thanks to decades of misguided policy choices, the U.S. has an astonishing lack of maritime capacity.

“He who commands the sea has command of everything,” the ancient Athenian general Themistocles said. By that standard, the United States has command of very little.

America depends on ocean shipping. About 80 percent of its international trade by weight traverses the seas. The U.S. needs ships to deliver nearly 90 percent of its armed forces' supplies and equipment, including fuel, ammunition, and food. Commercial shipyard capacity is essential for surge construction of warships and sealift-support ships that transport equipment and troops in times of national emergency.

Yet the U.S. has an astonishing lack of maritime capacity. Of the tens of thousands of large vessels that dot the oceans, a mere 0.13 percent are built in the United States. China, by contrast, fulfills roughly 60 percent of all new shipbuilding orders and has amassed more than 200 times America's shipbuilding capacity.

Not only do most U.S. imports and exports travel on foreign-built ships, but those ships are owned and crewed almost exclusively by nine giant carriers based in Europe and Asia. By the end of 2024, these carriers had organized into three cartels that controlled about 90 percent of the U.S. containerized-shipping trade.

From the July 1870 issue: The shipping of the United States

After a ship arrives at a U.S. port, the crane that lifts containers from its cargo hold will probably have been made by a single Chinese corporation that produces 80 percent of all ship-to-shore cranes in the United States. China also makes 86 percent of the truck chassis onto which containers are loaded. Some 95 percent of the containers themselves are built in China.

In the early days of the pandemic, some consequences of America's loss of control over ocean shipping were suddenly thrown into relief. Foreign cartels raised the cost of spot contracts on certain shipping lanes by up to 1,000 percent while making a record $190 billion in windfall profits. They also rejected hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of U.S. agricultural exports, preferring to race back to China with empty containers to fill with more profitable Chinese imports while American-grown food rotted on the docks.

The national-security implications of America's lack of shipbuilding and shipping capacity are also becoming dire. Because so few commercial ships fly the American flag and employ American mariners, the U.S. faces a critical shortage of civilian sailors needed to crew Navy support vessels. In November 2024, the Navy confirmed that it would lay up 17 support vessels, some delivered as recently as January 2024, because of crew shortages. More alarming are shortages of support ships themselves. The U.S. would need more than 100 fuel tankers in the event of a conflict in the Pacific. It has access to about 15.

This should never have happened. In the middle of the 20th century, the U.S. had a thriving, well-regulated ocean-shipping industry. Then the country turned its back on the system that made it all possible.

At the turn of the 20th century, the ocean-shipping industry was plagued by a phenomenon known as “ruinous competition.” Carriers engaged in ruthless rate wars, reasoning that even if they moved cargo often at below-average cost, this would at least help defray the high fixed cost of operating a freighter. But the strategy was unsustainable. Years of continuous losses pushed many in the industry to the brink of insolvency. To avoid total collapse, the carriers banded together to form unregulated cartels in order to reduce supply and fix prices.

The cartels provided some stability, but at the public's expense. They offered secretive rebates to large operators that agreed to ship exclusively on cartel vessels, and they often refused to deal with shippers that did business with competitors. The cartels also engaged in price discrimination, offering steep discounts and rebates to big shippers—and recouping their losses by charging higher prices to smaller shippers that lacked the power to demand favorable terms. The resulting unequal prices and access to transportation services harmed smaller manufacturers, farmers, and ports.

At the same time that cartels were squeezing U.S. shippers, the U.S. government was neglecting maritime policy. Since the end of the Civil War, the United States had refused to allocate public resources to shipbuilding, while foreign governments, especially the British, subsidized their shipping and shipbuilding steeply. By 1901, U.S.-built vessels carried a mere 8 percent of national trade, and U.S. shipyards were left with little business aside from naval contracts.

The combined results of cartelization and government inaction were perilous. After World War I broke out in Europe in 1914, Great Britain, France, and Italy immediately diverted most of their shipping capacity to support their war efforts. Because the United States was so reliant on European shipping, freight rates soared. Foreign lines increased the rate to charter a vessel or ship key goods by about 20 times.

The United States was effectively cut off from the rest of the world. As the maritime historian Salvatore R. Mercogliano noted in Sea History magazine, “The domestic economy went into a recession as goods piled up on the docks and imports stopped arriving in American ports.”

In response to the emergency, Congress passed a series of bills that poured public funds into bolstering U.S. shipping and shipbuilding capacity. Both the immediate and long-term results were spectacular. Extensive public investment led to the construction of more than 2,300 vessels for World War I and more than 5,500 vessels during World War II. The United States became the world's preeminent shipbuilder, assembling vessels at a scale and speed previously unheard of. The U.S. built the Liberty-class cargo ship SS Robert E. Peary, for example, in a little more than four days during the height of World War II.

But Congress recognized that simply pouring money into maritime capacity was not enough. It needed to set market rules for ocean shipping, both to forestall destructive competition and to ensure that ocean carriers operated in the public interest. To do this, Congress created a new agency, the United States Shipping Board (later replaced by the Federal Maritime Commission), which was charged with regulating the industry like a public utility. Cartels were required to submit their operating agreements to the government, which in turn disapproved or altered agreements it found to be discriminatory or unfair. Carriers were not allowed to engage in price discrimination, offer deferred rebates, or employ other underhanded tactics that excluded competition. These laws were not always effectively enforced, but they were a significant improvement over the status quo.

During the 1980s, however, Congress and Ronald Reagan abandoned the regulated-competition approach. Reaganites argued that the FMC, which at the time had a budget of just $11.8 million, had become a bloated bureaucracy, and reasoned that the U.S. could achieve economic efficiency and lower shipping prices if ocean carriers were not required to treat all shippers equally. To that end, Congress passed a series of bills during the Reagan and Clinton administrations that stripped the FMC's ability to regulate ocean-carrier cartels.

The first-order effect was a return to the destructive competition and underhanded exploitation that had characterized the early-20th-century market. As the rise of containerization led to ever larger ships, fixed costs grew. This increased carriers' incentives to fill empty space on ships, even at steep discounts, because at least they would lose less money than if the space were unsold. Still, profits fell, and carriers turned to waves of mergers made possible by the federal government's simultaneous retreat from antitrust enforcement. In the seven years after President Ronald Reagan signed the Shipping Act of 1984, seven major carriers were snapped up by the competition, compared with just one during the entire period from 1966 to 1983.

American-flag carriers, which had higher costs than foreign counterparts, were particularly hurt by the rate wars, especially after the Reagan administration withdrew subsidies that had helped U.S. carriers defray the costs of paying crews livable wages. Foreign corporations acquired American President Lines and SeaLand, the two largest U.S. carriers at the time, in 1997 and 1999 respectively, leaving the United States with no globally competitive ocean carriers. Meanwhile, shipyards in Asia began to enjoy massive government subsidies.

From the April 1943 issue: We build ships

The consequences were nearly identical to the pattern in the early 1900s. Shipbuilding all but disappeared in the United States. Today, the U.S. produces five or fewer large commercial vessels a year, and shipyards almost exclusively rely on naval contracts. Worse, at a time of escalating tensions with China, the United States has virtually no surge capacity to build naval or sealift ships. In fact, China builds all the commercial ships that the U.S. government contracts to provide military support.

A bipartisan bill in Congress and a recent executive order seek to address the problem. The plans aim to levy tariffs on Chinese-owned ships and create new tax incentives to spur investment in shipyards, among other provisions. These ideas, though helpful, are too simplistic and small-bore. The central problem is not just inadequate investment or insufficient tariffs. It is the abandonment of a system of regulated competition that structures the industry to meet public purposes.

Restoring a robust version of that system would revive the government's ability to direct cartels to operate in the public interest. Carriers would be required to offer all shippers, big and small, similar prices and terms of service. This would ensure that market competition focuses on who provides the best products at the best prices instead of who enjoys the favor of a handful of foreign cartels. Government regulation of carriers would prevent them from excessively raising prices in times of tight capacity and engaging in ruinous price wars during times of slackening demand. Combined with robust public investment in shipping, shipbuilding, port services, and mariner training, this system would re-create the market rules we once used to address the challenge of unregulated monopolies in ocean shipping. A new era of American maritime greatness is possible.

In the movie Friendship, one man will stop at nothing to get his bro back.

Men will literally, as the meme goes, do anything to avoid therapy. They'll start wars. They'll become obsessed with the Roman empire. They'll join more improv teams than they could possibly need. The meme captures the exaggerated nature of the “male-loneliness epidemic” narrative: Despite a recent study finding that American men and women are roughly equally lonely, the idea that men are especially unable to cope with social isolation persists.

But for Craig Waterman, the protagonist of the new film Friendship, male loneliness is no myth. Played by the comedian Tim Robinson—best known as the mastermind behind the sketch-comedy series I Think You Should Leave—Craig is, to put it mildly, dreadful at making friends. He's an intrusive thought in human form, the embodiment of the speed bump he had the city install on his street. He's a tightly wound collection of eccentricities attempting to come off as an everyman, and as such, his co-workers can't stand him. His teenage son won't go see the “new Marvel” with him. Even his wife, Tami (played by Kate Mara), would rather hang out with her ex-boyfriend. In other words, Craig is a weirdo who's perfectly in keeping with Robinson's oeuvre of over-the-top characters: He knows he's not fitting in, but he desperately wants to anyway. That he fails again and again to perform a more socially acceptable version of himself leaves him anxious, frustrated, and at times enraged.

It's no wonder, then, that Craig can't seem to accept when a relationship is over. Friendship traces how Craig and his neighbor Austin (Paul Rudd), a jovial weatherman, quickly bond and then break apart. At first, the pair get along beautifully: Craig goes to see Austin perform with his band, and Austin takes Craig mushroom foraging. But when Craig ruins an evening with Austin's buddies, Austin cuts him off. Craig's attempts to repair their closeness only make the situation worse before veering into the bizarre. The result is a film that's both funny and unnerving; it examines the absurdity of modern male-bonding rituals and the lengths a person will go to in order to get someone else, especially a new friend, to like them.

Read: An unlikely model for male friendship

Friendship often plays like a horror movie, with the director, Andrew DeYoung, deploying techniques that shroud the story in suspense: dramatic cinematography, slow zooms, an off-putting lo-fi score. Robinson, meanwhile, has a knack for pulling faces that make him seem harmless yet somehow creepy. In an early scene, when Craig watches Austin perform, he imagines himself as the band's drummer. Craig's open-mouthed, wide-eyed expression can be interpreted as admiration, but it can also scan as obsession. He looks like he is about to start drooling.

The film is full of visual gags like that, many of which do little to move the plot forward. A guy named Jimp has to repeat his name multiple times before Craig understands him. When Craig tries a recreational drug, he hallucinates about wandering into a Subway sandwich shop; what follows made me laugh so much that I teared up. At work, Craig fills his coffee mug to the brim, shuffles through the office hallways trying not to spill a drop, and then stiffly sips from the rim during a meeting. These scenes come off as irrelevant sketches shoehorned into the story, but they capture how Craig perceives the world around him. Even in the most normal of circumstances, his social awkwardness leads to him doing or fixating on something unusual—and then struggling to understand why others don't see his point of view.

Yet Robinson never makes Craig out to be a complete outcast—he's just a guy who's baffled by how people get along. His deceptively nuanced performance makes Friendship somewhat compassionate as a study of how exhausting social mores can be to grasp. On the disastrous night when he meets Austin's friends, for instance, Craig copies everyone around him, grabbing a beer, delivering self-deprecating jokes, and agreeing to some casual sparring. But when he punches his new pal hard enough to make him fall over, the other men's silence befuddles him. Wasn't that what they'd wanted him to do, in cheering him on so enthusiastically? Later in the film, Craig takes Tami out on a date that, unbeknownst to her, involves exploring a hidden network of underground tunnels; he had so much fun trekking through them with Austin. Tami dislikes the experience, however, leaving Craig confused. Why is an adventure okay in one context and not in another? Would she have enjoyed herself if she were with someone who more easily commanded respect, like Austin? Is Craig really the problem—or are the unspoken expectations defining human interaction the actual culprits?

Read: How the passionate male friendship died

Friendship doesn't really pursue any answers to those questions, and the film is too slight and scattershot to be able to offer illuminating insights. Instead, it fearlessly—and wackily—reckons with how confounding people can be in their bid for one another's approval: at work, at home, at their new friend's house while dressed in their finest Ocean View Dining clothing. (It's the only brand that fits Craig just right.) More than anything, Robinson delivers a fantastic showcase for his particular brand of humor. His shtick—characters who seem like average middle-aged men until they open their mouth—has won him a cult following, but it's likely not for everyone. For those who prefer less cringe, well, take it from Craig himself: There's a new Marvel out.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Historically, in dark times people have sought love. But today might be different.

Life was bleak, bleak, bleak: Soup-kitchen lines ran for blocks. Teenagers walked across the nation on foot, looking for work. Parents fashioned cardboard soles for their children's little shoes. This was the Great Depression, and Americans were suffering. But many of them did have one thing to look forward to: dating. Young people still went to movies and dances; they shared ice-cream sundaes or Coca-Colas. (They called the latter a “Coke date.”) Not everyone could manage such luxuries, Beth Bailey, a University of Kansas historian and the author of From Front Porch to Back Seat: Courtship in Twentieth-Century America, told me. But for those who could, she said, the rendezvous were a “respite from all the grimness.”

Even in this country's darkest economic times, romance has offered a little light. In the 1930s, more jobs opened up for single women; with money of their own, more could move away from family, providing newfound freedom to date, Joanna Scutts, a historian and writer, told me. Nearly a century later, a 2009 New York Times article cited online-dating companies, matchmakers, and dating-event organizers reporting a spike in interest after the 2008 financial crash. One dating-site executive claimed a similar surge had happened in 2001, during a previous economic recession. “When you're not sure what's coming at you,” Pepper Schwartz, a University of Washington sociologist then working for PerfectMatch.com, told the Times, “love seems all the more important.”

Now, once again, people aren't sure what's coming at them. Many consumers have been rattled by the Trump administration's erratic trade policies. And although the chances of an actual recession have declined since the president eased off some of his more aggressive tariff positions, J. P. Morgan Research still estimates the possibility at 40 percent. Meanwhile, the United States is facing another kind of recession: a romance recession. Marriage rates are going down; the number of single adults is going up. Based on trends from past eras, one might expect economic unease to give the dating market a jolt. But the way people view romance has shifted dramatically since 2008. Americans today may not be as likely as they once were to seek solace in love. This time, if an economic recession is coming, it might make the romance recession even worse.

Dating has always been expensive. Going out to a restaurant or bar or movie theater costs money; getting there might require a car; taking someone home is trickier if you can't afford to not have roommates (or if your roommates are your parents). Some people still prioritize romance in rocky times—but a lot of Americans these days are letting financial anxiety deter them. In 2022, Dating.com surveyed single people about how inflation and economic uncertainty were influencing their love lives; nearly half of respondents said they'd refrained from scheduling a date in order to save money. In a 2024 poll from LendingTree, an online lending marketplace, 65 percent of participants said inflation had affected their dating life; 81 percent said they believed that dating might be easier if they had more money.

In some sense, sure, dating is easier if you have more money. But wouldn't someone with less money be more intent on finding a partner to struggle alongside?

Read: How to prepare for a recession

Today, maybe not: People might want to weather the storm before searching for love. As the sociologist Andrew Cherlin has argued, marriage was once seen as a step toward adulthood; spouses strived to build a future—and a flush bank account—together. Now, more often, marriage is seen as the culmination of the maturing process: a “trophy” earned once you've figured out everything else—including your finances.

In one recent study, researchers asked participants making different incomes how much they desired a relationship and how ready they felt for one; six months later, they checked in to see whether those subjects had started dating someone. Johanna Peetz, a psychologist at Carleton University in Ottawa who worked on the project, told me that she and her co-author thought a higher income might make single life easier and more fun—and partnership seem less necessary. In reality, the participants making the least were the ones who viewed coupledom as only a distant priority, and who were less likely to enter a relationship. They seemed to “really want a stable base,” Peetz said, “before they start looking for a partner.”

Something else has changed too. More people, stressed about their finances, may now see romance not as a fun distraction or a balm, but as a stressor in itself.

Economic insecurity, researchers have found, tends to make people more risk-averse. That might not affect your dating game if going out with someone doesn't feel so scary, or if you're nervous but expect that the butterflies might lead to something beautiful. Today, though, people may be more wary of letting other people in. In recent years, researchers have clocked a growing discomfort with emotional intimacy and a drop in social trust. In 1972, the first year the General Social Survey was conducted, 46 percent of participants in that poll agreed that “most people can be trusted”; earlier this month, Pew Research Center reported that, in a poll it conducted in 2023–24, only 34 percent of people said the same.

Straight people might be especially hesitant to put themselves out there. Suspicion between men and women seems to be on the rise. The Survey Center on American Life found that from 2017 to 2023, the number of women who said they feared being sexually assaulted had increased steeply. And a lot of women, for various reasons, really are having bad romantic experiences; in a YouGov poll from February, 44 percent of men said they'd been on a “terrible” date—while 57 percent of women said the same. Many of them might want to depend on a partner. They also might doubt that dating will yield one, at least not easily.

For young adults in particular, an economic recession could be a disaster for romance. Gen Z is, overall, a financially anxious cohort. Leading up to the 2024 election, young adults across races and party affiliations rated inflation as their top concern. In the aftermath of that election, I talked with Meghan Grace, a co-author of Generation Z: A Century in the Making, and she summarized what she sees as this group's consistent, underlying concern: “I just want to feel safe.” That attitude applies to finances but also to romantic risk. In a 2023 survey from the dating app Hinge, more than half of Gen Z users said they'd let the fear of rejection hold them back from pursuing someone; 44 percent had “little to no dating experience.”

Read: Teens are forgoing a classic rite of passage

Even if an actual recession doesn't hit, economic angst isn't likely to disappear soon. And the romance recession isn't likely to reverse itself either. The mood may remain, for a while, distinctly unsexy. “Overall, I guess my message really is, Oh, you better buckle up,” Peetz told me. “It's definitely not gonna be a dating boom.”

Being single is expensive. But no one can will a suitable partner into existence—and making romance work really can be harder with less wealth. In studies, people perform worse on cognitive-processing tasks when their funds are low: Some of their headspace seems to be occupied by worrying. “You need cognitive resources to take the perspective of your partner, to communicate with your partner,” Peetz said, “and to do all kinds of things that help relationship quality.”

Holding off on the slog of modern dating could mean conserving emotional and financial reserves. It could mean leaning instead on long-known loved ones and strengthening those bonds. Partnership may once have felt like a relatively safe bet in an otherwise precarious world. Now, for many people, it's just one more thing that they can't depend on.

Friday night's firings will make the next crisis that much more dangerous.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

At 4:20 p.m. on the Friday before Memorial Day, Brian McCormack, the National Security Council chief of staff, sent an email to more than 100 staffers telling them that they had 30 minutes to clear out their desk. Nearly all were people the Trump administration had hired to the NSC.

President Donald Trump has been gunning for the NSC since 2019, during his first term in office, when two staffers filed a whistleblower complaint about his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and got him impeached. On Friday, White House officials told Axios that the NSC is plagued by unnecessary committees and meetings that slow down decision making, and that the council is a needless check on the president's power. One official called the NSC “the ultimate Deep State. It's Marco vs. the Deep State. We're gutting the Deep State.”

That is a very strange way to characterize the arm of the government that exists to make sure the others are carrying out the president's agenda. In dismantling the NSC, Trump is not only removing part of his government's brain but creating real risk should a crisis strike. That's because the council has two core functions based in congressional statute: One is to advise the president on national security and foreign policy, and the other is to coordinate the work of agencies and departments in executing the policies he chooses.

So why do Trump officials think the NSC staff is unnecessary or harmful? The one quoted by Axios went on to say: “If you have officials fighting each other and their agencies always involved in turf wars, you maybe need this process. That's not what you have here. Rubio, Bessent, Hegseth, Bondi—all of them know each other and like each other, and they know they're there to execute the president's will.”

Read: Inside the fiasco at the National Security Council

It is nice to hear that Trump officials all get along, and that the rumors to the contrary are false. But the point of the NSC process is not simply to resolve clashes of personality. I served in the NSC for almost three years under President Joe Biden, as the head of the strategic-planning directorate, and I had a bird's-eye view of the entire bureaucratic process.

No one loves committees, but that doesn't mean they're unnecessary. In a typical week, a committee of deputy Cabinet secretaries meets two or three times in the Situation Room, to discuss issues of the highest priority to the president. No phones or electronic devices are allowed. Lower-level committees meet to prepare groundwork. Occasionally, if significant differences emerge among departments, Cabinet officials will meet—imagine the Houthi-strike Signal group, but in a classified space, with real preparation.

This doesn't involve as many people as you might think. The NSC policy staff stood at 186 at the end of Biden's term, larger than in Trump's first term but smaller than under George W. Bush or Barack Obama. These people are spread across about 20 different directorates, and drawn from across the government. Some directorates are charged with covering different regions or specific issues: technology, energy, intelligence, defense. Most of the people let go on Friday were career civil servants working in these directorates.

The White House briefings implied that these people were the tools of the “deep state,” sent to slow down the decision-making process and work against the president from the inside. But no one is sent to the NSC in that sense. The president and his national security adviser appoint the council's senior directors. These political appointees then pick directors to work on their teams—usually civil servants with the type of expertise and skills they believe the president will need to implement his agenda. The directorates often take the president's overarching ideas and convert them into nuts-and-bolts policy: AUKUS (the pact with Australia and the U.K. on nuclear-powered submarines), key elements of the CHIPS Act (which invested in the domestic manufacturing of semiconductors), the effort to roll back China's overseas bases, and the technology-export controls on China all originated in the NSC.

The NSC is a crucial tool for the president in a moment of crisis. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, for example, called for a policy response spanning much of the U.S. government. The Biden administration's policy mobilized sanctions, weapons, diplomacy, and intelligence cooperation; it required coordination or communication with Europe, China, the Middle East, Congress, and the press. To make all of this  happen, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met daily with senior NSC staffers, not only to solve immediate problems, but also to figure out what more could be done to advance the president's objectives. The NSC was behind the move to get Ukraine sufficient numbers of air-defense missiles; it came up with an inventive scheme to generate funds for Ukraine out of Russian sovereign assets without seizing them outright; and it recommended the strategic declassification of intelligence to pressure Russia.

Trump, of course, could use his NSC to advance very different goals than Biden did. That's as it should be. But he has opted instead to divest himself of this tool. He has a few senior directors left—an unspecified number were fired on Friday, and others have been let go over the past couple of months—and each oversees a massive portfolio. The Europe directorate alone covers about 50 countries, including Russia and Turkey. These senior directors are now largely on their own. They have hardly anyone to draft policy guidance, review speeches, or be the first point of contact for embassies.

Those who oppose Trump may welcome these cuts, precisely because they reduce the ability of this president to destroy and remake U.S. foreign policy. Decimating the NSC removes a layer of White House oversight from the departments engaged in foreign affairs, which could mean strengthening them relative to Trump: If Rubio is truly a temporary national security adviser, there for just six months, the gutting of the NSC will weaken his successor and strengthen his influence as secretary of state. The Pentagon, Treasury Department, Department of Homeland Security, Central Intelligence Agency, and other agencies could likewise set up their own mini–foreign policies, each based on the Cabinet secretary's interpretation of what they heard from the president, whether in a meeting, a side conversation, or a Truth Social post.

Not only would this produce a chaotic and likely ineffective U.S. foreign policy, but the administration could run into some serious trouble with contingency planning. The NSC staff normally flags things that could go wrong and pulls together high-level working groups called “tiger teams” to prepare plans for worst-case scenarios. The Biden administration ran tiger teams for Ukraine, various Taiwan scenarios, and a widening of the war in the Middle East. At least one looming crisis now deserves that type of attention.

Read: Inside the fight over Trump's foreign policy

On April 1 and 2, China carried out a maritime exercise called Strait-Thunder 2025A, for a quarantine of Taiwan and attacks on its military installations. Senior officials in the U.S. and allied nations saw this as a clear warning that China may be preparing a major action short of an invasion against Taiwan. It could, for example, impose a customs zone on Taiwan, whereby Beijing would control everything going in and out of it. The United States depends on Taiwan for semiconductor chips vital to the AI race—something the Trump administration is particularly concerned abou—and a quarantine or customs zone would wreak havoc with that.

In any other administration, the NSC would run a tiger team for such an eventuality. Two senior directors would convene senior officials from all departments and the military, who would then come up with options for deterring China from taking any such action, for making sure the U.S. gets advance notice if China does act, and for responding in a manner that would frustrate China's effort. The team would consider sanctions, diplomacy, and military options. It would scrutinize the plans of the departments. Deputies and principals would then discuss the tiger team's plan and make adjustments. If China struck, America would be as ready as it could be.

The kind of coordination the NSC provides, whether in anticipating crises or responding to them, does not happen automatically, even when Cabinet officials get along with one another. And no single department or agency can replace the NSC's role, because none has a sufficient overview of the whole field, or of all the tools the U.S. government can bring to bear. If one department did take the lead over all the others, it would likely be biased in favor of using the tools it controls and advancing its institutional interests.

Trump seems to think that he doesn't need any of this, that he knows what to do in any circumstance and doesn't need “options” and “recommendations” served up to him. In his mind, he just needs a small team to carry out his orders. But if China makes a move against Taiwan, especially if it is novel and unexpected, Trump may find himself asking what choices he has. If the plans have not been prepared, he will not be able to choose among them. Instead, the country will be dangerously exposed, relying solely on the president's gut instinct on a subject he knows little about.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The real cost of forcing foreign students away from elite universities like Harvard.

by  Bryan Walsh

In 1965, then-French finance minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing came up with the “mot juste” for describing the way that the supremacy of the dollar provided the foundation for the financial supremacy of the US. The fact the dollar was so dominant in international transactions gave the US, d'Estaing said, an “exorbitant privilege.” Because every country needed dollars to settle trade and backstop their own currencies, foreign countries had to buy up US debt, which in turn meant that the US paid less to borrow money and was able to run up trade and budget deficits without suffering the usual pain. The exorbitant privilege of the dollar was that the US would be able to live beyond its means. 

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

It's always been an open question as to how long that privilege would last, but President Donald Trump's harsh tariff policies, paired with a budget bill that right now would add trillions to the budget deficit, might just be enough to finally dislodge the dollar. Annual federal deficits are already running at 6 percent of GDP, while interest rates on 10-year US Treasuries have more than doubled to around 4.5 percent over the past few years, increasing the cost of interest payments on the debt. As of the last quarter of 2024, 58 percent of global reserves were in dollars, down from 71 percent in the first quarter of 1999. The dollar may remain king, if only because there seems to be no real alternative, but thanks to the US' own actions, the exorbitance of its privilege is already eroding — and with it, America's ability to compensate for its fiscal fecklessness.

But the dollar isn't the only privilege the US enjoys. Since the postwar era, America's best universities have led the world. Harvard, Princeton, MIT, CalTech — these elite universities are the foundation of the American scientific supremacy that has in turn fueled decades of economic growth. But also, by virtue of their unparalleled ability to attract the best minds from around the world, these schools have given the US the educational privilege of being the magnet of global academic excellence. In the same way that the dollar's dominance has allowed the US to live beyond its means, the dominance of elite universities has compensated for the fact that the US has, at best, a mediocre K-12 educational system. 

And now that privilege is under attack by the Trump administration. Cutting off federal funding for universities like Columbia and Princeton and eviscerating agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation were bad enough — but the administration's recent move to bar international students from Harvard would be a death blow, especially if it spread to other top schools. 

The ability to attract the best of the best, especially in the sciences, is what makes Harvard Harvard, which in turn has helped make the United States the United States. Just as losing the privilege of the dollar would force the US to finally pay for years of fiscal mismanagement, losing the privilege of these top universities would force the country to pay for decades of educational failure. 

As Vox contributor Kevin Carey wrote this week, foreign students are a major source of financial support for US colleges and universities, many of which would struggle to survive should those students disappear. But the financial picture actually understates just how much US science depends on foreign talent and, in turn, depends on top universities like Harvard to bring in top students and professors.

An astounding 70 percent of grad students in the US in electrical engineering and 63 percent in computer science — probably the two disciplines most important to winning the future — are foreign-born. Nineteen percent of the overall STEM workforce in the US is foreign-born; focus just on the PhD-level workforce, and that number rises to 43 percent. Since 1901, just about half of all physics, chemistry, and medicine Nobel Prizes have gone to Americans, and about a third of those winners were foreign-born, a figure that has risen in recent decades. It's really not too much to suggest that if all foreign scientists and science students were deported tomorrow, US science would grind to a halt.

Could American-born students step into that gap? Absolutely not. That's because as elite as America's top universities are, the country's K-12 education system has been anything but. 

Every three years, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is given to a representative sample of 15-year-old students in over 80 countries. It's the best existing test for determining how a country's students compare in mathematics, reading, and science to their international peers. 

In the most recent PISA tests, taken in 2022, US students scored below the average for OECD or developed countries in math; on reading and science, they were just slightly above average. And while a lot of attention has been rightly paid to learning loss since the pandemic — one report from fall 2024 estimated that the average US student is less than halfway to a full academic recovery — American students have lagged behind their international peers since long before then. Other wealthy nations, from East Asian countries to some small European ones, regularly outpace American peers in math by the equivalent of one full academic year.

To be clear, this picture isn't totally catastrophic. It's fine — American students perform around the middle compared to their international peers. But just fine won't make you the world's undisputed scientific leader. And fine is a long way from what the US once was. 

America was a pioneer in universal education, and it did the same in college education through the postwar GI Bill, which opened up college education to the masses. By 1950, 34 percent of US adults aged 25 or older had completed high school or more, compared to 14 percent in the UK and 11 percent in France. When NASA engineers were putting people on the moon in the 1960s, the US had perhaps the world's most educated workforce to draw from.

Since then, much of the rest of the world has long since caught up with the US on educational attainment, and a number of countries have surpassed it. But thanks in large part to the privilege that is elite universities like Harvard or the University of California, and their ability to recruit the best, no country has caught up to the US in sheer scientific brainpower. Take away our foreign talent, however, and US science would look more like its K-12 performance — merely fine.

It seems increasingly apparent that the Trump administration wants to make an example of Harvard, proving its own dominance by breaking a 388-year-old institution with strong ties to American power and influence. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to cancel all remaining federal contracts with Harvard, while Trump himself mused on redirecting Harvard's $3 billion in grants to trade schools. 

Grants and contracts are vital, but they can be restored, just as faith in the US dollar might be restored by a saner trade policy and a tighter budget. But if the Trump administration chooses to make the US fundamentally hostile to foreign students and scientific talent, there may be no coming back. Politico reported this week that the administration is weighing requiring all foreign students applying to study in the US to undergo social media vetting. With universities around the world now competing to make themselves alternatives to the US, what star student from Japan or South Korea or Finland would choose to put their future in the hands of the Trump administration, when they could go anywhere else they wanted?

The US once achieved scientific leadership because it educated its own citizens better and longer than any other country. Those days are long past, but the US managed to keep its pole position, and all that came with it, because it supported and funded what were far and away the best universities in the world. That was our privilege, as much as the dollar was. And now we seem prepared to destroy both.

Should that come to pass, we'll see just how little is left.

﻿The left's attachment to thinking of politics in “material” terms is causing it to misread the moment.

by  Zack Beauchamp

As right-wing populism has surged globally in the past 10 years, the socialist left has advanced a distinctive explanation for its emergence and how to respond.

Their theory: President Donald Trump and other right-wing leaders' ascendance is a symptom of Democrats and other center-left parties betraying their working-class base. These parties' embrace of free trade and neoliberal cuts to the welfare state cost them core supporters among low-income and non-college voters. When those policies produced painful job losses and stagnating wages, voters grew furious — anger that only mounted after the 2008 financial crisis and the worldwide rise of the billionaire class.

Far-right populists were able to channel that rage into electoral victory by promising to burn the system down. The only way to beat them is to turn sharply to the left — with political parties trying to win back the working class by promising them a bigger and more redistributive state.

Yet this “class-first” theory has repeatedly failed the test of reality. While some research finds economic roots for rising far-right support, studies that compare economic to cultural and ideological factors generally find that the latter two are far more important in both Europe and the United States. Socialist candidates, like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, failed spectacularly to win over either far-right or working-class voters when given a chance in national elections. And attempts by center-left politicians to tack left, like President Joe Biden's “post-neoliberal” agenda on trade and antitrust, have failed to bring disaffected voters back from the right-wing cold.

Some of the left's leading voices have, in short, consistently gotten the right's roots wrong. I think there is a deep reason why: the left's traditional commitment to a doctrine called materialism.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

Materialism is a very old theory of human behavior, most strongly identified with Marx and Engels. In a recent essay defending the idea, NYU sociologist Vivek Chibber locates its core premise as the idea that “agents are acting on their objective interests — more specifically, their material or economic interests.” These “material” concerns are not just one set of interests among many, but the primary ones — the most fundamental and basic forces in shaping human decisions.

“If I wish to be a successful artist, I have to first earn a living; in order to pursue my religious ends, I have to keep my body and soul together,” Chibber explains. “It is not that we don't value anything else. It's that there is no other value that acts as a precondition for satisfying higher-order values.”

Chibber is correct to put materialism in this sense at the center of a distinctively socialist analytic, one that profoundly shapes the modern left's approach to politics. This approach has produced brilliant works of analysis and contributed vitally to left-wing social movements in the past.

However, that does not mean it is (as Chibber claims) a “universal” analytic tool or a “necessary foundation” of left-wing politics. Rather, there are cases where trying to fit a situation into a materialist lens can lead one astray.

The rise of the far right is one such case — and the implications of this particular error are profound.

The typical knock on materialism is that it is “reductionist.” This means, in brief, that materialism reduces humans to simple consumption machines, ignoring all the other things — like love, religion, or ideology — that really matter to people.

This reductionism is, I think, a serious problem for left analysis of the far right.

Because so many on the left are wedded to a materialist account of human behavior, they begin with the assumption that far-right voting has to have some ultimate materialist cause. Voters' right-wing beliefs on race or religion must ultimately trace back to a material factor (like rage at factory closures being displaced onto immigrants).

There is no room, in this theory, for the possibility that people arrive at beliefs for other reasons. The notion that ideas, values, and religions may have independent causal force — motivating people for their own reasons — is dismissed by some leftists on ideological grounds, even though there's ample evidence it's the case today.

Many leftists, Chibber included, protest that this is an unfair critique: an attack on a vulgar strawman rather than a more sophisticated materialist theory. But such sophistication trades greater intellectual coherence for lesser practical utility.

Chibber describes material interests less as necessary ultimate causes than as constraints. He admits there are plenty of cases where people care about non-material interests, but argues that people are only likely to pursue such interests when they experience limited physical constraints.

“As long as agents can satisfy their basic needs, it's perfectly consistent with materialism for them to abjure further economic gain in order to pursue different ends,” Chibber explains. “But there will be limits to how far they are willing to go, and this is not just the limit of physical viability. Long before viability comes into question, simple physical hardship is often enough to incline social actors to return to the mundane reality of their material interests.”

Such a concession fundamentally weakens materialism's ability to serve as a guide to understanding modern politics. It shifts the location of analysis away from “objective” material interests to people's perceptions of those interests — whether they actually believe that their physical security is at stake in any given election, and whether they're right about those perceptions. These beliefs could all be influenced by non-material factors: A partisan Republican, for example, is more likely to have a favorable view of a GOP tax bill than a Democrat in a similar tax bracket.

Any materialist theory of voting is caught in a dilemma. Either it advances a distinctive, yet wrong, reductionism, or else it is a theory broad enough to provide little distinctive insight. The left's errors when it comes to the far right generally stem from choosing the former over the latter.

To understand how the materialist dilemma can hamper understanding of the far right, it's helpful to look at a particular case — Chibber's analysis of the declining relevance of class in democratic politics.

Voting across advanced democracies is increasingly less connected to class. More wealthy citizens are voting to raise their own taxes, while certain segments of the poor and working class vote for right-wing parties willing to cut benefits they depend on. 

Surely this would be an instance of ideological or identity factors trumping material self-interest?

Chibber's broad materialism allows for such a move. He could simply say that the rise of the welfare state has created a floor of material comfort for everyone, meaning that there is not enough “physical hardship” at stake for voters to prioritize economic concerns over ideological ones. 

But to do so would be to betray his own purpose in writing. Chibber's central argument is that materialism remains the best lens to understand modern politics and guide left-wing movements going forward. If he concedes that voting behavior is no longer driven primarily by material concerns, then that claim is fatally undermined.

So he goes a more reductionist route — positing that “rather than an example of workers acting against their interests, [voting for right-wing parties] is an example of workers trying to pursue them.”

Chibber argues, reasonably, that it is very hard for voters to accurately assess the likely consequences of policy actions. They have to rely on trusted sources, most notably the media and political leaders, to make such judgments. And Chibber's view is that these sources have simply misled the working class for their own (nefarious) material reasons:

If it turns out that the experts on whom I rely are media outlets, political leaders, and community leaders that have interests of their own and benefit from misleading me, then it is very likely that, even though I am acting rationally and trying to defend my interests, I might end up giving my vote to somebody who promulgates policies that are suboptimal or even harmful to me. And in the United States, media and political parties are thoroughly captured by economic elites. The information they provide to citizens is overwhelmingly partisan, even though it is presented in a language designed to appear neutral and concerned. It should be no surprise that people end up voting for parties that do not cater to their interests when the information they receive is systematically biased.

This is preposterous.

In the United States, mainstream media and cultural figures were overwhelmingly hostile to Donald Trump all three times that he ran for president. They provided no end of information about how his policy proposals would harm the working class, and how his opponents' ideas would benefit them. He won two out of three times anyway, with an increasing percentage of votes among lower-income and non-college voters.

A more sophisticated version of the argument might blame Fox News and other right-wing outlets specifically for deceiving these voters. But why do people trust Fox more than mainstream outlets with more objective descriptions of policy? To explain that, we need to rely on factors — most notably partisan and cultural identities — so far afield from anything reasonably termed “materialist” that we are no longer operating in Chibber's universe.

And when you look beyond the United States, to other countries experiencing similar rises in support for far-right parties, the story makes even less sense. No one could seriously claim that the media and cultural landscape across the European Union is systematically biased in favor of far-right parties.

In theory, then, Chibber's materialism is broad enough to avoid the charge of reductionism. But in practice, his efforts to apply materialism as a theory of voting behavior falls into a reductionist trap.

This is not to deny that voters care about material concerns. It's obvious that inflation was a central reason for Trump's 2024 victory (inflation that was, in part, caused by Biden's post-neoliberal policies).

But the issue here is not whether material factors are in any way relevant to modern politics. Individual elections can turn on all sorts of specific factors, ranging from scandals to wars to elderly candidates. 

What we're discussing here is more fundamental. It is the question of why the party system in so many countries has changed, with far-right factions consistently commanding enough support that they are now a viable option for swing voters. This was not the case for most of the post-World War II era; it clearly is now. What changed?

The left continues to favor various poorly evidenced explanations for this, like a revolt against neoliberalism, because it still wants to insist on a distinctively materialist theory of politics. If you believe that, at bottom, the roots of political behavior can ultimately trace back to material interests — that ideas and identities are secondary causal factors — you will always end up looking for material explanations.

Doing so causes many on the left to dismiss what is, to my mind, the best explanation of the far right's rise — one that focuses on a change to the ideological structure of global politics.

Across the world, an egalitarian vision of democracy and social order has beaten its competitors — leading to the decline of formal hierarchies along racial, gender, ethnic, religious, and caste lines. This manifested in concrete social changes, like the entry of women into the workforce or the end of racially discriminatory immigration regimes, that profoundly unsettled certain traditionally-minded segments of the global population. Far-right parties became their champions.

This is a fundamentally postmaterial account of far-right politics. It argues that the right wins not by channeling people's displaced economic anger, but by articulating ideas that match their deeply held beliefs, values, and identities.

They did not arrive at said beliefs because of their place in the class structure or assessment of self-interest, but rather because ideas and identity are social facts in their own right. When people go to church or talk to their parents about culture, they listen. And that defines who they are as human beings every bit as much as their role as economic producers, especially in a world where the average voter in a wealthy democracy is orders of magnitude more materially secure than the workers of Marx's day.

Adopting a postmaterial analytic framework does not require abandoning left-wing politics. You can see voters as driven on ideas without abandoning normative commitments to improving the lot of workers, to bolstering the too-weak welfare state, or even to seeing the existence of billionaires as a crime against democracy and human decency.

In fact, I'd argue, doing so is essential for the left to succeed.

As long as the left insists on materialism as its most fundamental theory of politics, not just one possible account of human behavior but always the primary one, it will continue to misunderstand the sources of its far-right enemy's power. It will continue proposing the same old slogans, regardless of their political efficacy, because to do otherwise would be to admit that materialism is in some important political sense no longer true.

Young adults from around the world are struggling.

by  Allie Volpe

The kids, it's been suggested, are not okay. 

For decades, established research showed that happiness and well-being levels tend to peak during youth in your late teens and 20s, drop during midlife, and rise again in old age. But this U-shaped happiness curve is now morphing, according to the results from a recent global study: Many of the world's young people are not flourishing. 

“Young people — and this is a universal finding — in general, are not doing well,” says Byron Johnson, the director of the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University and a co-author of the study. “That U is becoming a J. It's flattening. That's cause for concern, not just here in the United States, but it's cause for concern all over the world.” 

The results come from the Global Flourishing Study, a multiyear project from researchers at Harvard and Baylor that uses survey data from Gallup to measure levels of well-being worldwide. Data was collected between 2022 and 2024 from over 200,000 adults in 23 countries and territories. To measure flourishing, researchers surveyed participants in core areas such as happiness and life satisfaction, mental and physical health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, and close social relationships. Taken together, these dimensions represent the Flourishing Index Score, or how much a person is said to be flourishing. (Financial and material stability also play a role in flourishing, but were excluded when examining the relationship between flourishing and age.)

In the US and many other geographically and culturally diverse countries, young people between the ages of 18 and 29 do not appear to be flourishing. In Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States, flourishing increases with age. The gulf between young and old is most pronounced in the US, researchers found.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

The findings are not universal. Hong Kong and Japan show the traditional U-shaped course of flourishing, while in India, Israel, Kenya, Poland, and Tanzania, flourishing decreases throughout the lifespan. 

In the United States, the results of the study echo other research that shows young people are struggling. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40 percent of high school students reported feeling consistently hopeless or sad in 2023, compared to 30 percent in 2013. Nearly half of Gen Z report often or always feeling anxious, per a 2023 Gallup and Walton Family Foundation survey. The American Psychological Association's 2023 Stress in America survey found young people experience more stress than older cohorts. Today's young people are lonelier than previous generations, another study found.

As additional waves of data are analyzed, researchers can identify what causes young people to struggle, Johnson says. Early observations have shown that religious service attendance contributes to flourishing.

“It could be that regular religious service attendance gives people purpose, maybe it gives them meaning in their life, and these are major factors in flourishing,” Johnson says. “But maybe it also gives them support networks.”

Young people's lack of engagement in group activities more broadly could be impacting their well-being, Johnson says. Despite ranking highly in financial security, countries like the US and Germany fall behind in areas like close relationships, meaning, and purpose. Meanwhile, societal emphasis on individualism may make young people less inclined to engage with and support their neighbors and peers.

“Once you really, seriously think of others,” Johnson says, “instead of just focusing on yourself, it is, in fact, a game changer for so many people.”

Social media is commonly cited as a culprit of young people's suffering, and Johnson believes it plays a role, due to the negative impacts of comparison online and forgoing in-person socializing for digital connection. But isn't the sole contributor, he says.

It could also be that young people's flourishing levels improve with age, time, and change in circumstances. Researchers will continue to survey the same sample of participants over the next few years to find out, Johnson says.

“What about the woman that we interviewed just last year that said she wasn't flourishing?” Johnson says. “Then next year, she actually finds out she's having a child. Her whole world now has changed.”

Pope Leo's unusual crusade should be a model for every religion.

by  Sigal Samuel

Just days after the new pope, Leo XIV, took up his position as head of the Catholic Church, he started talking about artificial intelligence. 

In his first speech to the press, he recognized that AI has “immense potential” but emphasized that we need to “ensure that it can be used for the good of all.”

And in his first address to the cardinals, he explained that he actually chose the name Leo XIV because of AI. The name is a reference to a previous pope, Leo XIII, who held the position during the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century. That former pontiff weighed in on how rising capitalism and the new technology of the day risked turning workers into commodities. The Catholic Church, he argued, should stand up for workers' rights and dignity.

The new pope signaled that he thinks the Church must once again step into that role.

“In our own day, the Church offers everyone the treasury of its social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice, and labor,” Leo XIV said.

On the surface, AI and Catholicism might seem like a strange combination. Since when is Silicon Valley supposed to take marching orders from the Vatican? 

But when you take a look at Catholic history, you realize that AI is exactly the sort of thing the pope should have strong opinions on. The Church's past suggests that technology is something for it to actively engage with — cheering it on where appropriate, criticizing where necessary, but never just disengaging. AI in particular is forcing big questions about the meaning of human life, and it's important to have spiritual thinkers weigh in on those instead of just letting technologists run the show. 

Nowadays, a lot of people think of the Catholic Church as technologically retrograde. It's known for its negative views on abortion and contraception. And well before that, during the Renaissance, it was known for persecuting forward-thinking scientists like Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei because they challenged church doctrines, like the idea that the Earth is at the center of the universe. 

But go back to the medieval period and you'll see that the Catholic Church and technological innovation once went hand in hand. 

That's because Christian thinkers in the Middle Ages developed a radical idea: Technology, they theorized, could help us restore humanity to the perfection of Adam before his fall from grace. If part of what it meant for Adam to be formed in God's image was that he was a creator, a maker, then maybe the key to human redemption was to lean into that aspect of ourselves. 

Even in the midst of the so-called Dark Ages, this idea took off in monasteries, where the motto “ora et labora” — prayer and work — circulated widely. Some of these monasteries became hotbeds of engineering, yielding inventions like the first known tidal-powered water wheel and impact-drilled well. Catholics also gave us everything from metallurgy and mills to the widescale adoption of clocks and the printing press. To this day, engineers have not one but four patron saints in Catholicism.

“Overall the Church has been very positive toward technology in the past,” Brian Green, a Catholic professor who focuses on technology ethics at Santa Clara University, told me in 2018. “But as humans have become more powerful, the Church has felt like it has to say no to more things,” particularly technologies that it perceives as hindering human life, like birth control or nuclear weapons. 

The problem for the Church is that opposing technological innovation risks making it seem more and more at odds with modern life. The late Pope Francis recognized that the Church needs to engage with tech if it wants to stay relevant. 

To discuss how tech can be used for good, in 2016 he met up with Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, and Eric Schmidt, then the executive chair of Alphabet, Google's parent company. He had the Vatican serve as a venue for a hackathon as well as a climate tech competition. And in an encyclical, or papal letter, called Laudato Si, he enthused about tech's potential to reshape humanity's future. 

But he also warned that AI development couldn't be a reckless free-for-all. He called for international regulation. At a Vatican event last year, he emphasized that AI should be used to “satisfy the needs of humanity,” not “enrich and increase the already high power of the few technological giants.”

Francis also insisted that we shouldn't look to AI as if to a perfect, God-like decision-maker — that would be idolatry. Instead of outsourcing our agency to machines, Francis advocated for “a renewed appreciation for all that is human.” 

The Church, which valorizes divine revelation, hasn't always embraced humanism, the view that humans have the agency and abilities to figure out the truth and improve the world through their own reason. But Francis called on his followers to adopt a new Christian humanism — to assert their agency and decision-making abilities while still drawing on religious sources for pointers in the search for meaning. 

“The Sacred Scripture,” Francis said, “offers us the essential coordinates.” 

Pope Francis, and the 19th-century Pope Leo XIII before him, were making a key point: The Catholic Church can and should express opinions on the big technological developments of the day, because they relate to moral and spiritual questions. 

The AI revolution is raising a lot of these pressing questions: How can we stop power from becoming concentrated in the hands of a few? How do we make sure the economic spoils are fairly distributed to everyone? Which kinds of labor and which choices should we outsource to AI, and which should we keep for ourselves because they're ennobling or essential to human agency? Should we allow AI to take over artistic creation? What is a human life for, anyway? 

These kinds of questions are the bread and butter of religion. So it's entirely appropriate for religious leaders to weigh in on them. Failing to do so would mean missing out on perhaps the biggest moral tipping point of the century. 

That's not to say religion has all the right answers. But, as Francis suggested, we can think of it as a compass. Over the millennia, it's had the chance to identify some of humanity's “essential coordinates” — our fundamental psychological needs. And it's developed mechanisms to meet them.

In 1891, Pope Leo XIII offered an example of this in Rerum Novarum, an encyclical laying out his views on the Industrial Revolution. He observed that people will sometimes consent to things that are actually terrible for them — for example, working seven days a week. So their interests need to be protected. That's why there's a religious obligation to observe a day of rest, the pope explained: We need to keep people from allowing themselves to become commodities. 

The new Pope Leo has a powerful opportunity to bring that argument into the 21st century.

Elon Musk's most ambitious project spun out of control before his eyes once again.

SpaceX's Starship mega-rocket launched from its Texas facility on Tuesday evening to make an ill-fated third attempt at a huge milestone: releasing its first payload into orbit.

That's the key to Starship bringing in the big bucks to fund Musk's visions of building a city on Mars. To garner paying customers, Starship has to show it can deliver.

The first step is releasing a batch of eight mock Starlink satellites into orbit. SpaceX tried to do this twice already — in January and March — only to see Starship explode before it could even try opening its payload doors.

Tuesday's flight didn't fare much better.

The rocket thundered through the skies to reach space in one piece, but when it came time to release its practice satellites, the payload door wouldn't open. It's not yet clear what caused that first mishap.

The hosts on the SpaceX livestream emphasized that the more important test was the vehicle's reentry into Earth's atmosphere, because SpaceX had removed 100 of the spaceship's protective heat-shield tiles to test its limits.

""These launches are all about data. The most important thing is data on how to improve the tile design,"" Musk had told the space reporter Eric Berger before settling in to watch the flight from SpaceX's control room in Starbase, Texas.

A few minutes later, though, that test went out the window too when Starship started spinning as it cruised above Earth.

""We did spring a leak in some of the fuel tank systems inside Starship,"" Dan Huot, a SpaceX communications manager, said on the SpaceX livestream.

He added that, with no control over the spaceship's orientation, it was unlikely SpaceX would be able to test the heat shield. Rather, it would fall uncontrolled into the Indian Ocean, probably breaking apart on the way down.

Indeed, SpaceX later confirmed the ship had experienced a ""rapid unscheduled disassembly,"" which is the company's way of saying ""exploded.""

This is Starship's third consecutive problem flight. After being on a promising upward trajectory for nearly two years, SpaceX's vanguard rocket program has backslid.

As a super-heavy-lift vehicle, Starship's appeal to the space industry is its massive power. It can haul giant payloads into space, but that's not worth much if it can't release them into orbit.

The Starship-Super Heavy launch system — consisting of the lower-stage Super Heavy booster and upper-stage Starship rocket — promises to be the largest, most powerful, and first-ever fully reusable orbital rocket on Earth.

Some space experts and Musk have said that if it succeeds, it could help cut the cost of spaceflight by an order of magnitude.

Musk's interplanetary visions and SpaceX's long-term business plan aren't the only futures on the line. The heft and savings that Starship promises could revolutionize spaceflight and accelerate the space industry at large.

Want to build giant hotels in Earth's orbit? Want to mine the moon or asteroids for rare minerals? Want to set up a radio telescope on the far side of the moon? You'll need to haul a lot of stuff into space. The up-front costs will be high, so you'll need to do it for cheap. Enter Starship.

""In order to have a sustained economy around the moon, I think we need a heavy lift launch vehicle,"" Steve Altemus, the CEO of Intuitive Machines, which has landed two robotic missions on the moon, previously told Business Insider.

Musk said in an interview with Ars Technica on Tuesday that he initially expected Starship and SpaceX's satellite internet service, Starlink, to fail.

""Well, by far the biggest thing is Starship. If the Starship program is successful—and we see a path to success, it's just a question of when we will have created the first fully reusable orbital launch vehicle, which is the holy grail of rocketry, as you know,"" Musk said.

Starship is still in its testing and development stage, but it has made major strides toward commercial flight.

The rocket has flown to space multiple times. Starship has returned in one piece and landed in the ocean with its engines firing — a crucial demonstration before it can try landing on the ground. Its Super Heavy booster even landed smoothly on its launch tower three times.

Starship's luck changed in January, though, when the rocket was first set to attempt a mock satellite deployment.

As it soared toward space, the upper-stage Starship exploded and rained down huge chunks of debris in the Caribbean, causing the Federal Aviation Administration to divert aircraft in the area and triggering an investigation.

SpaceX determined that the propulsion system's hardware had suffered more stress than expected during the flight, causing fuel leaks and fire in the ship's ""attic area.""

The company made upgrades to better vent the attic area, got reapproval from the FAA, and flew again in March — only to watch Starship explode again.

On that flight, the vehicle reached space and quickly spun out of control, eventually tumbling back toward Earth and blowing up.

In that instance, too, the FAA briefly grounded flights across Florida's east coast to avoid raining rocket debris.

According to SpaceX, the ensuing investigation found that a ""hardware failure"" in one of the ship's Raptor engines had probably allowed its highly reactive propellants to mix and ignite, disabling all the engines. To fix that problem, the company said, it improved the engines' plumbing and key joints.

SpaceX said on X that the March flight was ""a reminder of the value of putting hardware into a real-world environment as frequently as possible.""

It could be weeks or months before SpaceX shares a verdict on what caused Tuesday's mishap. Starship probably won't launch again until then.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I swapped my Tesla for a BYD after getting frustrated with Elon Musk. It was the right decision, but there are some things I miss.","https://www.businessinsider.com/byd-sealion-7-i-swapped-my-tesla-for-a-byd-2025-5","Wed, 28 May 2025 11:43:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Mahican Gielen, a radiologist in Hjørring, Denmark, about swapping her Tesla Model 3 for a BYD Sealion 7. It has been edited for length and clarity.

We live in Denmark, in the city of Hjørring, but we're actually from Holland. My husband and I are both doctors: I'm a radiologist, and he's a cardiologist.

I bought a Tesla Model 3 three years ago. It was my first electric car, and I'd wanted a Tesla for years.

My kids even pushed me because they knew I was looking for a car. They said: ""Mom, it should be a Tesla. That's the best car. It's a green car. It saves the planet.""

I have to say, I loved that car. It was such a big step up from the normal combustion engines and had so many cool features. I still miss it sometimes.

The first time I got a bit annoyed with my Tesla was when the company started cutting the prices. I bought mine right before, so that hurt.

Elon Musk joining the Trump administration was the final straw. I love cars, but if owning one gets overruled by the constant noise about the CEO and people asking whether it bothers me, then the fun goes out of it.

I just didn't want the headache anymore.

I know there is more to the company. But when you have a CEO who's so visible, he just becomes one with the company. And I really feel bad for Tesla because I like the brand. They were so innovative and new.

But this was a step too far. It really made me say, you know what? I'm going to get rid of this car. It's not going to get any better from here, so I'll just cut my losses.

I sold my Model 3 for 150,000 Danish Krone, or about $22,000, in April, having paid 350,000 Krone for it in 2022, and I bought a BYD Sealion 7 Excellence the same month.

[Editor's Note: BI was unable to verify the purchase price of Gielen's BYD Sealion 7 Excellence. It starts from roughly 390,000 Danish krone, or about $59,000.]

I wasn't going to buy an SUV, but I saw the Sealion 7 in a showroom and thought it looked amazing.

It was a little bit impulsive, but I'm really happy with it.

The build quality is on a level with a Mercedes, and the car feels really premium.

Things are different, but it has so many cool features, like a head-up display and actual physical buttons, which I missed as the Tesla didn't have them.

The best thing about the car is how solid it is. I always tell people the Tesla felt like a toy car compared to this one, because it was always rattling.

Sometimes, when it was freezing, you couldn't close the door because it wouldn't catch, and when you drove the Tesla around in the rain, sometimes you would hear sloshing sounds like water was dripping in the car. So the build quality is completely different.

The range is more than enough for me, and the software works pretty well. It's a bit slower and less intuitive than the software in the Tesla, but overall, I like it.

I think it's great that Chinese EV brands are entering Europe. I absolutely believe that the market should be open, and they have something to offer.

For me, many European brands seem kind of boring. They do the same thing every time, and these brands do something new.

Even if people don't buy them, it will probably make the European brands push their boundaries a bit and do more stuff. So I think it's absolutely good for everyone if more become available in Europe.

There are a few features I still miss about the Tesla, but I'm hoping they could be added to the BYD with software updates.

The Tesla auto-locks and unlocks when you just have your phone in your bag or on you. In the BYD, I really had to get used to pushing the button on the car key to lock and unlock.

When you charged your car, the Tesla automatically opened its charger port flap and closed it again. I have been driving around with an open flap because I'm so used to it.

My kids also really loved the Tesla's ""Santa Mode,"" and the Tesla app has a lot more features than the BYD one.

The feature I'm really going to miss is that Tesla automatically defrosted the windows via the app. So, I didn't have to remove ice for the last few years. It's not a problem now, but I know it's going to be annoying in the winter.

You could overlook some of the things that were wrong with the Tesla because it was so easy to use, it was almost like an iPhone. But in the end, some things are just not right.

Part of the reason I sold the car was because of the build quality. Mine was beginning to get a bit older, and I was in the shop with it more and more.

The path Musk has taken is extremely frustrating. It seriously hurts because I was really rooting for the brand. I think it's sad for a company that was so promising and could have done much more.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk says Trump's spending bill 'undermines' DOGE's work","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-criticizes-trump-spending-bill-deficit-undermines-doge-2025-5","Wed, 28 May 2025 02:20:00 GMT","

Elon Musk is breaking with President Donald Trump — and Republicans in Congress — in a major way.

The tech titan and de-facto DOGE leader firmly criticized the ""big beautiful bill"" — the spending bill that will form the core of Trump's legislative agenda — in a forthcoming interview with CBS, a clip of which was released on Tuesday.

""I was like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,"" Musk said. ""I think a vote can be big, or it could be beautiful. I don't know if it could be both.""

The Tesla CEO, in his capacity leading the White House DOGE office, has focused intensely on trying to cut spending from the federal budget.

Musk initially predicted that DOGE would cut at least $2 trillion in spending. He's since revised the number down a couple of times, and last month, he told reporters that DOGE had saved just $160 billion in federal spending and cut 20,000 government jobs, or about 1% of the federal workforce.

The ""big beautiful bill"" in its current form ultimately increases the deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the legislation would add $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.

That's primarily because it extends the tax cuts that Trump and congressional Republicans enacted in 2017. The bill also includes Trump campaign promises like no tax on tips, and it makes some cuts to Medicaid.

The bill is now in the Senate, where fiscal hawks have pledged to oppose the bill unless it makes further cuts. Republicans hope to get it to Trump's desk by July 4.

""I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful. But I don't know if it could be both.""Tech billionaire Elon Musk tells CBS Sunday Morning's @Pogue he was ""disappointed"" to see the Trump-backed ""big beautiful"" spending bill, which passed in the House last week.Musk said… pic.twitter.com/LUcuTaNYrs

Musk, meanwhile, recently said that he would be scaling back his work with DOGE.

""In the grand scheme of things, I think we've been effective. Not as effective as I'd like. I think we could be more effective. But we've made progress,"" Musk said on April 30.

Investors have called on Musk to spend more time on his businesses after his work at DOGE sparked boycotts and protests against Tesla.

Last week, Musk embarked on a media blitz to reaffirm his commitment to Tesla. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Musk said he planned to cut down on his political spending.

""In terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,"" Musk told Bloomberg. ""I think I've done enough.""

Musk later told CNBC that he would still be spending time in Washington. Musk said in a Tesla earnings call last month that he planned to scale down his involvement with DOGE to focus on Tesla.

""My rough plan on the White House is to be there for a couple days every few weeks. And to be helpful where I can be helpful,"" Musk told CNBC.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Another Starship glitch is not a good look for SpaceX, the startup founded by Elon Musk.

This is the third consecutive Starship launch that ended with disappointment and several uncompleted tests. The mantra of SpaceX's tests have been to fail, learn and iterate. This strategy hasn't worked as well without full attention from Musk, who converted the idea of building a reusable rocket into reality.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Streaming Wars:

Creators are making longer shows to meet viewers where they are: increasingly, in front of their TVs.

For two decades, YouTube has tried to convince advertisers that it's the future of entertainment. The pitch has always been simple enough: “Young people don't watch cable; they watch YouTube.” It doesn't exactly require a PowerPoint presentation.

But YouTube has had problems making its case. The first is that the vast majority of videos on the site aren't filmed to Scorsese-like standards. “The biggest knock against creator content is that it's low quality, s---, crap, slop, garbage,” Doug Shapiro, a former executive at Time Warner, wrote in December. That's sort of inconsequential, he argued, since most people aren't watching random YouTube slop—they're watching the most popular slop. Which leads to YouTube's second issue: The most watched channels haven't always been hospitable to advertisers.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

As the US grows frustrated with peacemaking efforts, Europe needs to step up its support for Ukraine's defense.

Mission: possible.

From Istanbul to the Vatican to the Oval Office, everyone seems to want peace in Ukraine — except Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin says it prefers to end the brutal war it launched in 2022 through “political and diplomatic means,” but that's like a pickpocket claiming to prefer charity: The bluff only works if others fall for it. Ukraine's Western allies shouldn't.

Putin's actions hardly suggest he is looking to end the fighting. A two-hour call with the White House last week yielded only vague promises from the Russian president — followed by several days of some of the fiercest drone and missile strikes against Ukraine since the war began. Meanwhile, Russia's summer offensive seems to have begun. Satellite images suggest it is also improving its positions along the border of Finland, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and tightening its military integration with ally Belarus.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on western allies to provide about $30 billion by the end of the year to boost domestic weapons production and hold off Russia's advance. 

With support from the US under President Donald Trump waning and efforts at peace negotiations with Russia's Vladimir Putin stalling, Ukraine is increasingly focused on relying on its own resources. But the war-battered economy is far short on investments needed to ramp up arms production, Zelenskiy said. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

The co-defendant in the bombshell lawsuit accusing former WWE boss Vince McMahon of sexual abuse and sex trafficking has agreed to cooperate with and give evidence to the woman suing the pro wrestling mogul and the company.

The co-defendant, John Laurinaitis, also reached a confidential settlement with McMahon's accuser, Janel Grant, according to a statement issued by their representatives on Wednesday. 

A filing Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Connecticut shows that lawyers for Grant and Laurinaitis agreed to dismiss her lawsuit against as it applies to the former wrestler and WWE executive with prejudice, which means that it cannot be refiled.

""John Laurinaitis has agreed to cooperate and provide evidence in Janel Grant's lawsuit against Vince McMahon and WWE,"" the reps said in the statement obtained by NBC News.

""His agreement to a confidential settlement is a pivotal next step toward holding McMahon and WWE accountable and bringing justice to Ms. Grant after years of sexual abuse and trafficking,"" the reps said.

""Mr. Laurinaitis looks forward to moving on with his life. We cannot provide any additional details at this time.""

CNBC has requested comment from attorneys for McMahon and WWE.

When Grant first sued the defendants in January 2024, a spokesman for McMahon said, ""This lawsuit is replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and a vindictive distortion of the truth.""

Grant's settlement with Laurinaitis comes three weeks after she filed an amended civil complaint against him, McMahon, and WWE.

McMahon resigned as the executive chairman of the board of TKO Group Holdings — the parent company of WWE and Ultimate Fighting Championship — in January 2024 after Grant filed her lawsuit.

In January 2025, McMahon agreed to settle administrative charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission alleging he violated federal securities laws by failing to inform WWE's board of directors that he had signed non-disclosure agreements with two women whom he promised to pay $10.5 million to keep quiet about his sexual conduct.

McMahon agreed to pay a $400,000 civil penalty in that case, and reimburse the WWE $1.3 million after consenting to an order finding he violated a securities law.

McMahon's wife, former WWE executive Linda McMahon, is currently serving as secretary of the U.S. Education Department under the couple's friend, President Donald Trump.

In October, both McMahons, WWE and TKO Holdings were sued in a complaint in Baltimore County, Maryland, accusing Vince McMahon of being aware of but failing to stop a wrestling ringside announcer from luring so-called ""ring boys"" as young as 12 and 13 years old to work on ring crews ""to sexually abuse them"" in the 1980s and 1990s.

A lawyer for Vince McMahon told NBC News at the time of the suit that they were based on old ""false claims.""

The Trump administration on Wednesday relaxed barriers in 401(k) plans to buying cryptocurrency and related digital assets like NFTs and meme coins.

The Labor Department rescinded guidance put in place by the Biden-era Labor Department in 2022 that aimed to safeguard 401(k) investors from such digital assets.

At the time, the Biden labor officials cautioned employers to exercise ""extreme care"" before making crypto and related investments available to their workers. They cited ""serious concerns"" about the prudence of exposing investors' retirement savings to crypto given ""significant risks of fraud, theft, and loss.""

The Trump Labor Department has withdrawn that guidance in full.

The agency said the standard of ""extreme care"" cited by the Biden administration is not found in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA.

""Prior to the 2022 release, the Department had usually articulated a neutral approach to particular investment types and strategies,"" the Trump Labor Department said in a compliance assistance bulletin issued Wednesday.

The department said that it is ""neither endorsing, nor disapproving of"" employers who decide that adding crypto to a 401(k) investment list is appropriate.

The Labor Department's reasoning extends to cryptocurrencies and ""a wide range"" of digital assets like ""tokens, coins, crypto assets, and any derivatives thereof,"" it said.

Knut Rostad, president of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, an advocacy group, called the Trump administration's move a ""big mistake.""

""As a huge general rule, crypto doesn't belong in a 401(k), period, end of sentence,"" he said.

Rescinding the guidance ""sends the wrong message by eliminating a yellow caution light and putting in place a green light"" for employers and 401(k) investors to use crypto, Rostad said.

The move comes at a time when President Trump has launched a $TRUMP meme coin that's added billions of dollars in paper wealth to his net worth and led Democratic senators to call for an ethics probe.

President Trump has pledged to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the world.""

Some observers will likely view the Labor Department move as an olive branch to the pro-crypto crowd, signaling to employers that they can add digital assets to their 401(k) lineups at will and without consequence, said Philip Chao, a certified financial planner and retirement plan investment consultant.

""That may be the intended message,"" said Chao, the founder of Experiential Wealth in Cabin John, Maryland. But he added, ""I think it's the wrong message.""

ERISA bestows a fiduciary duty on employers and company officials overseeing their 401(k) investments. At a high level, that legal responsibility means employers must put the best interests of 401(k) investors first and act prudently when choosing which investments to offer (or not offer).

That duty still exists — meaning it's not a given employers will rush to offer crypto. Doing so might risk being sued by 401(k) investors in the future if their crypto investment goes belly up, Chao said.

In this sense, the Labor Department's move is ""not necessarily controversial,"" he said.

""In reality, it's saying we should treat crypto like any other asset,"" Chao said.

There was some pushback against the Biden-era guidance among retirement plan advisors at the time it was issued because it seemed to single out a specific asset class. However, he understands the rationale.

""Crypto is such a new thing and there's no regulation or protection, even a reasonable understanding of it,"" Chao said. ""And there still isn't enough.""

Stephen Hall, legal director and securities specialist at Better Markets, an advocacy group for financial reform, believes the Biden-era guidance likely saved millions of investors from ""grievous losses"" when crypto prices plunged during the ""Crypto Winter"" of late 2022.

""During that time, the collapse of Do Kwon's scam stablecoin project Terra Luna, and the bankruptcies of FTX, Celsius, Voyager Digital and BlockFi created a domino effect, sending crypto prices crashing and resulting in billions of dollars of customer funds frozen as courts sorted through the wreckage,"" Hall said in an e-mailed statement.

In this article

GameStop said Wednesday it has officially bought 4,710 bitcoins, worth more than half a billion dollars, as the video game retailer began its crypto purchasing plan in a similar move made famous by MicroStrategy.

The purchase, its first investment in bitcoin, was worth $512.6 million with bitcoin's price of $108,837 on Wednesday. The world's largest cryptocurrency has been on a tear lately, hitting a record high near $112,000 last week, as easing trade tensions and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt highlighted alternative stores of value like bitcoin.

Shares of GameStop dipped 9% in morning trading following the news. The meme stock is up about 8% this year. As of Feb. 1, the company had amassed a $4.76 billion cash pile, according to its annual report released in April.

CNBC first reported on GameStop's intention to add cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet in February. The company confirmed its plan in late March, saying it has not set a ceiling on the amount of bitcoin it may purchase.

CEO Ryan Cohen made an appearance at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas Wednesday following the announcement. In a pre-recorded video, he said GameStop's decision to buy bitcoin is driven by macro concerns as the digital coin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, could serve as protection against certain risks. 

""If the thesis is correct, bitcoin and gold as well can be a hedge against global currency devaluation and systemic risk,"" he said. ""Bitcoin has certain unique advantages compared to gold, the portability aspect of it. It's instantly transferable across the globe.. It's instantly verified via the blockchain... there's the scarcity element of it as well.""

GameStop is following in the footsteps of software company MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, which bought billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in recent years to become the largest corporate holder of the flagship cryptocurrency. That decision prompted a rapid, albeit volatile, rise for Strategy's stock.

""GameStop is following GameStop's strategy. We're not following anyone else's strategy,"" Cohen said.

GameStop's foray into cryptocurrencies marks the latest effort by Cohen to revive the struggling brick-and-mortar business. Under Cohen's leadership, GameStop has focused on cutting costs and streamlining operations to ensure the company is profitable.

Elon Musk criticized the Republican spending bill that recently made it through a House vote, saying it counters the work he's been doing to reduce wasteful government spending.

In an interview to be aired June 1 on ""CBS Sunday Morning,"" the richest person in the world and the head of the Department of Government Efficiency advisory board said the ""big, beautiful bill"" will not help the nation's finances.

""I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,"" Musk said in a clip the program shared on social media platform X.

DOGE says it has saved $170 billion in taxpayer money since it began in January, targeting areas of government waste and redundancy in sometimes-controversial ways.

For instance, it has gutted the U.S. Agency for International Development and reduced staff elsewhere. DOGE-related moves have been responsible for some 275,000 government layoffs, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a consultancy firm.

DOGE and Musk savings claims have been called into question previously.

For example, Associated Press previously found 40% of government contracts cut by DOGE weren't expected to save the government any money. In February, the New York Times reported, DOGE removed five of its biggest listed savings from its website.

The sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act is projected to raise the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that conducts economic analysis for Congress. The deficit is on track in 2025 to run close to $2 trillion, with the national debt now at $36.2 trillion.

""I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful, but I don't know if it could be both,"" Musk said in the CBS clip.

Trump and congressional Republicans counter that the bill reduces spending in key areas and will generate enough growth to compensate for the tax reductions. The legislation, though, is expected to face strong resistance in the Senate.

For his part, Musk has pulled back his DOGE work, saying he plans to focus on running his companies, which include X, Tesla and SpaceX. Musk had been a frequent presence in the White House since Trump's election.

However, Musk said on a first-quarter Tesla earnings call that while his time spent running DOGE should drop significantly this month, he still plans to spend a ""day or two per week"" on government work until the end of Trump's term. He also plans to keep his small office at the White House.

In an interview with The Washington Post published Tuesday, Musk said that the federal bureaucracy is ""much worse than I realized"" and that DOGE became ""the whipping boy for everything.""

Musk's work with Trump, and his frequently incendiary political rhetoric, have inspired a backlash and widespread protests against his autos business, Tesla. 

""People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That's really uncool,"" Musk told the Post.

In this article

Macy's cut its full-year profit guidance on Wednesday even as it beat Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations, as the retailer's CEO said it will hike prices of certain items to offset tariffs.

In a news release, the department store operator said it reduced its earnings outlook because of higher tariffs, more promotions and ""some moderation"" in discretionary spending. Macy's stuck by its full-year sales forecast, however. 

For fiscal 2025, Macy's now expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 to $2, down from its previous forecast of $2.05 to $2.25. It reaffirmed its full-year sales guidance of between $21 billion and $21.4 billion, which would be a decline from $22.29 billion in the most recent full year. 

In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said about 15 cents to 40 cents per share of the guidance cut is due to tariffs. He said about 20% of the company's merchandise comes from China.

Macy's will raise some prices and stop carrying certain items to mitigate the hit from tariffs, he added.

""You're dealing with it on both the demand side as well as the increased cost side,"" he said. ""And so navigating that, we have a series of different scenarios to try to figure out kind of what will be the reality, and we want our guidance to reflect the flexibility of that uncertainty, so that we can react in real time to how we serve or better serve the consumer.""

Spring said the company will be ""surgical"" with price changes.

""It's not a one-size-fits-all kind of approach,"" he said. ""There are going to be items that are the same price as they were a year ago. There is going to be, selectively, items that may be more expensive, and there are items that we might not carry because the pricing doesn't merit the quality or the perceived value by the consumer.""

Here's how Macy's did during its fiscal first quarter, compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

In the three-month period that ended May 3, the company's net income was $38 million, or 13 cents per share, compared with $62 million, or 22 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Sales dropped from $4.85 billion in the year-ago quarter. Excluding some one-time charges including restructuring charges, adjusted earnings per share were 16 cents.

The company's shares were up more than 1% midday Wednesday.

Economic uncertainty – including President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff announcements – has complicated Macy's turnaround plans. The New York City-based legacy retailer is more than a year into a three-year effort to become a smaller, but healthier business. It's shuttering weaker stores and investing in stronger parts of the company, including luxury department store Bloomingdale's and beauty chain Bluemercury. It has also tried to improve the customer experience, including by speeding up online deliveries and adding staff to stores. 

Spring told analysts on the earnings call that the tariff impact on Macy's outlook includes the additional costs of inventory previously imported under the 145% China tariffs, which have since dropped to 30%. He said the outlook does not include a potential increase in tariffs on the European Union or any other U.S. trading partner.

Trump recently threatened to implement, and then delayed, a 50% tariff on the EU.

Macy's sells a mix of national band private brands, which are sold exclusively at its stores and on its website. Spring told CNBC that the company has reduced the share of its private brands that comes from China to about 27% — a drop from 32% last year and more than 50% before the Covid pandemic.

CFO Adrian Mitchell said on the company's earnings call that Macy's has taken action to blunt the impact of tariffs on national brands it sells, too. He said the company has renegotiated orders with vendors, canceled some orders and delayed others.

""We've been able to gain some vendor discounts, which has been helpful to us, but we're absorbing some of that price as well,"" he said.

And in some cases, Macy's is keeping prices the same despite higher costs to appeal to value-conscious customers and gain market share from competitors, Mitchell added.

Spring said on the company's earnings call on Wednesday that Macy's sales were stronger in March and April compared to February, attributing some of that to improving weather. So far, sales trends in the second quarter have been above those in March and April, he added.

Macy's plans to close about 150 underperforming namesake stores across the country by early 2027.

In the fiscal first quarter, Macy's namesake brand remained its weakest. Comparable sales across Macy's owned and licensed business, plus its online marketplace, declined 2.1% year over year. 

When Macy's took out the stores that it plans to shutter, however, trends looked slightly better. Comparable sales of its go-forward business, including its owned and licensed business and online marketplace, declined 1.9%

On the other hand, comparable sales at Bloomingdale's rose 3.8% year over year, including its owned, licensed and marketplace businesses. Comparable sales at Bluemercury climbed 1.5% year over year.

To try to turn its namesake stores around, Macy's has invested in 50 locations – dubbed the ""First 50"" – with more staffing, sharper displays and changes to its mix of merchandise. It has expanded that initiative to 75 additional stores, bringing the total to 125 locations that have gotten increased attention. That's a little over a third of the 350 namesake locations that Macy's plans to keep open.

Those 125 locations performed better than the overall Macy's brand. Comparable sales among those revamped stores owned and licensed by Macy's were down 0.8% compared with the year-ago period.

On Macy's earnings call in March – before Trump made several sudden tariff moves that baffled companies and investors – Spring said the company's guidance ""assumes a certain level of uncertainty"" about the economic outlook. He said even Macy's affluent customer ""is just as uncertain and as confused and concerned by what's transpiring.""

Earlier this spring, Macy's announced a few key leadership changes – including a new chief financial officer. Macy's new CFO, Thomas Edwards, will begin on June 22. He previously served as the chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Capri Holdings, the parent company of Michael Kors. He will succeed Mitchell, who is leaving Macy's.

As of Tuesday's close, Macy's shares are down about 29% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's nearly 1% gains during the same period. Macy's stock closed on Tuesday at $12.04 per share, bringing the retailer's market value to $3.35 billion.

In this article

Instacart on Wednesday appointed business chief Chris Rogers as its new CEO, less than a month after OpenAI announced CEO Fidji Simo as its new head of applications.

Shares were flat.

Rogers, who joined Instacart in 2019, will start Aug. 15 and join the board of directors. Simo will retain her chair position to ""smooth the transition,"" the company said.

""Over the last four years, we've transformed Instacart into a growing, profitable, leading technology platform that's helping reshape the grocery industry,"" Simo said in a release. ""We're building a generational company at the intersection of technology and food, and Chris is the right leader for our next chapter.""

OpenAI announced this month that it had recruited Simo to lead its applications team, reporting directly to CEO Sam Altman. At the time, Altman said in a post that Simo would ""focus on enabling our 'traditional' company functions to scale as we enter a next phase of growth.""

She joined the artificial intelligence startup's board last year.

Simo helped take the grocery delivery company public in 2023, after it ballooned in popularity as consumers sheltered at home during the depths of the pandemic.

At the time, Instacart was the first major venture-backed tech IPO since the end of 2021. She also made CNBC's 2024 Changemakers list.

""There were a lot of questions about whether Instacart would be just another pandemic fad,"" Simo told CNBC at the time. ""And we have now proven that we not only kept the Covid gains, but grew on top of the Covid gains and grew sustainably and profitably,  which is really important.""

Prior to joining Instacart, Rogers spent 11 years at Apple working in a variety of roles, including managing director for the company's Canada division. He started his career at the delivery company as vice president of global retail, later transitioning into the chief business officer role.

Rogers began his professional career at Procter & Gamble and graduated in 2001 from Canada's Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, with a bachelor's degree in business administration.

""We have a world-class team, deep partnerships, leading technology, and a bold vision for the future, and I'm honored to step in and lead Instacart's next chapter,"" he said.

PLANO, Texas — Twenty-five years after introducing many Americans to hybrid vehicles with the Prius, Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs.

Such cars can function as an all-electric vehicle for a certain number of miles before they need a traditional gas-powered engine. Unlike traditional hybrids like the Prius that use a small amount of battery technologies, PHEVs also need to be charged with a plug, like an EV, to use the electric range.

PHEVs aren't new. Toyota first introduced the Prius as a PHEV in the U.S. in 2016, but such plug-ins are experiencing a renaissance as automakers try to meet federal fuel economy standards and emissions regulations. They've also acted as potential steppingstones to all-electric vehicles for consumers who might be hesitant to go fully electric.

""We are going to grow our PHEV volume through the lineup over the next few years,"" David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, told CNBC during a visit to the company's North American headquarters. ""We love the PHEV powertrain. We're working to increase, perpetually increase, the amount of miles you can drive on EV-only range.""

Company sources said Toyota plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. However, they said that could change based on regulations, customer acceptance of electrified technologies and affordability, among other factors.

That percentage of sales would match the amount of PHEV mix allowed under the California Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which requires automakers to exclusively sell zero-emissions vehicles in the state by 2035. President Donald Trump is expected to eliminate that rule.

Toyota's planned PHEV expansion comes amid the regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, which the company also continues to invest billions of dollars in annually. The performance of PHEVs also continues to improve.

""We're looking at plug-ins across the lineup, and it's more a function of where can we build them, and what is the product strength versus the competition,"" Christ said.

The EV-only range of PHEVs has increased from a few dozen miles in ideal conditions to 50 miles for vehicles such as the automaker's redesigned RAV4 that was introduced last week.

Sales estimates and forecasts for PHEVs vary, as their sales are limited and not all companies break out such models when reporting results. Several automotive data and forecasting companies expect modest PHEV growth, to between 4% and 5% of U.S. industry sales by 2030.

""The growth is likely limited due to the expensive dual powertrain cost structure. For those already invested, it may make sense to continue along the path,"" said Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""However, for those who haven't already made significant investments, it is a large incremental cost that must be balanced.""

S&P has PHEV sales in the U.S. growing from about 2% last year to 5% by the end of the decade. AutoPacific expects PHEVs to grow to about 4.2% by 2030, while AutoForecast Solutions expects such sales to be relatively stable around 3.3% over the coming years.

PHEV sales for Toyota, including its luxury Lexus brand, increased roughly 39% last year, according to company data. That included a 30% rise for the Toyota brand's Prius and RAV4 PHEVs, as well as an 88.6% jump for Lexus' three PHEVs, including a new ""TX"" model.

That compares with the automaker's more than 20 hybrid models that experienced a combined sales increase of 53% last year, including a 56% jump for the Toyota brand amid several new introductions.

""We're looking across the lineup and saying, 'How many power trains can we offer on what products?'"" Christ said. ""We are going to increase the percentage of hybrids and PHEVs.""

Christ said the Toyota brand expects hybrids, including PHEVs, to account for more than 50% of U.S. sales this year, increasing from roughly 46% in 2024 and nearly 30% in 2023.

Cooper Ericksen, Toyota North America senior vice president of product and battery electric vehicles, or BEVs, compared the automaker's ""electrified"" vehicle approach to having the bases loaded in a baseball game with different players.

""We've got ICE. We've got hybrid. We got plug-in hybrid. We got EV,"" he said. ""So, our chances of being successful in scoring runs is just a lot better than if you're really overly committed to any one of those powertrains.""

Ericksen, citing Toyota research and studies, said once people understand how PHEVs work and their benefits, there's a massive swing in customer interest from traditional vehicles, hybrids and even some EVs.

""Once we educate people, by far the biggest swing from all the powertrains is PHEV. It goes up exponentially,"" he told CNBC during a separate interview. ""PHEV is really important for us. There are people that will consider a PHEV that will not consider a BEV.""

Consumer understanding of PHEVs has been a challenge in the past. It was partially to blame for the slow sales and discontinuation of General Motors' Chevrolet Volt, which the automaker produced from 2010 to early 2019.

Many consumers also have voiced concern about having to plug the vehicle in. (But the vehicles can still operate as a traditional gas-powered vehicle without ever being plugged in, which has drawn criticism from some EV supporters.)

PHEVs are also costly due to the need for both EV technologies and an engine. Toyota's PHEVs currently cost thousands of dollars more than traditional or hybrid vehicles.

""There are a lot of negatives in the production side of it, and buyers, unless they're forced to, don't really opt for the PHEV models,"" said Sam Fiorani, AutoForecast Solutions vice president of global vehicle forecasting.

Toyota's 2025 RAV4 PHEV carries a roughly $15,000 price premium over the base model and $12,000 over the hybrid version.

""It's kind of like getting two cars in one,"" Ericksen said. ""And if it serves a compliance benefit, maybe we sweeten the pot a little bit on the price to get more people to consider it.""

In this article

Ford Motor is recalling nearly 1.1 million vehicles in the United States because rearview cameras may not display images due to a software issue, increasing the risk of a crash.

The recall covers some 2021 through 2024 model year Bronco, F-150, Edge, and 2023-2024 Escape, Corsair, F-250, F-350, F-450, F-550 and F-600 vehicles, the automaker said Wednesday in a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The recall also impacts the 2022-2024 Expedition, 2022-2025 Transit, 2021-2023 Mach-E, Lincoln Nautilus, 2024 Ranger, Mustang and the 2022-2024 Navigator.

NHTSA said the software issue may cause the rearview camera image to delay, freeze, or not display.

Ford said it is aware of one allegation of a minor crash resulting in property damage tied to the issue.

In January, NHTSA contacted Ford regarding allegations of more than three dozen rear-view camera complaints on 2021-2023 Ford F-150 vehicles.

In April, a Ford engineering team was able to reproduce the failure mode within a vehicle and link the causal factors to specific software variants.

Dealers are expected to update vehicle software through an over-the-air update. The software being recalled serves as an operating system for the car's dashboard, helping its infotainment system to control apps and display maps, among others.

Letters notifying owners of the safety risk are expected to be mailed by June 16. A second letter will be sent once the remedy is available later this year.

Ford in April issued two other recalls in the United States for rearview camera issues covering about 289,000 vehicles in total. For both recalls, the automaker will replace rearview cameras.

In November, NHTSA said Ford had agreed to a $165 million civil penalty after an agency investigation found the automaker failed to recall vehicles with defective rearview cameras in a timely manner.

NHTSA in August 2021 opened an investigation after Ford in 2020 recalled about 620,000 vehicles for a rear camera issue to determine whether the carmaker had made the recall in a timely fashion. Ford expanded that recall in 2022 and in March, adding about 24,000 vehicles.

In this article

More than $130 billion of value has been wiped off of ASML in under a year amid restrictions on exports to China and U.S. tariff uncertainty 

Shares of ASML, which is seen as a critical cog in the semiconductor supply chain, hit a record high of over 1,000 euros a piece in July last year for a market capitalization of $429.5 billion, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. That fell to just under $297 billion at the Tuesday close price.

Semiconductor stocks have been volatile since last year due to tightening U.S. chip export restrictions to China and U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs on the sector since he took office. ASML and other European semiconductor firms have felt the heat.

""All the equipment manufacturers in the space have come down because they are concentrating all the fears around … the U.S. restrictions to China,"" Stephane Houri, head of equity research at ODDO BHF, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Wednesday.

Houri also said tariff discussions and debate over whether companies are over-investing in artificial intelligence, bringing up questions over whether ""demand is not at the level that many people expect.""

ASML is one of the most important companies in the semiconductor supply chain. It designs tools, known as extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, that are purchased by manufacturers like TSMC and are required to make the world's most advanced chips.

The company recently started shipping the next generation of these machines, known as high numerical aperture, or High NA.

ASML is widely seen as the only company in the world that can produce these EUV machines, giving it a wide moat.

But ASML has never been able to ship its most advanced machines to China, which has cut off potential sales for the Dutch firm. ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet told CNBC in January that, in 2025, he expects the ""ratio of our business in China to be lower than what it has been"" in 2023 and 2024.

ASML is not alone in facing challenges from tariffs and China. Chip stocks across the world have felt pressure from the uncertainty in global markets linked to China and tariffs.

A trade and tariffs deal between the U.S. and Europe could remove some uncertainty for investors.

""If there is an agreement in the end with President Trump and ... Europe and many other countries, they probably will benefit from the relief in the market, and notably in the sector,"" Houri added.

Despite the external pressures weighing on ASML, analysts are still relatively bullish on the stock. ASML has a target price of just over 779 euros, according to a average of analyst calls collated by LSEG. That implies around 17% upside from the Tuesday closing price.

This month, Wells Fargo published a note to clients after a meeting with ASML management. The analysts at the investment bank said ASML ""remains positive on growth opportunities"" in 2025 and 2026, highlighting companies such as Samsung and Intel who are spending on next-generation chipmaking tools.

In this article

Auto giant Stellantis on Wednesday appointed North American Chief Operating Officer Antonio Filosa as its new chief executive, ending a monthslong campaign to fill the firm's leadership void.

The multinational conglomerate, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, said it would hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting in the coming days for Filosa to be elected to the board to serve as an executive director.

Stellantis said Filosa would assume CEO powers effective June 23. He will succeed Carlos Tavares, who unexpectedly resigned in December after a sharp drop in profit, falling sales and problems in the U.S.

""It is my great honor to be named the CEO of this fantastic Company,"" Filosa said in a statement, noting he takes over at a ""pivotal time for our industry.""

Filosa, in an internal memo to employees Wednesday, said his ""essential"" focus as CEO will be ""strengthening the bonds and trust we have with our partners — our dealers, suppliers, unions and communities.""

Mending relationships has been a priority for Filosa for much of the past year following a divide between many of Stellantis' partners under Tavares, especially in the U.S.

A 25-year veteran of the company, Filosa previously served as Jeep brand CEO before being named North America COO in October 2024 and chief quality officer in January this year.

In addition to mending bonds, Filosa will need to balance the company's investments in internal combustion engines and electric vehicles, while attempting to get the company's finances back on track.

Stellantis recently reported a 14% year-on-year downturn in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties regarding the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's back-and-forth trade policy.

Uncertainty over trade tariffs is expected to profoundly affect the car industry, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America.

Stellantis said John Elkann, who had led an interim executive committee since Tavares' resignation, will continue in his role as executive chairman. Elkann is scion of Europe's prominent Agnelli family that founded Italian carmaker Fiat more than a century ago.

""Antonio's deep understanding of our Company, including its people who he views as our core strength, and of our industry equip him perfectly for the role of Chief Executive Officer in this next and crucial phase of Stellantis' development,"" Elkann said.

Shares of Milan-listed Stellantis are down nearly 27% year to date.

Filosa was among a short list of potential CEO candidates that also included three external candidates and Stellantis head of procurement Maxime Picat, Reuters reported last month.

Filosa plans to travel to Stellantis' plants and offices across the world in the days and weeks ahead, according to the internal memo.

""I have always found strength in connecting and working closely with colleagues. That will be more important than ever. I look forward to our work together and the successes this will bring going forward,"" he said in the memo.

Michael Bettenhausen, a dealer in Illinois and chair of the Stellantis U.S. dealer council, said there is still a lot of work to get done regarding new products and sales.

""Today it's about recognizing Antonio but tomorrow we've got a lot of heavy lifting to do,"" he said Wednesday. ""We need to mutually work together and dive into all the issues here in the North American operations, and we look forward to Antonio still being a part of those discussions.""

Bettenhausen described Filosa as a ""very smart, retail centric operator"" who understands the business, including the need for new products to improve the company's embattled U.S. sales.

Ethereum options markets are pricing in a lower chance to surpass even conservative targets before the year ends, while volatility has stayed put despite increasing trader demand. 

Those factors convey a broader uncertainty about Ethereum's trajectory, even as the crypto market matures and attracts sophisticated capital.

That's according to data shared by digital asset and market intelligence platform Amberdata, whose director of derivatives, Greg Magadini, told Decrypt that investor appetite for options has returned.

""Looking at the options market, we're finally seeing a return towards appetite for options, but volatility remains inexpensive,"" he said, noting how current bets on Ethereum remain split.

Options contracts are financial agreements allowing investors to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price if they choose. In crypto, they provide the option, but not the obligation, to buy or sell at agreed prices.

These derivatives allow traders to establish positions with defined risk parameters: buyers can only lose the premium paid, while sellers collect premiums upfront.

Magadini's projections come as Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin this year, with investors tuning their attention to the alpha crypto, particularly as the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas gets underway this week.

The conference, compared with its previous iteration in July, could offer a ""useful analogue,"" QCP Capital observed in a Tuesday note.

""At the time, a keynote by President Trump coincided with a sharp spike in 1-day implied vols above 90,"" the Singapore-based digital asset trading firm wrote.

That was soon followed by a swift reversal and a nearly 30% decline in BTC within two days—a piece of crypto history that ""continues to shape market memory.""

Still, conservative pricing reflects a divergence between retail and institutional expectations, as risk appetites among groups maintain differing profiles.

""On-screen traders (retail) are betting on $3000 by the end of the month, while institutions are betting $3500 by the end of June,"" he said.

Still, despite the cautious price targets, the market looks considerably more positive, suggesting that traders are actively positioning even as their price expectations remain subdued.

""Open interest is returning to ETH as well,"" Magadini said, with levels now parrying ""back to December highs when the market was very optimistic.""

Ethereum, meanwhile, has gained approximately 4% over the past week, rising to around $2,647 at the time of writing, per CoinGecko data.

Open interest for Ethereum derivatives, meanwhile, stands at roughly $35 billion, up 8.8%, according to data from CoinGlass. ETH's OI-weighted funding rate remains positive.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin thinks ETH could be a viable alternative to attempts by Sweden and Norway to make their societies cashless. The countries pulled back recently after discovering that centralized payment systems collapse when physical infrastructures fail.

But in the crypto world, this move prompted a different response: The idea that decentralized systems could take on the role.

""Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,"" Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote on X, responding to a Guardian report that both countries now require citizens to maintain cash reserves.

Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile. Cash turns out necessary as a backup.

Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role.… pic.twitter.com/eFVYT254qN

Sweden had reduced cash usage to just 1% of transactions while Norway's Vipps app dominated commerce, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exposed critical vulnerabilities when infrastructure attacks could paralyze entire payment networks.

Buterin echoed the sentiment, saying: ""Cash turns out necessary as a backup.""

Looking at his own garden, Buterin posed a measured observation on the case of Sweden and Norway.

""Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,"" he wrote.

Cash versus code

Responding to Decrypt's inquiries on Buterin's statements, Sam MacPherson, CEO of decentralized finance protocol development firm Phoenix Labs, disagrees with the Ethereum co-founder's assessment.

""Ethereum is already there. It is designed to be as resilient to hostile actors as possible,"" MacPherson said, pointing to DeFi protocols managing billions without major failures.

Such decentralized systems are ""designed to be as secure as possible from the ground up,"" he claimed.

Still, offline functionality ranks as one of the primary challenges if Ethereum were to take on the role of providing a more resilient alternative to cash. Without electricity or internet, Ethereum wouldn't work on its own.

Zero-knowledge proofs, meanwhile, could theoretically enable offline payments, as Buterin noted in responses, though those remain experimental.

""We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware,"" Buterin said.

Another opportunity could be opened with stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar.

""Stablecoins are an exact solution to this scenario,"" Anthony Anzalone, founder of walletless blockchain platform XION, told Decrypt. Stablecoins have ""exploded in usage and adoption"" because they aren't ""reliant on one centralized party,"" he explained.

@rohangrey has done a lot of deep thought in this direction.

We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 25, 2025



Countries with ""unstable governments and currencies"" are the most apparent use case and context, Anzalone said.

Yet, stablecoins face their own questions about resilience, especially in terms of privacy.

""While there are several privacy protocols with the potential to make Ethereum private enough to act as a meaningful alternative to cash, resilience is another issue altogether,"" Harrie Bickle, documentation lead at AI-powered orchestration layer NodeOps, told Decrypt.

In the face of crisis scenarios such as those that Sweden and Norway now face, Ethereum could show its resilience by not strictly requiring users to have access ""to electricity, secure operating systems, and unhackable Web3 wallets,"" Bickle added, pointing out flaws in how Ethereum could remain practical in such cases.

""We must travel a long way down an, as yet undeclared, roadmap before Ethereum will be resilient enough to replace cash transactions,"" Bickle said.

Leading cryptocurrencies rose Tuesday, helped by improved consumer confidence and the Trump family's foray into the Bitcoin treasury space.

What Happened: The apex cryptocurrency tapped the high $110,000s in the early morning hours before sliding to the $108,000 region overnight.

Ethereum saw greater momentum as the second-largest cryptocurrency jumped 4.5% in the last 24 hours, reaching an intraday high of $2,712.29. 

As of this writing, Ethereum has outperformed its senior sibling in the second quarter, up 45% to Bitcoin's 31% increase.

The moves come after Trump Media & Technology Group DJT, a firm co-founded and majority-owned by President Donald Trump, announced it will use the proceeds of a $2.5 billion private offering to create a Bitcoin treasury.

Meanwhile, over $231 million was liquidated from the cryptocurrency market in the last 24 hours, with the majority being bearish short bets.

Bitcoin's Open Interest rose 1.87% in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum saw a 7.68% jump in funds locked in its derivatives. More than 57% of Binance traders with open ETH positions were positioned long as of this writing.

Top Gainers (24-Hours)

The global cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at $3.44 trillion, following a spike of 1.31% in the last 24 hours.

Stocks lifted on the first day of the holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 740.58 points, or 1.78%, to end at 42,343.65. The S&P 500 added 2.05% to close at 5,921.54, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rallied 2.47% to end at 19,199.16.

The market reacted to Trump's decision to delay the 50% tariffs on European Union imports until July 9 from June 1. Additionally, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in May, fueled by a recovering stock market and hopes tied to easing U.S.-China trade tensions.

Analyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Ali Martinez indicated that Bitcoin's top could be some time away.

""Bitcoin traders are currently sitting on 27% average profits. Historically, things start to look toppy once profits exceed 40%,"" Martinez added.

Another widely followed cryptocurrency commentator, Michaël van de Poppe, said ETH was looking primed for a breakout above $3,000.

""ETH is probably the best play to have in your base portfolio,"" he stated.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoption","https://cointelegraph.com/news/katana-defi-chain-launches-private-mainnet-for-higher-yields","Wed, 28 May 2025 15:01:54 GMT","

 Katana launched its private mainnet with support from GSR and Polygon Labs, aiming to solve liquidity fragmentation in DeFi. 

The Katana Foundation, a nonprofit focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) development, is launching its private mainnet, aiming to unlock greater crypto asset productivity via deeper liquidity and higher yields for users.

The Katana Foundation launched a DeFi-optimized, private blockchain, Katana, on May 28, incubated by GSR Markets and Polygon Labs, with the public mainnet launch set for June.

The new blockchain will enable users to earn higher yields and explore DeFi in a “unique, optimized yield environment” that unlocks latent value through an ecosystem that makes every digital asset “work harder,” according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

“DeFi users deserve ecosystems that prioritize sustainable liquidity and consistent ‘real' yields,” wrote Marc Boiron, the CEO of Polygon Labs and core contributor at Katana, adding: 

Katana aims to solve the crypto industry's liquidity fragmentation issue, which can cause significant price slippage, as one of the main barriers limiting institutional DeFi participation

Related: Here's how abstraction minimizes fragmentation in DeFi, making it more fluid

To reduce the value slippage in DeFi, Katana's blockchain concentrates the liquidity from numerous protocols and collects yields on all potential sources to create an ecosystem with deeper liquidity and more predictable lending and borrowing rates.

Institutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.

To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana's liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.

Katana has also incorporated Conduit's sequences and Chainlink's decentralized oracle network.

Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidity

Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.

The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.

“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs' Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:

“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.

Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana's core applications,” said Boiron.

Polygon Labs' CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. 

Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.

Regulatory concerns were the main barrier to entry, flagged by 57% of institutional investors as the main reason for not planning to participate in DeFi activities.

Proposed business combination will create a public company engaged in Crypto Mining, Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), and High-Performance Computing (“HPC”) Data Hosting Markets

BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure Generated Audited Revenue of $26.8 million and Net Income of $5.7 million in 2024

Includes an Earnout if BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure achieves or exceeds EBITDA of $25 million for 2026

Transaction to be completed at a significant premium to SGN's current stock price

SCOTTSDALE, AZ, May  28, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Signing Day Sports, Inc. (“Signing Day Sports” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: SGN), the developer of the Signing Day Sports app and platform to aid high school athletes in the recruitment process, today announced the signing of a definitive business combination agreement (“Business Combination Agreement” or “BCA”) to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interest of One Blockchain LLC (“One Blockchain”) (the operating affiliate company of BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure) (One Blockchain and BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure collectively, “blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure” or “blockchAIn DI”) which will operate a crypto mining, AI and HPC data hosting company with plans for 200MW in total power capacity from facilities in South Carolina and Texas. The proposed transaction was previously announced on April 14, 2025 following the signing of a non-binding letter of intent. 

The transaction will be effected through a holding company structure, whereby Signing Day Sports and One Blockchain will become subsidiaries of BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, Inc. (“PubCo”). The transaction between One Blockchain and Signing Day Sports is expected to result in the combined company being traded on the NYSE American. Signing Day Sports will not be required to make any cash payment to One Blockchain or its securityholders in connection with the transaction. One Blockchain will continue to operate under blockchAIn DI's management team led by Chairman and CEO Jerry Tang.

In 2024, blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure generated audited revenue of approximately $26.8 million and net income of approximately $5.7 million.

The market for digital infrastructure—including crypto mining, HPC, and AI-related computing—is evolving rapidly as demand for energy-efficient processing power continues to grow. Amid increasing sustainability standards and renewed emphasis on domestic infrastructure, blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure is positioned to pursue opportunities across a wide range of compute-intensive applications.

blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure's current operations include a 40 MW crypto mining hosting facility in South Carolina with expansion capability to 50 MW for third-party crypto miners in South Carolina, subject to utility approval. blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure anticipates transitioning to internally owning and mining crypto currency at their South Carolina facility in late 2025 or early 2026, to facilitate revenue and earnings growth. blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure is also in the process of commissioning a new 150MW crypto mining, AI and HPC data hosting facility in Texas with favorable economics with 34.5kV of interconnectivity to the grid for activation in late 2026. The Texas facility can be modularly built providing flexibility for crypto mining and/or AI and HPC data hosting activities. It is currently anticipated that the first 100MW will be initially focused on internally owned crypto mining operations and the remaining 50MW of capacity used for AI and HPC data hosting. This capital efficient and flexible modular business model will provide blockchAIn DI with optionality to pursue different revenue mixes as the crypto mining, AI and HPC markets continue to develop.

Signing Day Sports views the proposed transaction as a compelling opportunity to enhance its platform by combining with a technology-driven business with strong fundamentals and scalable infrastructure.

Danny Nelson, Chief Executive Officer of Signing Day Sports, stated, “This transaction marks an exciting new chapter for Signing Day Sports, which we are confident has potential to bring substantial value to the stakeholders of both parties. blockchAIn DI's scalable, cash-flowing bitcoin mining and AI data center platform positions the combined company to capitalize on the fast-growing HPC hosting market. With a 40 MW mining site in South Carolina with 10 MW expansion capacity and the significant upside potential resulting from the planned commissioning of a new facility in Texas, blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure is strategically positioned to meet the growing HPC workload demands, and we could not be more thrilled to deliver this unique growth opportunity to our shareholders.”

Jerry Tang, Chief Executive Officer of One Blockchain, added, “We are excited about the proposed transaction between blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure and Signing Day Sports, and the significant potential for value creation for both parties. In only a few short years since our inception, blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure has experienced rapid growth scaling to approximately $26.8 million in revenue and approximately $5.7 million in net income in 2024. Supported by our cash flow generation, we are positioned to become a leader in providing and operating sustainable, blockchain computing infrastructure and progress our significant growth goals forward. In the near term, blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure will look to bring bitcoin mining in-house, expand our South Carolina facility to 50MW, and build out our proposed 150MW facility in Texas to support the large demand for hosting services driven by various AI and mining applications. The business combination with Signing Day Sports will enable us to accelerate our robust growth in the public markets, and we look forward to executing on our business plan to drive value for all shareholders.”

Terms of the Transaction

The business combination will be effectuated through a holding company structure, whereby Signing Day Sports and One Blockchain will become subsidiaries of PubCo through merger transactions. Under the BCA, the consideration to be paid at closing to the securityholders of One Blockchain will be comprised of PubCo common shares with a value of approximately $215.0 million, subject to an exchange ratio and other certain adjustments, at an implied diluted value per share for PubCo of $5.12 (including adjustment as applicable for exchange listing purposes). Upon the closing of the business combination, the stock held by the stockholders of Signing Day Sports immediately before the closing of the transaction will be converted into the right to receive approximately 8.5% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company, and the equity securities of One Blockchain held by One Blockchain's equity securityholders immediately before the closing of the transaction will be converted into the right to receive approximately 91.5% of the outstanding common shares of the combined company before fees and commissions to third parties. The board of directors of PubCo post-transaction will be comprised of no less than five (5) and no greater than seven (7) directors. At least one director will be designated by Signing Day Sports, and One Blockchain will designate the remaining directors.

The BCA also includes an earnout, in which additional PubCo shares equaling 11.628% of the total number of shares of PubCo issued to One Blockchain's securityholders at closing will be issued to such former One Blockchain securityholders (the “Earnout Shares”). The Earnout Shares will be issued if PubCo achieves or exceeds net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of $25 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026. 

The boards of both companies have unanimously approved the signing of the BCA. The proposed transaction is expected to close late in the second half of 2025, subject to satisfying certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of approvals from Signing Day Sports' shareholders and the listing of PubCo registered common shares on the NYSE American. 

The Business Combination Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by Signing Day Sports and One Blockchain, including covenants that both parties use their commercially reasonably efforts to cause the transactions contemplated by the agreement to be completed, regarding obtaining the requisite approval of Signing Day Sports' shareholders, regarding indemnification of directors and officers, and regarding Signing Day Sports' and One Blockchain's conduct of their respective businesses between the date of signing of the BCA and the closing. The BCA also contains certain termination rights for both Signing Day Sports and One Blockchain. 

The Signing Day Sports board of directors has recommended to Signing Day Sports shareholders that they vote to approve the BCA and the transaction. Signing Day Sports also received a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction. 

A more complete description of the terms of and conditions of the proposed transaction and related matters will be included in a current report on Form 8-K to be filed by Signing Day Sports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). A copy of the BCA will be attached as an exhibit to Form 8-K.

 Average NFT loan sizes have tanked, which DappRadar's Sara Gherghelas says means users are borrowing against low-value assets or being conservative with leverage. 

Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.

Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.

Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.

“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” 

“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”

Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.

The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.

The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.

Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”

The average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it's been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.

Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”

Part of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.

“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they've been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”

The protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.

“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn't built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn't mean NFT lending is finished; it's simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.

“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”

CryptoSlate's latest report dives deep into the boom-bust trajectory of NFTs: from their euphoric peak and inscription speculation, through the subsequent collapse in activity and value, to the current search for stability and meaning in the aftermath.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Non-fungible tokens burst into the mainstream as a new digital asset class in 2017, promising verifiable ownership of unique digital items on blockchain.

Early experiments like CryptoKitties hinted at the potential, but it was the 2021 NFT boom, exemplified by multi-million-dollar digital art sales and coveted profile-picture (PFP) collections, that cemented NFTs in the cultural zeitgeist.

By representing art, collectibles, and more as tokens on Ethereum, NFTs introduced the concept of digital scarcity and ownership in a way consumers could grasp.

This movement even expanded to Bitcoin in 2023 with the advent of Ordinals inscriptions, a protocol allowing individual satoshis to be “inscribed” with data. Bitcoin, generally thought inhospitable to NFTs, saw its own version of NFTs emerge via Ordinals, treating tiny fractions of BTC as unique collectibles.

Together, NFTs on Ethereum and inscriptions on Bitcoin opened a new era of on-chain culture and speculative investment, creating what many saw as a new asset class of crypto collectibles.

Yet, as with past innovations, rapid hype cycles followed. The NFT market's story quickly became one of wild ups and downs, a mania of exuberant buying frenzies and celebrity endorsements, followed by a painful bust as reality set in. Bitcoin's Ordinals brought their own cycle of excitement and excess.

In this report, CryptoSlate will dive deep into that boom-bust trajectory: from the euphoric peak of NFT and inscription speculation, through the subsequent collapse in activity and value, to the current search for stability and meaning in the aftermath. We'll cover cultural moments (from viral digital art to political collectibles) and on-chain data (trading volumes, wallet stats, and more), reflecting what these cycles reveal about digital culture and financial speculation in the crypto industry.

A report by technical staff found NFT-based revenue generation was technically possible but impractical due to legal risks and high costs

North Korea conducted covert experiments from January through May in China to test whether it could generate foreign currency through NFTs based on its unique content.

A Daily NK source said recently that “several technical staff from the Korea Computer Center disguised themselves as trade representatives starting in late January, rented multiple locations in China, and experimented with earning foreign currency by selling NFT (Non-Fungible Token) works on NFT marketplaces.”

The source added that “the technical staff submitted their final report to North Korea on May 19 and have since withdrawn.”

The experiment was part of North Korea's efforts to secure new foreign currency revenue streams. The technical staff, divided into groups of two to three people, spent about five months in various Chinese cities accessing overseas networks to examine technical feasibility and profitability.

“North Korea was more interested in the marketplace platforms where NFTs are traded and structures that allow anonymous asset transfers than in NFTs themselves,” the source said. “They experimented with methods to conceal actual ownership through blockchain wallets and manage NFT assets and profits by registering under third-country corporate names.”

According to the source, the technical staff converted unique content such as Mount Kumgang landscape photos, Goryeo celadon images and internal maps of North Korean mines into digital NFTs. They attempted to register and sell these on Southeast Asian NFT marketplaces in Thailand and the Philippines, where identity verification requirements are less stringent.

The staff rented multiple locations under the names of a tourism and leisure company registered in Beijing and a real estate development company registered in Zhuzhou, Hunan province, where they conducted their experiments. After completing their final report on May 19, they withdrew, leaving behind no personnel or materials.

“The technical staff's final report included an explanation that ‘coins are digital currency operating on blockchain, while NFTs are digital assets or vouchers placed on top of that,'” the source said. “While technical feasibility was confirmed, they concluded there were institutional and practical limitations to generating profits.”

The report found that while NFT-based foreign currency generation was technically possible, various problems existed including legal risks in China, instability of Southeast Asian NFT marketplaces and high operating costs relative to profits, making it impractical as an immediate revenue source.

“While there were expectations within North Korea that this could become a new foreign currency acquisition method to evade sanctions, the technical staff determined it was inefficient,” the source said.

“This was just one experiment among various foreign currency strategies. While it's unlikely to be used as a practical revenue method in the near term, further research based on this five-month experiment and report is expected to continue.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","What is a stablecoin and what could it mean for your finances?","https://abcnews.go.com/Business/stablecoin-finances/story?id=122108448","Wed, 28 May 2025 10:14:18 GMT","

The crypto tokens could change everyday payments. But they pose risks.

The GENIUS Act, a cryptocurrency regulation bill making its way through the Senate, has thrust a little-known type of digital asset into the spotlight.

The industry-backed measure establishes rules targeting stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of another asset, often the U.S. dollar.

If enacted, the bill could allow such crypto coins to become a mainstream tool for digital payments and investments, proponents say. Critics warn that wider adoption of stablecoins may endanger consumers and the broader economy.

Here's what to know about stablecoins and how they could impact your finances:

Stablecoins are a type of digital currency backed by another form of currency, like the U.S. dollar or a commodity like gold.

Typically, the issuer of a stablecoin holds at least one unit of reserve currency for every stablecoin. A stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, for instance, is backed by a reserve of dollars that matches the number of coins.

Stablecoins are designed to be less volatile than other forms of cryptocurrency, which experience large price swings in part because digital assets lack inherent value.

Cryptocurrencies – including popular coins like bitcoin and ether – can be highly sensitive to news developments or investor behavior. In turn, such digital currencies pose difficulty for individuals trying to conduct a purchase or sale using digital assets.

""Most crypto assets have nothing behind them – they're literally annotations on a database or spreadsheet,"" Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who examines stablecoin policy, told ABC News. ""Stablecoins have reserve assets linked to the annotations in the database.""

As their name suggests, stablecoins ""evolved as a way of keeping a more stable price for crypto assets,"" Allen said.

For now, stablecoins function primarily as a tool for crypto investors, but wider adoption could pave the way for their use as a form of digital payment in everyday purchases, some experts said.

Stablecoins offer crypto investors a place to store their profits without converting the gains into fiat currency.

Once a crypto trader finds a new digital asset deemed worthy of investment, the stablecoins can be used to acquire that target cryptocurrency. When the trader wants out of the new investment, he or she can cash out for more stablecoins.

In other words, Allen said, stablecoins amount to a ""cash-management tool.""

Some stablecoins offer annual yields for investors, meaning the digital assets also function as liquid assets with stable upside akin to money-market mutual funds, some experts said.

In theory, both dollar-pegged stablecoins and money-market funds can be exchanged for a dollar at any time. That flexibility allows asset holders to earn small gains while retaining the capacity to sell off the asset at any time.

A potential integration of stablecoins into conventional finance could allow them to be used in a manner similar to app- or debit card-based payments, some experts said.

""You wouldn't need to physically transfer bills,"" said Steven Schwarz, a law professor at Duke University who studies stablecoins, who noted the crypto coins could have particular value for cross-border transactions.

""The holy grail would be to find a so-called 'global stablecoin' – one that everyone will accept internationally,"" Schwarz said.

Critics warn that stablecoins enable illicit transactions, lack consumer safeguards, and pose a threat to the wider financial system.

The fundamental consumer risk in holding a stablecoin stems from the possibility that an issuer will squander the reserve assets used to back the crypto tokens, some experts said.

""The risk is that you may go to the issuer of the stablecoin and say, 'Please redeem my stablecoin for the underlying reference assets,'"" Schwarz said. ""And the issuer may be unable to redeem the stablecoin.""

""The issuer may be in bankruptcy or failed to provide the assets in the first place,"" Schwarz added.

Wider adoption of stablecoins may coincide with participation by non-bank firms, which may result in assets that lack the protection of federal deposit insurance and the anti-fraud stipulations allowing users to redeem funds spent wrongfully or mistakenly, some experts said.

On a broad scale, such risky practices could pose a risk to the financial system, since asset holders could demand repayment from issuers unable to cover the reimbursements.

Such a scenario could trigger a government bailout or other public policy solution at the expense of taxpayers, Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University, told ABC News.

""These issuers could be in trouble during a crisis,"" Wilmarth said. ""It may require a massive bailout.""

Stablecoins, meanwhile, account for about 3 of every 5 illicit cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain data firm Chainalysis found in January.

""They're used for money laundering and sanctions evasion - that type of thing,"" Allen said.

Some critics say the risks posed by stablecoins are exemplified by conflict-of-interest concerns raised by President Donald Trump's dealings in the crypto tokens.

In March, Trump-backed crypto firm World Liberty Financial issued a stablecoin USD1. An Abu Dhabi-based investment firm earlier this month used the stablecoin to make a $2 billion investment in crypto exchange Binance, putting Trump's company in a position to profit from the deal. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

Updated on:  May 28, 2025 / 1:17 PM EDT
          / CBS News
        

Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday touted the Trump administration's ties with the cryptocurrency industry  — a once-fringe business that President Trump and his allies have embraced in recent months.

""I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House,"" Vance told the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas.

The Trump administration has leaned into cryptocurrency, looking to ease regulations, promote growth in the industry, and bring it into the mainstream. A longstanding backer of cryptocurrencies, Vance owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to an August 2024 financial disclosure.

""We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy, and are here to stay,"" Vance said Wednesday. 

Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with ""this level of energy,"" adding, ""but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins."" Vance gave few policy specifics in his speech. But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has ""transformed"" how Americans make transactions and acts as a ""hedge"" against bad policy. 

""Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control,"" he said. ""It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics."" 

Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar. 

""In this administration, we do not think that stablecoin's threatened the integrity of the United States dollar, quite the opposite,"" Vance said Wednesday. ""In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might."" 

Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to ""speak up"" and ""get involved,"" and he needs them to step up again. 

""Unless you guys get involved in politics, politics is going to ignore this industry,"" Vance said. ""... While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. None of us are. What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, it will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we don't make the right decisions. So the first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.""

The Las Vegas event is also featuring a handful of other Trump backers: His two eldest sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have invested in crypto ventures, are speaking Wednesday on a panel about ""the rise of new bitcoin business models."" Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist who serves as the White House's crypto czar, spoke on Tuesday.

Vance is the highest-ranking sitting politician to address the Bitcoin Conference, which describes itself as ""the world's largest gathering of bitcoiners"" and often draws crypto-friendly lawmakers. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year.

Vance headlined a fundraiser hosted by MAGA Inc. on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where tickets were priced at $1 million a head, CBS News has learned. The fundraiser was first reported by The Washington Post. 

Bitcoin — and cryptocurrency more generally — has grown in prominence and drawn allies from both parties, despite skepticism about its volatility. The price of Bitcoin, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has leaped nearly 60% in the last year.

Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin a ""scam"" whose value is ""based on thin air."" But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised to reverse strict Biden-era regulations.

Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced Tuesday it is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded ""meme coin"" earlier this year, and Mr. Trump hosted the digital currency's top investors at his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded a Bitcoin mining venture that's seeking to go public.

The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics experts who argue Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president. 

The GENIUS Act, the once-bipartisan Senate bill aimed at regulating stablecoins, bled support after Democratic lawmakers pushed for restrictions on elected officials buying or selling crypto — with some Democrats directly citing Mr. Trump's crypto investments. Senators ultimately voted to advance the bill earlier this month.

The White House has strongly denied any conflict-of-interest issues, saying Mr. Trump's assets are held in a trust managed by his children.

Block plans to launch bitcoin payments on its business technology platform Square, enabling merchants using the Square Point of Sale app to accept bitcoin payments directly through their Square hardware.

The company plans to begin rolling out this new, native Bitcoin For Businesses offering in the second half of the year and then extend it to all Square sellers in 2026, subject to regulatory approvals, it said in a Tuesday (May 27) press release.

“When a coffee shop or retail store can accept bitcoin through Square, small businesses get paid faster, and get to keep more of their revenue,” Block Bitcoin Product Lead Miles Suter said in the release. “This is about economic empowerment for merchants who like to have options when it comes to accepting payments.”

With Square's integration handling the complexity behind the scenes, and the Lightning Network enabling near-instant settlement, customers will be able to pay with bitcoin by scanning a QR code at checkout, according to the release.

Bitcoin For Businesses builds upon Square's Bitcoin Conversions features, which was launched in 2024 and allows qualified merchants to automatically convert a portion of their sales into bitcoin, the release said.

“We believe in an open, decentralized, fair, fast and low-cost money system for everyone, and that's exactly what we want to bring to Square sellers,” Suter said in the release.

When the Block ecosystems Square and Cash App began rolling out Bitcoin Conversions in April 2024, the company said the feature would enable Square sellers to participate in a digital global monetary system by giving them the option to allocate between 1% and 10% of their daily sales to be transferred to their personal Cash App account and converted into bitcoin at the end of each day.

“According to direct feedback from Square sellers, many are interested in bitcoin and believe it presents a wide range of use cases, such as long-term savings and diversifying their businesses' holdings,” Block said at the time in a press release.

Jack Dorsey, Block head, chairman and co-founder of Block, said during a November earnings call that the company is focused on making bitcoin more accessible and secure.

“We want to make it usable every day, by having an open protocol for payments on the internet,” Dorsey said at the time.

The headline-grabbing tale of an Italian man who said he was kidnapped and tortured for weeks inside an upscale Manhattan townhouse by captors seeking his bitcoin highlights a dark corner of the cryptocurrency world: the threat of violence by thieves seeking digital assets

The headline-grabbing tale of an Italian man who said he was kidnapped and tortured for weeks inside an upscale Manhattan townhouse by captors seeking his bitcoin highlights a dark corner of the cryptocurrency world: the threat of violence by thieves seeking digital assets.

The alleged attempted robbery is known as a “wrench attack.” It's a name popularized by an online comic that mocked how easily high-tech security can be undone by hitting someone with a wrench until they give up passwords.

Wrench attacks are on the rise thanks in part to cryptocurrency's move into mainstream finance, Phil Ariss of the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs said in a recent blog post .

“Criminal groups already comfortable with using violence to achieve their goals were always likely to migrate to crypto,” Ariss said.

Some of the crypto's key characteristics help explain why wealthy individuals who hold a lot of digital assets can be ripe targets for such attacks.

Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer traders full control of their funds without the need for a bank or permission from a government to buy, sell or hold it. The trade-off is that if funds are lost or stolen, there can be no way to get them back.

Self-reliance is a key ethos of crypto. Securing and controlling one's private keys, which are like passwords used to access one's crypto holdings, is viewed as sacrosanct among many in the crypto community. A popular motto is “not your keys, not your coins.”

Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don't need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.

In the case in New York, where two people have been charged, a lot of details have yet to come out, including the value of the bitcoin the victim possessed.

Stealing cryptocurrency is almost as old as cryptocurrency itself, but it's usually done by hacking. North Korean state hackers alone are believed to have stolen billions of dollars' worth of crypto in recent years.

In response to the threat of hacking, holders of a large amount of crypto often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called “cold wallets.” Used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.

But they can't defeat thieves who force a victim to give up their password to access their wallets and move money.

The case in New York is the latest in a string of high-profile wrench attacks. Several have taken place in France, where thieves cut off a crypto executive's finger.

Experts suggest several ways to mitigate the threats of wrench attacks, including using wallets that require multiple approvals before any transactions.

Perhaps the most common way crypto-wealthy individuals try to prevent wrench attacks is by trying to stay anonymous. Using nicknames and cartoon avatars in social media accounts is common in the crypto community, even among top executives at popular companies.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}","cryptocurrency"

The Trump Media and Technology Group has announced that it is now raising $2.5 billion for its plans to buy cryptocurrency, investing heavily in the top crypto in the market, Bitcoin.

The company revealed that it will create a ""Bitcoin Treasury"" for them, and it will help diversify their revenue and assets, as well as serve as their massive holdings amidst the rising token prices.

It is known that the Trump Media and Technology Group's majority owner, President Donald Trump, has pushed for the United States' adoption of Bitcoin, offering a boost to the crypto industry earlier this year.

In the latest press release by the Trump Media and Technology Group, the company has confirmed that it is raising $2.5 billion for its future endeavors of buying cryptocurrency for its assets. This will be offered in a private placement offering, and it will comprise approximately $1.5 billion in Trump Media common stock, as well as $1 billion in convertible debt to 50 investors.

The news behind this massive investment came after the dinner for the largest investors of the $TRUMP meme coin, with the Financial Times first reporting that the company is planning to raise $3 billion.

According to Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, this move is a ""big step forward"" towards the company's plans to acquire ""crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles.""

Trump Media believes that Bitcoin is the ""apex instrument of financial freedom,"" with their main focus centering on creating a ""Bitcoin treasury"" for the company.

The top coin would be held on Trump Media's balance sheet, and it will join the existing cash and short-term investments that total $759 million as of the end of the first quarter. Anchorage Digital and Crypto.com would be in charge of holding the Bitcoin for Trump Media.

The release claimed that this massive investment would help the company against ""harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.""

Back when Donald Trump was campaigning, he tapped into the crypto market for massive support as he expressed that he plans to lobby for wider adoption and regulation in the country. When he won, crypto prices surged exponentially, with Bitcoin achieving a $100,000 valuation, which it lost along the way. However, it slowly climbed back to it again amidst Trump's inauguration.

While crypto's significant growth did not hold steadily, there have been several surges that brought back life and power to its valuation, and this is because of the previous promises of President Trump slowly unfolding.

Last March, Trump unveiled the crypto strategic reserve for the United States, with the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and more to be part of the country's digital assets.

During the past months, Trump made significant moves for the cryptocurrency industry, including pardoning Silk Road's creator, easing down on regulatory scrutiny for companies, and incorporating digital tokens among programs and services.

That being said, Trump's World Liberty Financial (WLF) also launched a meme coin called $TRUMP for people to invest in and trade.

            Trump Media & Technology Group's crypto partners in the new venture are also lobbying Congress to pass major industry-friendly legislation now being advanced.
          

Trump Media & Technology Group has inked deals to raise $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin, the social media company announced today, as the Trump administration rolls out pro-crypto policies that stand to profit Trump family companies.

Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) dealt shares to around 50 large institutional investors, who were unnamed, with plans to form what it calls a “Bitcoin treasury.” President Donald Trump owns just over half the company's stock. In March, Trump made official an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin and digital assets reserve. Many in the crypto industry are hoping that the imprimatur of creating a U.S. stockpile of digital assets will spur wider institutional investment in crypto and prompt other countries to invest in Bitcoin.

Cantor Fitzgerald, the family-run investment firm of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, last month announced a merger to form a new Bitcoin holding company, an entity valued at $3.6 billion. The firm has been deepening its Bitcoin investments this year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure.

This month in the U.S. House, major crypto industry-championed legislation is moving. The legislation revises the bill, titled FIT21 in the previous Congress and passed in the Republican-led chamber, that would hand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) much oversight responsibility for crypto trading. Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, won his position as a prominent crypto cheerleader and is developing the bill for what he called “much-needed regulatory clarity.”

Cantor Fitzgerald increased its investment in the Bitcoin company Strategy, whose executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has been the leading industry cheerleader for creating a national Bitcoin reserve.

The stablecoin legislation failed to clear today's cloture vote, 48-49, but Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego says he'll press ahead with negotiations.

Bergen County, New Jersey is turning to the Avalanche AVAX$23.26 network to put its entire property record system on blockchain, claiming to be the largest property deed tokenization project in the U.S.

Under a five-year agreement with land record blockchain firm Balcony, the well-to-do county across the Hudson River from New York city will migrate 370,000 property deeds — representing about $240 billion worth of real estate — onto an immutable, searchable blockchain ledger, according to a press release. The system, powered by Avalanche, will serve nearly a million residents across 70 municipalities.

""This initiative is about improving the lives of our residents,"" said John Hogan, County Clerk of Bergen. ""By digitizing property records, we are making the process simpler, faster, and more secure for homeowners, businesses, and future generations.""

The move aligns with a broader trend of using blockchain rails for moving and recording ownership of assets like bonds, funds and real estate — a process also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). The tokenized asset market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, with real estate amounting to a significant share, a recent report by Boston Consulting Group and Ripple projected. Most recently, the Dubai Land Department debuted a real estate tokenization platform built on the XRP Ledger XRP$2.26 network as part of its strategy to bring 7% of all real estate transactions, worth roughly $16 billion, to blockchain rails.

Balcony, which has already introduced similar systems in several counties across New Jersey, claims that its blockchain-based platform can cut deed processing time by 90% while addressing risks like fraud and record discrepancies. It can boost municipal revenue, too: the platform detected almost $1 million in lost municipal revenue in Orange, NJ, previously hidden due to incomplete or outdated property records, the company said.

""Blockchain is continuing to solve complex, real-world problems,"" said Luigi D'Onorio DeMeo, chief strategy officer of ecosystem development organization Ava Labs. ""[Avalanche's] infrastructure is built to handle large amounts of data quickly and securely, which is exactly what's needed to modernize how property records are managed and transform how public institutions operate.""

Last year, California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) digitized 42 million of car titles on Avalanche to modernize the state's title transfer process with software development firm Oxhead Alpha.

The futures and options market, a proxy for big money, is increasingly backing ether ETH$2,651.96 over bitcoin BTC$107,608.89 in a major market shift.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently reached record highs of over $ 110,000. According to CoinDesk data, the cryptocurrency has gained over 16% this year, drawing strength from the macroeconomic factors and persistent inflows into the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds.

Meanwhile, ether has dropped 20% this year despite its parent blockchain, Ethereum, maintaining its pole position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenization markets. 

The performance gap, however, may be closed in the near term as the following indicator shows a growing bullish bias for ether.

Options listed on Deribit show a stronger bullish positioning for ether relative to bitcoin.

Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and represents a bullish bet on the market, while a put option provides protection against price drops.

As of writing, both BTC and ETH's 25-delta risk reversals, a measure of sentiment derived by examining the difference in implied volatility (demand) between calls and puts, were positive, reflecting a bias towards call options.

However, ETH risk reversals were more expensive than BTC. In other words, traders were relatively more bullish on ether compared to bitcoin.

The notional open interest in CME bitcoin futures, which represents the dollar value of the number of active contracts, has risen by roughly 70% to over $17 billion since the early April crash, according to data source Velo.

The growth, however, has stalled above $17 billion over the past seven days. The CME is considered a proxy for institutional activity.

Meanwhile, ether's open interest has jumped 186% to $3.15 billion since the early April crash. The growth has accelerated over the past two weeks.

The diverging trends show institutions are increasingly leaning toward ether.

The bias for ETH is also evident from the relative richness of premiums in ether futures.

As of the time of writing, one-month Ether futures boasted an annualized premium of 10.5%, the highest since January, according to Velo. Meanwhile, bitcoin futures premium was 8.74%.

Elevated premiums indicate optimism and strong buying interest, often signaling a bullish trend. Therefore, the relative richness of ether futures premium suggests traders are more bullish on ETH compared to BTC. After all, ether is still 84% short of record highs reached during the 2021 bull run.

There is also a possibility that the BTC's basis may have been held lower by cash and carry arbitrage (non-directional) traders.

A similar divergence is observed on offshore exchanges, where annualized funding rates, representing the cost of holding long positions in ETH perpetual futures, has neared the 8% mark. Meanwhile, BTC's funding rates hold below 5%.

Video game retailer GameStop (GME) has purchased 4,710 bitcoin, worth nearly $513 million at the time of writing.

GameStop announced the purchase on X on Wednesday but did not offer further details about when the BTC were acquired or the price paid. 

The Grapevine, Texas-based company revealed its plans to pursue a bitcoin treasury strategy in March, offering $1.3 billion in debt to raise the funds for BTC acquisition.

The shares of GME rose as much as 6.6% in U.S. pre-market trading on the news, but the stock promptly dumped in early trading, falling around 10% to about $31.50. With GameStop's BTC purchase rumored to be imminent for several weeks, the GME slide may be a ""sell the news"" event. 

The selloff may haver been exacerbated by a dip in BTC's price which fell from around $109,000 to around $107,300 during the ET morning. 

UPDATE (May 28, 15:25 UTC): Adds additional info and context on GME's price movement.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally initiated a review of the WisdomTree XRP Trust, a proposed spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would provide investors with exposure to XRP XRP$2.26.

Filed by the Cboe BZX Exchange, the application marks the first formal SEC review of a U.S.-based spot XRP ETF. If approved, it would be the first spot XRP ETF in the U.S. — a milestone that could open the door for similar products across other crypto assets.

The product would track XRP's market price via the CME CF Ripple-Dollar Reference Rate, allowing investors to gain XRP exposure through traditional brokerage accounts, bypassing the need for private keys or self-custody.

The SEC published its notice under Release No. 34-103124, initiating a more thorough evaluation of the application. The Commission now has up to 240 days to approve or reject the filing. 

In the meantime, the agency is soliciting public comments on whether the ETF's design adequately addresses concerns related to market manipulation and investor protection.

Meanwhile, in a letter submitted to the SEC's crypto taskforce this week, Ripple's Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, reiterated that XRP should not be treated as a security in and of itself.

Today, @Ripple submitted an additional letter to the SEC's Crypto Task Force addressing a key question from Commissioner Peirce's “New Paradigm” speech: When does a digital asset separate from an investment contract? We appreciate the continued engagement with the Task Force.…

""Rules must be clear not just for issuers, but for all market participants who could be unwittingly classified as securities exchanges, brokers, dealers, or issuers,"" Alderoty wrote, adding that overreliance on vague terms like “fully functional” or “decentralized” creates more regulatory confusion than clarity.

 GameStop's 4,710 Bitcoin purchase is the company's first since it disclosed plans in March to move into alternative investments. 

GameStop, the US video game and consumer electronics retailer, has confirmed its first Bitcoin investment, acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin, according to a statement posted May 28 on the company's X account.

The company did not specify how much it paid for the Bitcoin (BTC) or when the purchases were made in the announcement, while its Form 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also offers little detail. The amount purchased was worth around $513 million at the time of writing.

The announced acquisition is GameStop's first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March.

At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.

The news comes after months of speculation that GameStop was exploring alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies.

GameStop (GME) stock shares have climbed amid the speculation, jumping 12% in March. February rumors helped fuel an 18% spike in GME stock prices.

According to TradingView, GameStop shares closed at $35 on May 27 and were trading at $36.30 in the pre-market at the time of publication. The stock is up around 30% in the past 30 days, with year-to-date gains of about 10%.

Cointelegraph contacted GameStop for comment regarding its Bitcoin purchase but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

GameStop's Bitcoin investment is the latest in a trend among companies purchasing the world's largest cryptocurrency following the lead of Michael Saylor's Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which made its first BTC acquisition in August 2020.

Companies such as Japan's Metaplanet and Brazil's Meliuz have beefed up their Bitcoin holdings this year after adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies as well.

On May 27, Trump Media and Technology Group, the company that owns US President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform, confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin after previously denying reports of the deal.

 Ripple argued in a letter to the SEC that fungible cryptocurrencies are not securities in secondary transactions. 

Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP, argued that fungible cryptocurrencies are not securities when transferred in secondary transactions in a recent letter sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

In its May 27 letter, Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:

“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts' to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities' when transferred in secondary transactions.”

In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”

Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she'd been voicing her dissent with the regulator's approach to crypto, adding:

Peirce said that the SEC's “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:

The SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator's former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.

The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government's stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.

In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple's historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Bitcoin price will reach $130K or even $1.5M, top bulls say","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-top-bulls","Wed, 28 May 2025 13:39:22 GMT","

 From institutional inflows to the rising stablecoin economy, the top Bitcoin bulls of 2025 are calling for prices as high as $1.5 million. Do they know something we don't? 

Top Bitcoin (BTC) bulls in 2025 have updated their price forecasts, and they range from a relatively cautious $130,000 to seven-figure moonshots.

Familiar doubters like gold bug Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini continue to predict a catastrophic ending for the world's largest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spent the year with record-breaking rallies behind renewed institutional uptake.

It set a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 and has been trading near that level since, teasing investors with the possibility of a new ceiling.

Here are some of the boldest Bitcoin price predictions from the first half of 2025 (so far).

Blockstream CEO Adam Back said in November that Bitcoin could break $1 million “this cycle” if the US follows through with plans to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. In March, the White House did just that, though it has yet to be codified into law by Congress. 

The Bitcoin Reserve Act treats the world's first blockchain-based cryptocurrency as a digital gold-style reserve asset, using coins seized from criminal cases.

US states have started laying the groundwork. New Hampshire broke the ice on May 6 by signing a Bitcoin reserve bill into law. Later in the month, Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, backed by Governor Greg Abbott.

Speaking with Cointelegraph Magazine, Back gave a 2025 price target of “a few hundred thousand” dollars, citing renewed retail demand once roughly $16 billion in FTX bankruptcy repayments re-enter the market. He added that he is confident many of those investors will cycle back into the crypto market to fuel the next big rally.

Several analysts have set $200,000 as their target for Bitcoin in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices.

Kendrick said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins.

“The US Senate… voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act,” Kendrick wrote in the email note. “The point of the stablecoin Act is that stablecoins will further legitimise the whole asset class. All boats will rise.”

During a recent Chain Reaction X Spaces show hosted by Cointelegraph, other analysts weighed in with their 2025 outlooks. André Dragosch, head of European research at Bitwise, agreed with Kendrick's $200,000 year-end target. Markus Thielen added that Bitcoin has historically moved in $16,000 price increments, placing its next key resistance around $122,000.

Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and former White House communications director, also recently set his year-end target at $200,000 in a media interview.

Former Goldman Sachs partner and Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz remains one of the most prominent Bitcoin bulls in finance.

Novogratz built a personal fortune through early investments in Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), though he also famously backed the failed algorithmic stablecoin project that led to the multibillion-dollar collapse of the Terra ecosystem.

Following Galaxy Digital's recent public listing, Novogratz appeared on CNBC to share his latest Bitcoin outlook. Compared to other bullish forecasts, he offered a relatively modest target ranging from $130,000 to $150,000, citing strong institutional flows, a weaker dollar and growing demand for digital assets as key drivers.

“We had a euphoric top right around the inauguration,” Novogratz said. “Now, it looks like we'll take out [$106,000-$108,000] and make the next flight to [$130,000-$150,000] and at that point you're in price discovery.”

Cathie Wood, CEO and chief investment officer of ARK Invest, set her bull case forecast for Bitcoin at $1.5 million by 2030, which would require a compound annual growth rate of 58% over the next five years. 

In a YouTube video published in February, she cited rising institutional interest as the key driver. Wood and ARK Invest are known for placing high-conviction bets on disruptive technologies, including early investments in Tesla and Bitcoin.

Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, gave another seven-figure call, but over a longer timeline than Wood.

In an April 18 X post, he said that Bitcoin will have broken $1 million by 2035, alongside gold at $30,000 and silver at $3,000 per coin.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said Bitcoin could soar to $250,000 in 2025 if the US Federal Reserve resumes quantitative easing (QE). 

Writing in April, Hayes argued that Bitcoin is driven by expectations of fiat supply growth, and the Fed's shift from quantitative tightening (QT) to easing would trigger a major rally.

“If my analysis of the Fed's major pivot from QT to QE for treasuries is correct, then Bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end,” he wrote.

Metrics details

RNA replication is considered a key process in the origins of life. However, both enzymatic and non-enzymatic RNA replication cycles are impeded by the ‘strand separation problem', a form of product inhibition arising from the extraordinary stability of RNA duplexes and their rapid reannealing kinetics. Here we show that RNA trinucleotide triphosphates can overcome this problem by binding to and kinetically trapping dissociated RNA strands in a single-stranded form, while simultaneously serving as substrates for replication by an RNA polymerase ribozyme. When combined with coupled pH and freeze–thaw cycles, this enabled exponential replication of both (+) and (−) strands of double-stranded RNAs, including a fragment of the ribozyme itself. Subjecting random RNA sequence pools to open-ended replication yielded either defined replicating RNA sequences or the gradual emergence of diverse sequence pools. The latter derived from partial ribozyme self-replication alongside generation of new RNA sequences, and their composition drifted towards hypothesized primordial codons. These results unlock broader opportunities to model primordial RNA replication.

Life on Earth relies on the faithful copying of its genetic material—replication—to enable heredity and evolution. This process is thought to have begun with the templated polymerization of activated mono- or oligonucleotide building blocks by chemical replication processes1,2,3 and later by RNA-catalysed RNA replication4,5,6,7. In its simplest form, RNA replication comprises the copying of (+) and (−) strands into complementary (−) and (+) daughter strands. For replication to proceed further, the double-stranded RNA replication products (duplexes) must again be dissociated into single-stranded RNAs, and these must be copied before they reanneal (Fig. 1a).

However, RNA duplexes of functional lengths and concentrations (for example >25 nucleotides (nt), 100 nM) behave as essentially inert, ‘dead-end' products due to their remarkable stability (with melting temperatures approaching the boiling point of water)8. Furthermore, even when dissociated into individual, single-stranded RNAs, such strands reanneal on timescales (seconds to minutes) that are shorter than the typical time needed for copying reactions (hours to days) either by non-enzymatic processes or by polymerase ribozymes1. Thus, RNA replication cycles under standard conditions are both kinetically and thermodynamically disfavoured (Fig. 1a).

This so-called ‘strand separation problem'1 is aggravated by the comparative chemical instability of RNA. This precludes duplex dissociation under harsh conditions. High temperatures degrade RNA templates and ribozyme catalysts, particularly in the presence of divalent cations such as Mg2+ (which boost ribozyme activity but accelerate RNA fragmentation by transesterification)9. Furthermore, the strand separation problem worsens with increasing lengths of RNA duplexes, which become progressively harder to dissociate, more vulnerable to degradation and more prone to reannealing.

A range of different approaches have been tried to overcome this fundamental barrier to open-ended RNA replication. Acidic pH can protonate the N1 of adenine and N3 of cytosine, disrupting base-pairing and destabilizing RNA duplexes10. Coupled with wet/dry cycles or ionic gradients in a thermophoretic setting, this has been shown to promote duplex melting and RNA assembly, and enable nucleic acid amplification by proteinaceous enzymes11,12,13,14. Furthermore, highly viscous solvents can slow RNA reannealing sufficiently for long (32 nt) substrates to be ligated15,16. Alternatively, strand-displacement syntheses can circumvent full duplex dissociation by the progressive addition of ‘invader' oligonucleotides complementary to the non-templating strand17, or by the buildup of conformational strain on circular RNA templates18. Nevertheless, the scope of RNA-catalysed RNA replication cycles has been limited to polymerization of mononucleotides on primers flanking a 4-nt region assisted by denaturants19, or the templated ligation of up to three polynucleotide substrate segments14,20. However, general RNA replication and open-ended evolution requires the replication of longer sequences (able to encode a phenotype) via the polymerization of building blocks short enough to allow free sequence variation.

In this Article we describe an approach that unlocks both the replication of longer RNA sequences and enables free sequence variation in replicating RNA pools. Our approach leverages an unexpected capacity of trinucleotide triphosphate (triplet) substrates to stabilize dissociated RNA strands. This can be coupled to cycles of pH, temperature and concentration to drive open-ended RNA replication by a polymerase ribozyme that utilises triplet substrates.

We explored RNA replication catalysed by the 5TU/t1 polymerase ribozyme (henceforth triplet polymerase ribozyme / TPR). This is an artificial heterodimeric ribozyme21 that has been evolved in vitro to copy RNA template sequences using trinucleotide triphosphates (triplets) as substrates4 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). As shown previously, RNA-templated RNA synthesis by the TPR is preferentially carried out within the eutectic phase of water–ice at −7 °C, helped by the high ionic and RNA substrate concentrations and reduced water activity therein22. Under these conditions, triplet substrates display remarkable properties such as cooperative invasion of template RNA secondary structures, enabling copying of even highly structured RNA templates by the TPR4.

We initially hypothesized that this ability of triplets to invade and unravel template secondary structures might be leveraged to invade and replicate otherwise inert RNA duplexes. To test this we assembled a model 30-nt GC-rich RNA duplex AD (Fig. 1b; predicted Tm = 99 °C)8 and incubated it together with its constitutive triplet substrates and TPR. However, although the TPR readily synthesized full-length products on the duplex's individual RNA (+) and (−) strands (A+ and A−), the AD RNA duplex itself remained inert (Fig. 1c), indicating that RNA duplex dissociation might be required.

Using a fluorescence-quench assay, we found that temperatures over 90 °C were required to dissociate a mixed-sequence 30-nt RNA duplex (Rγ1D) into constituent strands (Extended Data Fig. 2). In the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ ions (needed for ribozyme catalysis), even higher temperatures approaching the boiling point of water were required. Exposure to such temperatures in the presence of Mg2+ would cause rapid fragmentation of longer RNA strands, including the TPR catalyst. We thus explored alternative approaches to destabilize the RNA duplexes.

Mildly acidic pH had previously been shown to destabilize short RNA duplexes and is not destructive to RNA10, which—unlike DNA—does not suffer depurination at low pH. However, we found that (at ambient temperatures) AD duplex dissociation of >50% still required low pH (pH ≤ 3, or pH ≤ 2.5 with added 20 mM MgCl2; Supplementary Fig. 1). Although incompatible with polymerase ribozyme activity (pHopt ≈ 8.8), we tested if acid-induced RNA duplex dissociation could be leveraged for copying of the AD duplex after neutralization. We therefore performed (1) acid denaturation of the AD duplex, followed by (2) neutralization and concurrent addition of TPR, primer and triplet substrates, and (3) freezing and TPR-catalysed polymerization at −7 °C. This yielded full-length synthesis of both A+ and A− constituent strands starting from AD duplex template (at 30–40% of the yields compared to individual single-stranded A+ or A− strands as templates; Fig. 1c).

We next investigated the kinetics of RNA duplex reannealing and replication in such reactions, by progressively delaying ribozyme addition after the neutralization step. To our surprise, extension on a pre-denatured duplex was maintained even when ribozyme was added up to six days post-neutralization (Fig. 1d). However, if triplet addition was also delayed, subsequent extension was rapidly reduced (kobs ~ 0.7 µM−1 min−1; Fig. 1d), presumably due to rapid reannealing of the two dissociated A+ and A− RNA strands.

We hypothesized that dissociated RNA strands become kinetically trapped in a single-stranded state when partially (or fully) hybridized to complementary triplets, which robustly attenuate strand reannealing, providing a time window for RNA polymerization (Fig. 1e). Consistent with this hypothesis, even partial triplet occupancy was sufficient to attenuate reannealing: the addition of triplets complementary to just one of the strands (A+ or A−) slowed reannealing by ~200-fold (Fig. 1d), and addition of complementary triplets to both strands effectively stopped the second-order reannealing process and maintained strands in a dissociated state for more than 300 h. A further prediction of this scenario is that such ‘substrate-assisted replication' would be contingent on the nature of the triplet substrates. Indeed, we found that AU-rich triplets on 40% GC templates are unable to compete effectively with strand reannealing, and templates of balanced (50% GC) composition lead to a mix of reannealing and extension (Extended Data Fig. 3). In contrast, on GC-rich templates (such as A+, A−), inhibition of intermolecular annealing is effective at low (almost stoichiometric) triplet concentrations (~2.5 µM per triplet; Supplementary Fig. 2)—even below the triplet concentrations needed for cooperative invasion of intramolecular template RNA secondary structures such as hairpins (>12 µM per triplet)4. This effect is specific to the triplet substrates; an RNA polymerase ribozyme even with high concentrations of mononucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrates23 (5 mM of each NTP in the eutectic phase) exhibited only negligible extension on a pre-denatured duplex (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Our data are consistent with a dual role of triplets, both as RNA chaperones keeping complementary strands from reannealing—progressively ‘coating' RNA strands via specific hybridization and cooperative triplet–triplet stacking interactions—and as substrates for RNA replication. These ratchet-like processes progressively stabilize the template dissociated state until a full complementary strand is synthesized. This model is supported (and potentially enhanced) by the capacity of the TPR to initiate templated ‘primer-free' RNA synthesis internally from adjacent triplets at multiple sites along the template (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4). By blocking strand reannealing and creating a long-lived substrate:template complex, triplets decouple RNA polymerization from both the kinetics and thermodynamics of RNA duplex dissociation and reannealing (Fig. 1e).

Having discovered an effective strategy to overcome the strand separation problem, we sought to integrate triplet-assisted strand separation and triplet-based RNA synthesis into a full RNA replication cycle. However, the preferred conditions required for strand separation and RNA synthesis are diametrically opposed. Effective RNA duplex denaturation requires low pH and elevated temperatures to weaken base-pairing interactions, together with low Mg2+ concentrations ([Mg2+]) to reduce duplex stability and minimize RNA hydrolysis, and low RNA strand concentrations to slow down reannealing. In contrast, optimal RNA synthesis requires a mildly basic pH, high [Mg2+], high ribozyme and triplet substrate concentrations ([RNA]) and ambient to low temperatures. Furthermore, incubation of RNA at acidic pH in the presence of the high [Mg2+] needed for optimal ribozyme activity (>60 mM) leads to precipitation and inactivation of long RNAs—an effect exploited in the trichloroacetic acid precipitation of nucleic acids. A replication cycle would therefore require opposing shifts in pH, temperature and solute concentrations ([Mg2+], [RNA]) (Fig. 2a).

a, Schematic of conflicting conditions required for RNA strand separation (left) and triplet polymerization (right). b, Physicochemical cycling workflow that integrates strand separation and polymerization conditions. pH switching results in a build-up of KCl, and serial dilution allows continued cycling by resetting KCl concentrations and restoring ribozyme and triplet substrate levels. c, Iterative replication of the model RNA duplex AD and its constituent strands in replication buffer (4 nM template, substrates and primers from Fig. 1b). Also shown (for comparison) are a single-cycle eight-day polymerization reaction (1 × 8 days), and four-cycle reactions undergoing twofold dilution (4 ÷ 2) followed by an extra cycle (5). Full-length primer extension yields are expressed as percentages relative to the starting template. To compare efficiencies in the diluted 4 ÷ 2 and five cycle reactions, their yields should be doubled (×2).

Source data

To reconcile these conflicting requirements, we first defined milder, more dilute denaturing conditions (pH 3.6, 80 °C, low [Mg2+] and [RNA]) that efficiently separate even GC-rich RNA duplexes (Extended Data Fig. 2) while avoiding RNA degradation. To access synthesis conditions after neutralization, we noted that freezing can drive a more than 200-fold concentration of solutes and reduction of water activity within the eutectic brine phase while supporting polymerase ribozyme activity22. We thereby established a coupled pH/freeze–thaw replication cycling regime (Fig. 2b,c), which shifts between denaturing conditions that efficiently dissociate RNA duplexes and extension conditions that yield near-full TPR activity (Supplementary Fig. 5).

When applied to individual A− or A+ template strands, a single cycle achieved per-strand yields of 39% or 53%, and a second cycle nearly doubled these yields (52% or 111%; Fig. 2c). This second cycle was also accompanied by full-length extension of primers associated with the starting strands (yields of 12% (A−) and 16% (A+)). This indicates that in cycle 2, the product strands of cycle 1 are used as templates, providing a foundation for exponential RNA amplification.

To test this, we initiated repeated cycles of pH/freeze–thaw replication starting from the duplex RNA AD and observed simultaneous production of both full-length A− and A+ synthesis products. After four cycles, the product yields reached approximately two A− strands (207%) and one A+ strand (104%) per starting AD duplex (Fig. 2c), while only ~0.5 strands of each was produced per duplex in a single long cycle with equivalent total reaction time. During this long incubation, the products were also elongated beyond full length, indicative of a TPR-catalysed terminal transferase activity, probably through blunt-ended ligation of the GC-rich triplet:triplet dimers (Extended Data Fig. 5) that were previously inferred to form in ice4.

The timescale and steepness of the concentration and temperature and pH gradients during these shifts impact the synthetic yields of RNA replication. For example, flash-freezing gives the highest RNA yields as it minimizes the amount of strand reannealing between the neutralization step and freezing (when triplets become sufficiently concentrated to attenuate reannealing). Nevertheless, even slow cooling supports efficient RNA replication, but reannealing begins at lower RNA duplex concentrations in the eutectic phase (4 µM and 1 µM, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 6). Effective replication cycles can also proceed across a range of temperature and pH conditions, using smaller temperature shifts (to 50 °C or even 37 °C), but require a lower pH (Extended Data Fig. 2).

In our pH/freeze–thaw cycling scheme, HCl and KOH addition drives the pH changes. This results in a buildup of K+ (and Cl−) ions, eventually inhibiting polymerization (Supplementary Fig. 6). We therefore imposed a serial, twofold dilution regime (into fresh reaction mix containing ribozyme and substrates, but lacking template and KCl) every fourth cycle to reset the ionic strength (Fig. 2b). Continuing AD replication under this regime for 21 cycles yielded diminishing returns in A+ and A− yields, probably due to TPR/product degradation and the low yield of A+ strands (Extended Data Fig. 7). Despite this, we observed overall strand amplifications of ninefold (A+) and 31-fold (A−) after accounting for the iterative reaction dilution.

To better assess the potential of this cycling protocol in an open-ended context, we initiated RNA replication from a random-sequence template (N17) flanked by defined primer binding sites (Fig. 3a) and provided all 64 triplet substrates (pppNNN). We hypothesized that if RNA replication were sustained, we would initially observe drift, then persistence and amplification of those RNA sequences that can both be synthesized and copied efficiently by the TPR. In early cycles, we observed a ladder of triplet-register extension products corresponding to the expected library size (6 × pppNNN triplet incorporations + a terminal pentamer (pppGUAGC) adding a primer binding site; Fig. 3b). As cycling progressed (up to 40 cycles), the full-length product progressively faded, and a new, second series of shorter products emerged, identifiable by their altered register of migration. These persisted and increased up to 30-fold in abundance. Accounting for the >2,000-fold effective dilution over the course of the experiment, these emergent +8-, +11- and +14-nt product classes have undergone an up to 60,000-fold amplification, with apparent exponents of 1.37-, 1.3- and 1.27-fold per cycle, respectively (Fig. 3c). They probably arose from early incorporation of the terminal pentanucleotide substrate on some library templates, providing a reciprocal primer binding site, and supporting higher yielding synthesis of the shorter amplicons—a well-known phenomenon in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-style primed amplifications24.

a, Design of replication substrates and scheme for iterative replication of an N17 RNA random-sequence library.

Source data

To better understand the sequences that are synthesized and copied efficiently in our replication reactions, we sequenced +8-, +11- and +14-nt product pools (Supplementary Table 1). Although no clear sequence consensus was found to dominate the pools, many sequences comprise triplets exhibiting a (G/C, G/C, N) compositional pattern (compatible with reciprocal replication due to the register shift; Fig. 3a). We tested replication of a common emergent sequence of each length. These showed escalating synthesis of both product strands during replication cycling (Fig. 3d). The (+) and (−) strands of the +14-nt sequence exhibited a four-cycle exponential growth phase (1.2- and 1.38-fold per cycle) before plateauing at 3.5- and 7-fold amplification from the starting duplex (Fig. 3e). This confirms that pH/freeze–thaw cycling lets the TPR exponentially replicate RNA sequences, with open-ended cycling driving the evolution of replicable RNAs from libraries.

Having previously shown that the TPR can synthesize segments of both its (+) and (−) strands4, we asked if replication could be extended to parts of the TPR's own sequence. A potential pitfall in this context is the potential for invasion and self-inhibition of the (+)-strand TPR by complementary (−)-strand TPR sequence segments following denaturation during cycling. We tested this using a 29-nt fragment of the ribozyme catalytic core previously designated the γ fragment4 (Fig. 4a). After one replication cycle on the γD duplex, we obtained both full-length γ+ and γ− product strands, and after two cycles we saw evidence of replication of both individual γ+/γ− and duplex γD templates (Fig. 4b), with the products being used again as templates in a second cycle, as observed for AD (Fig. 2c). We observed no self-inhibition, presumably because the TPR tertiary structure either does not unfold under our denaturation conditions, or refolding is faster than complementary strand invasion. During iterative cycles of γD partial self-replication, full-length product levels increased steeply in early cycles, reaching micromolar concentrations in the eutectic phase (Fig. 4c) and exhibiting up to 1.26-fold amplification per cycle (Extended Data Fig. 8). The TPR itself is active at micromolar concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 1), indicating that our cycling protocol could support production of a ribozyme at the concentrations needed for activity.

Right, sequences of the γD duplex and its constituent strands γ+ and γ−, shown with primer and triplet substrates. b, γ+ and γ− synthesis during replication of single strands and duplex. The triplets (0.2 µM each) and primers (0.1 µM each) shown in a were polymerized by the TPR (20 nM) on the indicated templates (2 nM each) in replication buffer across one or two denaturing acid cycles (polymerization: 24 h at −7 °C). Per-template yields of primer reaching full length are shown; two cycles yielded more product than a single cycle with equivalent total incubation time in ice (1 × 2 days). c, Iterative replication cycling of reactions (set-up as in b, with 0.6 mM starting KCl) with no template or 4 nM γD duplex (concentrated to ~1.8 µM in the eutectic phase). The eutectic phase concentrations of products reaching full-length were inferred from gel densitometry. Averages are shown of three independent reactions (transparent data points) set up for each cycle number. γ+ from γD template, filled red circles; γ− from γD template, open blue circles; γ+ or γ− products from no γD template, red/blue dashed crosses.

Unexpectedly, we also observed the synthesis of γ+ and γ− product strands in an unseeded (no template) negative control reaction (Fig. 4c). Even after a single cycle, both unseeded or exclusively γ−-seeded reactions yielded γ− products (whereas γ+-seeded reactions showed no γ+ synthesis; Fig. 4b). We hypothesized that the γ+ segment within the TPR itself might be acting as a template, but at low efficiency compared to exogenously added γ+ template. Indeed, after 50% degradation of the TPR (by heating at pH 9.0 with Mg2+ before replication cycling), we observed a greater buildup of γ+ and γ− synthesis products after five cycles, and more γ− extension products after a single cycle (Extended Data Fig. 8). This suggests that degraded TPR fragments can act as replication templates, boosting product yields despite the lower amount of active TPR catalyst available for RNA replication.

Sequencing the products of γD-seeded reactions confirmed the replication of accurate γ+ sequences alongside a number of partially homologous sequences probably derived from incomplete extension products undergoing recombination, and even some unanticipated products complementary to the TPR t1 subunit (Extended Data Fig. 8). Weighting the sequence data by reaction yield provided estimates of the production rates of different sequence classes, establishing that the production rate of accurate γ+ products increased almost 50% from cycles 1–5 of γD-seeded replication, with a replication yield of 130% accurate γ+ strands after five cycles (Supplementary Fig. 7). Lower levels of accurate γ+ sequences also emerged in the unseeded reaction. These results show that (1) a ribozyme can exponentially replicate part of itself from short building blocks, (2) this ‘fragmentary' self-replication can occur in a ‘one-pot' cycled reaction and (3) ribozymes can initiate replication on themselves, even in the absence of a seed template.

In all the RNA replication reactions described so far (Figs. 2–4), we provided sequence-specific RNA primers for the replication of either defined or random-sequence templates. However, the availability of specific RNA primers is unlikely in a prebiotic context1. We wondered if the capacity of the TPR to initiate replication from template-bound RNA triplets (Extended Data Fig. 4) could support a more prebiotically plausible primer-independent model of RNA-catalysed RNA replication.

To investigate such a replication scenario, where the TPR is free to explore RNA sequence space in an unguided manner, we initiated open-ended RNA replication cycles, without primers, but providing all 64 triplet substrates (pppNNN) and an N20 random-sequence RNA seed pool (Fig. 5a). After five cycles, a ladder of triplet-register RNA products was detected (Fig. 5b), indicating primer-free RNA synthesis from the N20 template seed. To our surprise, a similar (if fainter) ladder was also seen in the unseeded (no template) control, implying emergence of products even in the absence of a seed template.

a, All 64 RNA triplets (pppNNN, 0.1 µM each) ± 20 nM N20 random-sequence RNA template seed were subjected to iterative cycles of replication and dilution in replication buffer (with 20 nM TPR and 1.8 mM KCl, but no primers). b, RNAs present at different replication cycles (up to 73) were visualized with an intercalating dye. Both the intensity and length of the RNA products increased during cycling, despite serial dilution. c, Estimated conversion of the total triplet substrate pool into the RNA products. The amount of triplets needed to constitute calculated RNA product yields was expressed as a percentage of the replenished triplet substrates (Extended Data Fig. 10). d, In silico ‘translation' using a reduced codon set applied to the sequenced, unseeded 73-cycle synthesis products (red), compared to a simulated pool of random sequences with matching lengths but unbiased codon composition (grey). For each sequence, the longest stretch of family box codons is counted to show the maximum potential length of any encoded peptide using only a primordial genetic code. e, A population of sequenced products from the unseeded 73-cycle reaction (left) shows high ribozyme sequence complementarity, absent in a simulated pool of randomized RNAs of identical composition (right). Data are coloured by the classification in f (Extended Data Fig. 9 shows the criteria used); sequences with homology to the ribozyme (+) strand are plotted separately (Supplementary Fig. 8). f, Changes in proportions of sequence classes in 9–27-nt products from unseeded reactions during amplification. g, As cycling progresses, the G–C base composition of sequences classed as having no ribozyme homology increases (data from N20-seeded reactions shown). h, Mapping of ribozyme-homologous parts of 9–27-nt products from unseeded amplification reactions to the (+) and (−) strands of the TPR subunits 5TU and t1. Peak heights reflect the fraction of products homologous to that site, scaled by the product intensity in the corresponding gel lane in b. Products with homology to multiple locations on one or both strands were randomly assigned to one. Note the prior emergence and buildup of (−)-strand TPR homology products, followed by (+)-strand products (templated from (−)-strand products).

Source data

Following continued cycling (with serial dilution), the levels of synthesized RNA in both seeded and unseeded reaction pools grew, and product lengths increased. After 73 cycles (and over 2.5 × 105-fold dilution of the initial reaction), a robust ladder of products was present in both seeded and unseeded reactions (Fig. 5b), consuming a substantial fraction of the pppNNN triplet substrates supplied upon each dilution step (Fig. 5c). Although the seeded reaction initially maintained a higher level of RNA products (over a 128-fold dilution), RNA product levels in the unseeded reaction eventually matched the seeded reaction.

To understand the nature of the emergent RNA sequences, we performed next-generation sequencing of all 5′-triphosphorylated RNAs from both seeded and unseeded reactions (Extended Data Fig. 9). We observed products ranging from 6 to 60 nt in length, with many (25–75%) in both seeded and unseeded reactions showing some complementarity to the TPR ribozyme sequence (Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Fig. 8). This suggests that, as observed above in the primer-dependent γD replication (Fig. 4b), the TPR acted both as a polymerase and as a template. The absolute amount of ribozyme-complementary products increased progressively in later cycles (Extended Data Fig. 9), with homologous regions mapping to multiple initiation points along the TPR sequence (Fig. 5h). Although some TPR sequence segments appear to be absent (for example 5TU(−) 30–45, 125–140), products homologous to TPR subunit 5TU or t1 (−) strands build up in the cycling reactions, followed in later cycles by products with homology to the 5TU/t1 (+) strands, suggesting that the emergent (−)-strand segments begin to act as templates, themselves instructing (+)-strand synthesis (Fig. 5h and Supplementary Fig. 8).

A fraction (5–20%) of RNA sequences generated in both seeded and unseeded reactions showed no homology to either TPR (+) or (−) strands. These sequences were extremely diverse (~95% unique) and showed no evidence of convergence or complementarity among themselves (Supplementary Fig. 9). Across iterative cycles, their abundance increased and their composition shifted towards a more GC-rich pattern (Fig. 5f,g) reminiscent of the TPR's substrate preferences4 and the influence of triplet composition upon strand reannealing (Extended Data Fig. 3). However, unlike a previous template selection experiment (using a mononucleotide RNA polymerase ribozyme), where products became biased towards increasingly G-rich sequences23, here the relative proportions of G to C as well as of A to U remained both stable and closely matched, following Chargaff's rule25. This strongly suggests that these emerging RNA sequences were propagated by synthesis in a templated process26. We hypothesize that the gradual emergence of these diverse RNA sequence pools indicates a de novo sequence generation by the TPR followed by mutual templating and priming, as well as a mix of partial replication and recombination (as seen in Extended Data Fig. 8). In contrast to the products observed from primer-dependent random-sequence replication (Fig. 3b), RNAs in this pool increased in size and complexity upon open-ended cycling. In summary, our data show how randomly triplet-primed RNA replication driven by pH/freeze–thaw cycles can support fragmentary and distributive TPR self-replication as well as the accompanying de novo generation of diverse RNA sequence pools.

We have shown that RNA trinucleotide triphosphates (triplets) provide a plausible solution to the strand separation problem by acting simultaneously as RNA chaperones (by stabilizing RNA oligomers in single-stranded form and attenuating strand reannealing) and as substrates and initiators (primers) of RNA replication. Combined with coupled pH, temperature and concentration gradients, here this enables exponential replication of defined- and mixed-sequence double-stranded RNA sequences. When extended to primer-free amplification of random RNA sequence pools, this led to emergent de novo sequence generation and partial self-replication, with the TPR spontaneously copying stretches of its own sequence.

All of these outcomes are consequences of the physicochemical properties of the triplet substrates, which form a web of interactions both with the template strands and themselves. Triplet:triplet base-pairing interactions4 probably underpin both terminal transferase activity (Extended Data Fig. 5) and the ‘creative mode' of de novo sequence generation (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 9). Triplet–triplet stacking interactions drive cooperative triplet binding, enabling primer-free synthesis (Extended Data Fig. 4) and blocking reannealing on templates with ≥50% GC (Fig. 1d). The principles for overcoming the strand separation problem described herein are not dependent on the nature of either the catalyst or a specific geochemical environment (for example, bedrock chemistry) and therefore could probably apply to non-enzymatic RNA replication1, where di- and trinucleotides have been shown to act as functional substrates27.

Despite the capacity of RNA triplets to hybridize to RNA strands and prime RNA synthesis as well as invade RNA secondary structure4, we find that the TPR appears surprisingly resistant to inhibition by them, even in the presence of random triplet (pppNNN) pools and multiple cycles of denaturation (Figs. 3b and 5b), presumably due to either high stability or rapid refolding of the TPR structure. Indeed, the TPR appears largely resistant to invasion, even by a 29-nt complementary internal segment (γ−) (Fig. 4). However, the γ segment is part of the stable and highly ordered core of the TPR as judged by cryo-electron microscopy21, and it is currently unclear whether more flexible segments of the TPR (such as, for example, the 5TU P10 domain) would be more vulnerable to sequestration. A future RNA replicase ribozyme will probably have to manage the tradeoffs of embodying both template and catalyst in one RNA molecule. Evidence of such tradeoffs is apparent in our replication experiments, where the intact TPR serves as only an inefficient template, but becomes a more efficient template as it begins to unfold and/or degrade upon prolonged cycling (Extended Data Fig. 8). As replication cycles proceed, triplet priming on such fragments creates a growing pool of first TPR (−) and then (+) strand-homologous products, providing a potential route to a fragmentary form of self-replication28 (Fig. 5h).

Beyond these TPR fragment pools, replication with all 64 triplet substrates also results in the de novo generation and amplification of diverse pools of RNA oligomer sequences (up to 60-nt long; Fig. 5). Such de novo sequence generation has been observed previously by proteinaceous RNA polymerases, notably Qbeta RdRP29 and T7 RNA polymerase30, via a variety of mechanisms. Further study to elucidate product origins may open a route to primer-free replication of defined sequences, although replicated sequences would likely need to exhibit a selectable phenotype to persist31. In this way, pools of amplification products could yield new activities to promote ribozyme survival.

Analysis of the amplified product pools in primer-free replication reveals a striking drift (~80%) towards sequences composed of triplets corresponding to family box codons in the genetic code (Extended Data Fig. 10). Family box codons (1/2 of all codons) encode amino acids independently of their third nucleobase, and these have been proposed to have formed part of a simpler, primordial genetic code, as they (generally) form more stable codon–anticodon interactions32, and encode amino acids provided by potentially prebiotic chemistry33,34. Their observed selective enrichment by replication probably reflects both TPR sequence preferences (for GC-rich triplets) as well as thermodynamic considerations (that is, higher template occupancy to inhibit strand reannealing), which have been shown to influence sequence pool evolution in model replication experiments11 (Fig. 3). It is tempting to speculate that the same physicochemical principles that introduce sequence bias into triplet-based RNA replication may have shaped an early genetic code to potential mutual benefit. Through a drift in triplet usage, replication cycles not only drive RNA sequence pools towards more effective replication, but also more productive translation using a primitive genetic code (Fig. 5d). This could have played an important role in the emergence of coded peptide-based phenotypes.

The factors that shape the emergence and evolution of preferentially replicated sequences from a random template (Fig. 3) may also underlie differential (+)- and (−)-strand replication (Fig. 2c). Viruses35 and viroids36 (considered by some to be relics of the RNA World) show evidence of a ‘division of labour' between their strands, where asymmetry in secondary structure formation and folding energy favours one strand for encoding function and the other for replication. Similar specialization may manifest in RNA-catalysed RNA replication.

Although we had not set out to investigate prebiotic RNA replication scenarios, we note that our RNA replication strategy is general and robust over a range of temperature and pH values (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 6), including flash-freezing37, present in modern geothermal fields38. Functionally similar physicochemical gradients can be found in alternative geochemical scenarios including evaporation–condensation cycles or thermophoretic pH and concentration gradients13,39,40. Notably, freeze–thaw cycles have also been shown to promote RNA folding41, and recently to facilitate both activation and non-enzymatic polymerization of ribonucleotides2, as well as RNA 2′,3′-aminoacylation42.

In summary, we describe a general mechanism by which the conflicting roles of RNA oligomers as general replication substrates, as unfolded replication templates (and primers) and as folded replication catalysts can be plausibly reconciled. Our work defines physicochemical parameters capable of overcoming the strand separation problem and suggests that RNA self-replication—generating fragments for later assembly26,28—arises as a predisposed, emergent property of randomly primed RNA replication.

Standard (non-replicative) primer extension assays were conducted in 5 µl of extension buffer (final concentrations 0.1 M MgCl2, 50 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.3, 0.05% Tween-20, 100 nM of each primer, 2.5 µM of each triplet/oligomer, 0.5 µM ribozyme). To start, ribozyme was annealed (80 °C, 2 min; 17 °C, 10 min) in 1 µl of water. Meanwhile, 0.5 pmol of template or duplex was incubated in 2 µl of 0.05% Tween-20 (+5 mM HCl for ‘acidified' reactions) at 25 °C for 10 min. All other reaction components (in 2 µl) were mixed with ribozyme then template fractions, before flash-freezing in liquid N2 (20 s) and incubation at −7 °C in an LTC4 refrigerated bath (Grant Instruments).

To measure the effect of delayed triplet and/or TPR addition (for example, Fig. 1d), duplex or template was acidified as above, then a neutralization mix was added with or without the relevant triplets and primers. This neutralization mix also contained enough MgCl2, Tris·HCl pH 8.3 and Tween-20 to yield their final concentrations above. The resulting volume (2.5–3.7 µl) was immediately flash-frozen in liquid N2 and incubated at −7 °C to allow the eutectic phase to thaw out, during which time the template strand(s) reannealed or became coated with triplets.

After the indicated delay, more buffer (with identical MgCl2/Tris·HCl pH 8.3/Tween-20 concentrations) containing the TPR (with any missing triplets and primers) was added on top of the frozen volume to a final volume of 5 µl at −7 °C. This made all total reaction compositions identical (except template), though the buffer with TPR froze as a distinct layer on top of the original ice; the eutectic phases of the layers, however, became contiguous, allowing TPR (±triplets) to diffuse into the lower layer containing the template (as previously reported22). Reactions were then incubated at −7 °C for 48 h to allow primer extension, and the fraction of primers extended was then used to deduce the available template levels (and thus the degree of strand reannealing) as follows.

Data points with extension >0.1% were used to deduce reannealing rates in the eutectic phase. Even in standard reactions, primer extension is not complete, and (independent of strand reannealing) a two-layer reaction with triplets separated from the template gave threefold less primer extension than when triplets began in the same layer as the template (Fig. 1d). Therefore, primer extension efficiencies on the duplex were first divided by the average efficiency with template alone (from equivalent reactions with or without triplets at neutralization—or a geometric mean thereof when half were present). Efficiencies were then converted into free strand concentrations by estimating the eutectic phase volume (see below). As triplets/TPR do not immediately complete diffusion between reaction layers, there is a hidden lag phase, and extrapolated no-delay efficiencies would vary between different conditions. Nonetheless subsequent reannealing rates could be estimated using the changes observed between delays of different lengths.

Iterative replication of RNA was undertaken in 0.5-ml microfuge tubes containing 125 µl of replication buffer (standard composition: 0.4 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM KCl, 1 mM N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (CHES)·KOH pH 9.0, 0.01% Tween-20, 20 nM TPR, 100 nM of each triphosphorylated triplet, 100 nM each of any RNA primers/oligomers). Up to 1 pmol of starting RNA template or duplex to be amplified was added per reaction (Extended Data Fig. 6 provides a discussion of this parameter). Reactions were prepared at room temperature, and cycling was begun with an initial denaturing step where 0.75 µl of 0.1 M HCl was added (+0.6 mM in the reaction, overwhelming the CHES buffer), the reaction was vortexed, and then incubated for 2 min on a thermocycler preheated to 80 °C. Next, 0.75 µl of 0.1 M KOH was added, and the reaction was briefly vortexed, then plunged in liquid N2 for 20 s to flash-freeze, before incubation at −7 °C for ~24 h. Another cycle was initiated by thawing the reactions at room temperature before HCl addition, and so on.

The fold concentration of solutes within the eutectic phase upon freezing of extension buffer or replication buffer was calculated by estimating the eutectic phase volume as a fraction of the ice, as described previously22. Briefly, a sample was prepared with the ionic composition of the target reaction (for extension buffer) or a 50-fold concentrated version (for replication buffer), alongside a gradually more concentrated set of samples with the same amount of buffer components but lower reaction volumes. These were then flash-frozen and incubated at −7 °C to allow eutectic phase equilibration. If the volume of a concentrated sample was less than that of the eutectic phase of the parent sample, no ice phase would be present at equilibrium. This transition occurred in a tenfold concentrated sample for extension buffer, and an 8.8-fold concentrated sample for 50× pre-concentrated replication buffer. Assuming that the eutectic phase composition was the same, independent of the starting volume (that is, uniform freezing point depression from solutes), linear concentration factors were applied (that is, 440-fold concentration from freezing replication buffer at −7 °C).

Open-ended replication cycling involving serial dilution proceeded as shown in the relevant figures (Figs. 2b, 3a and 5a). The dilution protocol was designed to create an appropriate replication burden (two- to threefold amplification in four or five cycles), while maintaining the KCl concentration (increasing from pH cycling) within the 1.8–4.2 mM range. To dilute, an acidified sample was neutralized post-heating by the combined addition of chilled KOH and fresh reaction mix, then flash-frozen and incubated at −7 °C. After this incubation, the reaction was thawed and a 125-µl aliquot transferred to a fresh tube for further cycling. The remnant sample was retained for analysis.

In some lanes of Extended Data Fig. 8a, half of the TPR was degraded beforehand by incubation at 80 °C for 8 min in 20 mM MgCl2/30 mM KCl/50 mM CHES·KOH pH 9.0/0.02% Tween-20. The remaining reaction components were then added to this mixture to restore the standard reaction composition before cycling began.

For gel analysis of RNA synthesis in extension buffer, the samples were quenched with excess ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) over Mg2+, adding urea to 6 M. Where a specific template sequence was included in the reaction, a tenfold excess of a complementary RNA was also provided to outcompete product:template rehybridization. Samples were denatured (94 °C, 5 min), cooled and separated on 20% acrylamide/8 M urea/TBE gels. For analysis of RNA synthesis in replication buffer, 125-µl reaction aliquots were first ethanol-precipitated (85% ethanol final concentration, with glycogen carrier) before resuspension in water and addition of EDTA and urea as above.

The reactions in Supplementary Fig. 7a with biotinylated primer were stopped with excess EDTA and mixed with two volumes of bead-wash (BWBT) buffer (200 m NaCl, 10 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20), then biotinylated primers and products were bound to MyOne C1 streptavidin-coated microbeads (Invitrogen) prewashed three times in BWBT. These were then washed with BWBT, templates were removed with a 50 mM NaOH/1 mM EDTA/0.1% Tween-20 wash, the beads were neutralized with a BWBT + 100 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.4 wash, before a final BWBT wash and resuspension in 95% formamide/25 mM EDTA. After heating at 94 °C for 5 min to denature and detach the primers from the beads, the supernatant was subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to separate the primers.

Gels were scanned on a Typhoon FLA-9000 imager (GE) at different wavelengths for each fluorophore-labelled primer. The gel of primerless extensions in Fig. 5b was pre-stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) before scanning. Gel bands were quantified using ImageQuant analysis software; backgrounds were drawn between peak troughs or using adjacent negative controls. For primer extensions, band intensities of unextended primers and extension products of all lengths were used to calculate the product distribution, and hence extension yields of, for example, ‘full-length' (full-length band only), ‘reaching full-length' (including longer bands) or ‘primer extension' (at least 1–3 triplet addition) products, as indicated in the figure legends, with product pmol or µM calculated from the known total pmol or µM of primer in each reaction.

To estimate the amplified RNA yield (Fig. 5), the lane intensities in Fig. 5b beneath the TPR bands were measured by densitometry, and the corresponding pppNNN-free reaction backgrounds were subtracted (alongside, if present, N20 seed band intensities). These intensities were converted to RNA product yields using the N20 seed band intensity as a reference (Fig. 5b, left lane), treating the fluorescence of SYBR Gold-stained RNAs as proportional to their length.

Oligonucleotides were purified from PAGE gels by the excision of bands identified by UV shadowing or alignment with a fluorescence scan. The bands were crushed and the oligonucleotides therein eluted into 10 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.4. Gel fragments were removed from the supernatant by passage through a Spin-X 0.22-µm cellulose acetate filter (Costar) and the supernatant was precipitated in 73% ethanol (ribozymes or long oligonucleotides) or 85% ethanol (oligonucleotides <8 nt).

(a) A secondary-structure-level representation of the 5TU+1 (5TU/t1) triplet polymerase ribozyme (TPR) heterodimer based upon its cryo-EM structural model21. The TPR comprises a catalytic 5TU subunit (orange) and an inactive type 1 (t1) subunit (blue), depicted next to a template-substrate complex. Triplet substrate (green) binding to template (light grey) juxtaposes the 3' hydroxyl of the upstream RNA primer (brown) and the 5' triphosphate of the triplet (purple). The 5TU subunit catalyses nucleophilic attack of the 3' hydroxyl on the triphosphate α-phosphate of a correctly-paired triplet to form a new phosphodiester linkage, repeating this process iteratively. Type 1 forms a heterodimer with 5TU, improving 5TU's interaction with ligation junctions. The γ fragment of 5TU is highlighted in red, and type 1 regions complementary to products in Extended Data Fig. 8 are highlighted in lilac. (b) Primer extension by the TPR. Full-length product is generated when all junctions are ligated, and incomplete ligation yields a ladder of intermediate extension products. Here, multiple-turnover catalysis allows the TPR to synthesise complementary strand RNA upon excess primer/template molecules. 40 nM of single-stranded template A+ and primer FITCA were mixed with the indicated concentrations of TPR in 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CHES·KOH pH 9.0, 4 mM KCl, 0.001% Tween-20, and 0.1 µM of each triplet substrate. To initiate extension, the mixture was frozen in dry ice then incubated at −7 °C for 24 h. Formation of a supercooled liquid brine eutectic phase concentrated all solutes by an estimated 250-fold. Primer extension products were resolved by denaturing PAGE, and gel densitometry allowed quantification of extension and calculation of the number of complementary strands synthesised per ribozyme molecule. Considering that each strand is itself the product of eight iterative ligation reactions, at 0.4 nM TPR each TPR molecule must carry out a ligation every few minutes in ice.

(a) Fluorescence/quench assay design. (i) The 27-nt RNA duplex Rγ1D (70% GC composition) is mixed with an equal amount of duplex FQγ1D, whose component strands are identical but for a 5' fluorescein group (green) on one and a 3' Black Hole Quencher group (purple) on the other strand. (ii) Upon subjecting the duplex mix to denaturing conditions, the strands separate from their starting partners. (iii) Returning to native conditions (pH 8, room temperature) leads to reannealing and reassortment of strands. Some fluorophore-labelled strands are now hybridised to unlabelled complements, yielding a fluorescent signal in proportion to the extent of duplex dissociation. This assay decouples the conditions required for measurement from those needed for strand separation, and thus measures the history of denaturation in a sample, not its current state. (b) Strand separation of GC-rich RNA duplexes by heating. 1 pmol each of Rγ1D and FQγ1D were mixed in 50 µl of 0.02% Tween-20 and the following buffer compositions: 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.4 (Na+); 0.1 M NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM tris·HCl pH 7.4 (Mg2+); 2.4 mM KCl, 0.4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CHES·KOH pH 9.0 (Rep. pH 9.0); 2.4 mM KCl, 0.4 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM HCl (Rep. pH 3.6); 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM HCl (Na+ pH 2.3). The samples were incubated for five minutes at the indicated temperatures, then cooled on the bench and neutralized with 50 µl 1 M Tris·HCl pH 8, 25 mM EDTA. After sitting overnight at room temperature, sample fluorescence was measured and plotted against incubation temperature. Reactions were set up in triplicate. A positive control (Strand mix) comprising a mix of 1 pmol of both (+) with 1 pmol of both (-) strands of the duplexes in ‘Na+' buffer conditions was also prepared. Very high temperatures are needed to dissociate the duplex under neutral or slightly basic conditions, but at an acidic pH of 3.6 moderate heating is sufficient to denature the RNA duplex. (c) Combinations of temperature and pH capable of denaturing the RNA duplex AD prior to TPR-catalysed primer extension. Extensions were carried out as in Fig. 2c with different denaturing conditions followed by a single cycle of extension on single-stranded A+ or duplex AD; matched full-length efficiencies indicate strand separation during denaturation, and maintenance of this state into polymerisation.

Source data

One cycle of replication in replication buffer, carried out as in Fig. 2c, but on RNA single strands or duplexes of different sequence compositions, supplying their constitutive triplet substrates and primers from the start (Sequence A = A+/AD template (>50% GC), FITCA & Cy5A primers, constitutive triplets as in Fig. 1b; Sequence B = B+/BD template (50% GC), FITCB & Cy5B primers, constitutive triplets; Sequence C = C+/CD template (40% GC), FITCC & Cy5C primers, constitutive triplets). Although the TPR can synthesise full-length extension products of FITC-labelled primers on all three single-stranded templates, it could only do so on double-stranded duplexes of 50% GC composition or higher. The capacity of low concentrations of GC-rich triplets – but not high concentrations of AU-rich triplets – to support duplex copying likely reflects the extreme cooperativity of strand coating (via Watson-Crick pairing and base stacking) needed to maintain a kinetic barrier to reannealing.

Above, Potential synthesis pathways to a 24 nt RNA from triplet substrates. Each node represents a synthesis intermediate, of increasing length towards the centre of the map (full length product). The intermediate at each node can be synthesized from the intermediates or triplets at each end of a line passing through the node. Larger intermediates can potentially be generated via multiple routes. Below, Maps of products detected during primer-less synthesis of three fragments (β+ (top), γ+ (middle) and δ+ (bottom)) of the t5 ribozyme4, and their inferred synthesis pathways. The maps show the distribution of polymerised triplets: the area of each node is proportional to the abundance of that intermediate (from sequencing scheme in Supplementary Fig. 4) multiplied by its length. Node sizes are uniformly scaled in each map such that the sum of intermediate node areas is constant; the triplet substrate nodes (not sequenced) are sized arbitrarily. Putative synthesis pathways are marked on each map and displayed alongside in a 5' to 3' direction with intervening symbols indicating how triplets are joined together into RNA products – indicating sites of initiation (triplet:triplet ligation), polymerisation (triplet addition to the 3' of an oligonucleotide) or instances of ligation (of oligomer substrates larger than triplets). The β fragment exhibits two sites of initiation, followed by polymerisation from each with their concomitant ligation on the path to the full-length fragment. The γ fragment synthesis is characterized by multiple sites of initiation and independent ligation of the resulting oligomers, and proceeded effectively, perhaps reflecting the availability of multiple initiation sites. The δ primerless synthesis was inefficient, with negligible ligation at two junctions, and as a result no full-length product was detected. The observed products suggested a pattern of two initiation sites, followed by polymerisation and ligation. The triplet:triplet ligation observed across the three templates is evidence of widespread triplet substrate coating of single-stranded templates.

(a) Terminal transferase activity by the t5+1 TPR4 (the precursor of the 5TU+1 TPR21) when extending 12 different primer/template (P/T) pairs. These template incorporation of pppCCC preceding and following one of 12 different triplets (indicated). As substrates, either all 64 triplets (pppNNN) or only the specific templated triplet and pppCCC were provided. With pppNNN, on average 29% of the full-length products were extended by a fourth triplet in a non-templated manner. Extensions were carried out as previously described (ref. 4, ‘Fidelity assay' section of Methods). (b) RNA products in a mixture of the reactions that used pppNNN in (a) were sequenced (see ref. 4). The probabilities of each of the 64 triplets being added (non-templated) to a full-length product were plotted by triplet GC content. GC-rich triplets were better substrates for terminal transfer (means ± s.d. after logarithmic conversion, n = 8 (0 & 3 GCs) or 24 (1 & 2 GCs)); from pppNNN, 19% of all non-templated triplets added were pppCCC. (c) Despite the uniform presence of the best terminal transferase substrate pppCCC in (a), terminal transferase activity was only notable when an additional G-rich triplet was present. We propose that duplex growth proceeds through blunt-ended addition of short RNA duplexes formed by pre-associated GC-rich Watson:Crick-paired triplet dimers, whose independent existence in solution was previously inferred by the influence of complementary triplets upon TPR misincorporation frequencies4.

Flash-freezing maximises replication efficiency at high RNA duplex concentrations. A single cycle of TPR-catalysed replication (as in Fig. 2c, with 2.4 mM KCl, −7 °C for 40 h) was applied to different concentrations of single-stranded (ss) RNA (top) or double-stranded (ds) duplex RNA (bottom) templates, and full-length yields per template were calculated by gel densitometry. When using ss templates, the yield was broadly constant. However, when using high concentrations of ds templates the yield dropped in a manner dependent upon the protocol used to freeze the reaction after acidification, heating and neutralisation (yield ratios plotted on the right). A flash-freeze in liquid N2 over 20 s (blue) maintained yield at a higher concentration of duplex than a slow freeze over half an hour (teal). Reannealing before freezing is more prevalent at higher duplex concentrations and longer delays between neutralisation and eutectic phase formation. In effect, these parameters govern the relative weights of the ‘reannealing' and ‘strand coating' arrows in Fig. 1e and thus the productivity of the replication cycling. Efficient duplex use (~80% vs. ssRNA) was nonetheless observed at eutectic phase concentrations of 3.5 µM (after flash-freeze) or 0.8 µM (after slow freeze). This concentration may be considered a critical parameter of any cycling protocol, as it governs the maximum concentration of each RNA species that can be generated via exponential replication. Reassuringly, ribozymes are operational at these concentrations, including the TPR itself (Extended Data Fig. 1), suggesting that sufficient catalysts could accumulate via this cycling protocol to drive RNA catalytic processes including self-replication.

Source data

Left panels, Replication reactions were set up as in Fig. 2c with varying starting AD duplex concentrations and continued over 21 cycles (including 5 serial dilutions as shown in Fig. 2b). Right panels, Calculated strand amplification in these reactions. After x cycles, the concentration of primer reaching full-length (above that in the no template control) (= [≥FL(x)]) was measured by densitometry and normalized to the expected concentration of starting AD remaining after serial dilution: Amplification after x cycles = 1 + 2^((x-1)/4)*([ ≥ FL(x)] ÷ starting [AD]).

(a) Iterative replication of exogenous or endogenous γ fragment by the TPR. Replication reactions were set up as in Fig. 4b (with 0.6 mM KCl), and either seeded with γD, no exogeneous template (TPR) or partly degraded TPR (by prior heating with Mg2+ = ‘deg. TPR'). Post-freezing (eutectic phase) concentrations of template, TPR and products are shown. Concentrations of γ+ (red) and γ– (blue) products reaching full-length were inferred from gel densitometry of triplicate reactions. Concentrations of product derived from replication of the template seed were calculated by proportional subtraction of products derived from intact ribozyme in unseeded reactions. This showed low single-cycle γ– synthesis efficiency using TPR as a template, but higher efficiency upon partial TPR degradation. Replication efficiency from γD is higher than in Fig. 4c, likely due to the 10-fold lower starting concentration of γD duplex used here. (b) Yields of full-length fragment replication products classed by γ-fragment homology. The sequence product distribution in Supplementary Fig. 7c for each sample was scaled by the modelled yield of all γ+ products in the corresponding cycle (Supplementary Fig. 7d). (c) The six most common individual sequences in the 5-cycle γD replication sample (occurrence shown out of 10,880 total sequences). Interestingly, the two of these sequences with very low γ+ identity show complementarity (underlined) to parts of the type 1 ribozyme (see Extended Data Fig. 1), a further instance of TPR acting as a template.

Source data

(a) Amplification products derived from indicated regions of the gel in Fig. 5b were sequenced and analysed as product pools B-I, alongside products from the corresponding 9–27 nt region of a separate equivalent 1-cycle seeded amplification (pool A). (b) Length distributions observed within the pools of sequenced RNAs. The strong triplet register bias confirms sequencing of ribozyme-synthesised RNAs. (c) Workflow for classification of the sequenced products. Only triplet-register products were analysed. Amplification products that exceeded stringent length-dependent sequence identity thresholds at any point when aligned along the (+) strand sequences of either 5TU or t1 TPR subunits (or their (-) strand complements) were classed as possessing ribozyme homology. These were further subdivided by the (+) or (-) strand they were matched to; some showed homology to both (unsurprising in a hairpin-rich RNA with internal complementarity) and were classed separately. Sequences that clearly did not align to the ribozymes or their complements at any point were also classed separately. Sequences between the indicated identity thresholds could not be easily categorised and were excluded from further analysis. (d) Levels of ribozyme homology within RNA product pools fractions (top), and corrected for corresponding RNA yields (bottom) based upon intercalator fluorescence in the excised region in part (a). A substantial fraction exhibits complementarity to ribozyme. All categories of product increase in absolute abundance over the course of cycling. (e) Reclassification of longer amplification products in pools E and I via only the 4th–12th nt of each sequence. This showed that the analysis in (d) suggesting that most of the > 27 nt sequences exhibited no overall ribozyme homology was partly an artefact of aligning all along these longer sequences; instead, there is a similar level of local ribozyme homology in longer (pools E & I) and shorter (pools D & H) sequences. The lower global ribozyme homology implicates recombination in this discrepancy. Note that the 9 nt length window used here is too short to definitively class sequences as ‘not derived from ribozyme' using our identity thresholds.

The triplet composition of pool H products (Extended Data Fig. 9a) was multiplied by the observed yield of RNA product in the reaction (the equivalent of 284.5 pmols of triplets incorporated out of 800 pmols supplied; see Fig. 5c) to estimate the consumption of each triplet (from the 12.5 pmols of each of the 64 triplets available in the analytical sample). Consumption %s are shown to the right of each triplet sequence, which show strong biases: some triplets are barely incorporated, others are almost fully consumed. Those triplets' consumptions calculated to exceed 100% may reflect sequence/structure/length preferences of RNA intercalation, adapter ligation and/or RT-PCR in the work-up, not unusual when sequencing short RNAs43. GC-rich triplets are particularly depleted, and their high degree of utilisation might also reflect their better capacity to initiate RNA synthesis on the growing product pool (Extended Data Fig. 4) and more effective inhibition of strand reannealing (Extended Data Fig. 3). Triplets highlighted in grey represent family box codons (FBC) in the genetic code, encoding the same amino acid independently of their third position. Triplets written in purple represent the anticodons of FBCs. Right, Correlations between these classifications and triplet usage. TPR RNA products are 3.8-fold enriched in family box codons, which are thought to have comprised an early genetic code. There are contributions from both nucleobase composition (random sequences with identical nucleobase composition yield a less pronounced 2.8-fold FBC preference) and triplet sequence preferences (there is just a 1.6-fold preference for family box anticodons which have inherently identical GC compositions). TPR-generated amplification products therefore would likely generate longer peptides when translated using a putative primordial genetic code (assuming identical triplet / codon register). As may be expected based upon their base composition, triplets corresponding to modern stop codons were rarely incorporated.

Metrics details

Suppression of the insulin–IGF–mTORC1–Ras network ameliorates aging in animals. Many drugs have targets in the network because of its roles in cancer and metabolic disease and are candidates for repurposing as geroprotectors. Rapamycin, an established geroprotective drug, blocks mTORC1 signaling, and trametinib inhibits the Ras–MEK–ERK pathway. In this study, we assessed survival and health of male and female mice treated with trametinib, rapamycin or their combination. We show here that trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes and that its combination with rapamycin was additive. Combination treatment reduced liver tumors in both sexes and spleen tumors in male mice, blocked the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake and strongly reduced inflammation in brain, kidney, spleen and muscle and circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We conclude that trametinib is a geroprotector in mice and that its combination with rapamycin is more effective than either drug alone, making the combination a candidate for repurposing as a gerotherapy in humans.

The insulin–IGF–mTORC1–Ras nutrient-sensing network is highly conserved in evolution and is implicated in the etiology of many age-related diseases1,2. Genetic inhibition of multiple nodes within the network can improve health during aging and extend lifespan in laboratory model organisms3. Growing evidence indicates a pro-aging role of the network in humans1,4. There is, therefore, potential to repurpose existing drugs with targets in this signaling network as geroprotectors to improve human health during aging5.

Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin (sirolimus), a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug used mainly for immunosuppression after organ transplantation6, robustly extends lifespan in multiple model organisms7,8, including mice, where rapamycin administration later in life at 600 days of age increases median and maximal lifespan in both sexes9. Rapamycin also ameliorates aging-related morbidities, including cardiac dysfunction10 and impaired immune responses11. Administration of mTOR inhibitors to older human subjects led to enhanced immune response to influenza vaccine and reduced infection rate, with briefer and lower dosing than used clinically and minimal side effects12. Some of the geroprotective effects of rapamycin may, therefore, be conserved in humans.

Reduced signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) node of the nutrient-sensing network can extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila13,14 and has been viewed as the primary route mediating the anti-aging effects of reduced upstream insulin/IGF signaling. However, Ras signaling plays a role in aging in yeast15, whereas, in Drosophila, the Ras–MEK–ERK pathway is as important a mediator as the PI3K pathway of the upstream effects of insulin/IGF signaling on lifespan16. Indirect inhibition of Ras in mice is associated with increased lifespan and enhanced motor function in old age17. Inhibition of the Ras pathway may, therefore, have an evolutionarily conserved, geroprotective effect.

Ras hyperactivation is highly oncogenic, with a third of human cancers presenting with a Ras mutation12. There has, therefore, been an intense search for small-molecule inhibitors of the Ras pathway. Trametinib (also known as Mekinist), an FDA-approved drug for treatment of melanomas, is a highly specific inhibitor of MEKs18. Oral administration of trametinib increases Drosophila lifespan, even when started later in life16. To examine whether the geroprotective effect of trametinib is conserved in mice, we orally dosed female and male mice and assessed their aging phenotypes.

There is extensive crosstalk among the branches of the insulin–IGF–mTORC1–Ras network. Simultaneous inhibition of different nodes within the network, by combined drug treatments, could, therefore, be more effective than suppression of single nodes, by prevention of compensatory responses. Combinatorial drug treatments could also inhibit specific targets more strongly or induce a wider range of protective effects, because different nodes in the network have many non-overlapping targets. Indeed, joint inhibition of mTOR, MEK and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) by rapamycin, trametinib and lithium, respectively, resulted in additive increases in Drosophila lifespan, both with both double and triple treatment combinations, the latter inducing a 48% median lifespan extension19. Such combinatorial drug treatment could exert similar benefits in mammalian aging.

In the present study, we investigated whether administration of trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend lifespan and improve health at old age in mice. We orally treated male and female mice with trametinib or rapamycin or with both drugs at the same doses as in the single-drug treatments. We assessed their survival, fitness, brain metabolism and organismal health. Administration of trametinib or rapamycin alone significantly increased male and female lifespan, whereas the combination produced an additive increase in both sexes. Additionally, combined treatment significantly reduced liver tumors in both sexes and spleen tumors in male mice and alleviated the age-related increased glucose uptake in the brain. Combination treatment also markedly reduced age-related inflammation in brain, kidney, spleen and muscle, with reduced levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib also is, thus, geroprotective in mice, and its combination with rapamycin is even more so.

To determine the dose range of trametinib that efficiently inhibited Ras/Mek/Erk signaling without adverse effects on health, young, C3B6F1 hybrid, wild-type male and female mice were fed with 0.29 mg, 0.58 mg, 1.44 mg, 2.88 mg or 11.52 mg of trametinib per kg of diet for 4 weeks (Fig. 1a), and their plasma levels of trametinib (Fig. 1b,c), Ras–Mek–Erk pathway activity (Fig. 1d,e), body weight (Fig. 1f,g) and spleen weight (Fig. 1h,i and Extended Data Fig. 1) were measured. Trametinib in plasma increased with dietary concentrations and was significantly higher in female mice than in male mice (Fig. 1b,c). Inhibition of MEK activity measured by western blot of liver samples using phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) as read-out (Fig. 1d,e) showed that Erk1/2 phosphorylation was unaffected at 0.29mg kg−1 and 0.58 mg kg−1 trametinib and reduced at concentrations of 1.44 mg kg−1 trametinib and higher in both sexes, although low sample number and high variability meant that only 11.52 mg kg−1 in female mice resulted in a significant reduction. Decreased Ras–Mek–Erk pathway activity upon trametinib treatment was also observed in kidney, spleen and muscle tissue (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). pERK1/2 levels were significantly reduced in kidney and spleen tissue of female mice treated with 1.44 mg kg−1 trametinib (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b) with a non-significant trend in female (Extended Data Fig. 1c) and male (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c) muscle. Treatment with 11.52 mg kg−1 trametinib strongly reduced pERK1/2 levels in all tested tissues in both sexes (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). Thus, short-term treatment with trametinib led to a dose-dependent downregulation of Ras–Mek–Erk pathway activity in several tissues. Trametinib did not significantly affect water uptake (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Trametinib can cause body weight loss, liver lesions and necrosis and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels indicative of liver dysfunction. There was no significant effect of any dose of trametinib on plasma levels of AST (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g) or ALP (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i). At doses of 0.29–2.88 mg kg−1, trametinib also did not affect body weight (Fig. 1f,g) or spleen size (Fig. 1h,i). In contrast, animals fed with 11.52 mg kg−1 trametinib failed to gain body weight in the 4-week measurement period (Fig. 1f,g), with a trend for increased spleen weight in both sexes (Fig. 1h,i). In summary, dietary trametinib concentrations of 1.44 mg kg−1 and higher were sufficient to inhibit Ras/Mek/Erk signaling, whereas only the highest dose of 11.52 mg kg−1 trametinib induced adverse effects on mouse health. We, therefore, used 1.44 mg kg−1 in all subsequent experiments.

Mice were continuously fed with 1.44 mg kg−1 trametinib starting from 6 months of age, and their survival was measured (Fig. 2a). Trametinib treatment caused a significant lifespan extension in both sexes: in female mice with a median lifespan extension of 7.2% (P = 0.0248, log-rank test) (Fig. 2b) and no significant effect on maximum lifespan (P = 0.474, Wang–Allison test) and in male mice with an increase in median lifespan of 10.2% (P < 0.0001, log-rank test) (Fig. 2c) and maximum lifespan of 15.8% (P = 0.014, Wang–Allison test). Cox proportional hazard analysis showed no significant interaction between sex and trametinib treatment (P = 0.1793), showing that trametinib increased survival of male and female mice to a similar extent.

Source data

In Drosophila, trametinib and rapamycin combine additively to extend lifespan19. We measured the survival of mice on diets containing only rapamycin (42 mg kg–1), the dose so far inducing the largest increase in longevity20, or both rapamycin (42 mg kg–1) and trametinib (1.44 mg kg–1). Rapamycin was fed in alternate weeks (Fig. 2a), which improves metabolic health parameters11,21 and extends lifespan to a similar degree as continuous treatment22. As previously shown22, intermittent rapamycin treatment extended lifespan in both sexes to a similar extent (P < 0.0001, log-rank test; P = 0.2481 for the sex–drug interaction, Cox proportional hazard) with an increase in median and maximum lifespan of 17.4% and 16.5%, respectively, in female mice (Fig. 2b) and 16.6% and 18.3%, respectively, in male mice (Fig. 2c). In contrast to the single treatments, combined treatment with rapamycin and trametinib increased survival more in female mice than in male mice (sex–treatment interaction P = 0.0218, Cox proportional hazard) and caused a larger increase compared to the single treatment (Fig. 2b,c) in both sexes, with median and maximum lifespan increased by 34.9% and 32.4%, respectively, in female mice (Fig. 2b) and by 27.4% and 26.1%, respectively, in male mice (log-rank test; see Fig. 2b,c for the corresponding P values). In female mice, the hazard ratio of trametinib alone compared to control (P = 0.0383) was 0.6926 (0.4886–0.9804) and 0.4478 (0.3002–0.6641) in the presence of rapamycin (P < 0.0001). Rapamycin alone had a hazard ratio of 0.3284 (0.2243–0.4784) compared to controls (P < 0.0001) and 0.2123 (0.1380–0.3234) in the presence of trametinib (P < 0.0001). In male mice, trametinib alone had a hazard ratio of 0.5257 (0.3845–0.7169) versus controls (P < 0.0001) and 0.5814 (0.4127–0.8154) in the presence of rapamycin (P = 0.0017). Rapamycin on its own had a hazard ratio of 0.4623 (0.3376–0.6316) compared to controls (P < 0.0001) and 0.5113 (0.3611–0.7208) in the presence of trametinib (P = 0.0001). There was, thus, no indication of a positive or negative interaction between drug treatments in either sex.

In summary, treating mice with either trametinib or rapamycin extended lifespan in both sexes, with lifespan further extended by combined treatment in an additive manner.

We measured health parameters, including body weight (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), heart function (Extended Data Fig. 3c–f), anxiety behavior (Extended Data Fig. 3g–j), endurance (Extended Data Fig. 3k,l), motor coordination (Extended Data Fig. 3m,n) and memory (Extended Data Fig. 3o,p), at middle age (12 months) and old age (20–22 months). In addition, we used metabolic cages to measure body weight (Extended Data Fig. 4a), fat and lean mass (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c), water and food uptake (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g) at 16 months of age. Consistent with the pre-test, 1.44 mg kg−1 trametinib had no effect on body weight (Extended Data Figs. 3a,b and 4a). In contrast, both rapamycin and combined drug treatment decreased body weight in female mice at 20 months (Extended Data Figs. 3a and 4a) and in male mice at 12, 16 and 20 months (Extended Data Figs. 3b and 4a). Combined treatment induced a significant increase in fat content (Extended Data Fig. 4b) and a decrease in lean mass (Extended Data Fig. 4c) in female mice but not male mice. Lean mass was lower in female mice treated with trametinib (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The drug treatments did not affect water or food uptake (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). Heart rate of both sexes declined with age, and, in male mice, both rapamycin and trametinib attenuated the decline, with a similar non-significant trend in female mice (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). QT interval, a read-out for left ventricular hypertrophy, increased with age, and rapamycin decreased QT interval in female mice, and both rapamycin and combined treatment prevented the age-related increase in male mice (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). The drug treatments did not affect center occupancy in the open field (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h), forced running endurance on a treadmill (Extended Data Fig. 3k,l) or motor coordination in a rotarod assay (Extended Data Fig. 3m,n). Rapamycin-treated female mice performed slightly worse in the Y-maze (Extended Data Fig. 3o). Rapamycin-treated and combination-treated male mice showed increased global speed in the Y-maze (Extended Data Fig. 3p) with a similar trend for the combined drug treatment in the open field (Extended Data Fig. 3i), suggesting a higher motivation to move at old age. RER was not significantly altered by drug treatment in 16-month-old female mice (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g), whereas all three drug treatments significantly reduced RER during the night (Extended Data Fig. 4g), indicating a slight shift toward mixed carbohydrate and lipid utilization.

Chronic rapamycin treatment negatively affects glucose homeostasis and can lead to hyperglycemia. To assess the effect of trametinib, we measured glucose levels in plasma of 24-month-old animals. Both male and female mice treated with rapamycin showed significantly increased plasma glucose levels (Extended Data Fig. 4h). In contrast, plasma glucose levels of trametinib-treated animals did not differ significantly from controls (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Combination-treated mice had plasma glucose levels similar to rapamycin-treated animals, indicating that trametinib did not further exacerbate the effect of rapamycin. Thus, in contrast to rapamycin, trametinib extends lifespan without causing hyperglycemia. In human patients, trametinib treatment can result in increased plasma levels of ALT and ALP, indicative of reduced liver function. In contrast, treating mice chronically with 1.44 mg of trametinib did not change plasma levels of AST and ALT in 24-month-old animals (Extended Data Fig. 4i), consistent with the results from young animals (Extended Data Fig. 1f–i). Prolonged treatment with this dose of trametinib, therefore, did not affect liver function in mice.

In summary, rapamycin treatment alone or in combination with trametinib reduced body weight in both sexes and attenuated the decline in heart function with age. Both rapamycin and trametinib attenuated the age-related decline in heart rate in male mice; rapamycin decreased QT interval in both sexes; and combined treatment prevented the age-related increase in male mice. Rapamycin-treated and combination-treated female mice moved more at late age, and all drug treatments reduced nighttime RER in male mice. Rapamycin, but not trametinib, treatment caused hyperglycemia in old animals.

Trametinib and rapamycin are cancer chemotherapeutics. To address whether their lifespan-extending effects were associated with their anti-cancer function, we performed a cross-sectional histopathological analysis at 24 months of age, complemented by a macropathological assessment of overall tumor load postmortem, to assess any delay in tumor formation. Untreated mice predominantly developed tumors in the liver (Fig. 3a–d), spleen (Fig. 3e–h) and kidney (Fig. 3i,j). Liver tumors were most prevalent, with approximately 50% of female mice (Fig. 3a) and 70% of male mice (Fig. 3b) with tumors at 24 months of age. No significant differences in liver tumors were detected with either trametinib or rapamycin treatment at 24 months (Fig. 3a,b) or postmortem (Fig. 3c,d). However, combination treatment significantly reduced liver tumor numbers in both sexes at 24 months of age (Fig. 3a,b) and in male mice postmortem (Fig. 3d), with a similar trend in female mice (Fig. 3c). Twenty-five percent of female mice and 20% of male mice had tumors in the spleen (Fig. 3e,f), and 15% of female mice and 5% of male mice showed kidney tumors (Fig. 3i,j) at 24 months of age. Neither trametinib nor rapamycin reduced tumor formation in the spleen (Fig. 3e,f) or the kidney (Fig. 3i,j). The combination treatment significantly reduced spleen tumor formation at 24 months of age in male mice (Fig. 3f), with a similar trend in female mice (Fig. 3e). Although we did not detect any tumors in the kidney upon combined treatment, this tumor type was so rare in controls that the effect was not significant. In summary, only the combination of rapamycin and trametinib caused significant effects on tumor load, and this was more obvious in the cross-sectional analysis—for example, compare spleen pathology in male mice at 24 months and postmortem (Fig. 3f versus Fig. 3g), which may indicate a delay in tumor formation rather than reduced overall lifetime tumor load. To further investigate, we performed a longitudinal analysis, measuring tumor formation in vivo by 18F fluodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) coupled with computed tomography (CT)23 in the same animals at 12, 18 and 24 months of age (Fig. 3k). Because the capacity for the PET/CT measurement was limited, we restricted our analysis to control, trametinib-treated and combination-treated female mice. Tumors were identified as hypermetabolic regions, first in 24-month-old animals and then traced back in the same animals at 18 months and 12 months of age. Tumors were detected in several organs, including liver and uterus, but could only be reliably quantified in the spleen (Fig. 3g). Tumor occurrence increased with age in control animals, and, consistent with the histopathological analysis (Fig. 3e), trametinib did not affect spleen tumors at 12, 18 or 24 months (Fig. 3k). In contrast, combination-treated animals showed lower spleen tumors at all three ages, with no significant increase with age. Combined drug treatment, thus, delayed tumor formation, but, due to the missing single rapamycin treatment, the effect may have been entirely attributable to rapamycin.

Cross-sectional histopathological analysis of tumor levels in liver (a,b), spleen (e,f) and kidney (i,j) samples of 24-month-old female mice (a,e,i) and male mice (b,f,j). Combined drug treatment significantly reduced liver tumors in both sexes at 24 months and spleen tumors in male mice, with a similar trend for reduced tumor load in female spleen and male and female kidney (e,f). The absence of liver tumors was scored with 0, and the presence of low, moderate, high and very high severity tumors was scored with 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The absence or presence of spleen and kidney tumors was scored with 0 or 1, respectively. Liver tumor data for rapamycin and control animals were previously published22.

Brain glucose uptake increases during mouse aging24 and may be linked to impaired cognitive function25. We, therefore, used the 18F-FDG PET/CT longitudinal data to address whether trametinib and combined drug treatment attenuated age-related increase in glucose uptake (Fig. 4a–g). 18F-FDG uptake increased with age in control female mice across the whole brain (Fig. 4a,e), consistent with a previous study24. 18F-FDG uptake increased significantly between 12 months and 24 months in the striatum and cerebellum but not the cortex (Fig. 4a,e). Uptake in trametinib-treated female mice showed a significant increase across the whole brain and in the striatum, cerebellum and cortex between 12 months and 18 months of age (Fig. 4b,f), with no further increase between 18 months and 24 months. Combined drug treatment prevented the age-related increase in glucose uptake both across the whole brain and in the striatum, cortex and cerebellum (Fig. 4c,g), confirmed by two-way ANOVA analysis (P < 0.05 interaction between age and drug treatment; Fig. 4d). Direct comparisons of uptake between 12 months and 24 months (Fig. 4f–h) showed that trametinib treatment induced an intermediate phenotype between control and combination-treated animals with an increase in glucose uptake, whereas there was no change in the double drug-treated mice. Trametinib treatment, thus, ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake but only completely blocked it when combined with rapamycin.

Longitudinal 18F-FDG PET/CT measurements of age-related changes in differential glucose uptake in the female mouse brain. a–c, Images show differential regional glucose uptake across the mouse brain between 24-month-old and 12-month-old control (a), trametinib-treated (b) and rapamcin/trametinib-treated (c) female mice.

Brain inflammation increases the requirements for glucose and results in greater 18F-FDG uptake26. Microglia are the primary immune cells of the brain, and their increased activity is associated with age-related brain inflammation accompanied by synapse loss and late-onset neurodegeneration27. Microglia act in concert with astrocytes to resolve inflammation, and astrocyte-dependent Tgfβ secretion can inhibit microglia activation28. Aging disrupts this interplay, leading to exacerbated inflammation in both an autonomous and an astrocyte-dependent manner29. Because Ras/MEK/Erk signaling has been implicated in microglial activation27, we assessed whether drug treatment reduced activation of microglia and astrocyte density by performing immunohistological stainings of brain sections using antibodies against Iba-1 and Gfap for activated microglia and astrocyte density, respectively (Fig. 5a–e), in brains of 24-month-old female control (Fig. 5b), rapamycin-treated (Fig. 5c), trametinib-treated (Fig. 5d) and rapamycin/trametinib-treated (Fig. 5e) mice. We also stained brains of 6-month-old control mice (Fig. 5a). Activated microglial and astrocyte density significantly increased in the striatum (Fig. 5f,g), hippocampus (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b) and cortex (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d) but not the cerebellum (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f) of 24-month-old compared to 6-month-old controls, indicating increased brain inflammation at older age. Combined drug treatment significantly reduced the density of activated microglia and astrocytes in the striatum of 24-month-old mice (Fig. 5f,g), with a similar trend in the cortex (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d) but no significant effects in the hippocampus (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b) or the cerebellum (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). Compared to the combined treatment, single treatment with rapamycin or trametinib did not significantly reduce the number of activated microglia in the striatum (Fig. 5f). Thus, rapamycin and trametinib had only mild effects, but the combination of both drugs significantly reduced age-related brain inflammation in specific regions. Notably, 18F-FDG uptake was increased in the cerebellum, suggesting mechanisms other than inflammation.

a–e, Representative confocal composite images of immunohistochemical stainings of the striatum region in 6-month-old young controls (a) and 24-month-old controls (b) and 24-month-old rapamycin-treated (c), 24-month-old trametinib-treated (d) and 24-month-old rapamycin/trametinib-treated (e) female mice. Nuclei were stained with DAPI, astrocytes with GFAP and activated microglia with Iba-1. f,g, Quantification of microglia density (DAPI/Iba-1+ cells) (f) and astrocyte density (DAPI/GFAP+ cells) (g) per mouse striatum of young and old control animals and old drug-treated animals. Microglia and astrocyte density significantly increased with age in the striatum of control animals. Combination treatment significantly reduced microglia and astrocyte density in the striatum compared to old controls. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. 10–15 confocal images per brain region were averaged per sample. Numbers in brackets indicate the number of brain regions of individual animals analyzed per treatment. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.

As Ras/MEK/Erk signaling has been implicated in microglia activation27, we assessed whether trametinib crossed the blood–brain barrier. Trametinib levels were measured in the brains of the animals used for the pre-test (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h). At dietary concentrations of 0.29 mg kg−1 and 0.58 mg kg−1, trametinib was not detected in the brain (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h). Significant, but very low, levels of trametinib were detected at 1.44 mg kg−1 and 2.88 mg kg−1 dietary concentrations, with levels 25-fold and 30-fold lower than the corresponding plasma concentrations of female (140 ng µl−1) and male (55.8 ng µl−1) mice, respectively. Trametinib at 1.44 mg kg−1 thus barely crossed the blood–brain barrier. Only at 11.52 mg kg−1 did we detect trametinib in the brain, which might indicate saturation of the efflux system due to the high trametinib plasma levels. In conclusion, the effects on microglia upon treatment with 1.44 mg kg−1 trametinib might be indirect and caused by the action of trametinib in peripheral tissues.

During aging, inflammation increases in multiple peripheral organs, manifested in a low-level, systemic, pro-inflammatory phenotype termed ‘inflammaging'30. Inflammaging is associated with both mTOR and Erk pathway activity31. Combined treatment with rapamycin and trametinib reduced brain inflammation, so we assessed inflammation in peripheral tissues by histopathology of kidney and white adipose tissue (WAT) (Fig. 6a–d). Controls showed high levels of kidney inflammation, with 64% of female mice and 60% of male mice affected at 24 months of age (Fig. 6a,b). Trametinib did not reduce kidney inflammation (Fig. 6a,b), with a non-significant reduction with rapamycin treatment (40% of female mice and 43% of male mice affected at 24 months). Combined treatment significantly reduced kidney inflammation in both sexes with only 34% of female mice and 35% of male mice affected. Most of the combined drug effect was, therefore, probably due to rapamycin, which positively affects kidney health32. Control mice also showed high levels of inflammation in the WAT, with 82% of female mice and 86% of male mice affected (Fig. 6c,d). No drug treatment significantly reduced WAT inflammation, with 69%, 63% and 65% of female mice and 81%, 76% and 65% of male mice affected in trametinib-treated, rapamycin-treated and combination-treated animals, respectively.

a–d, Histopathological analysis of inflammation in kidney (a,b) and WAT (c,d) of 24-month-old female mice (a,c) and male mice (b,d). Combination-treated female mice and male mice showed significantly reduced kidney inflammation compared to control and trametinib-treated animals. Linear regression. Numbers in brackets indicate the number of tissue samples from independent mice per treatment. There was a non-significant trend for reduced WAT inflammation upon treatment with rapamycin and rapamycin/trametinib. e–p, Plasma protein levels of circulating cytokines as measured by the Olink Target 96 Mouse Exploratory panel: Tnf (e,f), IL17a (g,h), IL23r (i,j), Tgfα (k,l), IL6 (m,n) and IL10 (o,p). Drug effects on plasma cytokine levels were highly sex specific, with Tnf, IL17a, IL23r and Tgfα being downregulated by the combination treatment only in female mice but not male mice. One-way ANOVA with Tukeyʼs post hoc test. Numbers in brackets indicate the number of plasma samples from independent mice per treatment. Data in e and p are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Inflammation and plasma cytokine data for control and rapamycin-treated animals were previously published22.

We also assessed inflammatory markers in plasma of both sexes at 24 months, using the Olink Target 96 Mouse Exploratory panel (Fig. 6e–l and Supplementary Table 1). Combination-treated female mice at 24 months showed significantly reduced plasma levels of key pro-inflammatory proteins, including tumor necrosis factor (Tnf; Fig. 6e), interleukin-17a (IL17a; Fig. 6g), interleukin-23r (IL23r; Fig. 6i) and transforming growth factor α (Tgfα; Fig. 6k). Trametinib-treated female mice showed a significant reduction only in Tgfα (Fig. 6k), and rapamycin treatment significantly reduced levels of IL17a (Fig. 6g) and IL23r (Fig. 6i). The single-drug treatments had no significant effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines in male mice, with only interleukin-6 (IL6), which was not regulated in female mice (Fig. 6m), showing slight downregulation (Fig. 6n). Tnf (Fig. 6f) and IL6 levels (Fig. 6n) were mildly reduced in combination-treated male mice. Thus, combination treatment reduced the measured pro-inflammatory cytokines only in female mice. Notably, combination treatment significantly reduced the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL10) in both female mice (Fig. 6o) and male mice (Fig. 6p), possibly a response to reduced inflammation in these animals. In summary, combination treatment reduced inflammation in peripheral tissues accompanied by reduced levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines.

We assessed the impact of the drug treatments on age-related, non-neoplastic pathologies by measuring heart hypertrophy and kidney and spleen pathology at 24 months of age (Extended Data Fig. 6). Heart hypertrophy and kidney glomerulopatholgy were more pronounced in male mice than female mice, but there was no significant effect of any of the drug treatments (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d). Trametinib had no significant effect on spleen pathology in female mice, with a mild reduction in male mice (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Rapamycin mildly reduced spleen pathology in female mice, with a significant reduction in male mice (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Combined drug treatment significantly reduced spleen pathology in both sexes (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Increased spleen size in old mice reflects disrupted microarchitecture, extramedullary hematopoiesis, chronic inflammation and accumulation of senescent cells33, all of which impair spleen function. Spleen weight was significantly decreased by trametinib in female mice, with a similar trend in male mice, and by rapamycin and combination treatment in both sexes (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h), suggesting that both drugs combat spleen immunosenescence.

Long-term administration of rapamycin is associated with negative side effects, including liver lipidosis and testicular degeneration22. In contrast to rapamycin, trametinib treatment did not induce liver lipidosis or gonadal lesions (Extended Data Fig. 6i–l), whereas animals treated with both drugs showed similar levels to rapamycin-treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 6i–l). Thus, trametinib treatment did not induce these phenotypes, but nor did it protect rapamycin-treated mice from them.

Combination drug treatment reduced age-related kidney inflammation and spleen size. Neutrophils infiltrate muscle in aging mice34. We, therefore, measured gene expression changes in response to drug treatment in kidney, spleen and muscle of 24-month-old mice using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 2). In all three organs, the most strongly regulated genes were linked to inflammatory processes (Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8), with the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) strongly dependent on drug treatment and tissue type (Fig. 7a–f). Trametinib had only minor effects in female and male kidney (40/146 DEGs) and muscle (32/78 DEGs) and in the female spleen (14 DEGs), whereas, in male spleen, 2,038 genes were differentially regulated. Apart from in the male spleen, more genes were differentially regulated upon rapamycin treatment, with 199/210 DEGs in kidney, 828/534 DEGs in spleen and 743/317 DEGs in muscle of female mice and male mice, respectively. The strongest changes occurred with combination treatment, with 290/105 DEGs in kidney, 4,038/2,391 DEGs in spleen and 967/479 DEGs in muscle of female mice and male mice, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed little overlap in the transcriptional responses in male and female mice (Fig. 7g–l). Only GO terms associated with chromosome segregation, nuclear division and microtubule cytoskeleton organization involved in mitosis were downregulated in the spleen of both male and female combination-treated animals (Fig. 7j). There was also little overlap in DEGs between rapamycin and trametinib (Fig. 7a–f), with GO showing different terms between rapamycin and trametinib single treatments (Fig. 7g–l). Although there was significant overlap in DEGs between the single and the combined drug treatments (Fig. 7a–f), most DEGs were specific to the combined treatment, and there was little overlap in GO terms between single and combined treatments (Fig. 7g–l), suggesting that the stronger effect in the combined treatment was not simply a combination of the individual drug effects. Many GO terms were associated with immune regulation and inflammation (Fig. 7g–l) in the kidney, both among the upregulated and downregulated genes (Fig. 7g,h). In contrast, in the spleen and muscle, genes associated with immune regulation and inflammation were exclusively downregulated (Fig. 7i–l), suggesting reduced inflammaging.

There was differential regulation of genes associated with inflammation. CD5 antigen-like (Cd5l) and C-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (Ccl8, also known as Mcp2) were strongly downregulated by combined treatment in female and male kidney and in male and female spleen and male muscle (Extended Data Fig. 7a–f). Increased levels of Cd5l and Ccl8 are linked to inflammatory conditions35 and invasiveness and metastasis in various cancers36. Cd5l and Ccl8 were also downregulated by rapamycin but not trametinib in the spleen (Extended Data Fig. 7b,e) and in tendency also in kidney (Extended Data Fig. 7a,d). Reduced expression of Cd5l, which is expressed mostly by macrophages in inflamed tissues35, suggests reduced macrophage infiltration of kidney tissue of combination-treated and rapamycin-treated animals. Lysozyme 1 (Lyz1) expression was strongly downregulated by combination treatment in both kidney and spleen of male and female mice (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h) but not in muscle. Lyz1 is pro-inflammatory and can promote kidney fibrosis37. In kidney, Lyz1 was downregulated by trametinib but not rapamycin (Extended Data Fig. 7g). In female but not male spleen, Lyz1 was significantly downregulated by rapamycin and trametinib. Reduced Lyz1 levels upon trametinib treatment suggest a protective role against kidney fibrosis, even more pronounced after co-administration of rapamycin. Combined drug treatment also reduced expression of chemokines and chemoattractants in the kidney, spleen and muscle, including the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (Cxcl) genes Cxcl7, Cxcl11 and Cxcl13 (Extended Data Fig. 7i–l). Cxcl7 was downregulated by rapamycin in male muscle and by the combined treatment in male muscle and kidney (Extended Data Fig. 7i,j). Cxcl11 was significantly downregulated by rapamycin and the combination treatment in female spleen (Extended Data Fig. 7k). Cxcl13 was in the top 10 of significantly downregulated genes by rapamycin in muscle, with a similar trend for the combination treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7l). Cxcl14 was significantly upregulated by rapamycin and the combination treatment in muscles of both sexes (Extended Data Fig. 7m). Cxcl14 was significantly downregulated in the female but not male spleen under combination treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7n). Cxcl14 has context-dependent pro-tumor and anti-tumor effects38, possibly explaining the tissue-specific regulation. Cxcl7, Cxcl11 and Cxcl13 activate neutrophils and macrophages, promoting inflammatory states39, while also facilitating tumor growth, invasion and migration40. Their reduced expression upon combined drug treatment accords with the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effect of rapamycin and trametinib co-administration.

E26 avian leukemia oncogene 2, 3′ domain (Ets) transcription factors are key downstream effectors of the Ras/MEK/Erk signaling, and activated ETS2 sustains inflammatory responses by regulating the expression of inflammatory genes, including chemokines and matrix metallopeptidases (Mmp)41. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a direct target of ETS2 (ref. 42), was significantly downregulated by combination but not single-drug treatment in female kidney (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Syk was also downregulated by rapamycin and the combination treatment in male muscle (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Syk deficiency is protective against inflammation41, suggesting that its downregulation may have contributed to reduced inflammation in combination-treated mice. Expression of the two matrix metallopeptidases Mmp2 and Mmp13 was significantly downregulated in female but not male spleen upon combination treatment and with rapamycin for Mmp2 in female spleen (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). MMPs are involved in inflammation, and increased Mmp13 and Mmp2 expression is associated with increased tumor invasion and cancer progression43. Mmp2 interacts with the α-2-macroglobulin (A2m) gene, which was among the strongest downregulated genes by rapamycin and combination treatment in spleen (Extended Data Fig. 8e). A2m modulates immune and inflammatory processes and promotes pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic responses in cancer cells and macrophages44. A2m expression was also strongly downregulated by rapamycin and the combination treatment in the female kidney (Extended Data Fig. 8f). Elevated A2m levels are associated with kidney pathologies, including fibrosis and age-related kidney dysfunction45. Thus, rapamycin and the combination treatment may have alleviated age-related kidney fibrosis and dysfunction by lowering A2m levels. Interestingly, levels of Mmp12 were strongly increased by rapamycin and the combination treatment in both the female and male spleen (Extended Data Fig. 8g). Mmp12 usually promotes inflammation but has also been associated with anti-inflammatory effects46. Inflammatory gene expression was often sex specific. Although the drug treatments reduced Mmp expression only ín female mice, levels of chymotrypsin-like elastase (Cela) genes were exclusively downregulated in male mice (Extended Data Fig. 8h–j). Cela2a and Cela3b levels were significantly downregulated by single and combination drug treatments in male but not female spleen (Extended Data Fig. 8h,i). Furthermore, Cela1 was downregulated by rapamycin in the male muscle (Extended Data Fig. 8j). Cela genes are associated with inflammatory states47 and are also upregulated in cancer48.

In summary, the treatment with rapamycin and trametinib induced a drug-specific, sex-specific and tissue-specific remodeling of the aging transcriptome characterized by reduced expression of genes associated with inflammation and cancer growth.

We established that the FDA-approved drug trametinib, an inhibitor of RAS/Mek/Erk signaling, is geroprotective in mice and that its combination with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin has stronger effects than either drug alone in both female and male mice. The combination treatment produced an additive increase in lifespan, attenuated the decline in heart function with age, delayed tumor growth and overall tumor load and reduced brain and peripheral inflammation, suggesting improved health at old age. Several ongoing clinical trials address the potential of mTOR inhibitors as geroprotective drugs in humans49. Our study suggests that simultaneous inhibition of the mTOR and Ras–Mek–ERK pathway provides additional benefits that are worth exploring in humans.

Trametinib is used to treat metastatic melanomas and has also been used in clinical trials for treatment of solid tumors50. At a dose of 2 mg of trametinib per day, the drug is reasonably well tolerated, with side effects including skin rash, diarrhea, fatigue and retinopathy50. Average peak plasma levels in patients receiving 2 mg of trametinib daily were between 5.5 ng ml−1 and 7.5 ng ml−1 (ref. 50), which is significantly higher than the 0.1 ng ml−1 in mice fed with 1.44 mg of trametinib per kg of food. In a mouse model of mucosal melanoma, administering trametinib via oral gavage resulted in an average peak concentration of 23.8 ng ml−1 (ref. 51), which is more than 200-fold the concentration required for lifespan extension. Although effects of trametinib plasma levels might not be directly similar between chronic and acute application, these results suggest that higher trametinib doses are required for its anti-cancer effect than for lifespan extension. Consistently, tumor progression or load was not significantly changed in long-lived mice treated with trametinib, and the effects of 1.44 mg kg−1 trametinib on lifespan and health were mild. We, therefore, probably underdosed, and the optimal dose for geroprotection may be higher. In the pre-test, a dose of 2.88 mg kg−1 trametinib did not cause detrimental side effects and should be tested in future studies. It will also be important to assess the effects of late-onset and intermittent treatment, as these would be key to feasibility of and adherence to trametinib treatment in humans.

Combined treatment with rapamycin and trametinib increased lifespan by 29% and 27% in female and male mice, respectively, with no indication of any positive or negative interaction between the drugs, which had an additive effect on lifespan. It is not known what doses of rapamycin or trametinib produce a maximum increase in lifespan in mice or if these or their combination would also maximize late-life health. Nor is it known if the stronger geroprotection from combination treatment is a result of stronger target inhibition, additive inhibtion of more targets or some form of interaction between the drugs, for instance by prevention of signaling feedback.

Rapamycin caused liver lipidosis, hyperglycemia and testicular degeneration, whereas trametinib induced no obvious detrimental side effects. However, further in vivo experiments, including measurements of circulating insulin levels and glucose and insulin tolerance, will be necessary to confirm this. Apart from their longer lifespan, trametinib-treated mice showed only mild phenotypes, and the mechanisms contributing to their increased lifespan are currently unclear. Trametinib reduced spleen size at old age and caused a strong transcriptional response, especially in the male spleen, with an enrichment of GO terms associated with cell division and myeloid cell development. The Ras–Mek–Erk pathway controls B and T cell development, and Erk controls hyperproliferation in a mouse model of lymphoproliferative disease characterized by an enlargement of peripheral lymphoid organs52. Thus, trametinib may affect immunosenescence in the aging spleen.

Combination treatment with rapamycin and trametinib blocked the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake, and it also reduced density of activated microglia and astrocytes in several brain regions of female mice, indicative of reduced brain inflammation. Because trametinib did not cross the blood–brain barrier at the dose used, something else may have done so to decrease age-related inflammation in the brain. Treatment with the pro-longevity drugs acarbose, 17-α-estradiol and nordihydroguaiaretic acid specifically reduced age-associated inflammation in the hypothalamus of male but not female mice, whereas caloric restriction reduced brain inflammation in both sexes53. Geroprotection by drugs can be sex specific, and microglia show sex-related differences during development and aging54, so it will be important to assess the effects of combination treatment on brain inflammation in male mice. Another limitation of our study was that we could not measure the effect of rapamycin on brain glucose uptake and, therefore, did not address whether the effects of the combination treatment were caused by rapamycin. In addition, differences in region-specific glucose uptake and brain inflammation implicate additional currently unknown mechanisms.

The effects of the drugs were sex specific, especially at the molecular level. These included downregulation of plasma cytokines, which was more prominent in female mice, and the tissue-specific response in the transcriptome of aged animals. Sex-specific effects are commonly observed in longevity interventions55 and in interventions targeting the insulin–mTOR network56. Explanations could include differences in the aging process between male and female mice or in the bioavailability of the drugs. Indeed, trametinib plasma levels were significantly higher in female mice than in male mice. Rapamycin blood levels were also higher in female UM-Het3 mice20, but there was no sex difference in rapamycin plasma levels of the intermittently fed C3B6F1 mice used in this study22. Notably, despite higher plasma levels in female animals, the transcriptional response to trametinib treatment in the spleen was much stronger in male mice, suggesting that other processes than just drug bioavailability contribute to the sexually dimorphic molecular responses.

In summary, our results establish trametinib as a geroprotector that extends lifespan in mice. In combination with rapamycin, it acts additively to extend lifespan, and the drug combination induces late-life improvement in health at doses that have no detectable side effects. Trametinib should, therefore, be included in future trials to address whether it can geroprotect in humans, especially in combination with rapamycin.

All animal protocols were done in accordance with the guidelines of the Federation of the European Laboratory Animal Science Association (FELASA) and approved by the Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany (reference nos. 84-02.04.2017.A074 and 81-02.04.2019.A313).

Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages (Techniplast, GM500 Mouse IVC Green Line) in groups of five per cage, under specific pathogen-free conditions at 21 °C with 50–60% humidity and a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Mice had constant access to nesting material and chew sticks and ad libitum access to a standard rodent diet (Ssniff, R/MH low phytoestrogen; Ssniff Spezialdiäten GmbH) and sterile-filtered water. All mice were C3B6F1 hybrid, generated in-house by crossing C3H/HeOuJ female mice with C57BL/6NCrl male mice (strain codes 626 and 027, respectively; Charles River Laboratories).

For the trametinib pre-test experiment, 3-month-old male and female mice, five per treatment group, were fed with standard chow containing 0, 0.29, 0.58, 1.44, 2.88 or 11.52 mg of trametinib per kg of diet for 4 weeks. Mice were euthanized, and tissues were dissected for molecular and pathological analyses. At weaning, mice were fed a standard chow diet supplemented with the rapamycin encapsulation material Eudragit S100 (Evonik Cyro, 1-207-490-4242; 480 mg kg−1 diet). All experimental drug treatments started at 6 months of age, when control mice received a standard diet supplemented with the corresponding amount of Eudragit S100 (480 mg kg−1) and PEG-400 (3.2 ml kg−1). Animals treated with rapamycin received standard chow containing 42 mg kg−1 rapamycin (522 mg encapsulated rapamycin per kg) and PEG-400 (3.2 ml kg−1), and animals treated with trametinib received food containing 1.44 mg kg−1 trametinib, Eudragit S100 (480 mg kg−1) and PEG-400 (3.2 ml kg−1). Animals receiving the combined diet were fed with food containing 42 mg kg−1 rapamycin, 1.44 mg kg−1 trametinib and PEG-400 (3.2 ml kg−1). Trametinib was administered continuously. Rapamycin, whether alone or with rapamycin, was administered alternating between rapamycin and control food on a weekly basis22. Rapamycin was obtained from LC Laboratories and encapsulated by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). Trametinib was obtained from BIOZOL (1187431-43-1).

Survival of animals was assessed for a total of 876 mice: 482 male mice and 394 female mice. Mice for phenotyping, tissue collection and survival analysis were bred in three generations from the same breeding pairs. Mice of the phenotyping and tissue collection cohorts were included in the survival analysis and were censored at 24 months of age, when their tissues were collected. Health status of all mice was assessed daily using a standardized health score. Animals with poor health status were closely monitored and euthanized if they reached a predefined score. Mice were otherwise left undisturbed until they died of natural cause. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated using birth and death dates. Median lifespan was assessed, and survivorship was analyzed using log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard analysis. Maximum lifespan was assessed using the Wang–Allison test. Survival curves for control and rapamycin-treated mice of the lifespan cohort were previously published22.

Mice were euthanized using cervical dislocation. Tissues were dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Plasma was isolated by adding 1 μl of 500 mM EDTA per 100 μl of blood and subsequent centrifugation at 1,000g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Tissues for histopathological analysis were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for preparation of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues.

Cross-sectional histopathology of liver, heart, pancreas, kidney, WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT), spleen and testes of 24-month-old animals was carried out by Robert Klopfleisch (Institute of Veterinary Pathology, Freie Universität Berlin). Hematoxylin and eosin stainings were scored. Liver tissue was examined for the presence of lymphomas, sarcomas, benign or malignant tumors, lipidosis (diffuse or focal) and necrosis. Liver tumor grade was determined as 1 (low), 2 (moderate), 3 (high) and 4 (very high). Heart tissue was assessed for hypertrophy and fibrosis. In pancreas, inflammation, fat necrosis, lymphoma and exocrine atrophy were evaluated. For heart and pancreas, pathology presence was scored as 1 and absence as 0. In kidney, lymphoma, oxalate crystals and hydronephrosis were documented, and kidney inflammation and glomerulopathy were scored with 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe). WAT and BAT were scored for lymphoma, sarcoma, necrosis and granuloma and inflammation as 1 and absence of pathology as 0. In spleen, extramedullary hematopoiesis, lymphomas, sarcomas, germinal center and mantle zone hyperplasia were scored with 1 or 0 (absence). Testes were examined for atrophy or degeneration.

Dead mice were assessed for tumor load and location, organ enlargement and abnormalities, including organ discoloration or granulation. The presence and severity of tumors was scored with 0 (absence), 1 (one tumor in one organ), 2 (multiple tumors or tumor diameter > 3 cm in one organ or metastasis in two organs) and 3 (severe metastasis in three or more organs). Other lesions were scored with 1 or 0 (absence). The severity of pathology was adjusted upon combination of multiple pathological findings.

Next, 20 µl of plasma was mixed with 1 ml of a −20 °C methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE):methanol:water (5:3:2 (v:v:v)) mixture, containing 10 ng ml−1 everolimus as internal standard. Samples were incubated for 30 minutes at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 21,000g and 4 °C for 10 minutes. Supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes, and 150 μl of MTBE and 100 µl of UPC/MS-grade water (BioSolve) were added and incubated for 15 minutes at 15 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 5 minutes, 16,000g at 15 °C. The MTBE phase was dried in a Speed Vacuum concentrator and resuspended in 80 µl of 70:30 (v:v) acetonitrile:isopropanol (BioSolve) containing 5% dimethylsulfoxid. Samples were vortexed, incubated for 5 minutes in a sonication bath, filtered through a 0.2-µm filter and then transferred to autosampler vials, and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed using a Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters) coupled to an Acquity iClass liquid chromatography system (Waters). Samples were analyzed using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method. For the absolute quantification of trametinib levels, trametinib standards were diluted to concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 10, 40, 200, 600, 1,200, 2,400 and 3,600 ng ml−1. LC–MS data were analyzed using TargetLynx software (version 4.1, Waters).

Plasma measurements of AST and ALP levels were performed by Laboklin GmbH & Co. KG, Diagnostic Laboratory.

Plasma glucose levels were measured using a glucose monitor (Roche, Accu-Chek Instant).

Plasma protein levels were measured via proximity extension assay in EDTA plasma samples using the Olink Target 96 Mouse Exploratory panel (Olink Proteomics). Protein expression values were normalized using the Ct values of extension controls and a relative correction factor determined by Olink. Normalized protein expression (NPX) values on a log2 scale were analyzed. Eighty-four out of 86 plasma samples provided high-quality data. A total of 74 proteins were evaluated, representing greater than 75% quantification values as determined by values above the limit of detection. Individual protein measurements at old age between treatment groups were compared using Kruskal–Wallis and post hoc Mann–Whitney U-test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction (scipy Python library version 1.6.2).

Next, 5–10 mg of liver tissue was lysed in 400 μl of RIPA buffer (Pierce) containing cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor without EDTA (Roche) and PhosStop phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) in FastPrep Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals, 116913100) using FastPrep-24 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein extracts were incubated on ice for 10 minutes and placed in a sonicator water bath filled for 10 minutes. Centrifugation for 15 minutes at 15,871g and 4 °C followed. Protein quantification was performed using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, 23225). Samples were boiled; Laemmli buffer at ¼ of the total volume and 5% β-mercaptoethanol were added; and protein extracts were stored at −80 °C.

Next, 20 μg of protein extracts was loaded and separated using 12% acrylamide gels (Criterion TGX Stain-Free Protein Gel; Bio-Rad, 5678044) and blotted on PVDF membranes (Amersham Hybond, GE10600023; Merck) at 80 V, for 1 hour, on ice. Membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat dry milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) at room temperature (RT) for 1 hour and then incubated with primary antibodies for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:1,000, anti-rabbit; Cell Signaling Technology, 4370) and total ERK1/2 (1:1,000, anti-rabbit; Cell Signaling Technology, 4695) in 5% fatty-acid-free BSA in TBS-T at 4 °C overnight. Blots were washed 3 × 15 minutes in TBS-T and incubated with HRP-coupled secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted in 5% milk in TBS-T for 1 hour at RT, followed by 3 × 15-minute washes in TBS-T at RT. For signal development, ECL Select Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare) was applied, and image acquisition was performed using a ChemiDoc XRS+ System (Bio-Rad). Western blot signals were quantified using Image Lab Software (Bio-Rad) and normalized against non-drug-treated controls.

Brains of 6-month-old control female mice and 24-month-old control, rapamycin, trametinib and combined female mice were dissected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 2–4 hours at RT and overnight at 4 °C. Brains were dehydrated in 30% sucrose in 1× PBS and frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT (Labtech) on dry ice. Then, 25-μm brain sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica Biosystems, CM1850) and mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For immunostainings, slides were washed with PBS for 10 minutes, permeabilized with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 15 minutes and washed in PBST for 5 minutes. Samples were incubated with 2% normal goat serum in PBST at RT and then incubated with primary antibodies in 2% normal goat serum in PBST overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies included: ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1, 1:500; Wako, 019-19741) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich, G3893). Slides were washed 3 × 15 min in PBST and incubated for 1 hour with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:1,000 in 2% normal goat serum at RT. Secondary antibodies included: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11008, to detect Iba-1) and Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21126, to detect GFAP). Slides were washed 2 × 10 min in PBST and 1 × 10 min in PBS and incubated for 30 min with DAPI (1:10,000 in PBS). Slides were washed with PBS for 10 min and embedded using VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium without DAPI (VectorLabs).

Imaging was performed using a Leica SP8 upright confocal microscope and Application Suite X 3.0.15 software (Leica Microsystems). Then, 40-μm z-stack confocal images were acquired at 2-μm intervals, with ×40/1.3 oil objective. Settings were standardized for all treatment groups during image acquisition. Representative montages from z-stack confocal images were used, and image processing was performed using ImageJ (Fiji) software version 2.3.0/1.53q. For quantification of astrocytes and microglia density, the cell counter tool was used to count GFAP+ or Iba-1+ cells that overlapped with DAPI+ nuclei, respectively, in 10–15 images per brain region per mouse brain.

Next, 4–10 mg of spleen, muscle and kidney samples were homogenized in 1 ml of TRIzol (Life Technologies) using FastPrep-24. Samples were incubated at RT for 5 minutes. Then, 200 μl of chloroform was added, and samples were incubated at RT for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 minutes at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new RNAse-free tube. Then, 500 μl of isopropanol, 50 μl of 3.0 M NaOAc and 1.5 μl of glycogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added, and the mix was incubated at −80 °C for 30 minutes. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. RNA pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol, air dried for 5–10 minutes and resuspended in 30 μl of RNAse-free water. RNA samples were treated with DNAse using a TURBO DNAse Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing of kidney, spleen and muscle RNA was performed by Admera Health. poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using a NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Kit (New England Biolabs). Prior to first-strand synthesis, samples were randomly primed (5′ d(N6) 3′ (N = A,C,G,T)) and fragmented. First-strand synthesis was done using ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase. Library construction was done according to a NEBNext Ultra II Non-Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, E7760L). Final libraries quantity was assessed by Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quality was assessed by TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies). Illumina 8-nt dual indices were used. Equimolar pooling of libraries was performed based on QC values and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq S4 with a read length configuration of 150 bp for 50 million paired-end reads per sample. Libraries read processing was automated using Flaski (version 3.11.34). Raw reads were mapped to the mm39 ENSEMBL build 105 using kallisto (version 0.46.1). Gene counts were quantified in the same step. Differential gene expression was analyzed using DESeq2 (version 1.24.0) in R (version 3.6.3). Data were processed using numpy (version 1.12.0), scipy (version 1.7.1) and pandas (version 1.2.0). Results were visualized using matplotlib (version 3.3.2), matplotlib-venn (version 0.11.5) and seaborn (version 0.11.1). GO enrichment analysis was performed using the DAVID API-based function DAVIDenrich of the AGEpy Python package (version 0.8.2) on the GOTERM_BP_FAT ontology to identify significantly enriched terms (Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P < 0.05). As background, all expressed genes of a tissue were used. Redundancy of significantly enriched GO terms (adjusted P < 0.05) was reduced using REVIGO (cutoff: 0.7, valueType: pvalue, measure: SIMREL). GO terms were visualized using dot plot representation.

PET imaging was as described in ref. 57 using an Inveon preclinical PET/CT system (Siemens). CT data were used for attenuation correction of the PET data, and the CT image of the scull was used for image co-registration. Plasma glucose levels were determined from a tail vein blood sample using a standard glucometer (Bayer) after removing the tail vein catheters. PET data were histogrammed in timeframes of 12 × 30 s, 3 × 60 s, 3 × 120 s and 7 × 240 s, rebinned in three dimensions (3D), and images were reconstructed using the MAP-SP algorithm provided by the manufacturer. The imaging analysis software Vinci was used to co-register images to a 3D mouse brain atlas constructed from the two-dimensional (2D) mouse brain atlas (Paxinos). Kinetic modeling was performed as described in ref. 57. The ratio of tissue and plasma glucose concentrations (CE/CP) is a measure for glucose transport and is given by CE/CP = K1 / (k2 + k3 / 0.26)26,57. Because cellular activation is accompanied by increased glucose transport and this parameter is less sensitive to changes in plasma glucose level, we use alterations of glucose transport (CE/CP) as surrogate for alterations in neuronal activation. Statistical testing was performed by application of a voxel-wise t-test between groups. 3D maps of P values allow for identification of regions with significant differences in the parameters. From these regions, we defined volumes of interest (VOIs) and performed additional statistical testing.

A separate mouse cohort of 15 mice per treatment group was used to evaluate drug-related and age-related changes in healthspan, behavior and fitness. Experiments were performed at 12 months (middle-aged) and 20–22 months (old) of age. All tests were carried out during the light phase, and experimenters were blinded to the treatment group.

Electrocardiography (ECG) was performed non-invasively using the ECGenie system (Mouse Specifics). For acclimatization, each mouse was placed on the training platform for 10 minutes and then placed on the measurement platform on interchangeable electrodes that transmit the electrical signals to a computer for a maximum of 10 minutes. Signals with a heart rate variation that exceeded 35 bpm were excluded, and average heart rate per mouse was evaluated.

Motor coordination was assessed using a Rotarod (TSE Systems, type 3375-M5). Measurement started at low speed (5 r.p.m.), and the revolving rate was continuously increased to 40 r.p.m. over a period of 300 s. The total time that each mouse spent on the rod, with a cutoff time of 300 s, was measured. The test was performed on four consecutive days, and only data from day four were used for the analysis.

Endurance was measured using a treadmill (TSE Systems, type 3033401-M-04/C). Mice were acclimatized to the experimental setup for 5 minutes under low speed (0.1 m s−1). A progressively accelerating speed was applied from 0.1 m s−1 for another 10 minutes to 1.3 m s−1 within 60 minutes. A mild electroshock (0.3 mA) was applied for 5 s, followed by 5 s of refractory period as soon as mice slowed down beyond a critical point and crossed the laser beam for more than 2 s to ensure that mice stopped running only upon exhaustion. Exhaustion was defined as the willingness of a mouse to withstand three consecutive shocks instead of continuing running.

For the open field experiment using a ActiMot2 (TSE Systems), mice were placed in a 50 cm × 50 cm × 40 cm box and were allowed to freely explore for 10 minutes. The test chamber was illuminated to 20–30 lux. Total activity, speed and time spent in the center were recorded via infrared sensors.

Mice were placed in a Y-shaped maze and their activity recorded for 5 minutes using a video tracking system (TSE Systems, VideoMot). Global speed indicates the average speed of the mice during the 5-minute measurement period. Percent alternating arm visits were calculated as a read-out for spatial working memory.

Experiments were performed in a randomized and blinded fashion whenever possible. For the survival, phenotyping and tissue collection cohorts, female mice were randomly allocated to cages after weaning using simple randomization. Male mice were weaned litter-wise to reduce aggressive behavior. If male mice of different litters had to be combined, a ratio of 2:3 was preferred over 4:1. Cages were assigned to treatment groups using simple randomization. Tissue samples used for histopathology, RNA-seq, plasma protein and trametinib level measurements were randomized prior to extraction/analysis using simple randomization. Mouse survival data and postmortem pathology were scored by mouse caretakers, who were unaware of the study design. All phenotyping experiments were performed with the experimenters blinded to treatment. Histopathology was scored in a blinded manner by an external pathologist. Plasma protein levels and RNA-seq measurements were performed by external companies in a blinded manner. Confocal imaging and image analysis were performed in a blinded manner. 18-FDG-CT/PET scans were measured by an external facility with the experimenters unaware of study design. In ECG measurements, signals with a heart rate variation that exceeded 35 bpm were excluded. Three samples were excluded from the RNA-seq analysis (1× male muscle trametinib, 1× female muscle combined and 1× female kidney rapamycin), as they presented as clear outliers in the principal component analysis (PCA). Otherwise, no data were excluded from the analyses. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications10,22. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 and 10.3.0, except for Cox proportional hazard analysis, which was performed in R. Number of animals and statistical tests are indicated in the figures and figure legends. For multiple comparison testing, one-way and two-way ANOVA were followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. To test for differences in the proportion of mice affected by pathologies, chi-square test and Poisson regressions were used. The counts of mice where the pathological finding was present or absent was set as the dependent variable, and the absence of pathology (score 0) was set as the reference classification. Comparisons were performed against control mice as reference.

a–c Western blot analysis of Erk1/2 phosphorylation as a proxy for Ras/Mek/Erk pathway activity in a kidney, b spleen and c muscle of females and males after 4 weeks of treatment with 0, 1.44 and 11.52 mg/kg trametinib. Representative Western blot (upper panel) and corresponding quantification (lower panel) (n = 5 tested organs of individual animals per treatment and sex). Significance was tested by One-Way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc test. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Adjusted p values are shown. d, Water consumption of female and male mice was not significantly changed. e,f, Plasma level of Aspartate transaminase (AST) (e) and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) (f) as biomarkers of liver health were not significantly changed. Significance was tested by One-Way ANOVA. N = 5 per treatment for both sexes. Data in d-f are presented as mean ± SEM.

Survival curves of a–c female and d–f male mice of the a, d lifespan, b, e tissue collection and c, f phenotyping cohort. The corresponding pooled data are presented in Fig. 2. (Sample size lifespan cohort: control ♂ n = 52, ♀ n = 52, rapamycin ♂ n = 52, ♀ n = 51, trametinib ♂ n = 52, ♀ n = 51, combined ♂ n = 51, ♀ n = 51; tissue collection cohort: control ♂ n = 53, ♀ n = 33, rapamycin ♂ n = 53, ♀ n = 32, trametinib ♂ n = 54, ♀ n = 32, combined ♂ n = 54, ♀ n = 32; phenotyping cohort n = 15 for all treatments). Trametinib significantly extended lifespan in male mice and the combined treatment significantly increased lifespan compared to the individual drug treatments in both males and females when only survival of the lifespan cohort was analyzed. In the female lifespan cohort, trametinib showed a similar trend but the effect on lifespan was not significant, due to the limited power of the smaller sample size (females lifespan cohort: control vs rapa p < 0,0001, control vs tram p < 0.0697, control vs rapa/tram p < 0,0001, rapa vs tram p = 0.0005, rapa vs rapa/tram p = 0.0004, tram vs rapa/tram p < 0.0001; males lifespan cohort: control vs rapa p < 0,0001, control vs tram p = 0,0020, control vs rapa/tram p < 0,0001, rapa vs tram p = 0.1799, rapa vs rapa/tram p = 0.0283, tram vs rapa/tram p = 0.0006, log rank test). Survival curves for control and rapamycin treated mice of the lifespan cohort were previously published22. Within the different cohorts all treatments were run in parallel.

Data were analysed using a mixed effect model testing for the interaction between Rapamycin x Trametinib x Age followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test to test for significance changes between 12 and 22 months indicated by p values above the connecting lines and between drug treatments and control at 12 or 22 months indicated by p values next to the dots. Significant terms from the interaction analysis and the corresponding p-values are indicated per panel. N numbers (12 M, 22 M) for: female body weight, rota rod: Control (15/13), Rapamycin (15/13), Trametinib (15/10) Rapamycin/Trametinib (15/15); male body weight, rota rod: Control (14/10), Rapamycin (15/13), Trametinib (15/13), Rapamycin/Trametinib (15/15); female heart rate, QT-interval: Control (15/9), Rapamycin (15/10), Trametinib (8/10) Rapamycin/Trametinib (7/7); male heart rate, QT-interval: Control (15/9), Rapamycin (15/10), Trametinib (8/10) Rapamycin/Trametinib (7/7). N numbers (22 M female, 20 M male) for: open field: Control (13,11), Rapamycin (14,13), Trametinib (12,13) Rapamycin/Trametinib (15,15); treadmill: Control (13,11), Rapamycin (14,13), Trametinib (12,13), (Rapamycin/Trametinib (15,15).

a body weight. b nuclear magnetic resonance measurement of b % body fat and c % lean mass. Metabolic cages were used to measure d water uptake e food uptake relative to body weight and f, g respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during f day and g night. Measurements were done in batches between the age of 15–18 months. Rapamycin and combined treatment significantly reduced body weight in male but not female mice, but had no effect on water or food uptake. Fat content was significantly increased upon combined treatment in females. Lean mass was significantly decreased in trametinib and combined treated females. Males showed no significant differences in fat or lean mass. All drug treatments significantly reduced night-time RER in males but not females. h glucose, i aspartate transaminase (AST) and j alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level in blood plasma of 24 months old animals. Rapamycin but not trametinib significantly increased plasma glucose levels in male and female mice. Combination of trametinib and rapamycin did not further increase plasma glucose levels compared to rapamycin treated animals. One-Way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. Numbers in brackets indicate the number of plasma samples of different animals assessed per treatment. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.

Quantification of immunohistochemical stainings measuring the density of activated microglia (DAPI/Iba-1 positive cells) and astrocyte (DAPI/GFAP positive cells) in a, b hippocampus, c, d cortex and e, f cerebellum of 6-months old control animals (young) and 24 months-old control and drug-treated females. Microglia and astrocyte density significantly increased with age in the hippocampus and cortex of control animals, but not in the cerebellum. Single drug treatment did not significantly reduce microglia or astrocyte density in the hippocampus, cortex or cerebellum. g, h Brain levels of trametinib increased in a dose-dependent manner upon feeding g female or h male animals for 4 weeks with food containing 0, 0.29, 0.58, 1.44, 2.88 or 11.52 mg/kg of drug. N = 5 brain samples were measured via mass spectrometry per treatment. Only samples with significant trametinib levels above background are shown. Trametinib was undetectable in the brain of animals fed with 0, 0.29 and 0.58 mg/kg trametinib, and only very low levels were detected in animals fed with 1.44 and 2.88 mg/kg trametinib. Only at 11.52 mg/kg trametinib, higher levels of trametinib were detected in the brain. One-Way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. 10–15 confocal images per brain region were averaged per sample in a–f. Numbers in brackets indicate the number of brain regions of different animals analyzed per treatment. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.

Metrics details

Molecular determinants of KRAS(G12C)inhibitor efficacy in KRASG12C-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain poorly characterized. Here we report one of the largest integrated analyses to date of sotorasib clinical efficacy biomarkers from the phase 2 CodeBreaK 100 and phase 3 CodeBreaK 200 studies. We reveal differential sotorasib activity and relative benefit compared to docetaxel across KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC co-mutational subsets and transcriptional subtypes. We also identify low expression of TTF1 and KEAP1 co-mutations/NRF2 activation as major determinants of sotorasib anti-tumor efficacy and adverse prognostic features. Exploratory analyses highlight potential tumor cell-extrinsic contributors to sotorasib anti-tumor activity and suggest that early on-treatment clearance of KRASG12C- circulating tumor DNA may refine clinical response prediction algorithms. Our findings advance precision medicine for patients with KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC and establish a framework for patient stratification and selection for treatment intensification with rationally applied therapeutic combinations.

Mutations in the KRAS gene represent the most prevalent oncogenic driver event in non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 25–30%)1,2. KRAS mutations mostly result in a glycine-to-cysteine substitution at position 12 KRAS(G12C), accounting for approximately 13–17% of lung adenocarcinomas1,3,4,5 and approximately 10% of NSCLC6. Discovery of a cryptic allosteric pocket in the switch 2 region of GDP-bound KRAS(G12C) paved the way for the identification, clinical development and regulatory approval of inactive state-selective covalent inhibitors of KRAS(G12C), which has revolutionized the treatment landscape of KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC7,8.

Inhibitors of GDP-bound and/or GTP-bound KRAS(G12C) are in various stages of clinical development7,9,10,11,12. Sotorasib is a first-in-class small molecule that specifically and irreversibly inhibits the KRAS(G12C) protein, exerting selective anti-tumor activity5. Sotorasib has accelerated or full approval in more than 50 countries for adults with KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who received one or more prior systemic therapies based on the phase 2 global CodeBreaK 100 (CB100) trial13,14,15. The phase 3 CodeBreaK 200 (CB200) study demonstrated clinical efficacy and tolerability of sotorasib versus docetaxel in patients with previously treated, advanced NSCLC16. The KRAS(G12C) inhibitor adagrasib is also approved for patients with previously treated advanced KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC17,18. Despite remarkable progress, there is considerable interpatient variability in clinical outcomes with KRAS(G12C) inhibitors and a lack of validated biomarkers that can robustly identify patients likely to derive long-term benefit from monotherapy versus patients who exhibit early disease progression and may benefit from an intensified, combination therapeutic strategy.

The efficacy of inactive state-selective KRAS(G12C) inhibitors can be curtailed due to primary insensitivity or the emergence of adaptive or acquired resistance19,20,21. Co-occurring genomic alterations detected at baseline have been reported to affect responses to diverse systemic therapies, including KRAS(G12C) inhibitors22,23. Among patients harboring pathogenic co-mutations in the KEAP1, SMARCA4 and CDKN2A tumor suppressor genes, early disease progression and poor clinical outcomes were previously reported with sotorasib or adagrasib24. Adaptive resistance due to synthesis and GTP loading of new KRAS(G12C) resulting from increased RTK drive and feedback pathway reactivation through wild-type (WT) KRAS, NRAS or HRAS can also impair the activity of KRAS(G12C) inhibitors25,26. Furthermore, tumor cell-extrinsic factors, including innate and adaptive host immune responses and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME), were reported to modulate responses to KRAS extinction or inhibition27,28. Finally, after initial response, diverse and frequently co-incident mechanisms of acquired resistance to KRAS(G12C) inhibition were identified, including emergence of secondary alterations in RAS genes or other components of the RTK–RAS–MAPK pathway, as well as lineage switching19,21,29. In view of the heterogeneity of individual responses to KRAS(G12C) inhibitors, improved understanding of molecular determinants of response and resistance and the development of clinically actionable biomarkers constitute critical unmet needs to inform individual therapeutic decisions and guide the clinical development of combination therapies for patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced NSCLC.

Here we present a comprehensive, integrative analysis of baseline genomic and transcriptomic biomarker data and on-treatment dynamic changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from the CB100 and CB200 datasets, collectively representing one of the largest cohorts to date of patients with NSCLC prospectively treated in clinical trials of any KRAS(G12C) inhibitor.

Datasets included 317 biomarker-evaluable patients with previously treated advanced KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC who enrolled in CB200 and 112 biomarker-evaluable patients treated in CB100 (Fig. 1). Clinical outcomes in biomarker-evaluable populations were similar to the intention-to-treat (ITT) population across both studies (Extended Data Table 1). Overall, clinical covariates were well balanced between the two studies, although a few small but significant differences were noted (Extended Data Table 2).

Baseline tissue samples (fresh/archival) were analyzed using the Tempus xT assay, which combined a 648-gene targeted DNA sequencing panel and whole-transcriptome RNA. PD-L1 protein level was assessed by local standard-of-care testing. Pre-treatment and post-treatment samples were assessed using plasma NGS: Resolution ctDx Lung assay (23 genes).

Co-occurring genomic alterations introduce biological heterogeneity in KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC and may affect responses to systemic therapies, including KRAS(G12C) inhibitors13,18,22,24,30,31. Hence, we interrogated the interaction of gene mutation status across both studies and treatment arms (n = 312) with clinical outcomes. The most frequently co-mutated genes were TP53 (38.46%), STK11 (34.29%), CDKN2A (18.27%), ATM (16.35%), KEAP1 (15.71%) and LRP1B (10.58%) (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Table 3), which was largely consistent with previous reports from prospective and retrospective studies.

a, Oncoprint of alterations (pathogenic or potentially pathogenic based on OncoKB, SnpEff and FATHMM designation) in patients with available tissue NGS data at baseline (CB100 + CB200 sotorasib and docetaxel arms). The rows indicate genes with reported alterations (short variants, copy number variants (gain or loss), insertions, deletions or fusions) sorted based on prevalence. Of note, 10 patients from CB200 (3.2% of patients across both CodeBreaK studies) were negative for KRASG12C by retrospective tissue NGS. However, 8 of 10 patients were still reported to be KRASG12C positive by the plasma ctDNA assay. Tissue heterogeneity and sample quality likely account for this discordance. All patients, including those with lack of KRASG12C detection by retrospectively performed tissue NGS, had prospective central laboratory confirmation of KRASG12C in tissues using the pre-defined diagnostic companion assay (KRAS RGQ PCR Kit (Qiagen)). Hence, these patients were included in the analyses. b, Forest plot showing hazard of progression (HR (95% CI)) with sotorasib compared to docetaxel treatment in CB200 patients grouped based on specified genomic alterations.

Sotorasib trended toward increased progression-free survival (PFS) compared to docetaxel across most co-alteration–defined patient subgroups in CB200 (Fig. 2b). In treatment-by-biomarker interaction analyses, testing all reported genomic alterations with sufficient prevalence (Methods), ATM status was the only genomic biomarker associated with differential PFS benefit across study arms (interaction P = 0.009; false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P = 0.092; Fig. 2c). Specifically, patients with ATMWT NSCLC had significantly longer PFS with sotorasib versus docetaxel (median PFS (mPFS), 5.72 months versus 4.01 months; P = 0.0026; log-rank test), whereas patients with ATMMUT NSCLC had numerically improved PFS with docetaxel versus sotorasib (mPFS, 8.25 months versus 4.17 months; P = 0.13; log-rank test; Fig. 2d). Patients with ATMWT NSCLC were significantly more likely to exhibit long-term benefit (PFS ≥ 6 months) versus early disease progression (PFS ≤ 3 months) with sotorasib versus docetaxel (P = 0.0197; logistic regression; Extended Data Fig. 1a). Among 205 patients treated with sotorasib in the combined CB100/CB200 dataset, ATM co-mutations were associated with significantly shorter PFS (mPFS; ATMMUT versus ATMWT, P = 0.032; log-rank test; Fig. 2e); consistent trends were observed in individual studies (Fig. 2c, left panel, and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Overall survival (OS) with sotorasib was not affected by pathogenic ATM mutations (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

KEAP1 mutational status was not predictive of differential PFS benefit from sotorasib versus docetaxel in CB200 (interaction P = 0.2; FDR-adjusted P = 0.51). Patients with KEAP1-mutated NSCLC had significantly shorter PFS (P = 0.028, log-rank test; Fig. 2f) and OS (P = 0.00054, log-rank test; Fig. 2g) with sotorasib compared to those bearing KEAP1WT tumors in the combined dataset, with consistent trends across the individual studies (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Accordingly, patients with KEAP1WT NSCLC were more likely to exhibit long-term benefit versus early disease progression with sotorasib compared to those bearing KEAP1MUT tumors (P = 0.0125, logistic regression; Extended Data Fig. 1f).

Based on previous reports24, we evaluated the potential effect of co-alterations in SMARCA4 and STK11. In both the combined dataset and CB200, pathogenic alterations in SMARCA4 were not associated with significant differences in PFS or OS with sotorasib or docetaxel, although patients with SMARCA4MUT tumors more frequently displayed early disease progression (Extended Data Fig. 1g). When analyzing studies separately, there was a discordant interaction of STK11 alteration with clinical outcomes (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). In CB200, pathogenic STK11 alterations were associated with significantly shorter PFS and OS in both sotorasib and docetaxel arms (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), supporting a poorly prognostic role. In contrast, no significant differences in PFS or OS were detected between sotorasib-treated patients in CB100 with STK11MUT versus STK11WT NSCLC (Extended Data Fig. 2c). These conclusions were upheld when limited to patients bearing STK11MUT/KEAP1WT tumors (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Thus, additional biological modifiers may account for the heterogeneous clinical responses to sotorasib and other KRAS(G12C) inhibitors in patients with KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC with STK11 co-mutations.

Because the co-mutational profile alone may not fully capture the diversity of KRAS-mutated NSCLC, the transcriptional landscape of KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC and its impact on clinical outcomes with sotorasib was examined. An unbiased, non-negative matrix factorization-based analysis of KRAS-mutated NSCLC previously identified three robust and reproducible transcriptional subtypes, termed KP, KL and KC, based on distinct co-occurring genomic alteration enrichment patterns30. Key features of KP tumors include enrichment in mesenchymal gene signatures, frequent TP53 co-alterations and a typically ‘hot' T cell-inflamed TME with high levels of tumor cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. KL tumors are characterized by frequent inactivating STK11 genomic alterations and/or functional LKB1 inactivation, a ‘cold' CD8-positive T cell-depleted TME with low levels of tumor cell PD-L1 expression and increased prevalence of KEAP1 co-alterations with evidence of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway activation. Prominent features of KC tumors encompass reduced thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) expression, frequent mucinous differentiation, evidence of NRF2 pathway activation in a subset of cases and enrichment for bi-allelic CDKN2A/CDKN2B loss events30,32. In the combined dataset of 234 patients with KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC and available baseline tumor RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, KP/KL/KC subtypes accounted for 42.3%, 35.0% and 22.6% of tumors, respectively (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a), consistent with their previously reported prevalence across diverse datasets30,33. KP/KL/KC subtypes exhibited the anticipated co-mutation enrichment patterns, and KC tumors expressed substantially lower levels of NKX2.1/TTF1 mRNA (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Table 4).

We assessed the efficacy of sotorasib compared to docetaxel in KP/KL/KC transcriptional subtypes in CB200 and observed subtype-dependent differences in anti-tumor activity. A Cox proportional hazards model of PFS versus the interaction of transcriptional subtype and treatment suggested that the independent effect of subtype (P = 0.008) was more significant than the interaction with treatment (P = 0.28). Patients with KL tumors (representing 27% of CB200 patients receiving sotorasib) had improved mPFS with sotorasib compared to docetaxel (mPFS, 5.85 months versus 2.69 months; FDR-adjusted P = 0.011; log-rank test; hazard ratio (HR), 0.4; P = 0.07; Fig. 3b). In contrast, no significant differences in PFS were observed between sotorasib-treated and docetaxel-treated patients in the KP and KC subgroups. In patients with KP tumors, both treatments resulted in numerically longer but similar PFS (mPFS, 7.75 months versus 7.16 months; P = 0.33), whereas shorter PFS with either sotorasib or docetaxel was observed in the KC subgroup (mPFS, 3.94 months versus 3.02 months; P = 0.56). No significant subgroup-specific differences in OS were detected between treatment arms (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

Next, we compared the efficacy of sotorasib in the KP/KL/KC transcriptional subtypes in the combined dataset. Consistent with CB200, PFS with sotorasib varied widely across KP/KL/KC subtypes and was shorter in patients with KC tumors (mPFS, 2.92 (KC), 8.11 (KL) and 7.75 (KP) months; P = 0.016; log-rank test; Fig. 3c). This patient group was further skewed toward early disease progression versus long-term benefit with sotorasib (Extended Data Fig. 3e). OS was markedly different between subtypes and was significantly curtailed in patients with KC tumors (median OS (mOS), 5.82 (KC), 16.62 (KL) and 16.0 (KP) months; P = 3.5 × 10−5; log-rank test), corresponding to a higher hazard of death compared to those bearing either KL (HR (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4 (1.4–4.4)), FDR-adjusted P = 2.7 × 10−3) or KP (2.9 (1.7–4.9), FDR-adjusted P = 1.6 × 10−4) NSCLC (Fig. 3d).

Because a substantial fraction of KC NSCLC express low levels of TTF-1, we further assessed whether expression of TTF-1 could more precisely separate clinical outcomes with sotorasib30. We partitioned tumors into TTF1-high (TTF1High) and TTF1-low (TTF1Low) based on NKX2.1/TTF1 mRNA expression. Across the combined dataset, 17.5% of KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC were classified as TTF1Low (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with the previously reported prevalence of TTF-1-negative KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (~15%)34. Patients treated with sotorasib bearing TTF1Low tumors exhibited significantly shorter PFS (mPFS, 2.76 months (TTF1Low) versus 8.11 months (TTF1High); P = 2.9 × 10−9; log-rank test; HR (95% CI), 0.23 (0.14–0.4)) and OS (mOS, 4.47 months (TTF1Low) versus 16 months (TTF1High); P = 2.7 × 10−8; HR (95% CI), 0.26 (0.15–0.43)) and significantly lower objective response rate (ORR) (4.17% versus 42.1%; P = 0.000151; Fisher's exact test; odds ratio (OR) (95% CI, 16.55 (2.52–701.28))) compared to patients treated with sotorasib harboring TTF1High tumors (Fig. 3e–g). The adverse effect of TTF1Low status was observed when analysis was limited to KC tumors (Extended Data Fig. 3f,g). Although TTF1 status was not predictive of sotorasib benefit versus docetaxel in CB200, patients with TTF1High tumors had improved PFS with sotorasib versus docetaxel (mPFS, 7.26 months versus 4.83 months, respectively; HR (95% CI), 0.62 (0.36–1.07); Tukey adjusted P = 0.11, z-test; Extended Data Fig. 3h,i). These results indicate that TTF-1 status represents a robust and clinically tractable determinant of sotorasib efficacy.

Because KEAP1 alterations were associated with inferior clinical outcomes, we examined whether activation of a NRF2-driven transcriptional program that may capture both KEAP1/NFE2L2/CUL3-mutated and a subset of WT tumors could affect the clinical efficacy of sotorasib. For this, we used a previously validated gene expression signature35. In the combined dataset with available RNA-seq data, 21.8% of tumors were classified as NRF2High and 78.2% as NRF2Low (Fig. 4a). Notable differences in the fraction of NRF2High tumors were observed across distinct co-mutation-defined cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Concordant with the role of KEAP1 as a regulator of NRF2 stability, 78.8% (26/33) of KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC with KEAP1 co-alterations were NRF2High. NRF2High status was further documented in 22.9% (11/48) and 9.1% (12/132) of STK11MUT/KEAP1WT and STK11WT/KEAP1WT tumors, respectively. The prevalence of NRF2High tumors differed considerably among the KP/KL/KC subgroups (1.0%, 32.9% and 43.4%, respectively; P = 3.3 × 10−13; Fisher's exact test; Extended Data Fig. 4b), in agreement with earlier reports30, as well as between TTF1High and TTF1Low tumors (16.1% versus 48.8%, respectively; P = 3.212 × 10−5; Fisher's exact test).

Consistent with previous reports linking NRF2 activation and aggressive NSCLC35, patients with NRF2High tumors exhibited significantly shorter PFS with sotorasib compared to those bearing NRF2Low tumors in the combined dataset (mPFS, 2.73 months versus 7.75 months; P = 0.0016; log-rank test; Fig. 4b), with trends observed in individual studies (Extended Data Fig. 4c). OS was significantly shorter in patients harboring NRF2High tumors (mOS, NRF2High 6.05 months versus NRF2Low 16.0 months; P = 3 × 10−4; Fig. 4c). These results were in agreement with a recent study that reported inferior clinical outcomes with adagrasib in patients with NRF2High tumors in the KRYSTAL-1 trial36. Among patients with NRF2Low KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC, sotorasib resulted in improved PFS compared to docetaxel in CB200 (mPFS, 6.24 months versus 4.47 months; P = 0.015; log-rank test; Extended Data Fig. 4d), although NRF2Low was not predictive of differential PFS benefit (treatment-by-biomarker interaction analyses; FDR-adjusted P = 0.7). No difference in PFS was observed between the two treatment arms in patients with NRF2High tumors (Extended Data Fig. 4d). OS was not different between treatment arms in either NRF2Low or NRF2High tumors.

NE, not estimable.

Finally, we examined whether integration of TTF-1 and NRF2 status would further refine stratification of clinical outcomes with sotorasib in the combined dataset. Remarkably, the integrated analysis yielded three groups with markedly distinct clinical trajectories. Low TTF1 expression was the hallmark of the poor prognosis group, regardless of NRF2 status (mPFS (95% CI), 2.76 (1.41–3.12) months; TTF1Low; Fig. 4d; mOS (95% CI), 4.47 (3.15–7.92) months; TTF1Low; Fig. 4e). Among patients with TTF1High tumors, NRF2Low status identified a group (70.3% of the entire population) with prolonged PFS (mPFS (95% CI), 8.31 (5.72–11.04) months) and OS (mOS, (95% CI), 16.62 (12.48–not estimable) months) with sotorasib. Patients with TTF1High; NRF2High tumors (13.1%) exhibited intermediate PFS (mPFS (95% CI), 4.07 (1.41–9.99) months) and OS (mOS (95% CI), 9.49 (4.07–13.96) months). Thus, both TTF-1 expression and NRF2 activation status represent major determinants of sotorasib efficacy that can stratify patients with advanced KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC into groups with distinct clinical outcomes. In an assessment of the concordance of TTF-1 status based on RNA-seq (high/low) and IHC (positive/negative) in a subgroup of 27 patients with available data from both modalities, six of eight tumors that were TTF1Low by RNA-seq were confirmed to be TTF-1-negative by IHC, whereas 16 of 19 tumors deemed to be TTF1High by RNA-seq were TTF-1-positive by IHC (OR (95% CI), 13.81 (1.58–207.07); P = 0.006; Fisher's exact test). There was overall concordance between TTF-1 status as determined based on RNA-seq and IHC, in line with a previous study reporting a strong correlation between TTF-1 expression per IHC and RNA expression37.

Because both innate and adaptive host immune responses may contribute to the anti-tumor efficacy of KRAS(G12C) inhibitors5, we investigated potential tumor cell-extrinsic determinants of sotorasib efficacy. Across patients with low, intermediate or high PD-L1-expressing tumors, there was consistent sotorasib activity and PFS benefit compared to docetaxel (Fig. 5a). In agreement with the previously reported role of LKB1 inactivation as a driver of the cold TME in KRAS-mutated NSCLC22, a higher fraction of KL or STK11-mutated tumors had PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) < 1%, whereas KP or TP53-mutated tumors had PD-L1 ≥ 50% (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We then explored the effect of PD-L1 expression on PFS within the transcriptional subtypes. Although PD-L1 status did not seem to influence PFS in patients with KC/KP tumors, there was a numerical improvement in PFS in patients with PD-L1 TPS < 1% versus PD-L1 TPS ≥ 1% KL tumors (mPFS, 8.34 months versus 3.14 months; Extended Data Fig. 5b). Finally, we examined whether sotorasib outcomes diverged across previously identified tumor immune subsets from an integrated pan-cancer large-scale immunogenomic analysis38. Across the combined dataset with available RNA-seq data, the most prevalent immune subtypes were ‘inflammatory' (23.4%) and ‘interferon-γ (IFNγ)-dominant' (21.4%), followed by ‘transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-dominant' (19.3%), ‘lymphocyte-depleted' (18.6%), ‘wound healing' (12.4%) and ‘immunologically quiet' (4.8%) (Fig. 5b). We observed enrichment of inflammatory and immunologically quiet subtypes in tumors with PD-L1 TPS < 1%, whereas the IFNγ-dominant tumor type was overrepresented among PD-L1-expressing tumors (P = 0.0004; Fisher's exact test; Extended Data Fig. 5c), consistent with a role for IFNγ in the upregulation of tumor PD-L1 (ref. 39). PFS and OS with sotorasib differed significantly between patients with distinct tumor immune subtypes in the combined dataset and individual studies, with the inflammatory subtype consistently exhibiting the best clinical outcomes (mPFS, 9.99 months; mOS, 17.54 months) and the IFNγ-dominant and wound healing subtypes exhibiting the worst clinical outcomes (mPFS, 4.14 months and 3.61 months; mOS, 6.64 months and 7.43 months, respectively) (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 5d). Patients with the IFNγ-dominant subtype were skewed toward early disease progression versus long-term benefit, whereas the inflammatory subtype was skewed toward long-term benefit with sotorasib treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Among patients with inflammatory tumors, we observed a higher PFS in patients with PD-L1 TPS < 1% (mPFS, 16.3 months) versus PD-L1 TPS ≥ 1% tumors (mPFS, 5.29 months) (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Taken together, results highlight diverse outcomes across immune phenotypes and further identify a PD-L1 low but inflamed set of tumors that may benefit from sotorasib treatment.

Having explored the association between key baseline molecular features and sotorasib efficacy, we assessed the potential utility of dynamic, on-treatment biomarkers of anti-tumor activity. Across multiple studies of targeted therapies in advanced NSCLC and other tumor types, longitudinal monitoring of ctDNA may provide an early readout of treatment response, predict the emergence of adaptive or acquired resistance before radiologic progression and yield prognostic information40,41,42,43. In CB200 at baseline, KRASG12C detection with ctDNA was 82.5% for the sotorasib arm versus 73.7% for the docetaxel arm, consistent with what was previously observed with liquid biopsies from KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC42,43. In patients with detectable KRASG12C mutations at baseline, treatment with sotorasib resulted in more rapid reduction in KRASG12C variant allele frequency (VAF) relative to docetaxel, consistent with shorter time to radiologic response, and was evident as early as 1 week after treatment initiation (Fig. 6a)16. Clearance of KRASG12C ctDNA occurred more rapidly in the sotorasib arm and was achieved in 43% of sotorasib-treated patients at the cycle 2/day 1 timepoint compared to 14% of patients treated with docetaxel (Fig. 6b). Across both treatment arms, patients with detectable KRASG12C ctDNA during treatment exhibited increased hazard of disease progression or death and worse PFS compared to those with KRASG12C ctDNA clearance across cycles 1–4 (Fig. 6c–f and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Of note, KRASG12C ctDNA negativity observed at cycle 1/day 8 with sotorasib treatment (Fig. 6d) was associated with improved PFS (mPFS, 7.26 months versus 4.01 months; P = 0.0067; log-rank test). Overall, there was a trend toward numerically higher hazard of progression or death in patients with detectable KRASG12C ctDNA at later timepoints, consistent with tumor cell persistence and the possible emergence of adaptive/acquired resistance. Conversely, undetectable KRASG12C ctDNA at later timepoints likely reflects a sustained molecular response and may indicate prolonged clinical benefit. Notably, clearance of KRASG12C ctDNA at cycle 2/day 1 was associated with significantly longer PFS with sotorasib even among patients with TTF1High tumors, highlighting the potential additional predictive utility of on-treatment biomarkers when assessed in tandem with baseline molecular determinants of clinical outcome (Fig. 6g).

Finally, we characterized candidate genomic mechanisms of acquired resistance to sotorasib in ctDNA obtained at the time of radiologic disease progression. Plasma samples at progression were collected ≥1 month before the earliest progression date among independent and investigator assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in the combined dataset. Among 134 patients with detectable ctDNA at the time of radiologic progression, emergent genomic variants absent in paired baseline ctDNA samples were detected in 44 patients (32.8%), with pathogenic alterations identified in 30 patients (22.4%). The most prevalent acquired pathogenic genomic alterations involved TP53 (40%), MET (30%, mostly amplifications) and EGFR (20%, mostly amplifications) (Fig. 6h, Extended Data Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, acquired pathogenic alterations in KEAP1 and STK11 were identified in three patients (10%). Overall, 43% of acquired pathogenic variants involved RTK pathways (Fig. 6h, right panel).

This study dissected molecular determinants of response and resistance to sotorasib, leveraging in-depth genomic and transcriptomic analyses of tumor tissue and serial analysis of ctDNA from two unique and complementary clinical cohorts: the single-arm phase 2 CB100 study and the global randomized phase 3 CB200 study that compared the efficacy of sotorasib with docetaxel. Collectively, our datasets constitute one of the largest aggregate populations of patients prospectively treated in clinical trials of KRAS(G12C) inhibitors assembled. Furthermore, availability of randomized training datasets and a distinct validation cohort facilitate assessment of potential prognostic and predictive effects. Thus, our analysis represents, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive and detailed exploration of sotorasib efficacy biomarkers to date.

Our results indicate that the transcriptional diversity of KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC can affect clinical outcomes with sotorasib. Previous work identified three major transcriptional subtypes of KRAS-mutant NSCLC, termed KC, KL and KP, with distinct co-mutation enrichment patterns, differentiation states, histologic features and immune profiles. In our analysis, the KC transcriptional subtype, marked by reduced TTF-1 expression in tumor cells, frequently mucinous histologic features and enrichment of CDKN2A/CDKN2B bi-allelic loss events, was associated with significantly shorter PFS and OS with either sotorasib or docetaxel, indicative of a poor prognostic effect. In support of this finding, a mucinous transcriptional state akin to the classical subtype of pancreatic adenocarcinoma was recently reported to support long-term tumor cell persistence in response to diverse RAS inhibitors in NSCLC44 and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma preclinical models45,46. Notably, our work identified TTF-1 status as a major determinant of sotorasib clinical efficacy in KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC, resulting in divergent outcomes in patients with TTF1Low (ORR, 4%; mPFS, 2.8 months; mOS, 4.5 months) compared to TTF1High (ORR, 45%; mPFS, 8.1 months; mOS, 16 months) tumors. Because TTF-1 expression by IHC is routinely assessed as part of the diagnostic workup of thoracic tumors and metastatic carcinomas, this finding may provide a feasible biomarker strategy to identify approximately 15–20% of patients with KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC who exhibit poor prognosis and may benefit from treatment intensification with RAS inhibitor–anchored combination therapeutic regimens. In addition, this marker may further emerge as a clinically relevant stratification factor in future clinical trials of RAS inhibitors.

Our study raises the possibility that the composition of the TME may influence clinical outcomes with sotorasib, beyond tumor cell-intrinsic biomarkers of sotorasib efficacy. Strikingly, patients with the KL transcriptional subgroup, characterized by enrichment of STK11 co-occurring alterations and a ‘cold' TME with frequent lack of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, appeared to derive improved benefit from sotorasib versus docetaxel in CB200 compared to other subtypes. This calls into question whether the effect of KRAS(G12C) inhibitors can be further improved by combining with PD-(L)1 antibodies. This finding was consistent with the increased prevalence of immune subtypes associated with improved sotorasib efficacy in patients with PD-L1-negative tumors. Because patients with PD-L1-negative KRAS-mutated NSCLC exhibit inferior outcomes with first-line PD-(L)1 inhibitor-based chemo-immunotherapy compared to those harboring PD-L1-positive tumors, these findings may support efforts to combine sotorasib with platinum-doublet chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced KRASG12C-mutated PD-L1-negative NSCLC, such as the ongoing randomized phase 3 CodeBreaK 202 trial47. Additional work using direct visualization and enumeration of distinct immune cell subsets and characterization of immune cell functional states in tumor tissue is required to validate these hypothesis-generating findings.

Concordant with findings from large retrospective studies and post hoc analyses of prospective KRAS(G12C) inhibitor clinical trials1,13,18,24,36, co-occurring genomic alterations in key tumor suppressor genes were associated with heterogeneous clinical outcomes with sotorasib in our cohorts. Improved PFS with sotorasib compared to docetaxel was observed in patients bearing KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC with ATMWT genomic status. Further work is required to validate the role of ATM co-mutations and evaluate their significance in the context of chemotherapy-naive patients. In agreement with previous reports24,36, pathogenic alterations in KEAP1 were associated with inferior clinical outcomes with sotorasib. Similar trends were observed in patients bearing NRF2High tumors that captured a subset of KEAP1WT NSCLC. Integration of NRF2 activation status and TTF-1 expression enabled robust partitioning of patients into favorable (~70%), intermediate (~13%) and poor (~17%) prognostic groups. Future application of unbiased, machine learning-supported approaches to derive predictive signatures of sotorasib clinical benefit may enable refinement of clinical outcome prediction algorithms in patients with TTF1High KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC.

Finally, our analysis revealed that on-treatment clearance of KRASG12C ctDNA with sotorasib occurred rapidly (as early as cycle 1/day 8 in 31% of patients) and was associated with significantly improved PFS at early (cycle 1/day 8) and later (cycle 4/day 1) timepoints, with progressively increasing hazard of progression in KRASG12C ctDNA-positive patients at later timepoints. Thus, KRASG12C ctDNA clearance may serve as an early on-treatment surrogate of long-term outcomes with sotorasib and may refine clinical response prediction algorithms and baseline biomarkers.

Our study has several limitations. Despite the large cohort size, the subset of biomarker-evaluable patients is more limited, reducing the statistical power of molecular analyses. Although we do not see major differences in outcomes between biomarker-evaluable patients and the ITT population, we cannot rule out potential bias that may result from analyzing a subset of the enrolled population and/or instances of informative censoring that could confound interpretation of biomarker data. Additionally, most analyses reported here are post hoc in nature and were not prespecified. Because only genomic alterations considered pathogenic or likely pathogenic were included in the analysis, we cannot rule out the possibility that certain biologically relevant variants may have been erroneously considered WT. Furthermore, inference of immune cell abundance based on whole tumor RNA-seq profiles has caveats that reduce the accuracy and limit the resolution of the analysis. Lastly, given the limited ctDNA panel size, analysis of acquired resistance variants may not reflect the full spectrum of genomic alterations contributing to clinical resistance or non-genomic resistance mechanisms that cannot be captured by ctDNA assays. Thus, these analyses are exploratory and signal seeking, requiring further validation in additional datasets.

Our work provides critical new insights into tumor cell-intrinsic and tumor cell-extrinsic molecular determinants of sotorasib efficacy in advanced KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC. These results may pave the way for the development of clinically applicable biomarker predictors for personalization of treatment strategies, further inform patient stratification in future clinical studies and aid selection of optimized, rational and tailored combination partners of KRAS(G12C) inhibitors to prolong disease control.

The objective of this analysis was to characterize patients with advanced KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC, focusing on molecular and clinical features associated with response and resistance. Patients were pooled from the CB200 and CB100 sotorasib groups for power reasons, to assess prognostic factors. Patients in the CB200 sotorasib and docetaxel groups were analyzed separately to assess predictive factors. The predictive factors were then evaluated in patients in the CB100 sotorasib group to confirm consistency with the CB200 sotorasib group.

The multicenter, single-group, open-label, phase 1/2 CB100 study (NCT03600883) enrolled patients ≥18 years of age with KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after progression on prior therapies13. Key eligibility criteria included locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, KRASG12C mutation confirmed through molecular testing, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of ≤2 (phase 1) and ≤1 (phase 2), measurable disease according to RECIST version 1.1 and treatment with one or more prior systemic therapies unless intolerant of or ineligible for available therapies known to provide clinical benefit48. Exclusion criteria included previous treatment with a KRAS(G12C) inhibitor and active brain metastases. Patients with asymptomatic, treated and stable brain metastases were eligible. As of 22 February 2022 (data cutoff), 174 patients received sotorasib 960 mg orally once daily. The primary endpoint was OR (complete or partial response) as assessed by blinded independent central radiologic review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included duration of response, disease control, time to response, PFS, OS and safety.

The randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 CB200 study (NCT04303780) compared the efficacy of sotorasib versus docetaxel in patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced NSCLC. Enrolled patients were ≥18 years of age who had disease progression after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor16. Key eligibility criteria included histologically or cytologically documented, locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic NSCLC, KRASG12C mutation confirmed by central laboratory testing, tumor progression after receiving at least one previous systemic therapy for advanced disease, ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease according to RECIST version 1.1 (ref. 16). Patients with treated, stable brain metastases were eligible. Exclusion criteria included new or progressing untreated brain lesions or symptomatic brain lesions, previously identified oncogenic driver mutation other than KRASG12C for which an approved therapy is available, previous treatment with docetaxel (with conditions), previous treatment with a direct KRAS(G12C) inhibitor, systemic anti-cancer therapy within 28 days of study day 1 and therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks of treatment initiation. As of 2 August 2022 (data cutoff), 171 patients were assigned to once-daily sotorasib 960 mg orally, and 174 patients were assigned to docetaxel 75 mg m−2 intravenously every 3 weeks; 46 patients crossed over from docetaxel to sotorasib. The primary endpoint was PFS by BICR per RECIST version 1.1, and secondary endpoints included OS, ORR and patient-reported outcomes.

Inclusion criteria for biomarker-eligible patients were prospectively defined. Patients who provided appropriate consent were biomarker evaluable if they met protocol inclusion criteria and had either genomic (baseline and/or treatment) or transcriptomic (baseline) data for baseline associations, ctDNA dynamics or acquired resistance (Fig. 1). Attribution of predictive versus prognostic effects was based on treatment arm by biomarker interaction analysis in CB200, whereas assessment of molecular determinants of sotorasib efficacy was performed in the pooled population of sotorasib-treated patients across both CB200 and CB100, with subsequent confirmation of the consistency of observed effects in the individual trials. Sex and/or gender were not considered in this biomarker analysis. Baseline characteristics for sex are reported in CB100 (ref. 13) and CB200 (ref. 16).

Institutional review board approval before study initiation and participating country regulatory authority approval were received, and all patients provided written informed consent. Patients were not compensated for their participation in the study.

Baseline tissue samples (fresh/archival) were analyzed using a targeted 648-gene DNA sequencing panel (Tempus xT; Tempus Labs) and a whole-transcriptome RNA assay (Tempus RS.v2). Reported genomic alterations were filtered to retain only somatic, non-synonymous or splice alterations, copy number loss of tumor suppressor genes and copy number gain of oncogenes; the latter two (oncogene versus tumor suppressor gene) were based on the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census classification49. Fusions included in analyses involved oncogenic tumor-suppressing genes or oncogenes or one of these genes: MET, EGFR, ERBB3, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ALK, ROS1 and RET. Further filtering for likely pathogenic alterations was based on the alteration having an OncoKB therapeutic level and being oncogenic or likely oncogenic50, being predicted as pathogenic or likely pathogenic by the functional analysis through hidden Markov model (FATHMM) algorithm51 or being predicted to be of high impact by SnpEff software52. For statistical analysis of prognostic or predictive effect in the CB200 study, the filtered alterations were grouped at the gene level, and only genes with prevalence of five or more per treatment arm were included. Effect validation in the CB100 study also required meeting the same criteria. PD-L1 protein level was assessed by local standard-of-care testing. In a subset of biomarker-evaluable patients, TTF-1 status (IHC) was available through information reported by clinical investigators. Post-treatment samples were assessed using plasma next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Resolution ctDx Lung assay (23 genes; Exact Sciences Corporation).

Analyses of immune subtype and TME were performed by Tempus Labs based on methodology previously described38. Immune subtypes were determined by calculating single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scores of five representative signatures using transcripts per million (TPM) gene expression values. The data were standardized by median centering and scaled by median absolute deviation (MAD), and each study sample was assigned to the nearest cluster centroid based on Euclidean distance. Immune subtypes assessed were IFNγ-dominant, immunologically quiet, inflammatory, lymphocyte-depleted, TGFβ-dominant and wound healing.

Statistical analysis was performed using the R ‘stats' package (version 4.2.3; https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/). Time-to-event analysis (PFS and OS) was performed with Cox proportional hazards regression modeling using the ‘survminer' package (version 0.4.9). Where noted in the text and figures, comparison of survival between groups was also performed using a log-rank test. To evaluate whether a biomarker was prognostic or predictive in the CB200 study, a Cox proportional hazards model with a treatment-by-biomarker interaction term was fitted. Analysis of whether each biomarker was predictive or prognostic of CB200 categorical outcomes (that is, long-term benefit versus early progression) was performed with logistic regression of treatment-by-biomarker interaction model. For the clustering algorithm, k set to 2 was applied to log10-transformed mRNA expression of NKX2.1/TTF1 across all samples. For continuous and binary variables, statistical significance was assessed through the significance of the interaction term, whereas, for categorical variables with more than two levels (that is, Thorsson et al.38 cluster comparison), a likelihood ratio test was performed (a model with all covariates but without the interaction term versus a model with the interaction term), with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Stratified models evaluating the association of each biomarker with clinical response within each treatment arm of the CB200 study (sotorasib, docetaxel) and the CB100 study followed the same statistical modeling approach as outlined above but without any interaction terms included. When analyses of the combined dataset were performed, study was included as a covariate in the model. If prevalence of a categorical variable was compared across two or more groups, a Fisher's exact test was employed.

KRASG12C status was modeled as a binary variable (detected/not detected) and as a continuous variable (VAF). In the case of the latter, patients who had ctDNA data but no KRASG12C detected had their VAF imputed to a constant value (1−5). For changes in KRASG12C detection status from baseline, a McNemar test was performed at each timepoint within each treatment arm comparing prevalence of detection to day 1 (D1) (baseline). KRASG12C VAF was modeled using linear mixed-effects models, with treatment arm, timepoint (coded as a categorical variable) and treatment arm–by–timepoint interaction treated as fixed effects, whereas an individual patient was treated as a random effect using the R packages ‘lmerTest' (version 3.1) and ‘emmeans' (version 1.8.9). Comparisons between docetaxel and sotorasib at individual timepoints were performed by specifying contrasts from the full model.

FDR was controlled using the Benjamini–Hochberg method53 for the hypothesis-generating tests of gene mutation status association with outcomes and post hoc contrasts between factor levels (NSCLC transcriptional subtype, PD-L1 and longitudinal ctDNA). P values for the remaining descriptive ad hoc tests were unadjusted for multiple testing.

Metrics details

Recently, a class of long-period radio transients (LPTs) has been discovered, exhibiting emission thousands of times longer than radio pulsars1,2,3,4,5. These findings, enabled by advances in wide-field radio surveys, challenge existing models of rotationally powered pulsars. Proposed models include highly magnetized neutron stars6, white-dwarf pulsars7 and white-dwarf binary systems with low-mass companions8. Although some models predict X-ray emission6,9, no LPTs have been detected in X-rays despite extensive searches1,2,3,4,5,10. Here we report the discovery of an extremely bright LPT (10–20 Jy in radio), ASKAP J1832−0911, which has coincident radio and X-ray emission, both with a 44.2-minute period. Its correlated and highly variable X-ray and radio luminosities, combined with other observational properties, are unlike any known Galactic object. The source could be an old magnetar or an ultra-magnetized white dwarf; however, both interpretations present theoretical challenges. This X-ray detection from an LPT reveals that these objects are more energetic than previously thought and establishes a class of hour-scale periodic X-ray transients with a luminosity of about 1033 erg s−1 linked to exceptionally bright coherent radio emission.

Panel (a) shows a composite of radio (MeerKAT 816 MHz, red), X-ray (Chandra 1–10 keV, green), and infrared (WISE 12 μm, blue) emission of the field of ASKAP J1832–0911. The Fermi 95% positional error ellipse around 4FGL J1832.9-0913 is shown in cyan dashed line. The supernovae remnant SNR G22.7–0.2 is highlighted in the yellow dotted line. Panel (b) shows MeerKAT total intensity contours at 30, 40, and 50 mJy levels overlaid on the Chandra detection image on 2024 February 14. Panel (c) and (d) show the deepest near-infrared images of ASKAP J1832–0911 at J- and Ks-band, respectively. Red circles show 50 times the systematic uncertainty of the source position (~5 mas).

Horizontal lines show the false alarm probabilities at 3σ (green), 2σ (orange), and 1σ (red). The purple vertical line shows the best frequency we fit from radio observations.

The 3σ X-ray luminosity limits are calculated as a function of photon index (Γ; panel a) and black body temperature (kT; panel b). We assume NH = 1.8 × 1022 cm−2, which is the Galactic column density in the direction of the source, consistent with the X-ray spectral fits during the outburst. The shaded region assumes the error in the distance (\({4.5}_{-0.5}^{+1.2}\) kpc).

(a) Evolution in the \(P-\mathop{P}\limits^{.}\) plane. Dashed (solid) lines correspond to theoretical death lines for a pure dipole (highly multipolar) configuration18,19. The grey-shaded region indicates the radio pulsar ‘death valley' between the two extreme configurations. (b) Evolution of the quiescent X-ray luminosity as a function of the rotational power (\(\mathop{E}\limits^{.}\)). The grey line is \({L}_{X}=\mathop{E}\limits^{.}\) while the grey shaded area represents the constraints for ASKAP J1832–0911 during quiescence. See10,77,78 and references therein for details on the theoretical cooling models and the plotted sources.

Circled stars are radio-emitting magnetars. We assume as a luminosity limit for the quiescent emission of ASKAP J1832–0911 that is derived from the deepest XMM-Newton limits on 2011-03-13, and the most recent limits derived after the outburst by Chandra on 2024-08-11 (light blue lines). Solid lines assume an X-ray spectrum modelled by a power law with Γ = 2, while dashed lines assume a blackbody with kT = 0.5 keV. The age refers to the age of the SNR when available, and to the characteristic age otherwise. See10 and Dehman, Marino, and Rea et al., manuscript in preparation for more details on the data extraction and sources.

Uncertainties on the times of arrival have been adjusted in quadrature by EQUAD, fitted per-epoch, with values ranging from 6–69 s. The points are coloured by radio frequency, and the telescopes used for each measurement are indicated by the markers.

The purple line shows the spectral type limit we can constrain based on the current infrared observations.

Bacteria defend themselves from viral predation using diverse immune systems, many of which target foreign DNA for degradation1. Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this strategy by leveraging DNA synthesis instead2,3. We and others recently showed that DRT2 systems use an RNA template to assemble a de novo gene that encodes an antiviral effector protein, Neo4,5. It remains unknown whether similar mechanisms of defense are employed by other related DRT families. Focusing on DRT9, here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of DNA homopolymer synthesis. Viral infection triggers polydeoxyadenylate (poly-dA) accumulation in the cell, driving abortive infection and population-level immunity. Cryo-EM structures reveal how a noncoding RNA serves as both a structural scaffold and reverse transcription template to direct hexameric complex assembly and poly-dA synthesis. Remarkably, biochemical and functional experiments identify tyrosine residues within the reverse transcriptase itself that likely prime DNA synthesis, leading to the formation of high-molecular weight protein-DNA covalent adducts. Synthesis of poly-dA by DRT9 in vivo is regulated by the competing activities of phage-encoded triggers and host-encoded silencers. Collectively, our work unveils a novel nucleic acid-driven defense system that expands the paradigm of bacterial immunity and broadens the known functions of reverse transcriptases.

Metrics details

Lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated ex vivo gene therapy for haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has delivered on the promise of a ‘one-and-done' treatment for several genetic diseases1. However, ex vivo manipulation and patient conditioning before transplantation are major hurdles that could be overcome by an in vivo approach. Here we demonstrate that in vivo gene delivery to HSPCs after systemic LV administration is enabled by the substantial trafficking of these cells from the liver to the bone marrow in newborn mice. We improved gene-transfer efficiency using a phagocytosis-shielded LV, successfully reaching bona fide HSPCs capable of long-term multilineage output and engraftment after serial transplantation, as confirmed by clonal tracking. HSPC mobilization further increased gene transfer, extending the window of intervention, although permissiveness to LV transduction declined with age. We successfully tested this in vivo strategy in mouse models of adenosine deaminase deficiency, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis and Fanconi anaemia. Interestingly, in vivo gene transfer provided a selective advantage to corrected HSPCs in Fanconi anaemia, leading to near-complete haematopoietic reconstitution and prevention of bone marrow failure. Given that circulating HSPCs in humans are also most abundant shortly after birth, in vivo HSPC gene transfer holds strong translational potential across multiple diseases.

Ex vivo gene transfer using LVs in HSPCs has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in treating haematological and metabolic disorders. Several gene-therapy products are now in advanced clinical development or available on the market1. However, certain challenges hinder their broader application to all eligible patients2,3, such as the need to collect, manipulate and preserve enough functional HSPCs to ensure effective haematopoietic reconstitution, as well as the need for patient conditioning before cell infusion. Moreover, ex vivo gene therapy enables correction only in HSPCs, whereas many genetic diseases have systemic manifestations that would benefit from broader correction. In vivo gene therapy presents a potential solution to these limitations, but targeting HSPCs in their niche remains a major challenge4,5,6.

Here we identified a unique window of opportunity in early postnatal life, when high numbers of circulating HSPCs (cHSPCs) are trafficking from residual haematopoietic niches to the bone marrow (BM). Building on this observation and our previous development of engineered LVs for in vivo administration and tissue-targeted expression7, we report successful gene transfer into bona fide long-term HSPCs in newborn mice. To assess the translational potential of this approach, we carried out tests in models of disease in mice in which distinct haematopoietic lineages and/or extra-haematopoietic tissues are involved. We selected: (1) adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, which causes severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) through the accumulation of toxic adenosine metabolites, impairing T cell, B cell and natural killer cell differentiation and function; (2) autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), a severe inherited bone disease in humans caused by mutations in the T cell immune regulator 1 (TCIRG1) gene, leading to defective osteoclast function and impaired bone resorption; and (3) Fanconi anaemia, a rare genetic disorder classified as a DNA repair deficiency syndrome, caused by mutations in the Fanconi anaemia pathway, resulting in severe HSPC depletion and leading to BM failure and increased cancer susceptibility.

To assess the feasibility of in vivo LV gene transfer into HSPCs, we first examined the spatiotemporal evolution of the haematopoietic system in C57BL/6 mice. We characterized the composition and absolute counts of haematopoietic cells in the BM, peripheral blood (PB), spleen and liver in newborn (postnatal day 0–1), 1-, 2- and 8-week-old (adult) mice (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a–d).

Source Data

Analysis of the HSPC compartment revealed a consistent proportion of stem cells and different progenitor subtypes in the BM across all ages (Fig. 1b). By contrast, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were more prevalent in the PB and spleen in newborns compared with older mice (Fig. 1c,d). The composition of HSPCs in the newborn liver closely resembled that of the BM (Fig. 1e).

Further analysis specifically focusing on the HSC distribution confirmed the highest concentrations in the PB of newborns, which declined progressively over time and was paralleled by an increase in the BM (Fig. 1f,g), indicating ongoing HSC homing to the maturing BM niche. Furthermore, HSCs expanded significantly in the spleens of 1- and 2-week-old mice but were absent in the adult liver (Fig. 1h,i). To confirm active haematopoiesis in the livers of young mice, we detected cycling cells in haematopoietic foci that also included megakaryocytes (Extended Data Fig. 1e).

Together, these findings highlight a unique window of opportunity for the genetic engineering of HSC in newborns, marked by the persistence of fetal haematopoietic niches shortly after birth and extensive HSC trafficking in the blood.

To evaluate the potential of in vivo LV gene transfer into HSCs, we intravenously (i.v.) administered GFP-expressing LVs to newborn C57BL/6 mice. This procedure resulted in stable GFP expression in approximately 0.5% of all blood lineages (Fig. 1j,k). We observed comparable GFP marking across different lineages in the spleen and BM, including KIT+SCA-1+Lin− cells, in most analysed mice (Fig. 1l). To confirm gene transfer into long-term HSCs, we transplanted GFP+ cells collected from the BM into busulfan-conditioned adult mice. As GFP-marking levels were low, we pooled CD45+GFP+ cells from the BM sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) at 16 weeks after LV administration from four to five mice treated as newborns and transplanted each pool into busulfan-conditioned adult mice (Fig. 1j). Molecular analysis of sorted HSPCs showed an average of one vector copy per diploid genome (VCN; Extended Data Fig. 1f). We observed long-term engraftment of transplanted cells in four out of five mice (Fig. 1m–p). One transplanted mouse died owing to engraftment failure, like the non-transplanted control mouse. Notably, this mouse had received the lowest number of CD45+GFP+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Engraftment levels varied between the four surviving mice, which was expected given the low number of transplanted cells and the heterogeneous composition of GFP+ cells in each pool (Fig. 1m–p). However, we detected GFP+ cells across all analysed lineages in the PB and haematopoietic organs at comparable levels in each mouse, with a corresponding VCN (Fig. 1q and Extended Data Fig. 1h).

To confirm whether the GFP+ haematopoietic output in the transplanted mice originated from bona fide HSCs, we performed clonal tracking using LV integration site analysis. Examination of the GFP+ cells collected for transplantation from the BM of LV-treated mice, and of sorted GFP+ splenic myeloid, B cells and T cells revealed hundreds of clones that contributed homogeneously to the haematopoietic output across multiple lineages, without dominant clones. Analysis of total BM, spleen and thymus cells 20 weeks after transplant in recipient mice revealed heterogeneous contributions from a subset of clones originally identified in donor mice (Fig. 1r and Extended Data Fig. 1i–l). None of the clones that expanded in transplanted mice was predominant in donor mice or had integrations near oncogenes (Extended Data Fig. 1m). These findings show that LV administration in newborn mice successfully targeted multipotent, self-renewing HSPCs that contributed to long-term haematopoiesis in both donor and recipient mice.

To further assess long-term transduction, we monitored newborn-treated mice for more than 1 year after LV administration and observed stable GFP expression across all analysed PB lineages (Extended Data Fig. 1n). Next, to compare HSPC transduction efficiency between newborn and adult mice, we administered i.v. LVs to adult C57BL/6 mice at a dose matched to the body weight. GFP marking in the circulation was initially detected but rapidly declined by 4 weeks after LV administration (Extended Data Fig. 1o). This delayed loss was probably due to an emerging anti-GFP immune response in mice treated as adults. As i.v.-administered LVs predominantly transduce liver cells7,8, we examined the liver at the study end point and found few, if any, GFP+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 1p), suggesting clearance by cytotoxic T cells. Overall, these findings demonstrate successful in vivo gene transfer into bona fide HSCs, facilitated by the unique features of newborn haematopoiesis.

Our initial analyses showed that HSC content was highest in the liver and spleen of 2-week-old mice (Fig. 1h,i). We therefore tested the efficiency of in vivo HSPC gene transfer at this age but found that it was significantly lower than in newborns (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). These data suggest that HSPCs are targeted mostly when circulating in newborns. To increase the amount of HSPC accessible to LV transduction, we administered 2-week-old mice a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor mobilization regimen, modelling its clinical use. This treatment sharply increased the number of circulating HSCs (cHSCs) and enhanced in vivo gene transfer, reaching a mean of 8.5% GFP+CD45+ cells—fivefold higher than in control mice (Fig. 2a–d and Extended Data Fig. 2d). At 20 weeks after LV administration, GFP expression and VCN in the BM, thymus and spleen remained higher in mobilized mice than in controls (Fig. 2e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). We then performed total BM transplantation into busulfan-conditioned CD45.1 recipient mice. Cells derived from LV-treated donor mice successfully engrafted in all transplanted mice, with GFP-marking levels matching those of the corresponding donor, in PB and all analysed organs at 16 weeks after transplant (Fig. 2g–j and Extended Data Fig. 2g–l). We then applied a shorter mobilization regimen to newborn C57BL/6 mice that resulted in a 15-fold increase in gene transfer efficiency, reaching 11% GFP+CD45+ circulating cells (Fig. 2k,l). These findings indicate that in vivo LV gene-transfer efficiency is highest in newborn mice, reflecting a window of HSC accessibility that can be extended to juvenile mice through mobilization.

Source Data

In addition to mobilization, we tested other approaches to enhance gene-transfer efficiency. These included administration of an anti-interferon-α (IFNα) receptor-blocking antibody (MAR-1), the use of a phagocytosis-shielded LV (CD47high-LV) with high surface content of the ‘don't-eat-me' signal7 CD47 and higher LV doses. MAR-1 was administered i.v. 3 h before LV injection in newborn C57BL/6 mice, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in GFP+ cells compared with IgG-treated controls (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). We confirmed this increase across haematopoietic subpopulations in the spleen, thymus and BM at 16 weeks after LV administration (Extended Data Fig. 3c–f). These data suggest that IFNα restricts in vivo LV transduction of HSPCs, a limitation that MAR-1 can mitigate.

We next evaluated the effect of the CD47high-LV, using non-obese diabetic/SCID/IL2Rγ (NSG) mice bearing a CD47-receptor polymorphism that enables it to interact with human CD47 displayed on the LV surface9. A spatiotemporal analysis of haematopoiesis in these mice showed that, similar to C57BL/6 mice, cHSC numbers declined over time whereas BM HSC content modestly increased (Extended Data Fig. 4a–g). In contrast to C57BL/6 mice, however, NSG mice had fewer cHSCs as newborns but an increased HSC presence in the liver and spleen (Extended Data Fig. 4h,i), suggesting that haematopoiesis in NSG mice occurs mainly in these organs rather than in the BM. When we administered CD47high-LV expressing GFP to newborn and adult NSG mice, we observed a fourfold increase in GFP marking in NSG mice treated as newborns compared with both C57BL/6 mice treated as newborns and NSG mice treated as adults (Figs. 1k and 2m). By contrast, administration of CD47free-LV (produced in CD47-deficient cells) to newborn NSG mice resulted in a marked reduction of GFP+ cells in the PB. This finding demonstrates that phagocytosis shielding enhances LV gene transfer into HSPCs (Fig. 2m). We confirmed similar GFP expression in HSPCs in the BM of treated mice 20 weeks after LV administration (Fig. 2n). To further assess clonogenic capacity, we FACS-sorted GFP+ or GFP−Lin− cells from the BM of LV-treated NSG mice, performed colony-forming unit assays and found comparable clonogenic potential (Extended Data Fig. 4j). We also confirmed a higher VCN in Lin−GFP+ cells FACS-sorted from the BM of mice treated as newborns compared with those treated as adults (Extended Data Fig. 4k). To evaluate the range of VCN in HSPCs transduced in vivo, we analysed single colonies from colony-forming unit assays and measured a VCN of 1 in most colonies (Extended Data Fig. 4l). We also performed a biodistribution analysis of GFP+ cells using immunohistochemistry, 20 weeks after LV administration to newborn or adult NSG mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed GFP+ cells in the liver and spleen, with scattered cells in the lung, kidney and brain only in NSG mice treated as newborns. These cells were predominantly haematopoietic and endothelial, with liver parenchymal cell transduction also observed (Extended Data Fig. 4m,n). This distribution probably reflects the tissue-specific accessibility of LVs through the bloodstream.

We next combined HSC mobilization with CD47high-LV administration in 2-week-old or adult NSG mice. Although mobilization was more effective in adults than in 2-week-old mice (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c), GFP marking was sevenfold higher in 2-week-old mice (Fig. 2o and Extended Data Fig. 5d–f). Mobilization increased gene-transfer efficiency in both age groups, although cHSCs in mobilized NSG mice remained lower than in C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5b). Furthermore, LV doses were 2.5-fold lower in NSG compared with C57BL/6 mice as they had reduced tolerance to extensive manipulation by the mobilization regimen.

Analysed together, these data show significantly fewer GFP+ cells in the circulation of mice treated at increasing ages, with the highest permissiveness observed in newborn mice (Fig. 2p). Moreover, despite mobilization increasing gene transfer in both young and adult mice, transduction was twofold higher in the former, suggesting that cell-intrinsic factors influence LV transduction efficiency (Fig. 2p).

Finally, we assessed long-term HSPC gene transfer after increasing LV doses. We tested LV gene-transfer efficiency in newborn and 2-week-old C57BL/6 mice versus CD47high-LV in newborn, 2-week-old and adult NSG mice (Fig. 2q,r), confirming that HSPC accessibility to LV transduction was highest in newborns, with CD47high-LV enhancing gene-transfer efficiency in NSG mice. All mice treated as newborn or at 2 weeks old tolerated all LV doses without toxicity, whereas NSG adults had dose-limiting toxicity, preventing higher-dose administration (Fig. 2q,r).

Overall, these findings establish that the newborn period is the optimal window for in vivo HSC gene transfer, although HSC mobilization and CD47high-LV could enhance transduction efficiency in young and adult mice.

To evaluate the therapeutic potential of in vivo LV gene transfer, we selected ADA-SCID as our initial disease model for two key reasons. First, gene-corrected lymphocytes possess a selective survival advantage over uncorrected cells10. Second, the ADA enzyme is ubiquitously expressed, enabling gene-corrected hepatocytes to serve as a permanent enzyme replacement therapy by detoxifying the entire organism11.

We tested three LV constructs with distinct expression patterns: PGK.ADA, which drives ubiquitous ADA expression under the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter; PGK.ADA.122mirT, which excludes hepatocyte expression using complementary target sequences for the liver-specific miR-122; and ET.ADA.142mirT, which restricts ADA expression to hepatocytes using the enhanced transthyretin (ET) promoter along with miR-142 target sequences to suppress expression in haematopoietic cells12 (Fig. 3a). We administered these LVs to newborn ADA-SCID mice and monitored weight and survival over time up to 20 weeks after LV administration. Whereas all untreated ADA-SCID mice died before weaning, we observed longer survival in LV-treated mice, with healthy growth comparable with wild-type (WT) littermates (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 6a). PGK.ADA-LV achieved the highest rate of long-term survival (5 out of 7 mice), whereas PGK.ADA.122mirT-LV was less effective (6 out of 14 mice), highlighting the importance of hepatocyte-mediated detoxification. Meanwhile, 4 out of 5 ET.ADA.142mirT-LV mice also survived up to 20 weeks after LV administration, consistent with previous reports showing enzyme replacement therapy efficacy in this model and robust LV expression in hepatocytes13,14 (Fig. 3b).

To assess the selective advantage of the corrected cells, we measured the VCN in the PB of LV-treated ADA-SCID and WT littermates as a proxy. We observed a marked selective advantage only in PGK.ADA-LV-treated mice, in which 7% of circulating cells were transduced compared with 2–4% in LV-treated WT littermates (Fig. 3c). Immune reconstitution in the PB was fastest in PGK.ADA-LV-treated mice, whereas animals treated with the other LVs had a delayed immune recovery (Fig. 3d,e and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Analysis of spleen and thymus composition at 20 weeks after LV administration showed no differences between all surviving LV-treated mice and WT littermates, further confirming immune system reconstitution (Fig. 3f,g).

We measured ADA enzyme activity in red blood cells in the PB and found threefold higher activity in PGK.ADA-LV-treated mice compared with all other LV groups, although it remained below WT levels. Plasma ADA activity, however, was similar across all LV-treated mice and with compared WT levels (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). We also confirmed the expected pattern of expression dictated by each LV design (Extended Data Fig. 6f).

To determine whether gene-corrected HSCs retained engraftment potential, we transplanted total BM cells from ADA-SCID mice treated as newborns into irradiated adult NSG mice (Fig. 3a), enabling the monitoring of engraftment owing to an H-2Dq mismatch. Notably, despite NSG mice having normal ADA expression, only recipients transplanted with BM cells from PGK.ADA-LV-treated mice showed long term survival, similar to mice transplanted with WT cells (Fig. 3h). Mice that received BM cells from ET.ADA.142mirT-LV-treated donors had the lowest survival (four out of eight), as expected, as these cells lacked ADA transgene expression. The low survival of mice that received BM cells from PGK.ADA.122mirT-LV-treated donors suggests that these cells were less fit, despite expressing ADA in a fraction of them. This effect probably resulted from poor donor detoxification, similar to cells isolated from ET.ADA.142mirT-LV-treated donors (Fig. 3h). There were no significant differences in body weight and engraftment of transplanted mice between groups (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). However, lymphocyte counts were restored only in mice that received BM cells collected from PGK.ADA-LV-treated donors (Fig. 3i,j and Extended Data Fig. 6i,j). Similarly, spleen and thymus compositions were indistinguishable from WT-transplanted controls (Fig. 3k,l). In line with donor marking levels, mice that received BM cells from PGK.ADA-LV-treated donors and WT mice had similar VCNs, with an average 0.04 in PB and BM, confirming stable transduction of long-term repopulating HSCs (Fig. 3m and Extended Data Fig. 6k).

LV integration site analysis in the spleen, thymus and BM of LV-treated ADA-SCID mice and NSG transplant recipients confirmed integration site sharing across different organs, supporting that i.v. LV administration in newborns successfully targets bona fide HSCs (Extended Data Fig. 6l).

Finally, we compared in vivo LV gene therapy efficacy in newborn versus young mice by administering PGK.ADA-LV to 2-week-old ADA-SCID mice at a weight-matched dose. Only one out of five mice treated at 2 weeks old survived long term, compared with five out of seven mice treated as newborns (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 6m,n). Together, these findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of in vivo ADA-LV administration in newborn ADA-SCID mice and highlight the advantage of vector designs that allow expression in both haematopoietic and liver parenchymal cells.

As a second model for LV-mediated early postnatal in vivo gene transfer to HSPCs, we selected ARO. This condition requires early intervention to prevent disease progression, as BM failure in patients with osteopetrosis severely limits treatment options. The underlying genetic defect impairs osteoclast resorption capacity, preventing the formation of a properly structured bone matrix. This disruption hinders HSPC homing to the BM, resulting in an increased concentration of cHSPCs15,16.

In this setting, we showed that in vivo LV gene transfer to HSPCs in osteopetrotic (OC) newborn mice extended postnatal survival and enabled the differentiation of gene-corrected cells into functional osteoclasts capable of bone resorption in vivo. However, given the severe and rapidly progressing phenotype of this model, complete rescue could not be achieved under the current experimental conditions (Extended Data Fig. 7). For a detailed description of gene therapy outcomes in this model, see the Supplementary Notes.

Last, we selected Fanconi anaemia, a rare genetic disorder belonging to the DNA repair deficiency syndromes. In Fanconi anaemia, the HSC compartment is directly affected, posing additional constraints to the collection and subsequent infusion of sufficient numbers of genetically corrected HSCs in patients with this disorder. Nevertheless, clinical trials have shown that even a small population of corrected HSCs can expand in vivo and repopulate the BM progressively, even without conditioning17,18.

First, we analysed PB from Fanca knockout (Fanca−/−) mice over time, focusing on cHSC numbers (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). As observed in the other analysed mouse strains, cHSC numbers were higher in newborns than older mice; however, the absolute number of cHSCs in newborn Fanca−/− mice was very low, mirroring patients with Fanconi anaemia (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 8b).

We then administered PGK.FANCA-LV i.v. to Fanca−/− newborn mice and tracked the VCN over time in PB cells. The VCN progressively increased in all treated mice during physiological growth and homeostatic haematopoietic renewal up to 1 year after LV administration, demonstrating that gene-corrected Fanca−/− cells have a selective advantage over uncorrected Fanca−/− cells in vivo (Fig. 4a,b). Parallel analysis of PB parameters revealed that counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes normalized progressively starting at 30 weeks after LV administration. This suggests that the expansion of corrected HSCs eventually reached the threshold needed to restore PB parameters (Fig. 4c,d and Extended Data Fig. 8c–e).

Source Data

At the end of the 1-year follow-up, we detected a high VCN in the spleen, thymus and BM of LV-treated Fanca−/− mice, except for one mouse with low PB marking (Fig. 4e). Sorting of PB subpopulations and KIT+SCA-1+Lin− cells from the BM confirmed a VCN consistent with PB measurements (Extended Data Fig. 8f). LV integration site analysis in these sorted PB and BM samples and whole BM, spleen and thymus confirmed transduction of bona fide HSCs that expanded owing to their selective advantage (Extended Data Fig. 8g,h). We then transplanted BM cells from LV-treated or untreated Fanca−/− mice into irradiated adult Fanca−/− recipients. Gene-corrected cells expanded over non-corrected cells in this stringent setting, again confirming the ability of transduced HSCs to outcompete native cells (Fig. 4f,g). VCN measurements in the organs of transplanted mice 1 year after transplant matched those observed in the PB, further supporting the stability of gene correction (Fig. 4h).

As Fanca−/− mice have a milder disease phenotype compared with humans, we applied a mitomycin C (MMC) challenge to model Fanconi-anaemia-associated BM failure. MMC is a DNA cross-linking agent, which is toxic to Fanca−/− cells owing to their defective DNA damage response19,20. Interestingly, LV-treated Fanca−/− mice exposed to two MMC doses exhibited substantial expansion of corrected cells, with the highest measured VCN reaching 1 (Fig. 4i,j). By contrast, untreated Fanca−/− mice exposed to MMC experienced severe haematopoietic decline, mimicking the BM failure observed in patients with Fanconi anaemia. By contrast, LV-treated Fanca−/− mice underwent a rapid recovery of all these parameters (Fig. 4k–n). One year after LV administration, we measured the VCN in the BM, spleen and thymus of LV-treated Fanca−/− mice. We found that values again mirrored those measured in the PB and were the highest in MMC-challenged LV-treated Fanca−/− mice, reinforcing the idea that corrected HSCs expanded after selective pressure from MMC treatment (Fig. 4o).

Finally, to explore strategies to further increase the number of corrected HSCs, we applied an HSPC mobilization regimen to 2-week-old or adult Fanca−/− mice (Fig. 4p,q). As expected, HSC gene-transfer efficiency in young and adult mice was much lower than in newborns. However, mobilization improved gene-transfer efficiency in both groups, with the highest VCN observed in 2-week-old mice (Fig. 4p), highlighting the potential of using mobilization in Fanconi anaemia to enhance gene-transfer efficiency and extend the intervention window.

Overall, we achieved full rescue of the haematopoietic defects observed in Fanca−/− mice, leveraging the selective advantage of corrected cells and progressive expansion of the initial pool of in vivo transduced HSCs.

Given that in vivo gene transfer to HSCs in newborn mice was facilitated by high levels of cHSPCs, we next examined whether a similar window of accessibility exists in humans. Using a previously published multiparametric flow-cytometry analysis21, we assessed PB samples from healthy participants at birth, 0–2 months, 3–8 months and when adults (>18 years). We observed a peak in phenotypically defined cHSCs and multipotent progenitor cells during the neonatal and early infantile periods, both in absolute numbers and in percentage of total HSPCs, with amounts progressively declining around weaning and becoming nearly undetectable in adults (Fig. 5). These findings suggest that, as in mice, early postnatal life in humans may represent a unique and time-sensitive window for in vivo HSC gene therapy. By leveraging this stage, future therapeutic strategies could bypass ex vivo manipulations and enable direct, clinically relevant HSC correction in paediatric patients.

Here we show that the early postnatal period provides a unique opportunity to access HSCs in vivo for LV gene transfer in mice, bypassing the hurdles associated with ex vivo engineering. Although the transduction rate and extent of genetically modified haematopoiesis remained below what can be achieved by ex vivo transduction and infusion after conditioning, we provide proof of concept of substantial therapeutic benefit achieved in three models of severe genetic diseases.

Bona fide HSC gene transfer was proven by long-term multilineage output, self-renewal after serial transplantation and clonal tracking of in vivo transduced HSCs. Notably, the levels of genetically modified LV-positive cells in the haematopoietic compartment remained stable across all observation time points. Our investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of haematopoiesis in mice during postnatal development has provided insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie in vivo HSC gene transfer in newborns, with a substantial proportion of HSCs persisting in the liver and spleen of young mice, consistent with recent reports22,23. However, we also observed that the high numbers of cHSPCs seen in newborns, probably trafficking to newly forming definitive niches, rapidly declined in parallel with the efficiency of gene transfer. This suggests that LV access to HSCs is improved when they are in circulation. Supporting this hypothesis, we found that HSPC mobilization at 2 weeks of age, when significant numbers of HSPCs remain in tissue reservoirs, rescued effective gene transfer to levels exceeding those in non-mobilized newborns. These findings underscore the translational potential of this strategy, extending the window of efficacy to pre-weaning, a time point that may be more favourable for therapeutic intervention in humans.

HSPC mobilization with a G-CSF and plerixafor regimen markedly increased gene-transfer efficiency not only in WT mice but also in a mouse model of Fanconi anaemia. However, physical accessibility alone may not fully account for LV gene-transfer efficiency. Cell-intrinsic factors, including LV receptor expression levels, metabolic activity and the proliferative state of circulating cells during early life, may also contribute to productive transduction. Even after mobilization, in vivo HSPC gene-transfer efficiency declined at increasing ages. It is well known that HSPCs collected from the circulation of mobilized individuals are poorly permissive to LV gene transfer and require ex vivo activation for robust transduction. Similarly, quiescent HSCs in their BM niche impose notable barriers to genetic engineering, whether mediated by gene transfer or gene editing. These obstacles include limited vector entry, restricted reverse transcription owing to unbalanced cellular dNTP pools, inefficient nuclear translocation and constraints in DNA accessibility, repair pathways and replication competence. The permissiveness to in vivo HSC gene transfer observed in early postnatal life might, therefore, extend beyond LV transduction, potentially informing strategies to enhance genetic-engineering approaches. Notably, the few previous reports of in vivo genetic modification of HSCs have relied on either HSPC mobilization followed by chemotherapy-based selection of the limited number of cells engineered using adenoviral vectors or on targeted lipid nanoparticles delivering limiting amounts of RNA cargo5,6.

Our findings indicate that a permissive condition for LV gene transfer also exists in neonatal humans, probably extending into early infantile life, given the high numbers of cHSPCs, including the most primitive subsets24, and the well-established notion that human HSPCs isolated from cord blood exhibit greater permissiveness to LV-mediated transduction compared with those obtained from adult BM.

Systemic LV administration has not yet been reported in humans, but we have previously demonstrated its safety and tolerability in non-human primates7,25. Notably, non-human primates and humans exhibit greater permissiveness to LV gene transfer and respond more effectively to phagocytosis-shielded CD47high-LV than do mice7,25. In a mouse model engineered to be sensitive to human CD47 signalling, we achieved up to 9% stable haematopoietic engineering without transduction enhancers or mobilization protocols. Moreover, the LV doses used in this study fall in the range of doses already applied in preclinical liver-directed LV gene therapy for haemophilia in mouse models25. Interestingly, the estimated initial LV concentration in the PB after infusion also aligns with levels typically used for ex vivo HSPC transduction. Further increases in in vivo HSC gene transfer may be achieved through early-life mobilization and co-administration of clinically compatible transduction enhancers26,27,28, as shown here with IFNα receptor blockade.

In Fanconi anaemia, we successfully exploited the selective advantage conferred by correction of the genetic defect in DNA repair, which specifically affects HSCs. This approach led to a remarkably high proportion of genetic correction in the haematopoietic compartment over the long term, albeit sustained by only a small number of expanded HSC clones. Importantly, ex vivo Fanconi anaemia gene therapy has demonstrated the importance of treating patients at early stages of BM failure to facilitate the collection of clinically relevant numbers of HSCs17,18. An in vivo gene therapy approach would extend the application of treatment to patients with limited HSC content while avoiding ex vivo manipulation of these fragile cells. For ADA-SCID and ARO outcomes see Supplementary Discussion.

In conclusion, our findings support further preclinical studies to assess the translational potential of in vivo HSC gene transfer in early infants. The well-established clinical use of LVs, the advantages of the vector design used here for in vivo delivery and the increasing availability of newborn screening for monogenic diseases provide a strong rationale for progressing towards the first clinical testing of this approach. By bypassing the major barriers associated with ex vivo HSC gene therapy, this strategy stands to offer broader accessibility to life-changing treatments.

Sample size in experiments with mice was chosen according to previous experience with experimental models and assays. No sample or animal was excluded from the analyses. Mice were randomly assigned to each experimental group. Investigators were blinded at the moment of LV administration to newborn ADA-SCID or OC mice. In all the other experimental settings investigators were not blinded.

Plasmids pCCLsin.cPPT.PGK.GFP, pCCLsin.cPPT.PGK.ADA, pCCLsin.cPPT.PGK.TCIRG1 and pCCLsin.cPPT.PGK.FANCA were previously described14,19,29,30. Plasmid pCCLsin.cPPT.ET.ADA.142T was constructed by standard cloning techniques, by exchanging the human FIX cDNA7 with human ADA cDNA (SpeI–SpeI) into the previously described pCCLsin.cPPT.ET.coFIX-R338L.142T (NheI–SalI) after blunting the ends. Plasmid pCCLsin.cPPT.PGK.ADA.122T was constructed by standard cloning techniques, by inserting the miRNA-122 target sequence into the pCCLsin.cPPT.PGK.ADA plasmid (SalI–ScaI).

Third-generation self-inactivating LVs were produced by calcium phosphate transient transfection into 293T cells. 293T cells were transfected with a solution containing a mix of the selected LV genome-transfer plasmid, the packaging plasmids pMDLg-pRRE and pCMV.REV, pMD2.G and pAdVantage (Promega), as previously described7. In brief, the medium was changed 14–16 h after transfection and the supernatant was collected 30 h after medium change. LV-containing supernatants were sterilized through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore), pre-concentrated four times with a Vivaflow 200 Tangential Flow Filtration Cassette 100 kDa (Sartorius), according to manufacturing instructions, transferred into sterile polyallomer tubes (Beckman) and centrifuged at 20,000g for 120 min at 20 °C (Beckman Optima XL-100K Ultracentrifuge). The LV pellet was dissolved in the appropriate volume of PBS to allow 500–1,000× concentration.

For LV titration, 1 × 105 293T cells were transduced with serial LV dilutions in the presence of polybrene (8 μg ml−1). For PGK.GFP-LV, cells were analysed by flow cytometry using a FACSCanto analyser (BD Biosciences), equipped with DIVA software, 5–7 days after transduction and the infectious titre, expressed as transducing units (TU) ml−1, was calculated using the formula TU ml−1 = ((% GFP+ cells/100) × 100,000×(1/dilution factor)). For all other LVs, genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted 14 days after transduction, using the Maxwell 48 Cell DNA Purification Kit (Promega), following the manufacturer's instructions. The VCN was determined by ddPCR, starting from 5–20 ng of template gDNA using primers (HIV FW: 5′-TACTGACGCTCTCGCACC-3′; HIV REV: 5′-TCTCGACGCAGGACTCG-3′) and a probe (FAM 5′-ATCTCTCTCCTTCTAGCCTC-3′) designed against the primer-binding region of LV. The amount of endogenous DNA was quantified by a primers–probe set designed against the human telomerase gene (Telo FW: 5′-GGCACACGTGGCTTTTCG-3′; Telo REV: 5′-GGTGAACCTCGTAAGTTTATGCAA-3′; Telo probe: VIC 5′-TCAGGACGTCGAGTGGACACGGTG-3′ TAMRA) or the human GAPDH gene (Applied Biosystems HS00483111_cm). The PCR reaction was performed with each primer (900 nM) and the probe (250 nM; 500 nM for Telo) following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad), read with a QX200 reader and analysed with QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad). The infectious titre, expressed as TU ml−1, was calculated using the formula TU ml−1 = (VCN × 100,000×(1/dilution factor). LV physical particles were measured by HIV-1 Gag p24 antigen immunocapture assay (Perkin Elmer) following the manufacturer's instructions. LV-specific infectivity was calculated as the ratio between infectious titre and physical particles.

For mouse experiments, DNA was extracted from the whole liver using the Maxwell 48 Tissue DNA Purification Kit (Promega), from a cell suspension obtained from the thymus, spleen or BM using the Maxwell 48 Cell DNA Purification Kit (Promega) or from whole PB using the Maxwell 48 Whole Blood DNA Purification Kit (Promega). DNA was extracted from lineage-negative (Lin−) cultured cells using the Maxwell 48 Cell DNA Purification Kit (Promega) and from single-picked colonies using Quick extract DNA (Biosearch Technologies), according to cell number. The VCN in mouse DNA was determined by ddPCR, starting from 5–20 ng of template gDNA using a primers–probe set designed against the primer-binding region of LVs (see ‘LV titration' section). In some cases, the VCN was determined using an ad hoc ddPCR (QX200 EvaGreen Digital PCR Supermix, Bio-Rad), which selectively amplifies the reverse-transcribed vector genome (both integrated and non-integrated), discriminating it from possible plasmid contamination29 (RT-LV; ΔU3 FW: 5′-TCACTCCCAACGAAGACAAGATC-3′, gag REV: 5′-GAGTCCTGCGTCGAGAGAG-3′). The amount of endogenous mouse DNA was quantified by a primers–probe set designed against the mouse Sema3a gene (Sema3a FW: 5′-ACCGATTCCAGATGATTGGC-3′; Sema3a REV: 5′-TCCATATTAATGCAGTGCTTGC-3′; Sema3a probe: HEX 5′-AGAGGCCTGTCCTGCAGCTCATGG-3′ BHQ1). The PCR reaction was performed with each primer (900 nM; 150 nM for RT-LV primers) and the probe (250 nM) following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad), read with a QX200 reader and analysed with QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad).

RNA extraction was performed using a Maxwell 48 SimplyRNA Blood extraction kit (Promega, AS1380), according to the manufacturer's instructions and reverse transcribed using the SuperScript IV VILO kit (11766050; ThermoFisher Scientific). LV gene expression was assessed by ddPCR, starting from 10–25 ng of template cDNA using a primers–probe set designed against the Woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (Wpre) sequence of the LV genome (Wpre FW: 5′-GGCTGTTGGGCACTGACAAT-3′; Wpre REV: 5′-ACGTCCCGCGCAGAATC-3′; Wpre probe: FAM 5′-TTTCCATGGCTGCTCGCCTGTGT-3′ MGB). Hprt was used as a reference gene for mouse samples (dMmuCPE5095493, Bio-Rad). The PCR reaction was performed with each primer (900 nM) and the probe (250 nM) following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad), read with a QX200 reader and analysed with QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad).

The 293T cell line was maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; FetalClone II, HyClone, Euroclone), 4 mM glutamine (Lonza), 100 international units (IU) ml−1 penicillin and streptomycin (Lonza). Primary mouse Lin− cells were FACS-sorted from cell suspensions obtained from the BM or the liver of LV-treated mice and cultured in StemSpan supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM glutamine, 100 IU ml−1 penicillin and streptomycin, 100 ng ml−1 mouse stem-cell factor (mSCF, Peprotech), 50 ng ml−1 mouse thrombopoietin (mTPO, Peprotech), 100 ng ml−1 mouse fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (mFLT3L, Peprotech) and 20 ng ml−1 mouse interleukin-3 (mIL-3, Peprotech) for 24 h. The medium was then exchanged with IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU ml−1 penicillin and streptomycin, 100 ng ml−1 mSCF (Peprotech) and mFLT3L 100 ng ml−1 (Peprotech) for 48 h. Finally, GFP expression was determined using a FACSCanto analyser (BD Biosciences), equipped with DIVA software. Some of the sorted Lin− cells were plated (800 cells per plate) in classic Methocult (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 100 ng ml−1 mSCF (Peprotech), 50 ng ml−1 mTPO (Peprotech), 100 ng ml−1 mFLT3L (Peprotech) and 20 ng ml−1 mIL-3 (Peprotech). All cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination.

Founder FVB,129-Adatm1Mw Tg(PLADA)4118Rkmb/J mice (referred to as ADA-SCID mice) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory31 (stock 003265). Founder B6C3Fe a/a-Tcirg1oc/J mice (referred to as OC mice) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory16 (stock 00230) and fully backcrossed on the C57BL/6 background. Founder mice with a targeted disruption in the Fanca gene32 were provided by H. J. van de Vrugt (Free University Medical Center) and backcrossed with FVB mice to obtain the Fanca−/− FVB strain (referred to as Fanca−/− mice). C57BL/6 and NSG mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. All mice were maintained in specific-pathogen-free conditions. Genotyping of ADA-SCID and OC mice was performed at 2–3 weeks of age according to the protocol available on The Jackson Laboratory website. Vector administration was carried out in adult female C57BL/6 or NSG (7–10-week-old) mice by tail-vein injection (250–300 µl per mouse), in newborns by temporal-vein injection (30 µl per mouse) and in 2-week-old mice by retro-orbital injection (100–150 µl per mouse). Mice were bled from the retro-orbital plexus using capillary tubes and blood was collected in 0.38% sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.4 or in an EDTA-coated tube (Microvette 20.1341). For transplantation experiments, 7-week-old female C57BL/6 recipient mice were conditioned with a lethal regimen of busulfan (6 mg ml−1), consisting of four daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) administrations of 27 µg g−1 of busulfan (prediluted 1:2 in 0.9% NaCl injectable solution). The transplant was performed by i.v. injection of total BM cells or total CD45+ cells FACS-sorted (BD FACSAria Fusion Cell Sorter, BD Biosciences or MoFlo Astrios EQ Cell Sorter, Beckman Coulter) from the liver or the BM of donor mice the day after the last dose of busulfan. Cells were resuspended in 200 µl of PBS. The type and number of transplanted cells are indicated in the experimental schemes. The weight of recipient mice was monitored daily during busulfan administration and weekly for 1 month after transplant. In case of transplantation experiments in NSG mice, conditioning was performed by sublethal irradiation of recipient mice (200 rad) and transplantation 3–4 h after irradiation. For the transplantation experiments in Fanca−/− mice, conditioning was performed by lethal irradiation of recipient mice using two doses of 4.5 Gy 24 h apart. A total of 3–4 h after conditioning, 4–5 × 106 BM cells from LV-treated or untreated Fanca−/− mice were transplanted by i.v. injection in the tail vein of recipient mice. HSPC mobilization was performed in 2-week-old or adult mice by administering five i.p. doses of 250 ng g−1 G-CSF per mouse 12 h apart. Then 8 h after the last dose of G-CSF, 2 µg g−1 plerixafor per mouse was administered i.p. to mobilized mice. LVs were administered i.v. 2 h after plerixafor and, at the same time, haematopoietic cells were collected from the BM, PB or spleen for FACS analysis. HSPC mobilization was performed in newborn mice following the same protocol used in 2-week-old or adult mice, except for a reduced G-CSF regimen that consisted of three instead of five doses. Anti-IFNα receptor-blocking antibody (MAR-1, InVivoMAb, MAR1-5A3) or IgG control (InVivoMAb, mouse IgG1 Isotype control, MOPC-21) were administered i.v. to newborn mice 3 h before LV administration at 50 mg kg−1 dose. BM failure was induced in Fanca−/− mice by i.p. administration of two doses of 0.3 mg kg−1 of mitomycin C (MilliporeSigma), spaced 7 days apart, 6 weeks after LV injection20. Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation at the scheduled times. Experimental procedures in Fanca−/− mice were conducted according to European and Spanish regulations (European convention ETS 123, regarding the use and protection of vertebrate mammals used in experimentation and other scientific purposes, Directive 2010/63/UE, Spanish Law 6/2013 and Real Decreto (R.D.) 53/2013 regarding the protection and use of animals in scientific research). All animal procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

The mouse liver was perfused (15 ml min−1) through the inferior vena cava with 12.5 ml of the following solutions at subsequent steps: (1) PBS EDTA (0.5 mM); (2) HBSS (Gibco) and HEPES (10 mM); and (3) HBSS and HEPES containing 0.03% collagenase IV (Sigma). The digested mouse liver tissue was collected, passed through a 100-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) and processed into a single-cell suspension. This suspension was subsequently centrifuged three times (30g, 25g and 20g, for 3 min, at room temperature) to remove hepatocyte-containing pellets. The supernatant containing non-parenchymal cells was centrifuged (650g, 7 min, at room temperature) and recovered cells were subsequently incubated with the monoclonal antibodies indicated in the ‘Flow cytometry' section. To obtain a single-cell suspension of spleen or thymus, organs were smashed on a 40-µm filter using PBS–2% FBS (FetalClone II, HyClone, Euroclone), red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed with 0.5 or 1 ml of ACK Lysing buffer (GIBCO) for 5 or 10 min on ice, respectively. The lysis was stopped by adding 10 ml of PBS–2% FBS. The cell suspension was then filtered through a 40-µm filter and cells were counted and used for gDNA extraction or flow-cytometry analysis (see ‘Flow cytometry' section). BM cells were flushed from the tibia and femur of one or two legs, as needed, or extracted by bone crushing in the case of newborn or OC mice and then processed as described for cells isolated from the spleen.

Flow-cytometry analyses using cell suspensions obtained from BM, spleen, thymus, PB or liver were performed using a FACSCanto analyser (BD Biosciences), equipped with DIVA software. Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 cells were processed, washed with PBS–2% FBS (FetalClone II, HyClone, Euroclone) or MACS buffer (PBS pH 7.2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 mM EDTA), treated with fragment crystallizable (Fc) Receptor-Block (Miltenyi Biotec) when antibody-stained and then resuspended in the buffer used for washing. Staining was performed in MACS buffer, incubating cells with antibodies (in the proportion indicated in Supplementary Table 15) for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark. Right before analysis, 3 µl of 7-AAD (Biolegend 420404) was added to each tube to exclude dead cells. Rainbow beads (BD Biosciences) were used to calibrate the instrument detectors. Gating strategies are provided in Supplementary Figs. 1–4. A BD FACSAria Fusion Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences), equipped with DIVA software (BD Biosciences), or a MoFlo Astrios EQ Cell Sorter (Beckman Coulter), equipped with Summit software (Beckman Coulter), was used for cell sorting.

For PB samples collected from healthy human participants of different ages and mouse samples shown in Fig. 1b–i and Extended Data Fig. 1a–d, samples were analysed using two standardized multiparametric flow-cytometry assays21,33 (through whole blood dissection). In brief, after RBC lysis with ACK lysing buffer (STEM CELL Technologies), samples were labelled with the fluorescent antibodies reported in Supplementary Table 16. Titration assays were performed to assess the best antibody concentration. Samples from mice were pre-incubated with a rat anti-mouse FcR blocking reagent (BD, dilution 1:100). After surface marking, cells were incubated with propidium iodide (PI; BioLegend) to stain dead cells. Absolute cell quantification was performed by adding Precision count beads (BioLegend) to PB samples before the staining procedure. Images of all stained samples were acquired through a BD Symphony A5 (BD Bioscience) cytofluorimeter after calibration with Rainbow beads (Spherotech) and raw data were collected using the DIVA software (BD Biosciences). Data were subsequently analysed with FlowJo software v.10.5.3 (BD Biosciences). A list of antibodies used for mouse or human whole-blood-dissection panels is reported in Supplementary Table 16.

PB samples from paediatric and adult healthy donors were collected and analysed after written informed consent was given, using protocols approved by the ethics committees of IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele (Protocol_TIGET09 for both paediatric and adult participants). Written consent for paediatric participants was given by their parents.

Mice were perfused through the left ventricle with PBS containing 0.5 mM EDTA to remove blood, after which organs were collected and fixed in zinc-formalin for at least 24 h. Embedding, sectioning, slide preparation, staining and image acquisition were performed at the Centro di Imaging Sperimentale facility at San Raffaele Hospital (Italy). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded consecutive sections (4 µm) were dewaxed and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series before histological or immunohistochemical staining. Immunostaining was performed using the Automatic Leica BOND RX system (Leica Microsystems). Tissues were first deparaffinized and subjected to epitope retrieval using Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (ER1 Citrate Buffer). Slides were incubated with either an anti-GFP primary antibody (Invitrogen, A11122, 1:1,000) or an anti-Ki-67 primary antibody (D3B5, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:200) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by detection using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (Leica, DS9800). Images of stained slides were acquired using an Aperio AT2 digital scanner at 20× magnification (Leica Biosystems) and analysed with ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems).

Integration sites were retrieved by Sonication Linker Mediated (SLiM)-PCR, as previously described34, with minor modifications. In brief, for each sample up to 300 ng of gDNA was processed by DNA shearing using the Covaris E220 Ultrasonicator, generating fragments with an average size of 1,000 bp. The fragmented DNA was subjected to end repair and 3′ adenylation, and then ligated to linker cassettes containing an eight-nucleotide sequence barcode used for sample identification and all the sequences required for Read 2 paired-end sequencing. The ligation products were split in three technical replicates and subjected to 35 cycles of exponential PCR using primers specific for the LV LTR and the linker cassette. A subsequent amplification with an additional ten PCR cycles was performed using a primer specific for the linker cassette and the LTR. These primers contain an 8-nucleotide barcode used for sample identification (coupled with the barcode on the linker cassette) and the sequences needed for Read 1 sequencing, plus a random 12-nucleotide sequence, enabling easier cluster recognition in the first sequencing cycles on the next-generation sequencing system. The generated SLiM-PCR products are therefore associated with a unique pair of barcodes, assembled into libraries and subjected to Illumina next-generation sequencing.

Sequencing reads were processed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline35 (VISPA2) that isolates genomic sequences flanking the vector LTR and maps them to the mouse genome (mm9). Because vector integration in the same genomic position in different cells is a very low probability event, identical integration sites in independent samples were considered contamination or amplification artefacts, which may occur during the technical procedure. Datasets were pruned of potential contamination and false positives for each primary mouse and of integration sites derived from unrelated secondary mice. Identical integration sites shared between mice belonging to different experimental groups were reassigned by identifying the insertion site in at least two SLiM technical replicates and through sequence counts. Downstream analyses of vector-integration sites, such as relative abundance, sharing and CIS analysis, were performed using ISAnalytics36. Clonal abundance, estimated as the relative percentage of genome numbers, was determined by the R package sonicLength37. Common insertion sites were calculated using the Grubbs test for outliers38.

Haemocytometric analysis of PB was performed using a Procyte DX Analyser (IDEXX) at the time points indicated in the experimental design schemes. Approximately 30 µl of PB was collected into EDTA-coated tubes (Microvette 20.1341) and analysed. The measured parameters were: haemoglobin, total RBC count, differential count (lymphocyte, monocyte and neutrophil (absolute count and percentage)), platelet count and total leukocyte count (white blood cell).

ADA activity was measured in plasma or the cellular fraction of PB as previously described39. In brief, 20 μl of packed RBCs were lysed in 20 μl of lysis buffer (0.25 mol l−1 HEPES, 0.025 mol l−1 CHAPS and 0.025 mol l−1 dithiothreitol). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 min. The enzyme activity was evaluated in a mixture containing 50 mmol l−1 Tris (pH 7.2) and 0.4 mmol l−1 adenosine by adding 10 μl of lysed RBC supernatant or 20 μl of plasma. The reaction was stopped by adding PCA (final concentration, 0.21 mmol l−1) and neutralized with KOH (final concentration, 0.22 mmol l−1). The reaction progression was analysed using aliquots at two time points with a Bio-Rad Biofocus 3000 instrument (Bio-Rad) after inosine plus hypoxanthine formation at 0 and 10 min for the cellular fraction or at 0 and 30 min for plasma. The enzyme activity was measured as mol h−1 per (ml packed RBCs or ml plasma).

Osteoclasts were differentiated from BM cells as previously described40 and assayed for resorption functions on dentine slides (AE8050). Dentine discs were stained with toluidine blue as previously described40. The concentration of released CTX in the culture supernatant was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; CrossLaps, AC-07F1, Immunodiagnostic System) following the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of parathyroid hormone in the serum of LV-treated OC or WT mice was measured by ELISA (MicroVue Mouse parathyroid hormone 1-84 EIA) following the manufacturer's protocol.

For micro-computed tomography analyses, vertebral columns of OC mice and their WT littermates were dissected, cleaned from connective tissues and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Bones were scanned at a nominal image resolution of 7 µm using a SkyScan 1276 (Bruker) at 55 kV and 72 µA, using a 0.25-mm aluminium filter. Images were captured every 0.4° in a rotation to 360° with a 2 × 2 camera pixel binning. The reconstruction was carried out with the SkyScan NRecon 2.0.0.5 software using the InstaRecon reconstruction engine, ring artefact reduction and beam-hardening correction. Image analysis of the L5 vertebra was performed using the CT Analyser software (CTAn 1.18.8.0+). An in-house-developed semiautomatic approach was used to segment the trabecular region of the vertebral body in the coronal plane. The bone mineral density of the trabecular region was calculated by calibrating a linear extrapolation against the mean attenuation coefficients of selected regions of a 2-mm phantom rod pair containing 0.25 and 0.75 g cm−3 CaHA (Skyscan). A three-dimensional morphometric analysis of the trabecular region was performed after binarization of the trabeculae by an adaptive thresholding algorithm. The ratio between the bone volume and total volume (%) and the trabecular separation (mm) were assessed.

Statistical analyses were performed after consulting with professional statisticians at the San Raffaele University Center for Statistics in the Biomedical Sciences (CUSSB). When normality assumptions were not met, nonparametric statistical tests were performed. A two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test was performed to compare two independent groups and for more than two independent groups, a Kruskal–Wallis test was used, followed by post hoc analysis (Dunn's test for multiple comparisons against the reference control group along with Bonferroni's correction). For paired observations, a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test was performed. Data were analysed using GraphPad (v.10). To model the dynamics of biological processes, properly accounting for dependencies induced by the repeated-measures design, LME models were estimated, specifying random-effect terms for experimental units or session. To fulfil underlying model assumptions, various transformations of the outcome variable, including logarithmic, square/cubic root and ordered quantile normalization, were considered. After the estimation of LME models, a post hoc analysis was conducted, enabling the pairwise comparison of treatment groups at a fixed time point. To account for multiplicity issues, P values were adjusted using Bonferroni's approach. LME were estimated using R software (v.4.3.1). In all the analyses, the significance threshold was set at 0.05. Inferential techniques were used for adequate sample sizes (n ≥ 5), otherwise only descriptive statistics are reported.

Metrics details

Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus belonging to the genus Henipavirus, which infects Pteropus bat species in Southeast and South Asia. Since its discovery in the late 1990s in Malaysia, NiV has caused outbreaks in humans in Singapore, Bangladesh, India and the Philippines. The spillover pathway for the most recent NiV outbreak in 2023 in Kerala, India, remains speculative. NiV causes serious disease in infected humans, with a mean case-fatality rate of 70%, and no approved treatment or vaccines exist. Humans have been infected directly from bats through shared food or through infected bridging hosts, including pigs and horses, although other spillover pathways may exist. Here, we review the pathways of NiV spillover and transmission, highlighting areas needing further research. We emphasize the importance of collaborative and multidisciplinary efforts both in the laboratory and in the field, and the implementation of a One Health strategy to prevent future epidemics.

Nancy Mace, the South Carolina Republican congresswoman, often tells her staff that she's a self-taught coder—just one aspect of how Mace presents her tech expertise, as befits her role in shaping the GOP's policies on technology and work as chair of the House subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation.

“I would say [it was] at least a weekly comment, if not daily,” says one of several former Mace staffers who spoke with WIRED. Another found her high regard for her skills somewhat at odds with her demonstrated ability. (Like all the staffers WIRED spoke with, they requested anonymity because they fear reprisal from their former boss.)

A principal—and unusual—use to which Mace put her skills, according to former staffers, was setting up burner accounts on a variety of social media platforms to monitor what people were saying about her and bolster her image. They also claim she requested that staffers make their own burner accounts to defend her online.

“We had to make multiple accounts, burner accounts, and go and reply to comments, saying things that weren't true—even Reddit forums,” a former staffer says. “We were congressional staff, and there were actual things we could be doing to help the constituents.”

“It would be a slap in the face to taxpayers across the country for me to spent [sic] time on their dime commenting on my bosses [sic] personal life,” Sydney Long, Mace's communications director, writes in an email to WIRED. “The only relationship the Congresswoman cares about is her one with South Carolina. She is married to her job and that is all the media should care about.” Mace's office did not answer a detailed list of questions on the programming languages in which she is proficient and what types of devices she uses for coding.

Mace, who staff said once identified as a “never Trumper,” has become one of the president's staunchest allies on Capitol Hill. She's willing to go to more extreme lengths than many of her colleagues to attack Trump's enemies and gain ample attention online in the process, like introducing a resolution to stop transgender people from using bathrooms in federal buildings that align with their gender identity rather than biological sex. (This legislation, Mace confirmed, purposefully targeted Representative Sarah McBride from Delaware, the first openly transgender member of Congress.) She also has a guiding hand on technology policy; earlier this year, for example, she reintroduced a bill she previously cosponsored in 2023, the Modernizing Government Technology Reform Act, which, if passed and signed into law, would require a sweeping audit of legacy federal IT systems.

Recently, Mace showed a “naked silhouette” of herself during a House subcommittee hearing on surveillance as part of a running string of allegations she has made against her ex-fiancé, South Carolina businessman Patrick Bryant, whom she accused of physically assaulting her and of possessing images of “underage girls” in an explosive floor speech in February. During the speech, she alleged three other men had committed various other crimes, including sexual abuse, sex trafficking, and taking videos of sexual acts without their consent. Bryant and the three other men have denied Mace's accusations and did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED. (Because Mace's comments were made on the House floor, she may be sheltered by the Constitution's speech and debate clause, which protects lawmakers from lawsuits related to their legislative actions.)

In late 2023, before Mace's house speech, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division began an investigation into Mace's “allegations of assault, harassment, and voyeurism.” In an unrelated deposition, which was conducted by Bryant's lawyers, the congresswoman's passion for technology and alleged use of “Twitter burner accounts” came up at length.

The terms hack and hacking appear a combined 13 times during the deposition given by Wesley Donehue, whose firm did consulting work for Mace's 2022 and 2024 reelection campaigns before he says he fired her as a client.

“You need to know that Nancy Mace is quite the—when I use the word ‘nerd' or ‘geek,' it's always favorable, but a computer nerd or a computer geek,” Donehue said in the deposition, first reported by FITSNews, a conservative-leaning South Carolina outlet. “She programs her own bots. She sets up Twitter burner accounts. This is kind of a thing she does. She sits all night on the couch and programs bots, because she's very, very computer savvy. She controls her own voter database, she programs a lot of her own website, she programs Facebook bots and Instagram bots and Twitter bots. It's what she does for fun.”

In a post on X, Donehue claimed he stopped working with Mace because, he said, “​​I don't have time for her constant egotistical bullshit and drama in my life.” Donehue did not return a request for comment.

At another point in the deposition, Donehue alleged that Mace tried to get into Bryant's phone because she found out he was using an unspecified dating app. “And because she found that,” Donehue explained, “she started thinking that he was cheating on her, so she got into his phone. And then when she got back from the Caribbean, she hacked into other apps—and I don't know what those other apps are—and seemingly found hundreds of photos and videos.” (In her February House speech, Mace alleged that Bryant “put my thumbprint on his phone” and then gave her ""legal access” to his phone. During the speech, she also said, “Patrick Bryant must have forgotten that in my younger days, in my youth, I used to be a computer programmer … know enough about technology.”)

Mace's staffers shared a similar assessment to that of what Donehue alleged: The congresswoman was often using rudimentary tools available for anyone with a professional account on social media sites, such as automating comments on her Facebook page for anyone thanking her.

“I never saw her coding shit. Ever,” the first former staffer said. “But, I mean, she'd talk about tech a lot.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Switch 2 May Signal the End of Physical Games","https://www.wired.com/story/the-switch-2-may-signal-the-end-of-physical-games/","Wed, 28 May 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

One of the biggest changes of Nintendo's generational leap to the Switch 2 is the new console's game carts. Not the aesthetic shift—they're now red, to differentiate them from the original Switch's slate gray ones—but rather that, in many cases, they won't contain a game at all.

While all first-party Nintendo games are currently expected to be released on-cart, other publishers may choose to release their Switch 2 titles on “game-key cards.” These have no actual game data on them, instead serving as a physical license to access and play a digital version of a game. Per Nintendo, after players insert the game-key card into their console, they'll be prompted to download the associated game. An internet connection will be required to download the game and for any online features, but otherwise, game-key card titles will be playable offline as normal, so long as that physical cartridge is inserted, its presence serving as a software authentication tool.

It's a direction that has proven controversial with both fans and some developers (former Assassin's Creed and Far Cry lead Alex Hutchinson said, “I think it's sort of lame,” while Nightdive Studios CEO Stephen Kick said the move is “a little disheartening”) and could be confusing for consumers, despite Nintendo's plans to clearly mark the packaging of game-key card titles. However, the move does have several positives—and it may just be a harbinger of the future for the entire games industry.

Probably the biggest plus point to game-key cards is that they're an improvement on the current equivalent, which is … nothing at all. Switch cartridges are a proprietary storage format, which means they can be more expensive, per GB of storage, to release games on than mass-market media. As a result, several game publishers sell titles in a “code in a box” format—entirely empty Switch cases with a single-use, digital download code to redeem on the Nintendo eShop.

While these sorts of releases ostensibly fill a market gap, giving real-world retailers a product to put on shelves and, even for online sellers, providing some form of physical object to send to customers—useful to give out as gifts, for instance—they've always been an odd category. Collectors typically want an actual game on their shelves, while those unbothered by a permanent library would likely be browsing a digital-only storefront in the first place. Either way, once that code has been redeemed, the customer is left with an empty plastic case with no purpose and no secondary market value. Code-in-a-box releases are ultimately a waste of materials to produce and dispose of, the remnants likely destined for landfill.

Game-key cards go some small way to solving these problems. For collectors, they'll have something in the case lining their shelves, making their collections tangible, while more casual players can take a chance on titles they're unsure of. That's because the carts won't be tied to user accounts—anyone with the cart downloads their own copy of the game. Because the cartridge itself is the key, you'll be able to lend out, sell, or trade-in game-key cards as easily as carts for previous console generations, and only whoever physically possesses it will be able to play.

There is still a convenience factor to consider, as you'll need to have that cart inserted into your Switch 2 to play the game, unlike entirely digital purchases, but it stands to be a far more versatile and arguably consumer-friendly approach than those one-time codes. We'll have chance to see which format players prefer with the first wave of Switch 2 titles, as titles like EA's Split Fiction sticks with the code-in-a-box approach.

The biggest concern surrounding game-key cards, particularly for collectors, is likely to be longevity. A 40-year-old NES game cart can still be played on a working console—will the same be possible for a Switch 2 game in 2065? A game-key card would, presumably, still authenticate an already installed game to run (in this hypothetical, your Switch 2 console is still intact and working decades from now, too), but if the servers aren't running anymore to enable downloading the linked software in the first place, that cart would be useless—just more e-waste.

However, Switch 2 games could still be available to download for a long time. There's precedent here—although the Wii virtual store has long since been deactivated for new purchases, players can still download their existing purchases. Similarly, 3DS games and even update data can also be redownloaded, more than a year after its online store was turned off.

Those might represent different scenarios, given digital purchases on those earlier platforms were tied to the specific piece of hardware. (For example, Nintendo says you need ""the same Wii console you used to originally download the game"" to redownload.) Nintendo has since adopted an account-based structure for Switch 1, linking purchases to the user who bought them, and transferable to a new console.

That leaves game-key cards in a sort of limbo, unaffiliated with either hardware or user. That could throw up unforeseen hurdles in the much longer term—there'd be no way to predict when a game-key card in the wild would be plugged in and need a game to download—but based on Nintendo's track record for supporting digital games on retired hardware, there doesn't appear to be anything to be immediately concerned about, especially when backward compatibility on Switch 2 is looking like a priority.

It is fair to wonder why, if publishers are releasing a game on a cart at all, they wouldn't just put the game on there anyway. There are likely some practical reasons to explain this, though. Like the original Switch, the proprietary format again means cards that include flash memory to store game data on are more expensive to produce, so it's a way to keep production costs down. Don't expect a consumer benefit from that, but it will make business sense, somewhere.

Then there's the matter of storage limits. Switch 2 carts can hold a maximum of 64 GB of data—double the total internal capacity on the original Switch console itself, but still pretty meager compared to game sizes now. Some studios have performed some dark compression magic—CD Projekt Red has crammed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which weighs in at over 70 GB on PC, down to just 56.8 GB on Switch 2 to be one of the few third-party titles shipping with the full game data on the card—but other games may be larger than an actual Switch 2 cart could hold.

Games exceeding the capacity of physical media isn't unique to Nintendo. The recent PS5 release of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has only 20 GB on-disc, which sounds paltry when you consider a PS5 disc can hold up to 100 GB of data, but not when the installed size of the game is over 120 GB. Bethesda's Doom: The Dark Ages, too, ships with only 85 MB of data on the game disc (although there, the full install potentially could fit on a disc). However, like Nintendo's game-key cards, both of these prompt players to download the actual game in full.

It's worth remembering that even when a game's data is on a disc or cart at launch it's rarely the full and final version of a game nowadays. Even for single-player titles, day-one patches, updates, bug fixes, and bonus DLC can drastically change a game after release (which raises philosophical questions for preservationists too—which iteration do you save?) and require more storage space. As data demands continue to balloon, we may have reached the limit of physical storage for video games, so game-key cards (or discs) may be the best we get.

In that light, Nintendo providing any material release at all is actually a small win for fans of physical media, especially given how boxed-game sales have absolutely cratered. Industry analyst Mat Piscatella highlighted in January 2025 that spending on physical games in the US has halved since 2021 and is down 85 percent on a 2008 high. In the UK, a recent study by trade body UKIE found that physical sales accounted for just 4 percent of total spend in 2024 and represented a 34 percent fall year on year. Increasingly, consumers are choosing to go digital even when a physical option exists.

Even collector's editions, those bastions of physical media, are now abandoning physical copies of their game. Sony's upcoming Ghost of Yōtei costs $250 for the premium package and still provides just a download code for the game itself. Physical releases are becoming an afterthought.

These shifts in consumer and corporate behavior absolutely raise questions about game preservation and long-term access to the games we play, but those questions apply across the whole industry. As it stands, Nintendo's game-key cards may end up being physical gaming media's last gasp—even though they don't have a game on them at all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Jesse Armstrong Finds Sympathy for ‘Rich Assholes' in Mountainhead","https://www.wired.com/story/jesse-armstrong-mountainhead/","Wed, 28 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Jesse Armstrong hadn't planned on making another project about billionaires.

The Succession creator was taking a break after finishing HBO's Emmy-winning series about the ludicrously wealthy siblings fighting for control over their father's media conglomerate, which ended in May 2023. But while writing a review of journalist Michael Lewis' book Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon, about crypto fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, Armstrong got sucked into listening to podcasts featuring tech elites. It inspired him to write and direct his first feature: Mountainhead, a movie about three tech billionaires and their less rich, deeply insecure friend, all of whom have far too much power at their disposal.

“I couldn't get the … tech voice, tech man voice, a billionaire, out of my head,” Armstrong says, noting that to him, that voice embodies both “supreme confidence in their analytical abilities” and “arrogance.” Armstrong is being nice here. The word that repeatedly came to my mind while watching the foursome trade jargon, insults, and delusions of grandeur for the movie's nearly two-hour run time was douchebag.

The film, which will start streaming on HBO May 31, stars Steve Carell as venture capitalist Randall; Jason Schwartzman as Hugo Van Yalk, whose nickname “Souper” is a reference to a soup kitchen—and his lower net worth; Cory Michael Smith as Venis, a Zuck-Elon figure unleashing hyperrealistic deepfakes on his platform Traam; and Ramy Youssef as Jeff, who plans on profiting big from releasing AI that can counter the chaos his pal Venis is wreaking on the world.

The friends meet up for a retreat in the mountains, hosted by Souper, whose fixation on impressing the cohort with his home decor and food platters is met with scorn by the others. They have a “no deals, no meals, no high heels” rule for the weekend. But the fun—in their case, snowmobiling to a peak and writing their net worths on their chests with lipstick—is eventually superseded by plots to take over the world and “coup out the US.”

Mountainhead came together in just a few months, against the backdrop of President Donald Trump's second term in office, much of which has been dominated by Elon Musk's DOGE mission. Shooting took place over a few weeks this spring. While Carell says there were upsides to the tight turnaround—“everyone's just trusting their gut”—Schwartzman says quickly attaining fluency in the “tech voice” Armstrong was going for was a challenge for him.

“At a certain point I said to Jesse, if you ever want us to say anything extra, do you have a glossary or a dictionary,” Schwartzman says. “It's like if you were doing a movie in French and then improvise something in Italian.”

While Armstrong acknowledges that some people might react to his latest project by asking, “Why should I care about these rich assholes,” he refrains from outright making a judgment about them.

“I do feel some sympathy for the real people grappling with some of this tech, because it is a bit of a hall of mirrors,” Armstrong says. “Lots of people go into, especially AI, with a sense of the power of the technology, and I think, as far as I can tell, a genuine sense of responsibility.”

However, he says the “unbelievable amount of money” in the space, coupled with regulations that are often playing catch-up, make it “almost an inhuman task to keep your head straight about your desire to properly marshal the forces you're bringing into the world.” (He also describes the power of the Roys' media empire in Succession as “quaint” compared to that of tech leaders.)

Carell is similarly coy about “demonizing the characters” in the movie but offers a very human motivation to some of Randall's actions. The film sees Randall grappling with a terminal cancer prognosis that he refuses to accept, demanding his doctor find a solution, and later banking on the idea of having his consciousness immortalized by tech. It's a storyline that mimics real-world transhumanism movements, where entrepreneurs like Bryan Johnson are determined not to die.

“I think people are naturally afraid of death,” Carell says. “And he is, but he sees, somehow, he sees an out. He sees a way of cheating it. And so I think that motivates him to make decisions at the expense, basically, of the rest of the world.”

Mountainhead ends somewhat ambiguously, with deals afoot and the fate of the world still very much in the hands of these four men. It's too bad that part doesn't feel like satire.

Tesla's Cybertruck sales dropped significantly in recent quarters, leading to a rapid buildup of unsold inventory. And it looks like the company is resorting to unconventional storage sites for the excess vehicles.

One such location, per Crains Detroit Business, is a Detroit shopping center that is now in violation of city code for storing dozens of Cybertrucks and other unsold Teslas in its parking lot. 

No doubt the parking lot looks like a dystopian graveyard with rows upon rows of shiny silver Cybertrucks taking up space where shoppers once came to visit the now-closed Bed, Bath and Beyond and Torrid. The Buffalo Wild Wings in the shopping center, though, is still open. 

The lot is near a new Tesla showroom in West Bloomfield, which may account for the overflow. Crain's reports that the shopping center landlord has been informed of the violation, but enforcement could take some time. 

While still outselling other electric trucks, Tesla's Cybertruck has underperformed CEO Elon Musk's hopes for its success after eight recalls within a year and the automaker's brand devaluation due to Musk's political involvement.

For accounting departments, no software is more important than the general ledger system. It's the central hub that summarizes all financial transactions, providing the essential data needed to create accurate financial statements.

“The general ledger is the beating heart of the finance function, and so asking a company to remove it is a kind of open-heart surgery,” said Julien Bek, a partner at Sequoia Capital.

Until a few years ago, Bek believed that VCs wouldn't dare to invest in startups building new general ledger software. It's not only difficult to get customers to switch from their existing accounting software, but building a new general ledger business is also very challenging, he explained.

Bek changed his mind when he discovered Rillet, a three-year-old company leveraging machine learning and generative AI to automate accounting reports. Rillet directly pulls data from their customers' banks and platforms, such as Salesforce, Stripe, Ramp, Brex and Rippling, to generate essential financial statements, including the balance sheet and income statement.

Rillet founder Nicolas Kopp (pictured above) says thanks to machine learning and AI, his company's software enables accounting and finance teams at medium-sized companies to close their monthly or quarterly books in hours, a process that previously took weeks. Prior to Rillet, Kopp was U.S. CEO of European neobank N26.

Since launching its product last year, Rillet's revenue has grown five-fold, and it has brought on nearly 200 customers, including fast-growing companies like Windsurf, the AI coding assistant reportedly sold to OpenAI for $3 billion, and Decagon, an AI customer support startup reportedly valued at $1.6 billion.

In the past, companies of that size would likely have installed NetSuite, general ledger software developed in the late 1990s that is still very popular with middle-sized companies. But NetSuite is slow and clunky.

“I think a third of their deals are coming from [customers] replacing NetSuite, or NetSuite-like systems,” Bek said about Rillet's customers.

It was this statistic that helped Sequoia decide to invest. “What I was watching for is that they start replacing NetSuite. Because [with] many companies, you can get the small customers, but getting the big ones, I think that's really hard,” Bek said.

On Wednesday, Rillet said it has raised a $25 million Series A led by Sequoia Capital, with participation from existing investors. The fresh funding comes 10 months after the company raised a $13.5 million seed and pre-seed round from First Round Capital, Creandum and Susa Ventures.

Rillet's AI makes the installation process relatively painless. It used to take many months to transfer all the data from one general ledger software to another, Rillet can reduce that time to about four to six weeks, Kopp said. Clients simply continue to use the existing general ledger platform until they are sure that all the data has moved to Rillet.

According to Kopp, Rillet competes with NetSuite and other legacy platforms, but currently doesn't have a clear rival that leverages AI and machine learning to replace accounting systems for mid-size companies. Digits, another AI accounting startup, recently launched its autonomously-powered general ledger, but unlike Rillet, it targets small businesses that use QuickBooks and Xero.

LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a data broker that collects and uses consumers' personal data to help its paying corporate customers detect possible risk and fraud, has disclosed a data breach affecting more than 364,000 people. 

The company said in a filing with Maine's attorney general that the breach, dating back to December 25, 2024, allowed a hacker to obtain consumers' sensitive personal data from a third-party platform used by the company for software development.

Jennifer Richman, a spokesperson for LexisNexis, told TechCrunch that an unknown hacker accessed the company's GitHub account.

The stolen data varies, but includes names, dates of birth, phone numbers, postal and email addresses, Social Security numbers, and driver license numbers.

It's not immediately clear what circumstances led to the breach. Richman said LexisNexis received a report on April 1, 2025 “from an unknown third party claiming to have accessed certain information.” The company would not say if it had received a ransom demand from the hacker.

Data brokers like LexisNexis are part of a billion-dollar industry of companies that profit from collecting and selling access to large amounts of Americans' personal and financial data. LexisNexis uses swathes of consumer information to help companies detect potentially fraudulent transactions, as well as to perform risk assessment and due diligence on would-be customers. 

Last year, The New York Times reported that car manufacturers were among several companies that shared data on vehicle driving habits with LexisNexis without car owners' explicit permission. The data was then sold on to insurance companies, which used the mileage and driving data to determine the drivers' insurance premiums.

Law enforcement agencies also use LexisNexis for obtaining personal information on suspects, such as names, home addresses, and call records. 

Earlier this month, the Trump administration scrapped a plan that would have restricted data brokers from selling Americans' personal and financial information, including Social Security numbers. White House official Russell Vought wrote in a Federal Register notice that the Biden-era rule, which would have required data brokers to follow the same federal privacy rules as credit bureaus and renter-screening companies, was “not necessary or appropriate,” despite long-standing calls by privacy advocates to close the loophole.

With Apple's flagship Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event a few weeks away, the company is signaling that it's paying attention to the opportunity of mobile gaming.

Apple already has a subscription-based Arcade product for iOS, which gives users access to various mobile games, including cult-classic indie games like Stardew Valley. But per a Digital Trends report, the company is taking things a step further by acquiring its first game studio, RAC7, which makes the hit Apple Arcade game Sneaky Sasquatch.

Apple joins some other seemingly unlikely suspects in their investment in mobile gaming — Netflix, for example, acquired several gaming studios after launching Netflix Games in 2021, which makes cloud mobile gaming available to Netflix subscribers.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg confirmed a 9to5Mac report that Apple is developing a dedicated gaming app for iOS 19. The app will reportedly replace the Game Center app and integrate with Apple Arcade to host features like gaming leaderboards, recommendations, challenges, and social features. The new app could also integrate into iMessage or FaceTime to facilitate remote multiplayer gaming.

Apple's additional investment in mobile gaming comes at a time when cloud gaming — which allows users to stream games to their devices without downloading massive files — is on the rise. Microsoft has been a leader in this shift with its Xbox Cloud Gaming offerings.

Tech companies are betting heavily that nuclear power can help deliver the electricity they need to realize their AI plans. But data centers need power tomorrow, and the nuclear industry isn't known for its speed.

Trey Lauderdale thinks AI can give nuclear the speed that it needs. 

Lauderdale's obsession with nuclear started close to home. In San Luis Obispo, California, where he lives, he kept running into people who worked at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant. “They're like the coaches of our flag football team,” he said.

In talking with them, he learned that nuclear power plants are swimming in documents. Diablo Canyon, near Lauderdale's home in San Luis Obispo, has around 2 billion pages worth, he said. Lauderdale, a serial healthcare entrepreneur, had a hunch that AI could help the nuclear industry tame its paper problem.

Lauderdale founded Atomic Canyon a little over a year and a half ago, initially funding it with his own money. The startup uses AI to help engineers, maintenance technicians, and compliance officers find the documents they need.

The startup landed a deal with Diablo Canyon in late 2024. Lauderdale said the deal led to inquiries from other nuclear power companies. “That's when I knew, as an entrepreneur, we were at a point where we needed to raise a round of capital.”

Atomic Canyon closed a $7 million seed round led by the Energy Impact Partners, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Participating investors include Commonweal Ventures, Plug and Play Ventures, Tower Research Ventures, Wischoff Ventures, and previous angel investors.

When Atomic Canyon first started, its AI engineers tested various models with underwhelming results. “We quickly realized the AI hallucinates when it sees these nuclear words,” Lauderdale said. “It hasn't seen enough examples of the acronyms.”

But building a new AI model requires massive computing power. So Lauderdale talked his way into a meeting with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which conducts nuclear research and also happens to have the world's second fastest supercomputer. The lab was intrigued by the idea and awarded Atomic Canyon 20,000 GPU hours worth of compute.

Atomic Canyon's models use sentence embedding, which is particularly suited to indexing documents. It tasks them with making a nuclear power plant's documents searchable using retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. RAG uses large language models to create responses to queries, but it requires the LLMs to refer to specific documents in an effort to reduce hallucination.

For now, Atomic Canyon is sticking to document search, in part because the stakes are lower. 

“One of the reasons we're starting generative work around the titles of documents is because getting that wrong might cause someone a little frustration. It doesn't put anyone at risk at the plant,” Lauderdale said.

Eventually, Lauderdale envisions Atomic Canyon's AI creating “a first round draft” of documents, complete with references. “You are always going to have a human in the loop here,” he said.

Lauderdale didn't put a timeline on that effort, though. Search is “the foundational layer,” he said. “You have to nail the search.” Plus, given the number of documents in the nuclear industry, “we have a long runway in search alone,” he said.

Telegram has struck a partnership with Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, to distribute the latter's chatbot, Grok, via Telegram and integrate it into apps available on the chat app's platform for one year.

xAI will pay $300 million in cash and equity to the chat app as part of the deal, Telegram's CEO Pavel Durov said on Tuesday.

Durov said Telegram will also earn 50% of the revenue from xAI subscriptions purchased through the app.

Earlier this year, xAI made the Grok chatbot available to Telegram's premium users. It seems Grok might now be made available to all users.

A video posted by Durov on X suggested that Grok can be pinned on top of chats within the app, and users can also ask questions to Grok from the search bar. Notably, Meta has also integrated Meta AI into the search bar on Instagram and WhatsApp.

The video also shows that you will be able to use Grok for writing suggestions, summarizing chats, links, and documents, and creating stickers. Grok will supposedly also help answer questions for businesses and assist with moderation.

Note: This story was corrected to clarify that xAI is paying Telegram $300 million for distributing Grok.

Two new books attempt to tell the story of Sam Altman's OpenAI, its ambitions, and its growing empire.

In April, Paul Graham, the founder of the tech startup accelerator Y Combinator, sent a tweet in response to former YC president and current OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Altman had just bid a public goodbye to GPT-4 on X, and Graham had a follow-up question. 

“If you had [GPT-4's model weights] etched on a piece of metal in the most compressed form,” Graham wrote, referring to the values that determine the model's behavior, “how big would the piece of metal have to be? This is a mostly serious question. These models are history, and by default digital data evaporates.” 

There is no question that OpenAI pulled off something historic with its release of ChatGPT 3.5 in 2022. It set in motion an AI arms race that has already changed the world in a number of ways and seems poised to have an even greater long-term effect than the short-term disruptions to things like education and employment that we are already beginning to see. How that turns out for humanity is something we are still reckoning with and may be for quite some time. But a pair of recent books both attempt to get their arms around it with accounts of what two leading technology journalists saw at the OpenAI revolution. 

In Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman's OpenAI, Karen Hao tells the story of the company's rise to power and its far-reaching impact all over the world. Meanwhile, The Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future, by the Wall Street Journal's Keach Hagey, homes in more on Altman's personal life, from his childhood through the present day, in order to tell the story of OpenAI. Both paint complex pictures and show Altman in particular as a brilliantly effective yet deeply flawed creature of Silicon Valley—someone capable of always getting what he wants, but often by manipulating others. 

Hao, who was formerly a reporter with MIT Technology Review, began reporting on OpenAI while at this publication and remains an occasional contributor. One chapter of her book grew directly out of that reporting. And in fact, as Hao says in the acknowledgments of Empire of AI, some of her reporting for MIT Technology Review, a series on AI colonialism, “laid the groundwork for the thesis and, ultimately, the title of this book.” So you can take this as a kind of disclaimer that we are predisposed to look favorably on Hao's work. 

In 2019, Karen Hao, a senior reporter with MIT Technology Review, pitched writing a story about a then little-known company, OpenAI. This is what happened next.

With that said, Empire of AI is a powerful work, bristling not only with great reporting but also with big ideas. This comes across in service to two main themes. 

The first is simple: It is the story of ambition overriding ethics. The history of OpenAI as Hao tells it (and as Hagey does too) is very much a tale of a company that was founded on the idealistic desire to create a safety-focused artificial general intelligence but instead became more interested in winning. This is a story we've seen many times before in Big Tech. See Theranos, which was going to make diagnostics easier, or Uber, which was founded to break the cartel of “Big Taxi.” But the closest analogue might be Google, which went from “Don't be evil” to (at least in the eyes of the courts) illegal monopolist. For that matter, consider how Google went from holding off on releasing its language model as a consumer product out of an abundance of caution to rushing a chatbot out the door to catch up with and beat OpenAI. In Silicon Valley, no matter what one's original intent, it always comes back to winning.  

The second theme is more complex and forms the book's thesis about what Hao calls AI colonialism. The idea is that the large AI companies act like traditional empires, siphoning wealth from the bottom rungs of society in the forms of labor, creative works, raw materials, and the like to fuel their ambition and enrich those at the top of the ladder. “I've found only one metaphor that encapsulates the nature of what these AI power players are: empires,” she writes. 

“During the long era of European colonialism, empires seized and extracted resources that were not their own and exploited the labor of the people they subjugated to mine, cultivate, and refine those resources for the empires' enrichment.” She goes on to chronicle her own growing disillusionment with the industry. “With increasing clarity,” she writes, “I realized that the very revolution promising to bring a better future was instead, for people on the margins of society, reviving the darkest remnants of the past.” 

To document this, Hao steps away from her desk and goes out into the world to see the effects of this empire as it sprawls across the planet. She travels to Colombia to meet with data labelers tasked with teaching AI what various images show, one of whom she describes sprinting back to her apartment for the chance to make a few dollars. She documents how workers in Kenya who performed data-labeling content moderation for OpenAI came away traumatized by seeing so much disturbing material. In Chile she documents how the industry extracts precious resources—water, power, copper, lithium—to build out data centers. 

She lands on the ways people are pushing back against the empire of AI across the world. Hao draws lessons from New Zealand, where Maori people are attempting to save their language using a small language model of their own making. Trained on volunteers' voice recordings and running on just two graphics processing units, or GPUs, rather than the thousands employed by the likes of OpenAI, it's meant to benefit the community, not exploit it. 

An MIT Technology Review series investigates how AI is enriching a powerful few by dispossessing communities that have been dispossessed before.

Hao writes that she is not against AI. Rather: “What I reject is the dangerous notion that broad benefit from AI can only be derived from—indeed will ever emerge from—a vision of the technology that requires the complete capitulation of our privacy, our agency, and our worth, including the value of our labor and art, toward an ultimately imperial centralization project … [The New Zealand model] shows us another way. It imagines how AI could be exactly the opposite. Models can be small and task-specific, their training data contained and knowable, ridding the incentives for widespread exploitative and psychologically harmful labor practices and the all-consuming extractivism of producing and running massive supercomputers.” 

Hagey's book is more squarely focused on Altman's ambition, which she traces back to his childhood. Yet interestingly, she also  zeroes in on the OpenAI CEO's attempt to create an empire. Indeed, “Altman's departure from YC had not slowed his civilization-building ambitions,” Hagey writes. She goes on to chronicle how Altman, who had previously mulled a run for governor of California, set up experiments with income distribution via Tools for Humanity, the parent company of Worldcoin. She quotes Altman saying of it, “I thought it would be interesting to see … just how far technology could accomplish some of the goals that used to be done by nation-states.” 

Overall, The Optimist is the more straightforward business biography of the two. Hagey has packed it full with scoops and insights and behind-the-scenes intrigue. It is immensely readable as a result, especially in the second half, when OpenAI really takes over the story. Hagey also seems to have been given far more access to Altman and his inner circles, personal and professional, than Hao did, and that allows for a fuller telling of the CEO's story in places. For example, both writers cover the tragic story of Altman's sister Annie, her estrangement from the family, and her accusations in particular about suffering sexual abuse at the hands of Sam (something he and the rest of the Altman family vehemently deny). Hagey's telling provides a more nuanced picture of the situation, with more insight into family dynamics. 

Hagey concludes by describing Altman's reckoning with his role in the long arc of human history and what it will mean to create a “superintelligence.” His place in that sweep is something that clearly has consumed the CEO's thoughts. When Paul Graham asked about preserving GPT-4, for example, Altman had a response at the ready. He replied that the company had already considered this, and that the sheet of metal would need to be 100 meters square.

As we enter the colder months in Australia, covid is making headlines again, this time due to the emergence of a new variant: NB.1.8.1.

Last week, the World Health Organization designated NB.1.8.1 as a “variant under monitoring”, owing to its growing global spread and some notable characteristics which could set it apart from earlier variants.

So what do you need to know about this new variant?

More than five years since covid was initially declared a pandemic, we're still experiencing regular waves of infections.

It's more difficult to track the occurrence of the virus nowadays, as fewer people are testing and reporting infections. But available data suggests in late May 2025, case numbers in Australia were ticking upwards. Genomic sequencing has confirmed NB.1.8.1 is among the circulating strains in Australia, and generally increasing. Of cases sequenced up to May 6 across Australia, NB.1.8.1 ranged from less than 10% in South Australia to more than 40% in Victoria. Wastewater surveillance in Western Australia has determined NB.1.8.1 is now the dominant variant in wastewater samples collected in Perth.

Internationally NB.1.8.1 is also growing. By late April 2025, it comprised roughly 10.7% of all submitted sequences—up from just 2.5% four weeks prior. While the absolute number of cases sequenced was still modest, this consistent upward trend has prompted closer monitoring by international public health agencies.

NB.1.8.1 has been spreading particularly in Asia—it was the dominant variant in Hong Kong and China at the end of April.

According to the WHO, NB.1.8.1 was first detected from samples collected in January 2025. It's a sublineage of the Omicron variant, descending from the recombinant XDV lineage. “Recombinant” is where a new variant arises from the genetic mixing of two or more existing variants.

Like its predecessors, NB.1.8.1 carries a suite of mutations in the spike protein. This is the protein on the surface of the virus that allows it to infect us—specifically via the ACE2 receptors, a “doorway” to our cells.

The mutations include T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. It's early days for this variant, so we don't have much data on what these changes mean yet. But a recent preprint (a study that has not yet been peer reviewed) offers some clues about why NB.1.8.1 may be gathering traction.

Using lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested—suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains. The study also looked at how well antibodies from vaccinated or previously infected people could neutralise or “block” the variant. Results showed the neutralising response of antibodies was around 1.5 times lower to NB.1.8.1 compared to another recent variant, LP.8.1.1. This means it's possible a person infected with NB.1.8.1 may be more likely to pass the virus on to someone else, compared to earlier variants.

The evidence so far suggests NB.1.8.1 may spread more easily and may partially sidestep immunity from prior infections or vaccination. These factors could explain its rise in sequencing data.

But importantly, the WHO has not yet observed any evidence it causes more severe disease compared to other variants. Reports suggest symptoms of NB.1.8.1 should align closely with other Omicron subvariants. Common symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, fever, mild cough, muscle aches, and nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur in some cases.

There's potential for this variant to play a significant role in Australia's winter respiratory season. Public health responses remain focused on close monitoring, continued genomic sequencing, and promoting the uptake of updated covid boosters.

Even if neutralising antibody levels are modestly reduced against NB.1.8.1, the WHO has noted current covid vaccines should still protect against severe disease with this variant.

The most recent booster available in Australia and many other countries targets JN.1, from which NB.1.8.1 is descended. So it makes sense it should still offer good protection.

Ahead of winter and with a new variant on the scene, now may be a good time to consider another covid booster if you're eligible. For some people, particularly those who are medically vulnerable, covid can still be a serious disease.

As much as you love your current wireless earbuds, they may never be more useful to you than they are right now. That has nothing to do with their features or their sound, but everything to do with how they can help you upgrade into Samsung's newest and best buds, the Galaxy Buds3 Pro. Your old buds can work toward the $125 trade-in credit that Samsung's offering right now, which would bring you the Galaxy Buds3 Pro for just $125 —  half the original price.

Even if you have some unusual attachment to your current device, or decide they're better served as a hand-me-down, Samsung's still opening the door for you to get in on the AI-powered features of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro, with a $60 discount that doesn't require a trade-in of any kind. That would reduce the price to a still-solid $190, or $60 less than Apple's AirPods Pro 2.

See at Samsung

Galaxy AI is the big selling point of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro, and if you're wondering how artificial intelligence works with wireless earbuds, it's all about customization. Noise cancellation has been a desired feature in earbuds and headphones for a long time now, but with Galaxy AI, the Galaxy Buds3 Pro automatically adapt to the noise level of your surroundings, and also intelligently leave you enough external sound so you're aware of what's going on around you. It's the best and safest form of noise cancellation available.

The Adaptive Equalizer feature of the Buds3 Pro is also driven by Galaxy AI. The buds base their sound delivery on the way you wear them. They actually adjust their own sound profile based on your ear shape and how snugly they sit in your ear.

When you pair the Galaxy Buds3 Pro with a Samsung Galaxy Phone, like one from the Galaxy S25 fleet, you're in for an amazing treat. Using the power of the Galaxy Phone's translator, you can have face to face conversations translated in real time. Someone speaking a different language will come through the Galaxy Buds3 Pro in English or whatever language you set it to.

The Galaxy Buds3 Pro the latest and most advanced earbuds in the Samsung family, having dropped less than a year ago. You might expect a higher starting price than the $250 the Galaxy Buds3 Pro are currently listed at, but the current instant trade-in credit deal that brings them all the way down to $125 is a stunner, and the $190 price without trade-in is definitely not shabby at all. Check it out now at Samsung and have your old devices handy to see how low you can go with instant trade-in credit.

Update: May 27, 8:25 p.m. ET: Announcers on the SpaceX broadcast said Starship will break up above and crash into the planned landing zone in the Indian Ocean. They added that the Super Heavy booster was indeed lost.

Update: May 27, 8:18 p.m. ET: SpaceX anticipates the total loss of Starship as a result of the uncontrolled reentry. It's expected to crash into the Indian Ocean—or at least, bits and pieces of the vehicle.

Update: May 27, 8:13 p.m. ET: About 30 minutes into the mission, SpaceX announced that Starship had fallen into an unrecoverable spin as the result of the loss of attitude control. The spacecraft is suborbital and will perform an atmospheric reentry, but it will be an uncontrolled one. SpaceX pushed Starship further than in the previous two tests, but this latest flight can hardly be called a success.

Update: May 27, 8:02 p.m. ET: Starship blasted off from the Boca Chica launch mount a few minutes past 7:30 p.m. ET, following a pair of brief holds. All 33 Raptor engines went to work, with the fully integrated rocket surviving Max-Q, hot staging, and stage separation. Shortly after, however, SpaceX lost telemetry with the Super Heavy booster and was unable to attempt a controlled landing. The booster is presumably lost. As for the upper stage Ship, it continued along its journey and survived the trek to space, unlike the past two launches. SpaceX attempted to open the deployment doors at 7:54 p.m. but bailed on the procedure when the doors refused to open all the way. The company had hoped to deploy mock Starlink satellites during the demonstration.

Original article follows:

The world's largest rocket is gearing up for its ninth flight after suffering back-to-back anomalies. SpaceX is prepping Starship for liftoff on Tuesday, hoping the rocket fares better this time around after several improvements since its last flight.

Starship is set for liftoff on Tuesday, May 27 during a launch window that opens at 7:30 p.m. ET. The fully integrated rocket will take to the skies for its ninth test flight from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas. The launch will be streamed live on SpaceX's website and through the company's page on X, as provided here.

— SpaceX (@SpaceX) May 23, 2025



You can tune in 30 minutes before the scheduled launch time for the live webcast. You can also watch the launch via third-party providers, which we've provided below.

For its upcoming launch, SpaceX will use a Super Heavy booster that's flown before. The booster previously launched and landed during the rocket's seventh test flight on January 16, and 29 of its 33 Raptor engines have flown before. This will mark the first time SpaceX reuses a booster for its Starship rocket, which is a major step toward its reusability. Starship is a fully-reusable launch vehicle, meaning that both its Super Heavy booster and the upper stage, known as Ship, need to be caught mid-air by the 400-foot-tall Mechazilla tower.

After Back-to-Back Flops, SpaceX Says Starship's 9th Test Flight Is a Go

SpaceX has been making major progress with Starship's 232-foot-tall (71-meter) Super Heavy booster, catching the booster during three out of four attempts thus far. The same can't be said for the rocket's upper stage, however, which suffered glitches during the last two test flights.

During Flight 7 in January, Starship's upper stage suffered an engine problem that forced an early shutdown, causing it to break apart and rain down bits of rocket debris over Turks and Caicos in the Caribbean. Less than two months later, during Flight 8, the upper stage suffered another major failure, spinning uncontrollably before breaking apart a few moments after launch. Both times, the upper stage was supposed to make a soft splashdown off the coast of Western Australia about an hour after liftoff.

The failure prompted an investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which conducted a safety review of the rocket. Last week, the FAA gave SpaceX the green light to launch Starship for its ninth test flight. SpaceX also reported that it had identified the problem and made “several hardware changes,” ahead of Tuesday's liftoff, according to a statement. The company said that one of the rocket's engines failed to fire during the boostback burn, which was likely due to overheating of the engine's ignition device. SpaceX added insulation to Starship's engines this time around, hoping that it won't run into the same issue again.

During Tuesday's flight, Super Heavy “will fly a variety of experiments aimed at generating data to improve performance and reliability on future boosters,” SpaceX wrote. The rocket will also re-attempt objectives that it failed to meet during the last two test flights, including the deployment of payloads and “multiple reentry experiments geared towards returning the vehicle to the launch site for catch,” according to SpaceX.

SpaceX's Starship is a key part of NASA's planned return to the Moon as part of the agency's Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface in 2027. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is also betting on the company's Starship rocket for his plan to land humans on Mars. Ahead of Tuesday's launch, Musk will hold a company talk titled, “The Road to Making Life Multiplanetary,” which will be live streamed on X at 1 p.m. ET.

Three seasons—and then an abrupt end. It's a routine genre fans are unfortunately familiar with. There are still people out there (me included) holding out hope for fourth seasons of The Orville and Hannibal. The latest three-season casualty is Prime Video's The Wheel of Time.

Sometimes a miracle happens and another platform steps in; remember when Lucifer made three seasons at Fox, then got resurrected for three more at Netflix? Or when The Expanse was rescued from the Syfy scrap heap after its third season, and got a few more notches on its belt from Amazon?

Amazon's the one doing the scrapping this time around: The Wheel of Time fans learned last week that the fantasy show will not be returning for a fourth season. Pickup elsewhere seems like a grim prospect, no matter how passionate the online outcry, mostly because the reason given for its cancellation was how much it cost to produce—a price tag that apparently wasn't justified by its viewership numbers.

That's a true shame, because The Wheel of Time was a damn good show. 

Its budget wasn't as lavish as Prime Video's other big fantasy series—The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which is currently working on its own third season—but it definitely wasn't made on the cheap. It had a large cast headed up by Rosamund Pike as Moiraine Damodred; though the rest of the main characters were mostly played by up-and-comers, more familiar faces (Sophie Okonedo, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Olivia Williams, Lindsay Duncan, Hayley Mills) were sprinkled through the supporting cast. 

Across the board the performances were excellent; special shout-out to Madeleine Madden for Egwene's absolutely searing season-two arc, though.

Its production values were outstanding; on a show filled with a vast array of cultures across diverse landscapes—deserts, forests, cities, villages, throne rooms, dungeons, freaky in-between worlds—it did a striking job creating tones and textures that felt distinct and detailed. The costumes were particularly notable in this regard. I'm still haunted by the spooky outfits, especially the gold mouth shields, forced onto the magic-wielding “damane” slaves in season two. 

The special effects were also impressive, bringing both practical creatures (Loial the Ogier, brought to life by Hammed Animashaun in heavy prosthetics, being particularly emotive) and mystical magic “weaves” to the screen.

Much like Lord of the Rings, The Wheel of Time is based on a beloved book series, though as popular as Robert Jordan's work is, it's definitely not part of mainstream culture the same way JRR Tolkien's work is. There's no Oscar-winning trilogy of epic movies for The Wheel of Time, for one thing. Though there had been games (both video and tabletop) based on The Wheel of Time in the past, the TV adaptation drew in a lot of newcomers along with seasoned readers, and the show was careful to remain accessible for the former while also dotting in winks and Easter eggs for the latter.

The worldbuilding was high-quality, and if the story felt familiar and trope-y at times—it's kind of Tolkien meets Game of Thrones but with more women-powered magic, and an end-of-the-world prophecy that's both cyclical and inevitable—the series, broken into eight-part seasons of episodes that ran at or just under an hour, was still propulsive and enjoyable. 

The tone was overall fairly serious (as we mentioned, the fate of the world is at stake here!), and many of its storylines dealt with darker themes of trauma and grief, as well as the frustration of being powerless to control one's fate, especially in a world where prophecies are seen as both irrefutable and subject to interpretation, depending on who you ask.

But The Wheel of Time also made room for humor, romance, music, and even some delightfully campy moments, especially as the show found its footing in seasons two and three. 

Perhaps the biggest bummer about the show's cancellation is that it was clearly building toward something very big. The Wheel of Time's “Last Battle” is, as implied, the showdown at the end of days between the Dragon Reborn, the reincarnated chosen one, and a villain so sinister he's known only as the “Dark One,” with lieutenants running around among humankind known as “Darkfriends” (if they're mortal) and “Forsaken” (if they're not). 

The Last Battle was teased throughout all the show's seasons, with the character of Rand learning in season one that he was the Dragon Reborn. Season two followed him as he came to terms with that awful yet awesome responsibility, compounded by the known fact that in this world, men with magical abilities will inevitably go insane. And season three saw him begin to prepare, strengthening his control over his burgeoning powers while building an army of supporters. 

Every other character, without exception, is also invested in the Last Battle in some way. They're on different sides and serve different purposes, but they're all counting down to it just the same. It is the defining event of the story. Everyone knows it's coming. And Amazon pulled the plug before the show got there.

This is all the more crushing because Wheel of Time series creator Rafe Judkins had high hopes that Amazon would grant the space to tell “the whole story,” as he explained to io9 in an interview ahead of season three. There are over a dozen books in the Jordan series, so you can't imagine he meant that Wheel of Time would continue for a decade. But he definitely had plans for a fourth and maybe a fifth season, and you can tell that season three was plotted accordingly.

While fan campaigns are now underway to save Wheel of Time (read more about that on Nerdist), maybe the best case scenario would be a made-for-Amazon movie. Another Prime Video show that's meeting an early end for entirely different reasons—Good Omens—is getting a send-off movie in place of a third season, wrapping up that show's own tantalizing cliffhangers. 

With a fourth season apparently relegated forever to Tel'aran'rhiod, The Wheel of Time's slippery dream world, would it be too much to ask for, say, one more jumbo-sized episode to craft a satisfying conclusion? Especially for fans who invested time and emotions into the three existing seasons? 

Of course it would be. At least you can always pick up Jordan's books and find out how the author envisioned the Last Battle—then stick around to dive deeper into the world the show, after just three seasons, has sadly left behind.

Memorial Day weekend just came and went. Even if it isn't technically summer yet, I say it starts the moment you bite into your first hot dog or hamburger in a backyard. So with that definition, summer is in full swing. Do summer right this year by bringing music with exceptional sound wherever you go. Amazon has the JBL Clip 5 portable Bluetooth speaker on sale for 38% off at the moment. It normally goes for $80, but after the discount you can get it for $50. That'll save you a cool $30.

See at Amazon

The JBL Clip 5 is engineered to deliver crystal clear sound with a booming bass wherever you want to listen. The JBL Clip 5 is a portable speaker you can take along with you. It's IP67 waterproof and dustproof so you can take it poolside or too the beach to enjoy that warm record-high November weather. The fabric and rubber exterior is rugged and durable so it can withstand the elements or getting banged around a bit.

A carabiner is fully integrated into the Bluetooth speaker, making it ideal for taking with you anywhere. Clip it onto your bag or belt loop while embarking on a hike, to your beach chair while digging your toes in the sand, or even on the back of a paddleboard while heading out on the water.

Battery life is strong with portable speaker giving you 12 hours of listening time on a single charge. Plus, you can tap the Playtime Boost button to get three more hours out of it. That should handle the whole day out or at least most of it.

Choose from a wide array of colors to match your style and personality. The JBL Clip 5 is available in red, purple, blue, pink, or sand. There's also a patterned camo version. Just be careful not to lose it in the grass. If you just want a speaker that's loud in the auditory way and not the visual way, you can also select a white or black option.

Like all recent JBL Bluetooth speakers, the JBL Clip 5 supports Auracast. This means you can pair it with two or more speakers (also compatible with Auracast) to synchronize their output, creating stereo or surround sound. This is an excellent option for parties where you want multiple rooms of the house to be able to hear the music.

Right now, Amazon has the JBL Clip 5 for 38% off. This amounts to a savings of $30, bringing the price down to just $50 for a limited time.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a fringe anti-vaxxer who somehow became head of America's health agencies under President Donald Trump, met with the president of Argentina and discussed establishing a new alternative to the World Health Organization, according to a tweet from Kennedy on Tuesday. And while the substance of their meeting is important, all anyone can notice on social media is their bizarre photoshoot.

Your eyes don't deceive you. That's the Secretary of Health and Human Services holding a chainsaw that belongs to Milei and reads “las fuerzas del cielo” in Portuguese. Translated into English, it means “the forces of heaven.”

Milei, a far-right ally of President Trump, campaigned on promises to deliver austerity to his country and slash government spending, often wielding his chainsaw. And ever since, people who meet with Milei will often hold the chainsaw themselves. Billionaire oligarch Elon Musk waved the chainsaw around earlier this year at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where Musk looked absolutely blitzed out of his mind.

That conference in February, it should be noted, was the same CPAC gathering where two other speakers (including Steve Bannon) did Nazi-style salutes that mimicked Musk's gestures on Jan. 20.

It's particularly odd for Kennedy to be posing with a chainsaw, considering he was investigated for using a chainsaw to hack the head off a dead whale two decades ago. Kennedy's daughter described how the head was strapped to the top of the family car and said that whale juice was streaming down into the open windows. Kennedy called the investigation a weaponization of the government, and it was later dropped.

Kennedy posted other photos from the strange meeting at Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Tuesday, including another where Milei is seated at the head of the table and the chainsaw is in the foreground. Needless to say, the vibes are straight out of The Shining.

In another era, these photos would be mind-boggling and come to define the legacy of the politicians involved. But here in the year 2025, it's just another day that ends in Y.

What did these guys actually discuss? Apparently the Milei and Trump governments want to create some kind of woo-woo public health body that competes with the World Health Organization. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the WHO on his first day back as the American president on Jan. 20, and and Milei followed suit on Feb. 5.

“I had a wonderful meeting with Argentine President @JMilei about our nations' mutual withdrawal from the WHO and the creation of an alternative international health system based on gold-standard science and free from totalitarian impulses, corruption, and political control,” Kennedy wrote.

What makes the World Health Organization totalitarian? Kennedy doesn't get into specifics. But some far-right figures have claimed that WHO colluded with China to hide the “real” origins of the covid-19 pandemic. The Trump regime's gallery of health-adjacent weirdos insist covid-19 was created in a lab and unleashed upon the world either intentionally or accidentally. Most scientists still believe covid-19 has natural origins.

Kennedy has been busy in recent weeks, firing vital employees of the agencies he runs, including the FDA and CDC, and rolling out new policies. The health secretary was on a podcast Tuesday called “Ultimate Human” where he suggested government scientists would no longer be allowed to publish in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Lancet. Those are, of course, the most prestigious medical journals, but Kennedy called them “corrupt,” according to Politico.

Kennedy would instead like American scientists to publish their work in “in-house” journals. As luck would have it, FDA head Marty Makary and NIH director Jay Bhattacharya recently launched their own medical journal called the Journal of the Academy of Public Health. Science magazine called the journal's editorial policies “unusual,” and real scientists have noted the journal seems to be comprised of “a small clique of contrarians around the COVID pandemic.”

Synthetic tests don't provide the full scope.

AMD's recently announced mid-range RX 9060 XT 16GB has been put to the test in Geekbench across Vulkan and OpenCL, where it allegedly leads its predecessor by up to 30%. This test was likely and inadvertently made public by a reviewer, consistent with previous product launches. We strongly advise viewing these tests with skepticism, firstly due to their preliminary nature and secondly because synthetic benchmarks only provide a partial glimpse of a GPU's real-world capabilities.

After weeks of rumors and leaks, AMD finally lifted the veil off its budget RX 9060 XT GPUs at Computex last week. The RX 9060 XT family comes in 8GB ($299) and 16GB ($349) flavors, both using the same 200mm^2 Navi 48 GPU core with 32 Compute Units or 2,048 Stream Processors. AMD has transitioned to a PCIe 5.0 x16 (64 GB/s) interface for these GPUs, as opposed to the PCIe 4.0 x8 (16 GB/s) on last-generation RX 7600 XT cards. Likewise, the RX 9060 XT features a 3.13 GHz boost clock speed, extendable via manual or factory overclocking, along with a 150W/160W Total Board Power (TBP).

The test-bench for these benchmarks featured an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and 32GB of DDR5 memory atop the Gigabyte X870E Auros Master, and the RX 9060 XT 16GB. We've compiled publicly available test results for various relevant GPUs in Vulkan and OpenCL using Geekbench's repository. The RX 9060 XT managed to score 109,315 points and 124,251 points in OpenCL and Vulkan, respectively. This marks a solid 31.21% improvement over its last-generation counterpart, the RX 7600 XT, in Vulkan.

As expected, it falls short of its RX 9070 counterparts: 31.24% slower than the RX 9070 XT and as much as 24.4% slower than the RX 9070. Direct comparisons in synthetic tests between Nvidia and AMD are generally unreliable due to driver, optimization, and architectural differences. But for the sake of argument, the RX 9060 XT trails the RTX 5060 by 11% in OpenCL, while establishing a 5% lead in Vulkan. As expected, this anomaly stems from the inherent design differences between the two GPUs, and we'll only get a clear picture once independent reviews go live.

Synthetics might not push VRAM to its limits, but real-world gaming performance often relies on it. This is evident with the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, struggling to keep up with its 16GB counterpart in VRAM-bound titles, even at 1080p. While AMD asserts the RX 9060 XT 8GB is designed for the majority of gamers, engaged in esports at 1080p, critics are still questioning the firm's rationale behind this model.

The company revealed its dual-GPU plans to us at Computex


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Sparkle has confirmed the company is working on dual-GPU versions of the Intel Arc B60, as the company showed off its trio of cooling solutions at Computex 2025. The company demoed its blower, passive, and liquid-cooled solutions, and confirmed to Tom's Hardware that it is working on dual-GPU versions.

All of Sparkle's Arc Pro B60 graphics cards carry Intel's BMG-G21 graphics processing unit with 2560 stream processors (20 Xe cores, 160 ray tracing, and 160 XMX cores), mated with 24GB of GDDR6 memory using a 192-bit interface. The boards are aimed at a wide range of applications, including AI inference, computer-aided design, professional graphics, and media encoding/decoding.



To ensure that the cards are tailored for various deployments, they come with different cooling systems, including a blower cooler that can be used both for desktop workstations and rack servers; a passive cooler for servers; and a liquid cooler. For some reason, Sparkle only demonstrated its Arc Pro B60 cards with a blower and passive cooler, but the liquid-cooled board was referenced, listed as ‘Prototype B.' So, while it is likely that the liquid-cooled Arc Pro B60 for datacenters will have similarities with this model, we do not know what the final product will look like. There is, of course, a big question as to whether the Arc Pro B60 needs liquid cooling, given it features a total board power of 200W, and a blower with a large radiator will manage its cooling perfectly.



When asked about dual-GPU Intel Arc Pro graphics boards for AI inference applications, the company's representative answered that these boards are in the works and will be available later, if there is demand.



Of course, there is a major caveat with all Intel Arc Pro B60 graphics cards, as BMG-G21 is generally an entry-level GPU, so do not expect such cards to challenge the best graphics cards for high performance, either for AI or graphics applications. To that end, Sparkle and other makers of add-in-boards will have to price their Arc Pro cards low enough to make them appealing to potential customers.

Sparkle plans to start sales of its Arc Pro B60 graphics cards in the coming months. At this point, we do not have any information about their pricing. Bearing in mind that these boards are aimed at servers and workstations and therefore will be sold to system integrators, their prices will depend on volumes and other factors.

We've been waiting for a fast, efficient, and polished high-end PCIe 5.0 SSD for quite some time. The long wait is over as Sandisk delivers the goods with the excellent WD Black SN8100, a drive that just about defies all expectations. Anyone asking for the singular “best” SSD now has the definitive answer.

What makes this SSD so great? Aside from chart-topping performance in almost every category, including the all-important random read performance, it's also one of the most efficient drives we've ever tested. Sandisk doesn't skimp anywhere and even promises an 8TB SKU later this year, making it essentially impossible to find a better all-around drive. It's an absolute achievement and easily our top recommendation if you have the ability to get it. It's going to be overkill for most things, but sometimes that's part of the fun.

The Sandisk WD_BLACK SN8100, henceforth referred to as the WD Black SN8100, is launching with the expected capacity range, covering 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB. However, Sandisk indicates that an 8TB SKU is expected later this year. This is a point in the drive's favor, as 8TB remains desired by enthusiasts and is often a difficult capacity to hit. WD surprised us last year with its launch of an 8TB WD Black SN850X. The company nailed it with that model, and it has become the de facto choice if you want a fast 8TB drive. We are therefore optimistic that we'll see a viable option here, hopefully in 2025 as promised.

Sandisk waited to bring out its answer to Phison's early adopter E26 controller drives, and the performance specifications do not disappoint. The drive can reach up to 14,900 / 14,000 MB/s for sequential writes and up to 2,300K / 2,400K random read and write IOPS. While these numbers aren't record-setting per se, Phison had to work very hard with its controller technology – creating the so-called Max14um SSD platform – to reach or surpass 14,000 MB/s. It's fair to expect that the WD Black SN8100 can push these more consistently.

The drive supports hardware encryption through TCG Opal 2.02. Sandisk backs the drive with a 5-year, 600TB of writes per TB capacity warranty. This is pretty standard. Models are offered with and without heatsinks. The base versions come with suggested retail prices of $179.99, $279.99, and $549.99, with an additional $20 for the heatsink. In general, we recommend a heatsink for any drive of this caliber, and $20 is a fair price for an upgrade. If the WD Black SN8100 has one weak spot, it's here in the pricing – these prices target the Samsung 9100 Pro and all but make it obsolete, true, but the Crucial T705 is still less expensive and still viable.

Sandisk is almost second-to-none in terms of its software and support. The drive comes with free downloads for Acronis True Image, an OEM version of the popular backup software for cloning and imaging, as well as the WD Dashboard. This all-in-one SSD toolbox has you covered for features, health information, firmware updates, and more. In this department, Sandisk has come a long way to matching Samsung's Magician and software offerings, which makes the WD Black SN8100 feel like a premium product.

The WD Black SN8100 is single-sided at all of the launch capacities, which means it can be used in laptops and other devices that can't fit some double-sided drives. This is a nice change from the 4TB Black SN850X, which is a double-sided drive. You had to go with the Samsung 990 Pro to get the highest level of performance from the last generation of drives if you needed a single-sided solution.

As for this generation, drives have generally not been efficient enough for laptop use to be reasonable. Drives built on Silicon Motion's SM2508 controller are an exception, but until today, the main example of that was the OEM Micron 4600. We've covered the hardware aspects of the controller in our previous preview and in the 4600 review, with a key takeaway that it can deliver maximum performance without the power consumption drawbacks.



The WD Black SN8100 uses Kioxia's 218-Layer BiCS8 TLC flash along with DDR4 memory for metadata caching. We've seen this flash before on the excellent WD Black SN7100, a drive with fantastic power efficiency. Given what we saw with the preview SM2508, which used the less-efficient BiCS6 flash, we'd expect the WD Black SN8100 to be very efficient as well. The 4600 uses Micron's flash instead, which makes it very interesting to compare these two drives.

Because the BiCS8 flash is only four-plane instead of Micron's six-plane, the WD Black SN8100 has some potential advantages. More planes mean more bandwidth, but that's not really a problem with eight channels at up to 3,600 MT/s. Fewer planes could mean better power efficiency and also better optimization for small I/O, which is generally preferred among enthusiasts. This makes the WD Black SN8100 feel more agile – insanely so for a drive of this caliber, to be frank – which will make it hard to beat even with the same controller if you're looking for an all-around solution. Micron's flash has niche potential, though.

One possible drawback to mention here is the use of DDR4 rather than a lower-power option, such as the 990 Pro's LPDDR4. In the grand scheme of things, this won't have much impact on power consumption, but it does mean that there is some small room for improvement.



The WD Black SN8100's SMI SM2508 controller is a departure from the proprietary solutions usually used by Sandisk. Luckily, this isn't a serious negative, as the controller has proven itself to be very powerful and efficient. Unlike Phison's E26, which is built in the 12nm node, the SM2508 is built in 6nm. This gives it some advantages, including the ability to use newer flash up to 3,600 MT/s. This helps more at smaller capacities to eke out maximum performance rather than just push at higher capacities, given that even the E26's 2,400 MT/s is sufficient to saturate x4 PCIe 5.0 with eight flash channels. A higher interface rate can also lead to latency improvements, which are always welcome, providing a more responsive experience.

Not to leave Phison out in the cold, this also applies to its 7nm Phison E31T controller, which we tested with BiCS8 flash in the past. There is also the incoming Phison E28, which threatens to upend the current SSD landscape. So while the WD Black SN8100 may very well capture and hold the crown for now, it's not and won't be the only option in town, and may have some serious competition in the future. Especially as the SM2508 is not a proprietary part.

5x more contacts than consumer-grade LGA 1851 Arrow Lake sockets.

An alleged picture of the socket that is expected to host Intel's next-generation Diamond Rapids (Xeon seventhgeneration) family of server CPUs has emerged, as spotted by HXL on X. The LGA9324 socket reportedly carries over 10,000 pins, once you consider debug pins and the like. This will likely be the largest LGA CPU socket yet, unless future Venice offerings from AMD exceed this amount.

Last August, test tool listings for partners indicated that Intel's future Diamond Rapids processors will reportedly require a new Oak Stream platform with its LGA9324 socket. Under the Xeon 7 family, these CPUs are expected to supersede existing Granite Rapids offerings, across AP (Advanced Performance) Xeon 6900P and SP (Scalable Performance) Xeon 6700P/6500P offerings. Prototype cooler designs from Dynatron suggest Intel will fragment Diamond Rapids into AP and SP flavors, and so we might see a toned-down socket under the Oak Stream family for Diamond Rapids-SP.

Currently, Intel's largest socket, LGA7529, features at least 7,529 contacts, while AMD's SP5 offers 6,096. Xeon 6900P CPUs, utilizing the LGA7529 socket, offer up to 128 P-cores, support 12 DDR5 memory channels, and can reach a TDP of 500W. With a nearly 30% increase in pin-counts, expect more I/O, memory channels, increased TDPs, and even core counts. While we don't have a banana for scale, visually, this is a massive socket, dwarfing LGA1851 (used by Arrow Lake) by almost five times.

The Goofish listing mentions that the model in the shared image was apparently acquired from a scrap yard and was initially part of a thermal test board. What this means is that Intel is probably validating Diamond Rapids as we speak with their partners, and who knows if benchmarks or even an actual CPU sample surfaces soon?

Diamond Rapids is expected to leverage the Panther Cove-X architecture, which is believed to serve as a server analogue to Coyote Cove on Nova Lake. Rumored to be built using 18A, the launch of Diamond Rapids hinges greatly on its High Volume Manufacturing (HVM) readiness, with Panther Lake targeting HVM by late 2025.

This isn't an apples-to-apples comparison since Panther Lake's Compute Tile (Likely 18A) is expected to span between 100-150mm^2, while Compute Tiles on Intel's Xeon processors can be as large as 600mm^2. Even though Intel hasn't confirmed an exact release window for Diamond Rapids, we can expect these CPUs to arrive sometime in 2026, rivaling AMD's Venice.

 May 28, 2025  

The presence of foreign objects in the urethra or bladder often results from unconventional sexual practices. Patients may be reluctant to disclose these circumstances and fail to attend follow-up appointments, complicating diagnosis and treatment, which can lead to serious health risks and a reduced quality of life.

Michael Godzisz, MD, from the Department of Urology and Oncological Urology, Medical University of Lublin, in Lublin, Poland, and colleagues have documented several cases of foreign object findings in the urethra and the specific challenges associated with them.

Case 1

On May 15, 2005, a 34-year-old man presented with acute haematuria. During the medical examination, a cord protruding from the external opening of the urethra was observed. The patient did not disclose the events leading to the presence of the cord in the urethra. An x-ray of the pelvis revealed a coil of wire within the urinary bladder, which precluded removal through the transurethral approach. The patient subsequently underwent cystotomy with removal of the foreign body. The post-operative period was uncomplicated. However, the patient did not attend the follow-up visits.

Case 2

On April 08, 2007, a 25-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with recurrent urinary tract infections accompanied by urination difficulties. During the gathering of her medical history, she confided to the doctor that she had lost a pen in her bladder 5 weeks earlier while masturbating. Cystoscopy was performed, and the foreign body was removed via a transurethral approach. The patient attended a follow-up visit without complications.

Case 3

On November 21, 2008, a 32-year-old man presented with severe haematuria. He had been treated for recurrent lower urinary tract infections for 3 years. The patient reported having inserted a nylon string into the urethra while under the influence of alcohol a few years prior to his current hospitalisation. Cystoscopy revealed a calculus on the coils of the string. The patient underwent cystolithotomy, and the stone was successfully removed. The post-operative period was uncomplicated; however, the patient did not attend follow-up visits.

Case 4

On December 23, 2010, a 63-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a hairpin lodged in his urethra. The patient had inserted it to achieve penile rigidity. An x-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder confirmed the pelvic location of the hairpin. He underwent open surgery, during which the foreign body was removed. The post-operative follow-up was without complications.

Case 5

On June 30, 2012, a 46-year-old woman under the influence of alcohol presented with a thermometer in her bladder. She claimed that she had attempted to measure her body temperature and could not explain how the thermometer ended up in the urinary bladder. After an x-ray, the foreign body was removed under spinal anaesthesia using Randall forceps. The patient did not attend the follow-up visits.

Case 6

On October 04, 2012, a 43-year-old woman presented after accidentally inserting an elongated plastic object into her urinary bladder. She claimed that she used the object to enhance her sexual experience during intercourse. The object was removed endoscopically using Randall forceps. The patient attended a follow-up visit, and there were no post-operative complications.

Case 7

On May 05, 2013, a 16-year-old girl presented with abdominal pain and pyuria. An x-ray of the kidneys, urethra, and bladder revealed a calculus associated with an oblong object. The patient reported that it was a fragment of a pen that she had inserted into her urinary bladder while masturbating 1 year prior to her hospital visit. Under spinal anaesthesia, the calculus and the fragment of the pen were removed during cystoscopy using lithotripsy. The patient did not attend the follow-up visits.

“The diagnostic process and subsequent follow-up after treatment can be problematic, as patients often struggle to explain the circumstances surrounding their actions,” wrote the study authors.

The authors noted that compiling these case reports may help raise awareness among healthcare professionals and patients that inserting objects into the urethra can lead to severe health complications and lead to unnecessary surgical interventions, ultimately lowering patients' quality of life.

In older adults, increased sedentary time was associated with smaller brain volume, greater neurodegeneration, and worse cognitive performance, especially among apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers, new research suggested. These associations persisted over a 7-year period, even among people who achieved recommended levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA).

“These findings are particularly important in the context of aging, as mobility limitations and greater sedentary time increases in older adults. From a personalized medicine approach, healthcare professionals might consider assessing not only a patient's exercise regimen but also the amount of time they are sedentary throughout the day, recommending a reduction in such sedentary behavior in addition to increasing daily physical activity,” the study authors wrote.

This study was led by Marissa A. Gogniat, Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center, Nashville, Tennessee. It was published online on May 13 in Alzheimer's and Dementia.

This study included a racially homogenous, highly educated, and physically active sample, which may have limited its generalizability. Methodological limitations included the use of cross-sectional rather than longitudinal MRI registration, the use of individual neuropsychological subtests instead of composites, and a potential inaccuracy due to wrist-worn actigraphy devices. This study also did not conduct a full 24-hour compositional activity analysis, which could have improved the assessment of optimal activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep distribution.

This study was funded by the Alzheimer's Association, National Institute on Aging, Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University High-Performance Computer Cluster for Biomedical Research, and the Richard Eugene Hickman Alzheimer's Disease Research Endowment.

A recent analysis indicated that switching from the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine to the recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) could have prevented nearly 100,000 hospitalizations among working-age adults in the United States over 10 seasons. The greatest benefits would have been seen in individuals aged 50-64 years and at-risk adults aged 18-49 years with chronic conditions.

“Considering the whole 50- to 64-year age group for the use of enhanced vaccines, like RIV, deserves consideration as it could support public health interventions promoting healthy aging,” the authors wrote. “A risk-based recommendation may be more appropriate for younger working ages, given the fraction of burden within those with chronic conditions,” they added.

The study was led by Laurence Torcel-Pagnon, MSc, Sanofi, Lyon, France. It was published online on April 17, 2025, in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

The vaccine effectiveness of RIV vs the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccinevaries between seasons and studies, making it challenging to compare benefits across different scenarios. The analysis was limited due to a scarcity of high-quality evidence on clinical burden and vaccine effectiveness in at-risk groups. Lastly, the modeling approach used may not have considered indirect effects that influenced vaccination at the population level.

This study was funded by Sanofi. The authors reported being employees of Sanofi and potentially holding shares in the company.

The ancient Egyptians believed that mummifying the king's body enabled his ascension to the realm of the gods. According to this belief, the preserved body, known as the Ach — a luminous spirit — was thought to enter the sarcophagus, symbolizing the womb of Nut, the mother goddess of the sky.

This belief in the enduring power of corpses echoes human history.

In the early history of the Church in the West, Christians developed a special reverence for the bones of saints. Among the many preserved relics are Jesus' foreskin and the head of John the Baptist.

By the 19th century, European scientists had begun to preserve and study the organs of extraordinary individuals.

From Mohammed's beard and Buddha's teeth to Adolf Hitler's testicles, this offers an overview of the most famous human body parts in history. Part I examines the masculinity of Napoleon Bonaparte.

How masculine was Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821)? The answer to this question depends on the definition of masculinity. However, sufficient biographical evidence exists to offer clear answers to some of the possible variations in this otherwise broad and general question.

During the French Revolution, young soldier Bonaparte distinguished himself as a military talent of the highest caliber. He went on to become a general of the First French Republic, the First Consul of France, and eventually the Emperor of the French, King of Italy, and Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine.

Pieter Geyl wrote in 1947, “It is impossible that two historians, especially two historians living in different periods, should see any historical personality in the same light.” reflecting on the personality that enabled Bonaparte's swift rise to military and political power.

What is beyond dispute is that Bonaparte was “ambitious,” “highly intelligent,” “exceptionally well-organized,” and possessed “an excellent memory.”

These traits allowed him to issue complex military orders swiftly and accurately during critical battles without losing track of troop movements.

Arthur Wellesley, first Duke of Wellington from 1769 to 1852, said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers. He could charm people when he needed to but could also publicly humiliate them and was known for his rage when his plans were frustrated.

By that measure, if masculinity was defined by ambition, resolve, and authority, Napoleon would undoubtedly be masculine.

Physical strength is another traditional indicator of masculinity.

Swiss officer Johann Ludwig Wurstemberger, who accompanied Bonaparte between 1797 and 1798, described him at 29 as “slight and emaciated looking.”

Among his troops, Bonaparte was nicknamed Le Petit Caporal, translated as “The Little Corporal.” In many later portraits, he appears noticeably shorter than his officers do.

This apparent contradiction between personality and physique inspired the Austrian physician and psychiatrist Alfred Adler in 1870-1937 to retrospectively diagnose Bonaparte with an inferiority complex, which was largely caused by his small stature and sexual dysfunction. Adler's theory evolved into what is now known as the “Napoleon complex.”

Historians now know that Napoleon was not unusually short. Standing at 1.686 m, he was > 8 cm taller than the average Frenchman of his time. Young soldiers usually measured between 1.65 and 1.69 m. The fact that Bonaparte nevertheless appears short in paintings is probably due to his preference for tall soldiers — none of his bodyguards were < 1.76 m.

Bonaparte had his first sexual experiences at 18 as a second lieutenant with Parisian prostitutes from the Palais-Royal. He remained faithful to his first wife, Joséphine de Beauharnais, for 2 years — 1763-1814. While on campaign in Egypt, he met Marguérite Pauline Fourés in 1778-869, who was newly married. After sending her husband, a lieutenant, back to France with an important letter, Bonaparte had an affair with Fourés.

Two years later, he became involved with the famous Milanese opera singer Giuseppina Grassini — 1773-1850. Later, Bonaparte had affairs with actors Marguerite-Joséphine Georges in 1787-1867 and Catherine-Joséphine Duchesnois in 1777-1835, as well as with Adèle Duchâtel — 1782-1860, the wife of an elderly state councilor.

Napoleon appointed the young Genoese dancer Carlotta Gazzani in 1789-1827 as de Beauharnais's reader to facilitate his affairs with Gazzani. Bonaparte also seduced the wives of his officers and other politicians.

However, politician and writer Marie-Henri Beyle in 1783-1842, who witnessed one of Bonaparte's encounters, wrote about his sexual performance:

“The emperor, sitting at a small table with his sword at his side, signed decrees. The lady entered, without being disturbed, he asked her to sit on the bed. The main part of the meeting lasted < 3 minutes. Often his Mameluke stood behind a screen.”

Surgeon and author Robert McNair Wilson later speculated that Napoleon had testicular atrophy and impotence in his 50s. Even when the Countess of Ornano, Maria Walewska in 1786-1817, with whom he had already fathered an illegitimate child, secretly visited him in exile in 1814, she was given separate accommodation.

A final thought-provoking detail about Bonaparte's masculinity comes from his penis, obtained during an autopsy in 1821 and reportedly preserved to this day.

In a Channel 4 documentary by the British television network, Napoleon's preserved penis, reportedly owned by American urologist John Kingsley Lattimer, was measured off-camera. at 1.0 inch (2.54 cm). Experts estimate that in his lifetime, it may have measured approximately 3-4 cm.

The penis is often viewed as a symbol of male creativity and power. However, the discovery of the penis of one of history's most influential and idealized figures, Monarch Napoleon I, invites a reconsideration of penis cults and old stereotypes.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended sparsentan (Filspari, Vifor Pharma) for treating primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy in adults.

The recommendation reverses NICE's February decision to reject NHS funding for the drug. The regulator had previously said available evidence did not demonstrate value for money.

The manufacturer provided additional analyses and agreed to a price discount, leading to the positive recommendation.

Sparsentan reduces urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) more effectively than standard treatment. The drug may also better maintain kidney function, NICE said. 

In its final draft guidance , the regulator recommended sparsentan for immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) patients with a urine protein excretion of 1.0 g/day or more, or a UPCR of 0.75 g/g or higher.

Treatment should cease after 36 weeks if a patient's UPCR remains at or above 1.76 g/g and has not reduced by at least 20%.

IgAN affects more than 18,000 people in England. It ranks among the most common causes of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. 

Over 4200 people with chronic kidney disease could benefit from NICE's recommendation.

Standard care for IgAN includes angiotensin-2 receptor blockers such as irbesartan.

Sparsentan works by blocking the receptors for two hormones — endothelin-1 and angiotensin II — that cause kidney damage. By blocking these receptors, the drug reduces the amount of proteinuria and slows down the progression of kidney damage. 

Clinical trial evidence has shown that sparsentan reduces UPCR more than irbesartan. Evidence also suggests that sparsentan is better at maintaining kidney function than irbesartan, but this was uncertain, NICE explained.

The regulator's recommendation was informed by the outcome of the PROTECT study. The double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 trial included patients aged 18 years or older with biopsy-proven primary IgAN and proteinuria of at least 1.0 g daily despite maximised renin-angiotensin system inhibition for a minimum of 12 weeks.

Patients were randomly assigned to either receive 400 mg of oral sparsentan or 300 mg of oral irbesartan, both taken once daily.

The sparsentan group showed slower rates of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline. At 36 weeks, sparsentan had significantly reduced proteinuria, a reduction that continued throughout the study. 

At 110 weeks, proteinuria, as determined by the change from baseline in UPCR, was 40% lower in the sparsentan group compared with irbesartan patients. 

The composite kidney failure endpoint was reached by 9% of patients in the sparsentan group compared with 13% of those in the irbesartan group. 

The researchers concluded that treatment with sparsentan vs maximally titrated irbesartan in patients with IgAN resulted in significant reductions in proteinuria and preservation of kidney function.

Sparsentan is taken as a once-daily tablet for long-term use. This differs from targeted-release budesonide, which is limited to 9 months' duration.

NICE said it expected the treatment to reduce NHS pressure by preventing or delaying progression to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or transplant.

Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, highlighted the limited treatment options available for the disease. She said that sparsentan offered long-term benefits to patients and “could make a huge difference to people's lives by delaying kidney failure.” 

Fiona Loud, policy director at Kidney Care UK, welcomed the guidance. She noted that IgAN typically affects younger patients, disrupting lives when people have young families or are starting careers.

“We're pleased that this new treatment for IgAN will now be an option for patients who need it,” Loud said.

Nine prominent medical and social care organisations have jointly condemned proposed amendments to mental health legislation that would extend police powers of detention to medical practitioners in England and Wales.

The amendments, tabled during the passage of the Mental Health Bill through Parliament, would empower “authorised” individuals, including medical professionals, to detain someone undergoing a mental health crisis.

At present, only the police have these powers of detention under the Mental Health Act 1983.

The nine groups, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of Nursing, and the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, warned of the risk of ""significant harm with dangerous consequences"" from the proposals.

The joint statement focused on proposed changes in the Bill to sections 135 and 136 of the Mental Health Act. These sections cover the detention of people in crisis in public or private settings.

If passed, the amendments, introduced in the House of Lords, would authorise powers of detention for doctors, mental health nurses, and approved mental health professionals.

Police officers would only need to attend to investigate a crime or if there was an immediate risk to life.

The organisations warned that removing police involvement in mental health incidents could be unsafe. 

According to the statement, “instances of detentions under the Mental Health Act where there is no risk are almost non-existent.” It noted that “the mere presence of uniformed officers can ensure that an otherwise risky situation remains contained and safe.”

The organisations also noted that police are essential in carrying out many tasks that medical practitioners cannot perform, such as checking whether it is safe to enter a home. 

The Bill aims to deliver on the government manifesto commitment to modernise mental health legislation to give patients greater choice, autonomy, and enhanced rights and support, ensuring dignity and respect throughout treatment. It is intended to give effect to the policy approaches outlined in a 2018 independent review by Sir Simon Wessely.

The statement criticised the lack of consultation with frontline professionals and patients. It warned that the changes could increase the use of restrictive practices and limit patient autonomy, undermining the aims of the legislation.

Transferring police powers to healthcare professionals could risk damaging their therapeutic relationships with patients, the statement said. It might also discourage people from seeking help.

Dr Lade Smith, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, who worked on the 2018 review, echoed these concerns. ""It is well known that at times, people experiencing a mental health crisis cannot be safely reached and cared for without the assistance of the police,"" she said.

Delegating police powers without proper consultation or planning ""sets a dangerous precedent"" and is likely to increase risk to patients and compromise the safety of others, Smith added.

Other signatories to the statement are the:

As the Bill moves to the committee stage in the House of Commons, the signatories 

called for joint working with police and government to improve crisis responses.

The Child and Youth Maltreatment Section of the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) has released a new Practice Point for the assessment of children with suspected traumatic head injury related to child maltreatment (THI-CM).

This type of injury “is not rare and frequently results in significant morbidity for the child and family,” the CPS told Medscape Medical News in email correspondence.

“Healthcare providers have important roles to play,” according to the new guidance. These include “identifying and treating these children, reporting concerns of child maltreatment to child welfare authorities, assessing for associated injuries and medical conditions, supporting children and their families, and communicating medical information clearly to families and other medical, child welfare, and legal professionals.”

The Practice Point was published online in Paediatrics & Child Health.

Although no single injury is pathognomonic for CM, there are several “red flags” that should prompt a healthcare provider to consider THI-CM, the CPS said. “These include elements of the history, clinical presentation, and radiographic findings.”

Red flags in the history include:

Red flags in the clinical presentation include:

Red flags in the radiographic findings include:

CPS also noted that the term THI-CM “was chosen through an iterative process to reflect the current language (traumatic head injury) used by health professionals, separated from the opinion on the cause of the injury (level of concern for child maltreatment).”

The terms “shaken baby syndrome,” “abusive head trauma,” “non-accidental head injury,” and “inflicted traumatic brain injury” are no longer recommended for use in Canada, they added.

If clinicians are concerned that CM may have occurred, they should approach the case with an open mind, be aware of possible bias, and have compassion for the child and family, according to the Practice Point. Other recommendations include:

Provincial and territorial laws require that clinicians report any concerns of possible CM to their local child welfare agency.

The Practice Point also stated that a pediatrician specialized in CM “can help guide clinical assessment and communication with families, healthcare professionals, child welfare, and law enforcement.” Consultation with other specialists, including critical care, ophthalmology, neurosurgery, neurology, orthopedics, endocrinology, hematology, genetics, and rehabilitation, “can assist as needed.”

Notably, the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP's) guidance mirrors that of the CPS, Suzanne Haney, MD, professor of child abuse pediatrics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and Nebraska Children's Hospital, Omaha, Nebraska, told Medscape Medical News.

Like the CPS, the AAP does not use the term “shaken baby syndrome” to describe suspected head trauma due to abuse, she said. “Instead, we use the term ‘abusive head trauma.' Sometimes these kids are shaken, sometimes they're slammed, sometimes shaken and slammed, we don't necessarily know exactly what the forces are, but we do know that it's abusive and was done by someone.”

Similar to the new Canadian guidance, Haney suggested advocating for the involvement of a child abuse expert when faced with a situation that suggests CM.

“Studies have shown that when you involve somebody with expertise, you are more likely to get the right diagnosis,” she said. “Most major medical centers have a child abuse pediatrician, although unfortunately our numbers are far too small. We do have a number of colleagues who may not be board-certified but have a special interest or expertise in this area. So if clinicians can identify somebody in their area who has a special interest in child maltreatment, they can be very helpful.”

The authors of the Practice Point reported no relevant financial relationships. Haney reported that she is the author of the AAP Technical Report on Abusive Head Trauma and is past chair of the Council on Child Abuse and Neglect of the AAP.

A lower proportion of children from non–English-speaking households received preventive medical care visits than their English-speaking peers.

“These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to improve preventive care for children from non–English-speaking households, ensuring equitable health care for all,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Prabi Rajbhandari, MD, of the Rebecca D. Considine Research Institute at the Akron Children's Hospital in Akron, Ohio. It was published online on May 22, 2025, in Pediatrics.

Researchers relied on the primary language spoken at home as a proxy of language barriers. Using telephone interpreters for non–English, non–Spanish-speaking households may have affected data interpretation quality. Grouping all non–English, non–Spanish languages together limited the analysis of specific languages.

No funding was received for this study. One author disclosed receiving a foundation grant from Akron Children's Hospital for studying language access and health literacy among non-English patients and families.

Patients with Sjögren disease (SjD) had a 68% higher risk for overall malignancy than the general population, with hematologic malignancies contributing more to this elevated risk than solid tumors. Cancer accounted for 23.8% of deaths, with older age at diagnosis, smoking, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and cryoglobulinemia identified as key predictors.

“These findings underscore the need for early identification of high-risk patients and the refinement of risk prediction models,” the study authors wrote.

This study was led by Olga Rusinovich-Lovgach, MD, Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda University Hospital, Madrid, Spain, and was published online on May 4, 2025, in Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism.

The small number of malignancies reduced statistical power, which may have prevented the evaluation of cancer-specific SIRs. The lack of a non-SjD control group may have limited the ability to differentiate disease-specific risk factors. Additionally, selection bias may be present, as patients recruited from rheumatology clinics likely had more severe disease, potentially not reflecting the broader SjD population.

This study received grants or industrial support from the Spanish Society of Rheumatology. One author reported receiving administrative support, article publishing charges, statistical analysis, and other ties with the Spanish Society of Rheumatology.

Patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who experienced higher levels of sleep disturbances were more likely to have greater difficulties with daily activities because of pain 6 months later.

“Identification and early intervention in problematic sleep patterns may contribute to enhanced long-term pain outcomes,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Burcu Aydemir, PhD, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago. It was published online on May 12, 2025, in Arthritis Care and Research.

This study relied on patient-reported assessments for sleep and pain interference, which may have introduced bias. Although the study accounted for several important confounders, it likely did not eliminate all potential sources of bias from unmeasured confounding. Additionally, the study did not assess the impact of the duration of sleep disturbances, so it's unclear how persistent or temporary sleep issues can affect pain interference outcomes.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Welcome back, everybody. My name is Teresa Amaral, and it's a real pleasure to have you here for this melanoma series on Medscape. We have talked in the last two episodes about the current status of adjuvant therapy and its benefit in patients with stage III melanoma, and in the last episode we discussed the absence of overall survival (OS) benefit.

You may question why it is important to have this discussion in terms of the absence of OS benefit or the absence of data on the OS benefit. This absence of data might have three consequences, and I'm going to go through them with you.

The first one is associated with reimbursement. The fact that we will need to wait until 2028, most likely, to evaluate the OS benefit from adjuvant therapy compared to placebo in stage III might lead to some discussions in terms of the reimbursement and might lead some agencies to consider whether they would like to continue reimbursing this therapy or not in this setting.

Second, in some countries, the absence of OS data is leading to discussions on whether they will fund this therapy or not until there is clear proof that there is an OS benefit. 

The third point is related to the fact that we don't knowthe patient's individual benefit. We also know that, depending on the stage, we might need to treat more patients to actually have one patient to prevent a recurrence. 

For example, we know that in patients in stage IIB, we will have to treat between five and nine patients in stage IIB to prevent a recurrence. In patients with stage IIC, we need to treat between four and seven patients to prevent a recurrence. 

All of these cost-effectiveness analyses are being done by the healthcare agencies, and this obviously needs to be taken into consideration when we are discussing these types of therapiesthat have a benefit in terms of relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival but lack data in terms of OS benefit. 

Another point is that, despite the fact that all the guidelines have been supporting the use of this therapy in stage III and stage IV — namely the ESMO guidelines and the ASCO guidelines— there is some uncertainty in terms of the OS benefit. This may lead to some difficult discussions and a lack of clear direction in terms of whatpatients should do when they need to make a decision on receiving adjuvant therapy or not. 

The patients and their treating physicians may struggle with treatment choices due to this uncertainty and the fact that they don't know if there will be a long-term survival impact for this particular patient or not.

Here, we come to the first discussion that we had a couple of sessions before, which is the absence of prognostic and predictive biomarkers in this setting.

New data suggest that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, used to treat diabetes and obesity, may also help guard against obesity-related cancers.

In a large observational study, new GLP-1 agonist users with obesity and diabetes had a significantly lower risk for 14 obesity-related cancers than similar individuals who received dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which are weight-neutral.

This study provides a “reassuring safety signal” showing that GLP-1 drugs are linked to a modest drop in obesity-related cancer risk, and not a higher risk for these cancers, said lead investigator Lucas Mavromatis, medical student at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, during a press conference at American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting.

However, there were some nuances to the findings. The protective effect of GLP-1 agonists was only significant for colon and rectal cancers and for women, Mavromatis reported. And although GLP-1 users had an 8% lower risk of dying from any cause, the survival benefit was also only significant for women.

Still, the overall “message to patients is GLP-1 receptor treatments remain a strong option for patients with diabetes and obesity and may have an additional, small favorable benefit in cancer,” Mavromatis explained at the press briefing.

Obesity is linked to an increased risk of developing more than a dozen cancer types, including esophageal, colon, rectal, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreatic, kidney, postmenopausal breast, ovarian, endometrial and thyroid, as well as multiple myeloma and meningiomas.

About 12% of Americans have been prescribed a GLP-1 medication to treat diabetes and/or obesity. However, little is known about how these drugs affect cancer risk.

To investigate, Mavromatis and colleagues used the Optum healthcare database to identify 170,030 adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes from 43 health systems in the United States.

Between 2013 and 2023, half started a GLP-1 agonist and half started a DPP-4 inhibitor, with propensity score matching used to balance characteristics of the two cohorts.

Participants were a mean age of 56.8 years, with an average body mass index of 38.5; more than 70% were White individuals and more than 14% were Black individuals.

During a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, 2501 new obesity-related cancers were identified in the GLP-1 group and 2671 in the DPP-4 group — representing a 7% overall reduced risk for any obesity-related cancer in the GLP-1 group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93).

When analyzing each of the 14 obesity-related cancers separately, the protective link between GLP-1 use and cancer was primarily driven by colon and rectal cancers. GLP-1 users had a 16% lower risk for colon cancer (HR, 0.84) and a 28% lower risk for rectal cancer (HR, 0.72).

“No other cancers had statistically significant associations with GLP-1 use,” Mavromatis told briefing attendees. But “importantly, no cancers had statistically significant adverse associations with GLP-1 use,” he added.

Experts have expressed some concern about a possible link between GLP-1 use and pancreatic cancer given that pancreatitis is a known side effect of GLP-1 use. However, “this is not borne out by epidemiological data,” Mavromatis said.

“Additionally, we were not able to specifically assess medullary thyroid cancer, which is on the warning label for several GLP-1 medications, but we did see a reassuring lack of association between GLP-1 use and thyroid cancer as a whole,” he added.

During follow-up, there were 2783 deaths in the GLP-1 group and 2961 deaths in the DPP-4 group — translating to an 8% lower risk for death due to any cause among GLP-1 users (HR, 0.92; P = .001).

Mavromatis and colleagues observed sex differences as well. Women taking a GLP-1 had an 8% lower risk for obesity-related cancers (HR, 0.92; P = .01) and a 20% lower risk for death from any cause (HR, 0.80; P < .001) compared with women taking a DPP-4 inhibitor.

Among men, researchers found no statistically significant difference between GLP-1 and DPP-4 use for obesity-related cancer risk (HR, 0.95; P = .29) or all-cause mortality (HR, 1.04; P = .34).

Overall, Mavromatis said, it's important to note that the absolute risk reduction seen in the study is “small and the number of patients that would need to be given one of these medications to prevent an obesity-related cancer, based on our data, would be very large.”

Mavromatis also noted that the length of follow-up was short, and the study assessed primarily older and weaker GLP-1 agonists compared with newer agents on the market. Therefore, longer-term studies with newer GLP-1s are needed to confirm the effects seen as well as safety.

In a statement, ASCO President Robin Zon, MD, said this trial raises the “intriguing hypothesis” that the increasingly popular GLP-1 medications might offer some benefit in reducing the risk of developing cancer.

Zon said she sees many patients with obesity, and given the clear link between cancer and obesity, defining the clinical role of GLP-1 medications in cancer prevention is “important.”

This study “leads us in the direction” of a potential protective effect of GLP-1s on cancer, but “there are a lot of questions that are generated by this particular study, especially as we move forward and we think about prevention of cancers,” Zon told the briefing.

This study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. Mavromatis reported no relevant disclosures. Zon reported stock or ownership interests in Oncolytics Biotech, TG Therapeutics, Select Sector SPDR Health Care, AstraZeneca, CRISPR, McKesson, and Berkshire Hathaway.

 May 28, 2025  

SAN FRANCISCO — A molecular variant of an older, hard-to-tolerate antifibrotic agent showed promise for reducing decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) over 26 weeks among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

These findings come from the phase 2B ELEVATE IPF trial, results of which were reported at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2025 International Conference here.

The trial compared the investigational agent deupirfenidone to placebo for protection against FVC decline in 257 patients with IPF.

The deupirfenidone molecule is nearly identical in conformation to pirfenidone, except for the substitution of hydrogen in pirfenidone for deuterium, or “heavy hydrogen,” in deupirfenidone at the site of metabolism.

This process, known as “deuteration,” is designed to make the modified compound less toxic than pirfenidone, said lead investigator Toby Maher, MD, PhD, from the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles.

Although the primary endpoint of the study was decline in FVC over 26 weeks, “when we've looked at the open-label extension of patients continuing on the high dose, we've seen a sustained stabilization in FVC over 52 weeks, again suggesting a durable effect of treatment,” he said in an oral abstract session.

In the ELEVATE IPF trial, 257 patients with IPF from 87 sites in 14 countries were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of four treatment arms: 550 mg deupirfenidone thrice per day, 825 mg deupirfenidone thrice per day, 801 mg pirfenidone thrice per day, or placebo thrice per day.

The primary Bayesian analysis showed that the mean adjusted change in FVC from baseline to 26 weeks was −48.4 ml for all patients randomized to deupirfenidone compared with −110.7 ml for patients assigned to placebo (posterior probability vs placebo, 98.5%).

The respective adjusted mean changes from baseline in FVC% predicted were −48.4% and −1.1% (posterior probability, 99.6%).

In a Frequentist inference analysis, compared with placebo the higher dose of deupirfenidone but not the lower dose was associated with significantly less decline in FVC and FVC% predicted. The adjusted mean changes over baseline were −21.5 ml for the 825 mg deupirfenidone group vs −112.5 ml for the placebo group (P = .02), and the respective changes in FVC% predicted were −21.5% and −3.43% (P = .01).

Both pirfenidone and deupirfenidone 825 mg (but not 550 mg) significantly delayed time to progression compared with placebo. The respective hazard ratios were 0.50 (P = .0076) and 0.439 (P = .0033).

In the placebo, pirfenidone, deupirfenidone 550 mg and 825 mg arms, respectively, treatment-emergent adverse events commonly associated with antifibrotics were nausea (7.7%, 27.0%, 16.9%, 20.3%), dyspepsia (3.1%, 22.2%, 12.3%, 14.1%), diarrhea (9.2%, 11.1%, 10.8%, 7.8%), abdominal pain (4.6%, 7.9%, 6.2%, 14.1%), photosensitivity reaction (0%, 7.9%, 6.2%, 7.8%), decreased appetite (7.7%, 14.3%, 18.5%, 20.3%), fatigue (1.5%, 11.1%, 7.7%, 9.4%), dizziness (3.1%, 7.9%, 9.2%, 12.5%), and headache (4.6%, 12.7%, 7.7%, 3.1%).

In the question and answer, session co-moderator Rachel Knipe, MD, from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, commented that there appeared to be a small signal for increased abdominal pain with deupirfenidone but less so for diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. She asked Maher whether investigators had also looked at liver function tests.

“The liver function tests didn't flag up as an adverse event that differed across groups or reached the threshold for inclusion in the table,” Maher said.

Maher acknowledged that there are gastrointestinal events associated with the drug, but added that it's difficult to distinguish specific events from one another.

“The challenge with clinical trials in interpreting adverse events is that we are beholden on the individual investigators to label the side effects,” he said, noting that one center's dyspepsia, may be another center's loss of appetite or abdominal pain.

In an interview, Medscape Medical News asked Knipe, whose laboratory at Mass General has a special focus on PF, for her impression of deupirfenidone.

“I think the data looks pretty good; it's exciting, and it looks like it has good effect on lung function,” she said, adding that the adverse event profile appears to be more favorable than that of pirfenidone. 

The study was funded by PureTech Health. Maher reported receiving grants and funding and serving as a consultant for the company and others. Knipe had no disclosures relevant to the study.

Switching to a second-line Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor resulted in steroid-free clinical remission in about half of the patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) after induction; compared with filgotinib, upadacitinib as a second JAK inhibitor was independently associated with the improved outcome.

""Here we report the largest experience to date of intraclass switching of JAKi [JAK inhibitor]. We show that 47.9% of patients present a SFCR [steroid-free clinical remission] after the induction period,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Mathilde Osty, Gastroenterology Department, Hôpital Henri Mondor, APHP, Créteil, France. It was published online on May 22, 2025, in Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics.

The sample size was small to analyse each specific sequence of the use of JAK inhibitors. The retrospective observational nature of this study resulted in the lack of information on faecal calprotectin and endoscopic outcomes, and data on long-term follow-up were also lacking.

Patients with moderate to severe active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who continued anifrolumab treatment over 4 years showed sustained improvements in health status and quality of life, along with improvements in health utilities and employment measures.

“These findings highlight the importance of including patient-reported outcomes as single, composite indices (eg, SF-6D) in clinical trials to allow comprehensive assessment of meaningful benefit for patients,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Vibeke Strand, MD, Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, and was published online on May 2, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology.

The exploratory and post hoc nature of the analysis may have limited the interpretation of the results, as the trials were not powered for the exploratory endpoints examined.

A single measles virus lineage is now spreading locally in Milan, primarily among unvaccinated adults, challenging high regional vaccination rates and sparking fears of the disease becoming endemic again.

Rapid communication: From multiple measles genotype D8 introductions in 2024 to sustained B3 local transmission in and around Milan, northern Italy, January to April 2025. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

Despite high vaccination coverage, Milan is experiencing a resurgence of measles, raising concerns about a potential return to sustained transmission. Moreover, 27 of the 32 confirmed measles cases in Milan and its surrounding areas in 2025 were traced back to a single virus lineage. In a recent study published in the journal Eurosurveillance, Italian researchers investigated how a single lineage of measles virus established itself in Milan and increased the risk of possible re-establishment of endemic transmission.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can be prevented through vaccination. Despite successful immunization campaigns in Europe, recent years have seen an alarming rise in measles cases, particularly in countries like Italy. In 2024, outbreaks in northern Italy were triggered mainly by people bringing the virus from abroad. These outbreaks involved multiple strains of the virus, primarily genotype D8, but did not result in continuous local transmission at that time.

Now, experts are noticing a shift. Genotype B3, which has caused significant outbreaks in other regions, appears to be spreading locally within Italy. Although vaccination coverage in Lombardy, the region encompassing Milan, is notably high (96.06% for the first dose and 93.63% for the second, according to the study), pockets of susceptible individuals remain, especially among young adults who were not immunized in childhood. Scientists are trying to understand how a single genotype could lead to persistent transmission, and whether this indicates a more profound vulnerability in public health defenses.

Geographical distribution of genotype B3 measles cases in Province A and Province B, northern Italy, January–April 2025 (n = 27). A colour pattern different from blue identifies a direct linkage between cases.

Between January and April 2025, researchers in northern Italy examined suspected measles cases reported across Milan and its surrounding areas. A total of 42 suspected cases were investigated. Local public health authorities collected demographic and clinical data using standardized forms and classified cases based on World Health Organization (WHO) definitions. Laboratory testing was conducted on throat swabs and urine samples using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to confirm measles virus infections.

The researchers then performed genetic analysis for the confirmed cases by sequencing the N-450 region of the measles virus nucleoprotein gene. This region is known for its genetic variability and is useful for identifying the virus genotype. All sequences were submitted to international surveillance databases such as GenBank and the WHO's MeaNS2 platform.

The researchers also mapped the geographic spread of cases using location and symptom onset data. They looked for epidemiological connections between patients, including family ties, travel history, hospital exposure, and attendance at mass gatherings. Additionally, the team employed phylogenetic tree-building methods to assess the relatedness of virus samples. These methods enabled researchers to confirm the spread of a unique B3 lineage across different provinces.

The study found that the measles virus genotype B3 was behind the growing number of measles cases in and around Milan during the first four months of 2025. Of the 32 confirmed measles cases, 27 were linked to this single genotype, pointing to sustained community transmission. This signified a marked shift from the previous year, when most measles cases were sporadic and travel-related, involving multiple virus strains without prolonged local spread.

The outbreak began with an imported case in early February. Within just two weeks, cases of locally acquired B3 measles began appearing, with no known connection to the initial traveler, suggesting ongoing community transmission.

By April, the B3 lineage was responsible for multiple small outbreaks across three provinces, with the most common viral strain appearing in more than 20 cases. Notably, only a handful of the cases were linked to international travel.

The most affected individuals were adults, with a median age of 36.5 years. Only seven people had been vaccinated, and only one had received the full two-dose series. Twelve patients required hospitalization, and two developed severe pneumonia. The virus also spread in hospitals and workplaces, underlining gaps in immunity among adults, including healthcare workers.

Furthermore, the genetic sequencing revealed that the B3 strain in Milan was nearly identical to a strain circulating in Morocco, where a large outbreak was ongoing. This strongly suggested the possibility that a single imported case introduced the virus into a susceptible population in Milan and its surrounding areas, where it spread unchecked among unvaccinated adults.

The researchers stated that the steady transmission over 12 weeks, along with clustered cases, suggested that this B3 strain could lead to the re-establishment of endemic measles in the region if left uncontrolled. Moreover, there was a high possibility of missed cases or undetected travel histories, which could obscure the full transmission chain.

Overall, the study highlighted the emergence of a single measles virus lineage that has rapidly spread through Milan and its surrounding areas, primarily among unvaccinated adults. The findings emphasized the risk of measles becoming endemic once again, despite high overall vaccine coverage. The researchers suggested that health authorities must close immunity gaps, especially in adults, and strengthen surveillance systems to detect and contain future outbreaks before they escalate quickly.

Approximately one in three pediatric mental health Emergency Department (ED) visits resulting in admission or transfer exceeded 12 hours, and over one in eight exceeded 24 hours, according to estimates based on nationally representative data from 2018 to 2022. Seven in 10 of all kids staying in the ED over 12 hours were there for suicidal thoughts or attempt, and over half for aggressive behaviors. Findings were published in the Journal of American College of Emergency Physicians.

Our study underscores significant issues with access to mental health care for children and adolescents, who often face prolonged ED stays because a psychiatric bed is not available. As the youth mental health crisis continues, we have been seeing more severe psychiatric conditions in the ED. Most of these kids seek emergency care at adult hospitals, which often have more limited pediatric resources compared to children's hospitals and might not be prepared to provide the necessary supports.""

Jennifer Hoffmann, MD, MS, Lead Author, Behavioral Health Medical Director, Emergency Medicine at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine

The study sample was representative of all pediatric ED visits for mental health concerns in the U.S., with only 1 percent occurring at children's hospitals. Dr. Hoffmann pointed out that given this situation, continued funding is essential for the Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC), a federal program that provides training to non-pediatric hospitals across the country in the efficient and effective care for youth in the ED.

Dr. Hoffmann and colleagues evaluated records that represented 5.9 million mental health ED visits by children 5-17 years old in a four-year period. An estimated 1.4 million of these visits resulted in admission or transfer.

The study found that youth with public insurance were more likely to remain in the ED for more than 12 hours waiting for a psychiatric bed, which highlights inequities in accessing mental health services.

""Differences in reimbursement rates for psychiatric services, which are often lower with public relative to private insurance, may contribute to inequities in care access,"" said Dr. Hoffmann.

In addition to the needed improvements in Medicaid reimbursement rates for pediatric mental health care and sustained funding for EMSC, Dr. Hoffmann suggested several potential solutions to increase mental health care access for youth. These include greater use of telehealth, school-based mental health services and integrating mental health care into primary care. She also mentioned the emerging psychiatric urgent care clinics, as well as free-standing psychiatric EDs, which might help respond to the growing demand for these services in children and adolescents.

The study was funded by the Pediatric Pandemic Network.

Announcing a new article publication for Cardiovascular Innovations and Applications journal. Asthma and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are intricately linked, because of their widespread prevalence and shared pathophysiological processes.

People who have experienced overlapping asthma exacerbation, persistent asthma, or asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) face elevated CVD morbidity and mortality risks. These risks are exacerbated in cases of type 2 asthma, a common phenotype of severe asthma leading to accelerated CVD progression.

However, type 2 inflammation also exhibits protective effects against CVDs. This review explores the dual role of type 2 inflammation in CVDs, emphasizing its detrimental effects (e.g., exacerbating atherosclerosis) and protective mechanisms (e.g., release of atheroprotective cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13).

Furthermore, it examines the therapeutic potential of anti-asthma medications targeting type 2 inflammation to mitigate CVD progression.

Nuclera, the biotechnology company accelerating protein expression and optimization through its benchtop eProtein Discovery™ System, has announced a collaboration with Cytiva, a global life sciences leader. This collaboration is focused on accelerating the production, purification and characterization of proteins required for drug research and development, enabled through the combination of Nuclera's eProtein Discovery System with Cytiva's Biacore™ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology.

Proteins represent 95 % of drug targets designed to combat disease. Rapid access to these proteins and understanding how they interact with drug candidates is essential for drug development. Typically, it takes months to obtain and characterize proteins, but Nuclera and Cytiva together have achieved production and characterization within five days. This achievement was showcased at industry conferences Discovery on Target and PEGS Europe, where Nuclera's eProtein Discovery System was used to produce Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). These proteins were subsequently functionally characterized using Cytiva's Biacore SPR system.

Collaborating with life science leader Cytiva supports Nuclera in our mission of improving human health. Through this collaboration, we have demonstrated eProtein Discovery's ability to produce clinically significant proteins that can be used in characterization experiments. Combining eProtein Discovery's capability to streamline protein production workflows with Cytiva's Biacore protein characterization systems open a whole new avenue for accelerating drug development.""

Dr. Yvonne Tan, Associate Director of Product Management, Nuclera

Anna Moberg, Senior Manager and Project Manager, Cytiva, added: ""The ability of Nuclera's eProtein Discovery to accelerate protein production and purification complements Cytiva's Biacore SPR technology by streamlining the upstream protein production process. We look forward to continuing our collaboration to further enhance the production of characterizable proteins for drug development.""

Background and goal: This study explored older adults' perspectives on proactive deprescribing, identified barriers and enablers, and developed a typology of patient attitudes to inform patient-centered deprescribing interventions.

Study approach: In this qualitative study, researchers conducted semi structured interviews with 20 patients in Japan aged 65 years or older who were receiving 5 or more oral medications. 

Main results:

Enablers

Negative valuation of medication: patients noted pill burden, possible harm and past success in stopping drugs.

Proactive decision making preference: a few patients wanted an active role and even started deprescribing talks.

Openness based on trust in the prescriber: many said they would cut back if a trusted clinician suggested it.

Barriers

Positive perspective on medication: satisfaction with current drugs or high expectations kept regimens unchanged.

Passive involvement and low perceived capability: patients deferred to doctors and felt unable to ask about deprescribing.

Caution driven by fear of change or comfort with the status quo: worry about symptom return discouraged stopping pills.

The researchers also developed a new typology with five types of patients: indifferent, satisfied and risk-averse, compliant, fearful but passive, and proactive.

Why it matters: The findings from this study show that patients vary in their readiness to cut back on medications and underscore the importance of tailoring deprescribing discussions to each patient.

A novel bird flu genotype is driving a surge in outbreaks across wild birds, poultry, and even a human in British Columbia, raising urgent questions about how this virus is evolving and what it means for future pandemic preparedness.

Study: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) in Wild Birds and a Human, British Columbia, Canada, 2024. Image credit: Amy Lutz/Shutterstok.com



Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is an emerging global pathogen that primarily affects birds but can occasionally spill over into humans. The most common strain found in poultry is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically the H5N1 subtype.

In the fall of 2021, a B strain of the HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b was transmitted to wild and domestic birds in Canada. Birds in eastern Canada brought it via the East Atlantic Flyway. The virus subsequently spread across North America, with infected fowl detected in British Columbia in April 2022.

This led to three waves of avian influenza, commonly referred to as bird flu. Various viruses were isolated from different hosts, most of which arose from gene reassortment within the 2.3.4.4b clade.

Another viral event via the Pacific Flyway occurred in February 2022, causing the fourth wave. The dominant genotype this time was A3. With each successive wave, new genotypes were identified, and the dominant genotypes shifted.

The fourth wave was primarily associated with a novel D.1.1,3, which descended from the clade introduced in February 2022.

Both genotypes now infect numerous wild birds in the province. The virus has spilled over into domestic fowl multiple times. With each wave, infection rates among wild birds and poultry continued to increase. As noted in the dispatch published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, these waves were also characterized by the emergence of new genotypes and ongoing shifts in viral dominance.

The dominant D1.1 genotype was the focus of the current investigation into its ecology and origins. Data were collected as part of the British Columbia Wildlife Avian Influenza Surveillance Program. Researchers collected oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from dead wild birds. A conserved gene common to all H5N1 genotypes was analyzed, along with whole-genome sequencing.

Approximately 69% of the new cases were from the Fraser Valley in British Columbia. Cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii) accounted for 35% of the cases, while Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and snow geese (Anser caerulenscens) comprised about 17% each.

Fewer than three cases were identified in other wild birds, such as American pigeons, bald eagles, barred owls, great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, and peregrine falcons.

Conditions in the Fraser Valley provide an optimal habitat for migrating waterfowl to spend the winter and support large-scale poultry farming. This may explain the higher rate of HPAI infection compared to the rest of Canada.

From October 3 to November 8, 2024, 57 wild bird samples containing 2.3.4.4b viruses were collected; six were of genotype A3, and the remaining 51 were of genotype D1.1.  The A3 isolates were phylogenetically closer to the 2024 A3 virus isolates from Japan than the 2023 A3 isolates from British Columbia. This suggests a recent introduction of HPAI from East Asia.

After November 8, 2024, an adolescent from Fraser Valley was diagnosed with D1.1 bird flu.

Between October 21 and November 30, 2024, 60 HPAI infections in poultry were reported, with 59 cases attributed to the D1.1 strain. This genotype has also been isolated from some parts of the United States south of British Columbia.

Phylogenetically, the D1.1 strain is most closely related to strains from wild birds. It comprises four segments, each derived from both Eurasian and North American versions. The neuraminidase [NA] segment was identified for the first time in this clade in British Columbia.

Interestingly, the 2024 D1.1 viruses share a recent common ancestor with the 2023 A3 viruses. However, they have fewer substitution mutations than expected over this period. This observation may indicate that the D1.1 genotype, or its ancestors, persisted in an environmental reservoir, such as frozen wetlands, over the summer of 2024 before being reintroduced into migratory birds in the fall. Alternatively, the virus may be particularly well adapted to certain wild bird populations, resulting in minimal evolutionary pressure and low genetic divergence.

Several infected poultry exhibited a D1.1-specific Am4N1 segment containing a mutation associated with antiviral resistance, NA-H275Y. These samples all came from a single outbreak. The mutation was not detected in wild birds. The possible functional impact of the Am4N1 neuraminidase segment on host-virus interactions is a subject for further investigation, as the study notes that certain NA lineages might increase viral shedding in wild birds. Given the rapid rise in poultry outbreaks caused by HPAI, increased environmental detections of the virus (such as from wetland sediment) in fall 2024 compared to fall 2023 may indicate that a larger number of birds were infected with D1.1, that D1.1 leads to greater viral shedding, or both.

Although cattle in the western United States have been infected with the B3.13 genotype, wild birds along the Pacific Flyway have not yet shown any signs of infection with the B genotype until fall 2024.

D1.1 appears to be an emerging genotype resulting from the reassortment of genes present in both Eurasian and North American lineages of the bird flu virus. It has been detected in wild birds, poultry, and one human to date.

The close genetic relationship of D1.1 strains isolated from humans and wild birds highlights the need for further research into the changes in the variant's host range and infectious capability. The study also highlights that the reduced genetic divergence observed in D1.1, compared with similar viruses detected a year earlier, has implications for how molecular clock models are applied to track the evolution of HPAI viruses. This finding underscores the importance of ongoing genomic surveillance, including environmental monitoring, in enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms and risks associated with emerging avian influenza genotypes.​​​​​​​

The human genome is broadly classified into the genome residing in the cell nucleus (nuclear DNA) and the genome residing in the mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA: mtDNA). Mitochondria are cell organelles that produce energy essential for life activities through oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondrial respiration), and mtDNA encodes a set of genes required for mitochondrial respiration. Previous research has led to the widely accepted hypothesis that the accumulation of multiple mutations in mtDNA with aging induces a decline in mitochondrial respiratory function, resulting in the ""mitochondrial theory of aging."" Nevertheless, whether the decrease in mitochondrial respiratory function is actually due to these accumulated mutations has not been definitively established.

In this study, researchers demonstrated that mitochondrial respiratory function is not impaired even when wild-type mice accumulated mtDNA mutations to the same extent as in premature aging model mice.

These results suggest that the decline in mitochondrial respiratory function is not directly caused by mtDNA mutations alone. Furthermore, the results call for a reinvestigation of the ""mitochondrial theory of aging."" The research team will continue to explore how various mutations accumulated in mtDNA contribute to symptoms of premature aging, aiming to expand our understanding of the relationship between aging and mitochondrial dysfunction.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Enhancing early breast cancer diagnosis through modern imaging technologies","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250528/Enhancing-early-breast-cancer-diagnosis-through-modern-imaging-technologies.aspx","Wed, 28 May 2025 16:21:00 GMT","

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, underscoring the critical need for early detection to improve survival rates and reduce treatment invasiveness. This review synthesizes advancements in imaging technologies that enhance early diagnosis, focusing on their clinical applications, limitations, and future potential.

Breast cancer accounts for 25% of cancer cases in women, with survival rates significantly higher in developed nations due to advanced screening programs. Traditional methods like clinical exams and mammography have been cornerstone tools, yet emerging technologies now complement these approaches, particularly for high-risk populations and dense breast tissue.

Mammography remains the gold standard for screening, detecting 75% of cancers before palpability. Transitioning from analog to digital systems has improved sensitivity, reduced radiation doses by 30–50%, and enabled advanced processing techniques. Key advancements include:

Tomosynthesis (3D mammography): Reduces tissue overlap artifacts, increasing cancer detection by 30–40% and lowering recall rates. Synthesized 2D images minimize radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM): Combines iodine contrast with mammography to highlight tumor vascularization, offering MRI-like accuracy for invasive lobular carcinomas and occult lesions.

BI-RADS classification: Standardizes reporting and risk stratification, though variability in categories like BI-RADS 3 and 4 necessitates supplementary imaging or biopsy.

Breast ultrasound excels in differentiating solid masses from cysts and is indispensable for dense breasts. Innovations include:

Automated 3D ultrasound: Enhances reproducibility and detects mammographically occult cancers.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS): Uses microbubbles to assess vascular patterns, aiding in lesion characterization and reducing unnecessary biopsies.

MRI boasts 94% sensitivity, particularly for high-risk patients (e.g., BRCA carriers) and dense breasts. It excels in preoperative staging, monitoring neoadjuvant therapy response, and evaluating implants. Limitations include high cost, gadolinium use, and false positives. Recent 3-Tesla systems improve spatial resolution, while abbreviated protocols reduce scan time without compromising accuracy.

Thermography: Measures heat patterns via infrared or liquid crystal plates. Dynamic Angiothermography (DATG) identifies angiogenesis-linked thermal changes but lacks size assessment and requires validation.

Molecular breast imaging (MBI): Utilizes radioactive tracers for dense breasts, showing promise in detecting small tumors, though limited by availability and cost.

PET/CT: Primarily used for metastatic staging, with limited resolution for early detection.

Screening protocols vary by risk profile:

Average risk: Biennial mammography starting at 40–50 years.

High risk: Annual MRI + mammography from age 30, particularly for BRCA carriers.

Dense breasts: Supplemental ultrasound or tomosynthesis.

A comparison matrix (Table 4) highlights strengths and weaknesses:

Mammography: High screening utility but limited sensitivity in dense tissue.

MRI: Superior sensitivity but high cost and false positives.

Ultrasound: Radiation-free but operator-dependent.

Current gaps include accessibility, radiation risks, and overdiagnosis. Promising advancements include:

AI integration: Enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces radiologist workload.

Noninvasive biomarkers: Liquid biopsies combined with imaging for precision screening.

Hybrid techniques: PET-MRI and optoacoustic imaging for comprehensive assessment.

Early detection through advanced imaging significantly improves breast cancer outcomes. While mammography remains foundational, integrating ultrasound, MRI, and emerging technologies tailors screening to individual risk. Future innovations must prioritize affordability, reduced radiation, and personalized protocols to bridge global disparities in breast cancer care. Regular screenings and multidisciplinary collaboration remain pivotal in combating this disease.

Background and goal: While remote or electronic visits (eVisits) can increase access to health care for certain groups of patients, their use can increase staff workload and patient demand. Artificial intelligence (AI) may mitigate these outcomes. This study explored the views of staff and patients in primary care to inform the development of artificial intelligence (AI) features for eVisits.

Study approach: Researchers conducted interviews and focus groups with 16 primary care staff and 37 patients from 14 primary care practices in northwest England and London. Researchers asked interviewees about their views on the potential uses of AI during eVisits, risks, benefits, and challenges to its adoption into clinical practice. Transcripts were thematically analyzed to identify key themes.

Main results:

Initial misconceptions and reservations: both groups were unsure what AI could or could not do. Patients worried that AI might diagnose or prescribe without input from their physician, and staff questioned safety.

Perceived benefits included faster responses for patients and lighter workload for staff if AI handled routine tasks. Perceived risks included depersonalized care, data‑privacy fears, and the possibility that patients would have to enter symptoms perfectly for AI triage to work safely.

Seven specific opportunities for AI during eVisits were identified and generally welcomed if they complemented (not replaced) clinician judgment: 

Workflow routing – AI could direct each request to the appropriate team member quickly.

Directing – AI could reroute emergencies to emergency services and send non-urgent issues to pharmacies.

Prioritization – Urgent requests could be flagged so clinicians see them first.

Follow-up questions – AI could automatically request photos, questionnaires, or clarification after a submission.

Writing assistance – AI could suggest editable response templates for common concerns like mental health.

Self-help information – Trusted educational links could be sent to patients without clinician effort.

Face-to-face booking – AI could automatically schedule in-person visits when a physical exam is needed.

Why it matters: The results of this study may serve as guidance for developing and testing AI tools in primary care settings.

Background and goal: This study examined authorship inequities for research that was conducted in low- and middle-income countries and published in family medicine journals based in high-income countries.

Study approach: Researchers analyzed journals listed on the World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) Global family doctor website that focused on low-income countries, lower-middle-income countries, and upper-middle-income countries. They selected journals with editorial offices in high-income-countries. Inclusion criteria included research conducted in low or middle income countries, available in English language, with human study participants. They summarized the proportions of first and senior authors by country income level and other publication characteristics.

Main results: 431 of 1,030 articles met criteria for research conducted in low- or middle-income countries.

Over time, there was an increase in publication of research articles from low- and middle-income countries in the family medicine journals, with the majority of the studies conducted in upper-middle-income countries (55.9%).

The proportion of senior authors from high-income countries was highest in articles with research conducted in low-income countries (50%) compared with those reporting research done in lower-middle-income countries (37%) and upper-middle-income countries (21%). 

There was a trend toward higher average citation rate for articles having high-income countries first and senior authors compared with articles having lower-middle-income countries first and senior authors. 

Why it matters: Quantifying authorship inequities highlights systemic barriers to research leadership in low- and middle-income settings.

The aging of the innermost cell layer of blood vessels leads to cardiovascular diseases. Researchers at UZH have now shown for the first time that intestinal bacteria and their metabolites contribute directly to vascular aging. As people age, the bacterial composition in their gut changes, resulting in fewer ""rejuvenating"" and more harmful substances in the body.

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death worldwide. Even if known traditional risk factors such as diabetes or high blood pressure are treated, the disease worsens in half of all cases, especially in older patients. Researchers at UZH have now shown for the first time that intestinal bacteria and their metabolites can accelerate the ageing of blood vessels and trigger cardiovascular disease.

The human body consists of around 30 to 100 trillion bacteria that reside in our organs. Ninety percent of these bacteria live in the intestine, processing the food we eat into metabolic products, which in turn affect our bodies. ""Half of these substances have not yet been recognized,"" says Soheil Saeedi. His research group at the Center for Translational and Experimental Cardiology is investigating how the microbiota composition changes with age and whether this affects the cardiovascular system.

Using data from more than 7,000 healthy individuals aged between 18 and 95 as well as a mouse model of chronological aging, the researchers found that the breakdown product of the amino acid phenylalanine - phenylacetic acid - accumulates with age. In several series of experiments, Saeedi's team was able to prove that phenylacetic acid leads to senescence of endothelial cells, in which the cells that line the inside of blood vessels do not proliferate, secrete inflammatory molecules, and exhibit aging phenotype. As a result, the vessels stiffen up and their function is impaired.

By conducting a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the microbiome of mice and humans, the researchers were able to identify the bacterium Clostridium sp.ASF356, which can process phenylalanine into phenylacetic acid. When the researchers colonized young mice with this bacterium, they subsequently showed increased phenylacetic acid levels and signs of vascular aging. However, when the bacteria were eliminated with antibiotics, the concentration of phenylacetic acid in the body decreased. ""We were thus able to show that the intestinal bacteria are responsible for the increased levels,"" explains Saeedi.

However, the microbiome in the gut also produces substances that are beneficial to vascular health. Short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, which are produced by fermentation of dietary fibers and polysaccharides in the intestine, act as natural rejuvenating agents. The research group used in-vitro experiments to show that adding sodium acetate can restore the function of aged vascular endothelial cells. When analyzing intestinal bacteria, they found that the number of bacteria that produce such rejuvenating agents decreases with age.

""The aging process of the cardiovascular system can therefore be regulated via the microbiome,"" says Saeedi. The pharmacologist and his team are now investigating which diet has a positive influence on the complex interaction between bacteria and humans. Dietary fibers and foods with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties boost the body's own ""fountain of youth"". In contrast, intake of food and drinks that are rich in phenylalanine, e.g. red meat, dairy products and certain artificial sweeteners, should be limited to slow down vascular aging. The researchers are also working on ways to reduce phenylacetic acid in the body through medication. Initial attempts to curb the formation of phenylacetic acid with the help of genetically modified bacteria have been promising.

As researchers uncover the complexities behind cow's milk allergy in breastfed infants, new evidence suggests that strict maternal dairy avoidance may not always be necessary, paving the way for more personalized and evidence-based management.

 Study: Cow's Milk Allergy in Breastfed Infants: What We Need to Know About Mechanisms, Management, and Maternal Role. Image Credit: Pixel-Shot / Shutterstock.com

Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is one of the most common food allergies to develop during infancy. A recent review published in the journal Nutrients examines the immunological mechanisms underlying this allergy in breastfed infants, the role of gut dysbiosis, and the effectiveness of an elimination diet approach in its treatment.

CMA occurs in 2.2% of babies during the first year of life, whereas 0.5% of exclusively breastfed babies will be diagnosed with CMA. Certain factors that may impact the risk of developing CMA include age, duration of breastfeeding, and geographic location, with most children acquiring tolerance to this allergy by the age of five.

Cow's milk contains between 30 and 35 grams of protein per liter, 80% of which is casein and 20% whey proteins, including β-lactoglobulin (β-LG). After consuming milk, caseins and whey proteins are quickly broken down by the stomach, whereas β-LG is relatively resistant to digestion until it reaches the duodenum of the small intestine.

Although β-LG is abundant in cow, goat, and sheep milk, it does not naturally occur in human breast milk. However, after consuming dairy, β-LG can be detected in human breast milk at concentrations ranging from 0 to 800 µg/L. These variations are attributed to differences in maternal physiological absorption of food proteins, as well as the time between dairy intake and β-LG measurement, with peak β-LG levels detected between four and six hours after consumption.

Several studies have reported that high β-LG levels in breast milk are due to prolonged dairy consumption. Comparatively, other studies have reported that peak allergen levels after maternal ingestion of cow's milk occur between four and six hours.

Nevertheless, β-LG levels in breast milk may correlate with β-LG serum levels in infants, thus confirming that β-LG and other food proteins can enter infant circulation after breastfeeding. Existing evidence suggests that the presence of β-LG and other cow's milk allergens in breast milk does not correlate with an increased risk of CMA in infants, which raises questions about the potential utility of dietary restrictions for breastfeeding mothers.

Symptoms may persist in exclusively breastfed infants with CMA, even when the mother is on a diet free of cow's milk proteins.”

CMA can be classified as an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reaction, non-IgE-mediated CMA, or a mixed form involving both IgE and other cell-mediated responses.

IgE CMA

Approximately 60% of patients with CMA have IgE-mediated CMA, characterized by a type I hypersensitivity reaction that occurs immediately or within two hours after consuming milk. IgE-mediated CMA reactions may include skin rashes, angioedema, runny nose, coughing or wheezing, vomiting and stomach pain, diarrhea, and rarely, anaphylaxis. Skin manifestations occur in all cases.

IgE-mediated CMA rarely affects infants who are exclusively breastfed. However, allergic reactions have been reported in infants who have consumed human milk containing cow's milk proteins.

Forms of non-IgE CMA

Non-IgE CMA typically presents with nonspecific symptoms, most of which affect the gastrointestinal tract, including vomiting, diarrhea, and intestinal inflammation.

Food-protein-induced proctocolitis (FPIP), also known as allergic colitis, is triggered by immune-mediated reactions following exposure to one or more allergens. During FPIP, inflammatory changes in the distal colon and rectum can lead to bloody stools, which may or may not be accompanied by mucus or diarrhea. These symptoms typically present during the first few months of life and usually resolve by about one year of age.

Up to 68% of breastfed infants are diagnosed with FPIP, with cow's milk proteins responsible for most of these cases, followed by soy, egg, and wheat. About 18% of breastfed infants will be diagnosed with FPIP, with this diagnosis based on the efficacy of a maternal elimination diet.

Several cases of food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE) have also been reported in breastfed infants following exposure to cow's milk or egg protein in breast milk. FPE can lead to chronic diarrhea, which subsequently causes hypoalbuminemia, swelling of the extremities, weight loss, failure to thrive, abdominal bloating, and recurrent vomiting.

Few studies have considered whether infants were breastfed among those diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and eosinophilic colitis due to CMA, thus limiting the ability to conclude the role of breast milk in affected children. Likewise, Heiner syndrome and other non-IgE-mediated reactions to cow's milk have not been thoroughly studied in breastfed infants.

Accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plans are vital to prevent overdiagnosis and ensure proper growth while maintaining the practice of breastfeeding.”

Future studies are needed to standardize diagnostic tools, define CMA symptoms, and identify objective measures of improvement with an elimination diet. Additional research is also required to elucidate the role of elimination diets, the mechanisms involved in allergen transfer through breast milk, and the involvement of the gut microbiota in CMA.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Combination of trametinib and rapamycin extends lifespan in mice","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250528/Combination-of-trametinib-and-rapamycin-extends-lifespan-in-mice.aspx","Wed, 28 May 2025 14:55:00 GMT","

The researchers were able to show that Trametinib alone extends the lifespan of mice by 5-10%, while Rapamycin alone increases lifespan by 15-20%. Together, the drugs have a combinatorial effect that extends the life of the mice by around 30%.

The combination therapy also had positive effects on the health of the mice in old age. Less chronic inflammation was observed in the tissue and brain of the treated mice compared to untreated mice, and the onset and development of cancer was delayed.

Rapamycin and Trametinib are drugs used in cancer therapy that act on different points in the Ras/Insulin/TOR network, which plays a central role in ageing. Rapamycin is a potent geroprotector known to prolong the lifespan of animals. Geroprotectors are drugs that slow down the ageing process and extend lifespan. Trametinib acts on the Ras/MEK/ERK signalling pathway. It was not previously known whether Trametinib could extend the lifespan of mice, although previous studies in flies indicated that it might.

Although Rapamycin and Trametinib act on the same network, the combination achieves novel effects that are probably not solely due to an increase in dose. An analysis of gene expression in various tissues shows that the combination of the drugs influences the activity of the genes differently than is achieved by administering the drugs individually. There are specific changes in gene activity that are only caused by the combination of the two drugs.

The researchers plan to determine the optimal dose and route of administration of Trametinib to maximise the health and life-prolonging effects while minimising unwanted side effects. As Trametinib is already approved for human use, it is possible to test it in clinical trials.

""Trametinib, especially in combination with Rapamycin, is a good candidate to be tested in clinical trials as a geroprotector. We hope that our results will be taken up by others and tested in humans. Our focus is on optimising the use of Trametinib in animal models,"" explains Sebastian Grönke.

Co-senior author Professor Dame Linda Partridge (UCL Institute of Healthy Ageing and Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing) said: ""While we do not expect a similar extension to human lifespans as we found in mice, we hope that the drugs we're investigating could help people to stay healthy and disease-free for longer late in life. Further research in humans in years to come will help us to elucidate how these drugs may be useful to people, and who might be able to benefit.""

The research for this study was conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing with funding from the European Research Council and co-funded by the CECAD Cluster of Excellence for Ageing Research at the University of Cologne.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, global interest in antiviral therapies has increased significantly. Recently, with the growing attention to peptide-based drugs such as Wegovy, demand for effective peptide therapeutics derived from natural substances is rapidly rising. In particular, peptide metabolites-which are generated when natural proteins break down in the body-are emerging as promising candidates for multifunctional drug development.

A research team from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST, President Oh Sang-Rok), led by Dr. Hyung-Seop Han from the Biomaterials Research Center, Dr. Dae-Geun Song from the Center for Natural Product Systems Biology, and Dr. Oh-Seung Kwon from the Doping Control Center, announced that they have developed a therapeutic substance with both antiviral and tissue regenerative properties, based on a peptide derived from natural sources.

The team revealed that a peptide metabolite (Ac-Tβ1-17), produced from the breakdown of a natural protein (thymosin β4) present in the human body, functions as a bioactive molecule capable of both antiviral activity and tissue regeneration. The peptide metabolite (Ac-Tβ1-17) discovered by the team inhibited the activity of Mpro, a key protease of the COVID-19 virus, by over 85%, demonstrating strong antiviral effects. In experiments using human vascular cells, it also activated key processes essential for recovery, including cell growth, wound healing, blood vessel formation, and removal of reactive oxygen species.

To apply the excellent biological functions of Ac-Tβ1-17 in actual therapy, the research team fabricated a supporting scaffold using the peptide. Scaffolds serve as structural platforms for cell growth or tissue repair and play an important role in regenerative medicine. This peptide scaffold was found to be highly effective in promoting tissue recovery, supporting strong cell adhesion, growth, and blood vessel formation.

This study confirms that a single peptide can perform both antiviral and regenerative functions, and is expected to overcome limitations of existing protein-based therapies. Moreover, by focusing on the potential of metabolites generated from protein degradation in the body, the study offers a valuable technological foundation for developing both new drugs and medical biomaterials. The research team plans to continue research on the practical application of Ac-Tβ1-17 in customized therapeutics and regenerative biomaterials.

This study demonstrates that protein metabolites can be used not only as new drugs but also as biomaterials for tissue regeneration, confirming their potential for expansion into various biomedical applications.""

Dr. Hyung-Seop Han of KIST

Dr. Song said, ""We will continue research using natural bioactive materials to pursue practical applications in antivirals, functional biomaterials, and beyond."" Dr. Kwon added, ""The metabolite of thymosin β4 has been identified as a drug candidate through collaborative research, and we expect it to be widely applicable in this field moving forward.""

With MatchWornShirt, fans can buy a signed, game-worn USWNT or USMNT jersey in a real-time auction.

Ever wanted to own a jersey worn by Naomi Girma or Lynn Biyendolo?

Now you can—US Soccer recently announced a new partnership with MatchWornShirt, an online auction marketplace for sports memorabilia. Through MatchWornShirt, fans can buy signed, game-worn jerseys directly from USWNT and USMNT games, bringing home a piece of authentic team history.

MatchWornShirt's new partnership is with the U.S. Soccer Federation (U.S. Soccer), the United States National Soccer Team Players Association (USNSTPA), and the United States Women's National Team Players Association (USWNTPA). 

You can now own a piece of U.S. Soccer history   From the @USMNT stars one year out from the world's biggest tournament, to the dominant @USWNT players setting the gold standard for the women's game.Follow both teams, never miss an auction!  https://t.co/oTy51OLs0h pic.twitter.com/1tytTQBLn9

The partnership brings the MatchWornShirt business model to the US for the first time.

The company is already big outside of the US, and has current partnerships with over 300  top clubs and national teams, including Chelsea FC, Atlético de Madrid, and Club América, and the national teams of Croatia, Germany, and the Netherlands.

Fans will be able to bid on match jerseys in real time auctions as games take place, and jerseys come with digital certifications of authenticity. The first auction will take place during the USWNT's game against China on May 31st, and more will continue over the summer.

Jerseys are authentic—fans will be able to see the real wear and tear that comes from the game, like dirt or grass stains.

MatchWornShirt started when cofounder and CEO Tijmen Zonderwijk wanted to buy an Ajax shirt, but couldn't find a good place to buy an authentic, game-worn jersey. He started the company as a way to fill that gap, growing from a small auction in the Netherlands to a global brand.

“The energy around sports memorabilia in the U.S. has never been higher—and soccer in America is entering a golden era,” said Lilian Bours, Chief Marketing Officer of MatchWornShirt. “We're thrilled to give American soccer fans unprecedented access to their National Teams, deepening the emotional connection to their favorite players and celebrating the game's most iconic moments. We turn match days into memories–in wearable and collectible form.”

“There's something incredibly special about fans being able to own a piece of the player, their grit, their pride, the moment itself,” said Becca Roux, Executive Director of the U.S. Women's National Team Players Association. “This kind of access deepens the connection between players and fans and is helping drive an entire industry forward. We're proud to partner with MatchWornShirt to make that connection real.”

For the first time, USWNT fans will be able to own their own small part of the team's history. Now, the red, white, and blue jerseys that players wear while scoring goals and breaking records could be hanging in your closet just days later.

“The energy around sports memorabilia in the U.S. has never been higher – and soccer in America is entering a golden era,” said Lilian Bours, chief marketing officer of MatchWornShirt. “We're thrilled to give American soccer fans unprecedented access to their National Teams, deepening the emotional connection to their favorite players and celebrating the game's most iconic moments. We turn matchdays into memories – in wearable and collectible form.”

The first jersey auction with U.S. Soccer goes live on May 31, featuring match-worn, signed jerseys from the USWNT's back-to-back games against Brazil played last month. Starring this Saturday, a new auction will go live from kickoff, when the USWNT plays China. 

This summer, MatchWornShirt will roll out additional auctions featuring USMNT players throughout the Gold Cup. 

As a result, collectors will have the chance of bidding on the match-worn jerseys (that will later be autographed) of such U.S. stars as Matt Turner, Tyler Adams, Trinity Rodman and Catarina Macario.   

U.S. Soccer's agreement with the online marketplace comes a year before the United States co-hosts, along with Mexico and Canada, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

MatchWornShirt currently has agreements with 300 teams in 35 countries, including Real Madrid, Manchester City and Liverpool. It allows fans to bid in real time as the action unfolds on the field. 

“What started as one small auction in the Netherlands has now grown into a global community, and we are excited to bring that same trusted experience to fans in the U.S., starting with their beloved men's and women's national teams,” said Tijmen Zonderwijk, the company's CEO and co-founder of MatchWornShirt. 

The players' association for both the men's and women's U.S. teams also cheered on the chance for fans to own game-worn jerseys. 

“There's something incredibly special about fans being able to own a piece of the player, their grit, their pride, the moment itself,” said Becca Roux, executive director of the USWNT's Players Association. “This kind of access deepens the connection between players and fans and is helping drive an entire industry forward.”

Mark Levinstein, executive director of the U.S. Men's National Team Players Association, said the jerseys up for auction represent “a living fragment of U.S. soccer history.”

“The jerseys carry the energy, emotion and dedication of the players who have spent their lives to earn the opportunity to wear them,” he added, “and tell a story of hard-fought battles, unforgettable moments and the pride of representing an entire nation on the global stage. Fans and collectors can connect directly to the legacy of the USMNT.”

As head coach of the U.S. Women's National Team, Emma Hayes has a plethora of immensely talented players at her disposal, not least the Thompson sisters.

Angel City FC forward Alyssa, 20, and City defender Gisele, 19, are two of U.S. Soccer's brightest young stars, having already made 20 international appearances between them. Both called up for the USWNT's upcoming friendlies against China and Jamaica, Hayes recently gave an insight into what the Thompsons are like behind the scenes, and exactly what it is that makes them so special.

“They made me laugh a fair bit. They're inseparable. You couldn't go into an elevator or a dinner hall or anywhere without them two being side by side,” Hayes told Ion.

“But beyond their determination and their drive to be the very best, I love the way they reflect on what they need, and then they work at trying to put that in place.

“They don't feel that at any point they've made it, and they keep looking for that little extra yard, whatever it is, to keep improving to get there. And, they're very different players, but I think they have the qualities that the team are looking for.

“And I think Alyssa's been easily one of the best players in the NWSL this year. And Gisele, she just never gives up.

“She's always putting herself in strong positions on that right-hand side. But I'm bringing her in as a wide player because I want to see her attacking qualities, particularly against low blocks. So I'm getting a chance to do that this camp.”

Alyssa has enjoyed an excellent start to the NWSL season, scoring five goals and providing a further two assists in nine games for City, who currently sit seventh in the league table on 14 points after 10 games.

As such, she is already well on track for her most prolific goal-scoring season to date, and could well challenge for the golden boot given that she is currently only two goals behind leading scorer Esther Gonzalez with seven in 10 games.

Gisele, too, has played a pivotal role in City's season thus far, appearing in every game under interim head coach Sam Laity, having made just 16 appearances in all competitions last season.

However, Alyssa and Gisele may not end up being the only Thompsons representing the USWNT in a few years' time. Younger sister Zoe, who plays for Tudela FC, was one of 60 players recently called up to the USWNT's Under-14s Talent ID Program.

But while the Thompsons may yet end up with three representatives in the USWNT, for the time being, Alyssa and Gisele's primary focus will be on maximizing their opportunities to continue to impress Hayes, with one eye on reaching the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup roster, starting with Saturday's friendly against China in Minnesota.

Kasey Keller and Herculez Gomez chime in the omission of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah from the USMNT's squad for the Gold Cup. (4:01)

Fulham and United States men's national team defender Antonee Robinson has undergone successful knee surgery, the club confirmed on Wednesday.

The club described the surgery as ""minor"" and said he would now begin rehabilitation with the aim of being ready for the start of the next Premier League season in August.

Robinson has risen to be one of the best-performing Americans in Europe's five major leagues, although he will miss the USMNT's run at the Concacaf Gold Cup.

The defender was left out of Mauricio Pochettino's 27-player roster for a pair of June friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland ahead of the Gold Cup with the knee injury, alongside other mainstays Weston McKennie, Timothy Weah, Giovanni Reyna, Yunus Musah and Christian Pulisic.

Pulisic is taking time off after a grueling season in Europe that saw him play over 3,500 minutes for AC Milan. The USMNT boss defended the omission of his main stars at a news conference last week.

""Many people can say it's really important for us to be all together for the last time before the World Cup,"" he said. ""We decided the best for him [Pulisic], the best of the team, the best for the national team is the decision that we made.

""Sometimes we give too much importance knowing to be together and sometimes the group maybe sometimes doesn't work in this way or build in this way ... I think it is important to create this challenge. I really believe that to build a team is about staying together, to have time to work, yes, but I think we cannot underestimate the player.""

Chicago Fire goalkeeper Chris Brady has been added to the U.S. men's national team roster in place of the injured Patrick Schulte, U.S. Soccer confirmed on Wednesday.

Schulte will be out between two and six weeks with an oblique injury, Columbus Crew head coach Wilfried Nancy confirmed on Tuesday.

It's the first senior national team call-up for Brady, who has made his name as one of the most promising young goalkeepers in MLS.

The 21-year-old has been the Fire's starter since 2023, taking over after Gabriel Slonina transferred to Chelsea. He has been capped by the U.S. at the U-15, U-16, U-17, U-20, and U-23 age levels.

He will join the USMNT's 27-man squad for friendlies against Turkey on June 7 and Switzerland on June 10. Mauricio Pochettino is likely to draw most of his 26-player Gold Cup roster from that group.

The deadline for Pochettino to name his final Gold Cup roster is June 4.

Along with Brady, Pochettino will have Zack Steffen, Matt Freese and Matt Turner in camp at the goalkeeper position.

Pochettino recently said he was open to replacing Turner as the team's starter, following a season in which the 30-year-old made just four appearances while on loan at Crystal Palace.","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

Inter Milan could reportedly include Sebastiano Esposito in their squad for the summer's FIFA Club World Cup.

Per FCInterNews, Empoli have opted against activating a buyout clause in their loan agreement with Inter after suffering relegation from Serie A.

Therefore, Sebastiano Esposito will return to San Siro in the coming days.

With Marko Arnautovic and Joaquin Correa set to leave, Simone Inzaghi may soon find himself strapped for attacking options.

Indeed, Inter can hardly sign a new center-forward in the next two weeks.

As such, the 22-year-old could get an unlikely chance to prove his worth in North America.

Despite Empoli's calamitous Serie A season, Esposito has done well.

Indeed, he netted eight goals and added one assist in 33 league appearances in 2024/25.

Esposito's decent scoring exploits were in vain, as Roberto D'Aversa's side finished 18th in the table.

Relinquishing their top-flight status will have substantial implications for Gli Azzurri's transfer plans this summer.

As things stand, Esposito will be the first casualty, even though Empoli had hoped to sign him permanently.

However, it may give him a chance to launch his senior career at San Siro.

Welcome to our Live Comments section, where new comments will appear automatically

There would be worse ideas than keeping Sebastiano as our 4th choice, loaning out younger brother, and splashing some cash on a new 3rd Striker, be it Bonny, Castro, Zirkzee or another….

I would prefer him to stay as 4th option, bring someone like David to fight with Lautaro and Thuram for starting 11, and spend more money somewhere else

Manchester City's Under-21 manager Ben Wilkinson will join Pep Guardiola's backroom team for the Club World Cup.

Wilkinson, the son of former Leeds boss Howard, guided City's youngsters to the Premier League 2 title – beating Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United in the playoff stage before overpowering Southampton in this month's final.

The 38-year-old is set to link up with City's first team alongside assistant Craig Mudd when they arrive in Florida for a camp ahead of the summer tournament.

Guardiola's staff will be reduced by the time they head for America, with assistant Juanma Lillo leaving the club as well as both Inigo Dominguez and Carlos Vicens.

The coaching shake up coincides with new director of football Hugo Viana's appointment and City's sluggish season.

Mail Sport revealed earlier in the week that there had been some confusion among the backroom staff after the offer of contract renewals had been delayed.

City are thought to be moving forward with new deals this week but Guardiola will need fresh voices ahead of next year.

Having won last year's FA Youth Cup, Wilkinson has impressed since taking the Under 21s from Brian Barry-Murphy, who had become an integral member of staff during Guardiola's training sessions.

City's Under 19s, led by Wilkinson, also reached the UEFA Youth League quarter-finals, losing out to the 2023 winners AZ Alkmaar.

Wilkinson's invitation to form part of Guardiola's staff for the summer points to a host of youngsters making the trip. His role will be similar to that of Barry-Murphy's previously, with an onus on setting up the academy players in the shape of opposition.

Julien Laurens explains why Cristiano Ronaldo could join a club on a short-term deal to play at the FIFA Club World Cup. (2:17)

Al Hilal are looking to sign Napoli striker Victor Osimhen and Manchester City are lining up a move for Lyon attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki. Join us for the latest transfer news, rumors, and gossip from around the globe.

- Sources: Zubimendi set for medical before Arsenal transfer
- Sources: Man United trigger Cunha release clause
- Barça phenom Yamal inks new long-term contract

- Saudi giants Al Hilal are looking to sign Napoli striker Victor Osimhen for around €40m before the start of the Club World Cup on June 15, says Footmercato. Osimhen, 26, is set to leave the Serie A champions after spending the last year on loan at Galatasaray and has been linked with every top club in Europe, including Man United, Chelsea and Juventus. However, the Nigeria international could sign a lucrative three-year contract worth €120m to move to Al Hilal, the club that previously had Neymar on the books before he moved to Santos.

- A move for Lyon attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki is being prepared by Manchester City, reports the Telegraph. City are reportedly the latest side to join the race for the 21-year-old, who is expected to leave the Groupama Stadium this summer. Clubs in Europe are believed to be confident that a release clause in Cherki's contract allows him to be signed for around €30m, with Liverpool and Chelsea also previously linked.

- Napoli are set to reignite their interest in Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, says Calciomercato. It is reported that the Serie A side are now prioritizing adding a winger amid belief that they are close to completing the signing of Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, and there is hope that the Red Devils would accept an offer worth less than the €60m they demanded for the 20-year-old in January. Paris Saint-Germain's Lee Kang-In is also seen as a potential alternative.

- Barcelona are looking to sign midfielder Frenkie de Jong to a new contract extension before June 30, reports Diario Sport. The 28-year-old is reportedly keen to continue his stay with the Blaugrana, who are hopeful of reducing his salary to assist their current financial situation. It is said that De Jong's representatives are holding talks with sporting director Deco, with the club hierarchy optimistic of reaching an agreement over a new deal soon.

- Atletico Madrid are targeting a move to sign Inter Milan captain Lautaro Martinez, according to El Chiringuito. Martinez, 27, had 12 goals from 31 matches in Serie A and helped Inter reach the Champions League final against PSG. Atletico are aware they need to find a partner for Julian Alvarez and have the Argentina international at the top of their shortlist.

ESPN's Julien Laurens on what the future holds for Lyon midfielder Rayan Cherki.

Cherki will leave Lyon in the summer, but good luck trying to guess which team he will join. Sources have told ESPN that he is wanted by many top clubs -- especially in England, but also in Germany. He had a release clause of €25 million in January, but that is not valid anymore. Now, Lyon will want closer to €40m, even though he only has one year left on his contract.

City are the latest club to join the queue to recruit the Lyon prodigy, who has just completed his best-ever season (12 goals and 20 assists in 44 games in all competitions) at 21 years old. He showed a lot of consistency and maturity this season, and is clearly ready to make the step up to a bigger club and better league.

City are yet to contact Lyon and it's unclear where they would play him (as a No. 10 or out wide); Chelsea have long been admirers and contacted his entourage last summer but never made an offer;  Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes likes his profile but is busy trying to finalize a deal to sign Florian Wirtz; while Manchester United are keen and he would be perfect as an No. 10 in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation ... but Cherki wants to play Champions League football.

Meanwhile, Dortmund and Fulham tried to do a deal for him last summer, but the player turned them both down. Dortmund will come back for him, but Bayer Leverkusen have also contacted the Cherki camp and see him as a perfect replacement if Wirtz leaves for Liverpool. So he certainly has lots of options.

The ""ESPN FC"" crew discusses why Lamine Yamal has the right mentality to not let his new salary go to his head and continue starring for Barcelona.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Man City confirm three Pep Guardiola assistants will leave before Club World Cup","https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-confirm-three-pep-31739361","Wed, 28 May 2025 11:33:00 GMT","

Manchester City have confirmed the departure of three of Pep Guardiola's assistants ahead of a busy summer. Carlos Vicens, Juanma Lillo and Inigo Dominguez are all leaving before the Club World Cup, signalling a major refresh of the backroom staff.

Vicens, who has been with the club since 2017 and was promoted from the academy to the first team in 2021, is leaving to become the new head coach of Braga. The Portuguese club, who came fourth in their league this season, have agreed terms with Vicens as they ambitiously look to challenge the top sides in their league.

Lillo, a long-time mentor of Guardiola who coached the manager in Mexico towards the end of his playing days, first joined the coaching staff in 2020 and after leaving for a year returned in 2023. He brought Dominguez with him when he re-joined, but has expressed a wish to return to Spain and Dominguez will also depart.

That leaves Guardiola with just fitness coach Lorenzo Buenaventura and goalkeeping coach Xabi Mancisidor as assistants who sit with him in the dugout.

City's head of player support Manel Estiarte and performance analyst Carles Planchart are long-serving help who have been with the manager form his Barcelona days.

City have announced that the new coaching structure will be confirmed in due course, and the hope will be that the new arrivals can be in position as quickly as possible.

The Blues head off for the United States for the Club World Cup in the middle of June, a competition they are aiming to go far in before the start of next season's Premier League.

As revealed by the Manchester Evening News, Guardiola will get extra assistance for the tournament from City's Under-21 coach Ben Wilkinson and his No.2 Craig Mudd.

They will be there to support the younger players who are asked to help the first team prepare for matches and recover for them, although it remains to be seen how many other coaches there will be.

Cristiano Ronaldo's chapter at Al-Nassr could be over if you are to believe his social media post, but the Portuguese legend doesn't seem to be headed for retirement at 40. At the end of the Saudi Pro League season, Ronaldo posted, ""This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Thanks to all."" He was able to win the 2023 Arab Club Champions Cup, defeating Al-Hilal for his only club trophy with Al-Nassr, but he may not have to wait long for a chance at a trophy at whichever club he ends up at next.

A stay in the Saudi Pro League could happen with Al-Hilal reportedly being interested in Ronaldo's services, but it leads to the bigger question of whether Ronaldo could play in the upcoming Club World Cup. Slated to kick off June 14 with Al Ahly facing Inter Miami, it could certainly happen. Not only are there reasons for clubs to pursue Ronaldo, someone who has been there and done that in a range of tournaments, but there's also the fact that this could provide one last stand of Ronaldo facing his greatest rival, Lionel Messi, in the United States. There's no telling how many opportunities there will be for something like this to happen, so if there's a chance to line it up during the summer, there's no reason not to.

Historically, the summer transfer window doesn't open until the beginning of July, but thanks to the presence of the Club World Cup and some players not being under contract after the month of June, there has been a mini window created from June 1-10, allowing teams competing in the CWC to bolster their ranks ahead of the tournament. Every team can utilize that window, but it creates a chance for those teams to get their business done early and use the tournament as part of their preseason training.

Technically, a player could move to a team during this mini window and then depart after the Club World Cup for another side as a player can be registered for three clubs over the course of a season but can only play for two. So, Ronaldo could sign with a team and then move after the tournament if he would prefer to do so, even if that move is actually continuing his stay with Al Nassr.

So many clubs taking part in the Club World Cup would love to have Ronaldo on their side, but a few of the bigger contenders could be Al-Hilal and Al Ahly of Egypt. If it's a short term agreement, some of the bigger European sides may not be looking to make a deal like that due to the impact that it could have on team cohesion but other clubs around the world could view Ronaldo as a mercenary to help them have a chance to compete with top clubs for winning this competition. There's also the personal aspect as a move to Al-Hilal would set up Ronaldo facing his former club Real Madrid. 

Also, being a team owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, there would be no issues ensuring Ronaldo is compensated in a similar way to what he is now. When it comes to Al-Ahly, they've expressed interest in wanting to beef up their squad ahead of the tournament as well, and while they may not have the financial muscle of the Saudi Arabian sides, the increased financial compensation from the tournament allows clubs to compete in areas where historically they wouldn't be able to. It also could set up a mouth-watering intro to the tournament where Ronaldo and Messi face off one last time, an event that would be priceless and unimaginable a year ago.

The reworked Club World Cup kicks off on June 14, less than two full weeks after the end of this weekend's Champions League final.

For some clubs, the tournament in the United States extends a campaign that began with their pre-season last July. For others, it's a chance to sort out their priorities for 2025-26. Most of the 32 competing sides are expected to name strong squads, given the prize money and brand exposure on offer in a rapidly growing football market.

Players and managers have raised concerns, however, about the volume of games and reduced rest time between matches and seasons.

One of FIFA's measures to address this involves an extra transfer period, from June 1-10, for Club World Cup teams to bring in players ahead of the tournament, given that the summer window proper only opens on June 16. Soon-to-be free agents on contracts that expire at the end of June could be available to their new employers for minimal fees.

The Athletic has picked out some players who are in that situation and could be targeted by Club World Cup participants.

Ronaldo's future was already a question mark, with his contract at Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr, who are not in the tournament, ending on June 30. It has now come squarely into focus after FIFA president Gianni Infantino said the 40-year-old “might play” at the Club World Cup and that “there are discussions with some clubs” during YouTuber iShowSpeed's stream last week.

Ronaldo's post on social media on Monday, when Al Nassr played the final match of their season, then created more conversation. He posted a photo of himself in an Al Nassr jersey on X with the caption, “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.”

— Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) May 26, 2025



Wherever Ronaldo goes, drama follows. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner's two-and-a-half seasons in capital city Riyadh have brought 93 goals in 105 matches, controversies, tantrums, and less-than-pleasant gestures to crowds but no major domestic or Asian titles.

It is unclear whether Ronaldo will make a move in time to appear in this summer's tournament — could we see a last dance with long-time rival Lionel Messi, whose MLS team Inter Miami are participating in it?

Alexander-Arnold confirmed on May 5 that he will be leaving Liverpool this summer as a free agent, and he is expected to join Real Madrid. But while the process of Madrid hoovering up big names after their contracts expire may have been seamless in previous years — as it has been with their signings of Kylian Mbappe, Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba — the Club World Cup has added a layer of complexity.

Madrid's first-choice right-back Dani Carvajal is still recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury suffered last October. That leaves Lucas Vazquez — whose contract expires at the end of next month (two weeks into the Club World Cup) — as their only current senior option at the position. Madrid could negotiate with Liverpool on a fee that would allow them to sign Alexander-Arnold before the tournament begins.

The 26-year-old England full-back will depart Anfield after nine years with the first team that brought 352 appearances, 23 goals, 86 assists and eight domestic, European and world trophies.

Tah confirmed in April that he will be moving on from Bayer Leverkusen this summer, with the German club making it official in early May.

The Athletic reported over the weekend that Bayern Munich have a deal to sign the 29-year-old on a free transfer once his Leverkusen contract expires next month, and he could yet move earlier to feature for them at the Club World Cup. No agreement for that to happen has been reached yet. Three Bayern centre-backs, Dayot Upamecano, Kim Min-jae and Hiroki Ito, missed the end of the German season with injuries, leaving the team short-staffed in defence.

Tah made 402 appearances over 10 years for Leverkusen, playing a leading role in their unbeaten domestic campaign in 2023-24.

In January, Pogba completed an 18-month ban for an anti-doping rule violation. No move has yet materialised, and he remains a free agent. The 32-year-old last played a competitive match in September 2023, for Juventus against Empoli.

Before his suspension, Pogba was viewed as one of the most skilled midfielders in football. Consistency was an issue, but he made 423 combined appearances for Manchester United and Juventus — neither of whom have really replaced what he offered at his peak — and 91 for France.

His trophy cabinet includes a World Cup, four Serie A titles and the Europa League, and players seldom lose the kind of natural ability Pogba has.

Jorginho is another impending free agent with his next club already lined up. The Athletic reported this month that Brazilian club Flamengo, who will play in this Club World Cup, are in negotiations with Arsenal to find an agreement to let him leave the London side before his contract expires on June 30.

The Brazil-born Italy international, 33, started just nine Premier League matches this season, dropping behind Thomas Partey and Mikel Merino in the holding-midfield pecking order.

Jorginho's ability to dictate the tempo of games and his vast experience, with 423 Premier League, Serie A, Champions League and Europa League appearances and 57 Italy caps, make him look a handy pre-tournament acquisition.

Aurier has been a free agent since leaving Turkey's Galatasaray in July last year. He has kept himself in shape, though, by joining up with a fitness coach who has worked with Karim Benzema, Ryan Gravenberch and Aaron Wan-Bissaka in recent years.

The now 32-year-old defender made only 17 league appearances in 2024 for Nottingham Forest and Galatasaray, and has topped 2,000 minutes of playing time in a top-flight season just once in the past decade (with Tottenham in 2019-20). Aurier, who has also made 93 appearances for the Ivory Coast national team, might be rusty but could still do a job for one of the non-European teams at the Club World Cup.

Lacazette is set to leave Lyon for the second time in his career this summer after 11 years with their first team (2009-17 and 2022-25, either side of five seasons with Arsenal). He scored 201 times in 391 appearances for the Ligue 1 side, winning France's FA Cup equivalent once and their Community Shield twice.

He turns 34 today (Wednesday), so Lacazette's best years are obviously behind him, but 19 goals in 42 all-competitions games over the season just ended prove he can still find the back of the net with reasonable consistency.

Di Maria is another high-profile impending free agent, with his contract at Benfica expiring after a productive two-season second spell at the Lisbon side that brought 32 goals and 25 assists in 88 matches and two winners' medals in the Portuguese cups.

A world champion with Argentina in 2022, Di Maria is approaching the end of his career at age 37, but is more than capable of offering a team some added attacking punch from the bench. The winger has confirmed he is leaving Benfica this summer — but not when. It could be before or after the Club World Cup.

His trophy cabinet also includes the Copa America twice, a Champions League and multiple other trophies with Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Benfica and Argentina. The Club World Cup is one of the few competitions he has not won.

Chukwuemeka's time at Chelsea seems to be ending after three years, following an unsuccessful loan to Borussia Dortmund for the second half of this season. He made just one Bundesliga start, and ended the campaign with 452 minutes of first-team football played across the two clubs.

Dortmund look unlikely to make his move permanent, and he does not appear to be in Chelsea's plans either. A permanent move away seems to make sense for both player and club and getting it done before this tournament would give the talented midfielder, still only 21, a chance to get his career back on track.

Guess who's at number 1..

Bayern Munich is nearing its final tournament of the season, the FIFA Club World Cup. They are set to face off against Auckland City, Boca Juniors, and SL Benfica this summer in the United States. As the tournament comes closer, let's take a look at how Bayern might line up their depth chart between the sticks. 

According to a report captured by @iMiaSanMia, the clubs plans for goalkeepers is basically already finalized. Per the report, Manuel Neuer will be first in line to take up the position (shock). Jonas Urbig, a very talented youth who has proved himself to be a more than good enough backup, will be second behind him. Chances are he may be played for the smaller games. That leaves three goalkeepers - Daniel Peretz, Sven Ulreich, and teenager Leon Klanac. 

The report from Bild says that Daniel Peretz is nearing the finalization of a loan deal, and so he will not be traveling with the rest of the squad to the USA. He will be given this time off to prepare for his move, and focus on pre-season prep. Sven Ulreich will also not be participating, due to private reasons that no one really has any information about. And finally, Leon Klanac, a product of the youth system, will be Bayern's third and last option to go in goal. 

What do you think of the depth chart? Should Neuer be pushed down a level? Let us know in the comments!

Looking for some final thoughts on the Florian Wirtz saga? What about a conversation with one of our BPW staffers who actually spoke to Wirtz? We have all of that, plus some thoughts on if — or maybe when — Bayern Munich should make a move for VfB Stuttgart attacker Nick Woltemade on the Bavarian Podcast Works Show on Patreon, Spotify, or below:

                            Police in the Mexican state of Jalisco are getting 678 new patrol cars, though only a few of them will be Cybertrucks                        

With just over a year until the 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, authorities in the Mexican state of Jalisco are already gearing up for the massive soccer event. They've recently added three specially outfitted Tesla Cybertruck patrol vehicles to their fleet, which will be deployed in high-traffic tourist areas during the tournament.

One of these Cybertrucks was recently taken out onto the local city streets and tailed by a pair of F-Series trucks that police are also using. The local mayor, Pablo Lemus Navarro, is keen to maximize safety during the World Cup, although the expensive purchases do seem to have upset some locals.

Read: Las Vegas Gets First Cybertruck Police Fleet In America

The Tesla truck rocks a matte black wrap complete with all the necessary police livery. Flashing red and blue lights have also been neatly incorporated into the front and rear bumpers, as well as the side skirts. Local police have yet to release any photos of the Cybertruck's cabin, but it's likely also been modified with all the necessary equipment needed to patrol the streets and target criminals.

These Cybertrucks form just a small part of a much larger fleet of new vehicles that the state is introducing.

Governor Navarro has big plans to improve security in the region ahead of the World Cup. “We also need to work a lot on the perception of security; we are going to deliver 678 patrol cars for the State Police, State Highway Police, and State Police, including some ‘Black Mambas,' which are this kind of tanks,” he said.

Mexico isn't alone in adopting the Cybertruck for law enforcement. Earlier this year, Las Vegas announced it would receive 10 of the trucks, thanks to an anonymous donor. Some of these will be put into service with SWAT teams, while others will simply patrol the streets. Who knows? Maybe other cities will soon follow suit.

The 2026 World Cup is set to run from June 11 to July 19 across 16 host cities in the US, Mexico, and Canada, featuring 48 teams. While Jalisco's decision to roll out high-tech, bulletproof Cybertruck patrol vehicles might look impressive on paper, it also raises questions about whether this extravagant spending is really the most effective use of resources for an event of this scale.

Chelsea and Man City are the Premier League clubs competing at the Club World Cup against the likes of Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich with a prize of £97m for the winners; the early window will be open from June 1-10 for clubs to strengthen ahead of the tournament in the USA

Wednesday 28 May 2025 12:31, UK

The transfer window is opening earlier than usual this summer ahead of FIFA's newly expanded Club World Cup - but what can we expect?

Cristiano Ronaldo and Trent Alexander-Arnold could be among those on the move with FIFA keen for its new-look tournament to have a star-studded cast in the United States.

Premier League clubs Chelsea and Manchester City are competing with the likes of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan.

Clubs can sign new players from June 1-10 before the tournament kicks off on June 15.

And this is not limited to the 32 participating teams - which means there could be a big flurry of early transfer activity this summer.

Club World Cup teams can also use an in-tournament registration period after the group stages from June 27-July 3 to add players to their squads.

FIFA have incentivised clubs to make their squads as strong as possible, with a prize of £97m for the winners.

              Papers - latest headlines
            

The tournament format works exactly the same as the FIFA World Cup, only for clubs.


The 32 teams have been divided into eight groups of four teams, with the top two teams in each group qualifying for the knockout stage.


The last-16 stage - the first single knockout round - then moves to the quarter-final, semi-final and then final. There is no third-place play-off between the two losing semi-final teams.


The tournament runs from June 15, with the final taking place on July 13.

Cristiano Ronaldo attracts attention like few others on the planet - so it was no surprise to see FIFA president Gianni Infantino reveal discussions had taken place for him to sign for a Club World Cup team. His great rival, Lionel Messi, will be there with Inter Miami.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner fuelled speculation further by hinting he is leaving Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr in a cryptic post to his 654 million Instagram followers - though it is not yet clear at this stage which club he could join.

Ronaldo would either need to be released early from his £177m-per-year deal, which runs out at the end of June, or move after the group stages on a free transfer in the extra in-tournament registration period.

Reports have linked him with Saudi club Al Hilal, who face Ronaldo's former team Real Madrid in their opening game.

Trent Alexander-Arnold may have to wait to join Real Madrid unless a fee can be agreed with Liverpool to sign the full-back before his contract expires on June 30.

Real Madrid will have Dean Huijsen in Xabi Alonso's squad after agreeing a deal with Bournemouth for the centre-back to join in time for the Club World Cup.

Athletic Club winger Nico Williams - who has been of interest to Arsenal for a year - has been linked with Real Madrid and reportedly has a release clause of around £48m.

Chelsea could also be active in the mini-window with signing a forward one of their aims this summer. Ipswich's Liam Delap is a deal that could be done early due to his £30m release clause - but Manchester United and Newcastle United are also trying to sign him.

Hugo Ekitike, Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko and Jonathan David are their other striker targets, with transfer strategy being discussed in more detail after the UEFA Conference League final against Real Betis. Signing a winger and a centre-back is also a possibility.

Manchester City are in the market for a No 10 this summer to replace Kevin De Bruyne with Morgan Gibbs-White and Dani Olmo among those they like.

De Bruyne will still be contracted to City when the tournament begins but has said he is unlikely to take part and is now closing in on a free transfer to Napoli.

Tijani Reijnders, a central midfielder for AC Milan, is another City admire, while they are also looking to strengthen at full-back. As it stands, City appear in no rush to get deals done ahead of the tournament.

Al Hilal are interested in Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, who raised concerns he could leave after the Europa League final defeat when he admitted the club could cash in on him. Ruben Amorim, his head coach, has said he wants to keep the midfielder.

Given the financial heft of the Saudi Pro League club and speculation about the big transfer fee they could offer United, whose need to sell this summer has been well documented, there is an understandable sense of dread among fans about Fernandes.

United are set to take advantage of the earlier window themselves by sealing a deal for Matheus Cunha from Wolves after activating his £62.5m release clause. Arsenal are also confident of landing Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi.

Both of those deals can be completed ahead of June 1 - but the players will only be registered with the club once the mini-window opens.

Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone is keen to add to his squad before the Club World Cup and are the Spanish club are set to test Tottenham's resolve over defender Cristian Romero by making an approach for the World Cup winner.

It is not clear whether Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will be willing to discuss the sale of Romero after Spurs won the Europa League to qualify for next season's Champions League. The 27-year-old, who has two years left on his deal, has said he would love to play in LaLiga.

Ange Postecoglou has urged Spurs to keep hold of Romero, though the head coach's future in north London is uncertain after a dismal Premier League campaign, which saw them finish 17th.

Bayern Munich will also be taking part in the USA and are interested in Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma, Liverpool's Cody Gakpo and AC Milan's Rafael Leao if they lose Leroy Sane, who is approaching the final month of his contract, according to Sky in Germany.

The Parkville Board of Aldermen voted unanimously last Tuesday to temporarily loosen its short-term rental policy ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The move comes a year before Kansas City and the region take center stage in one of the biggest events across the globe. 

“We recognize that around the FIFA World Cup tournament next summer, there's going to be a lot of people wanting to stay for a short-term time. And so we're going to temporarily lift the restrictions for a three-month period,"" said Community Development Director Stephen Lachky.

In 2019, the city adopted short-term rental restrictions in order to have control over the increase of short-term rental properties in residential areas. 

The city's current policy has allowed four short-term rentals per ward, a total of 16 throughout the city. Short-term rentals must be an owner-occupied property, and one rental unit is allowed per property. 

Starting next May through July, those restrictions will be loosened to meet the need in short-term rentals during the FIFA World Cup. 

“We're ahead of the ball and ready for those international visitors that will be coming to the Kansas City region,” Lachky said.

There will not be a cap on short-term rentals throughout the city. Property owners looking to rent out their space must apply for a permit, have at least one designated parking spot per dwelling unit, and collect a 5% tourism tax.

The city believes this will help bring more traffic to the area, which leaders anticipate local businesses will benefit from.

“To know that the city is definitely watching out for us — because the city has a lot on their plate, we have a lot going on and we're still on their radar.  — it says something about the charm of Parkville,"" said Lauren Watson.

Watson, general manager at Farm House Collection in downtown Parkville, said the change is a step forward for the city and businesses looking forward to welcoming soccer fans next year.

“Oh, it's thrilling for us,"" Watson said. ""We've seen a lot over the last eight years that we've been in operation here in Parkville. As a company of 17 years, we've seen a lot of ups and downs. This is definitely going to be enough for us. We're very excited to meet everybody.""

Parkville is one of the first cities in the Kansas City region to loosen short-term rental restrictions.

Applications for permits are on the city's website.

There is no time to rest for several members of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City squad as high-profile international contests get underway across the next two weeks.

Just days after the conclusion of yet another long and challenging season for Manchester City, competitive action is not due to ease up with international action followed by a summer tournament for Guardiola and his players.

The next fortnight will see international contests in FIFA World Cup Qualification, the UEFA Nations League semi-final and final stages, as well as international friendlies over in the United States.

     

With just days then separating the conclusion of those matches, Manchester City are due to reconvene at the City Football Academy to prepare for the start of the brand new, revamped, rebranded, and expanded version of the FIFA Club World Cup.

City will begin the competition as holders following their triumph in the last edition of the old format in Saudi Arabia back in 2023, and take on Italy's Juventus, Morocco's Wydad AC, and the United Arab Emirates' Al Ain in the group stage.

But before then, and ahead of the final international break linked to the 2024/25 season, here is a comprehensive round-up of the Manchester City players selected to feature for their respective national teams throughout the opening weeks of June!

What about the rest of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City squad?

A total of 11 Manchester City first-team players have not been selected to represent their respective nations at senior international level this break, with goalkeeping contingent Ederson (Brazil) and Stefan Ortega Moreno (Germany) absent.

Heading into the defensive stars of the Etihad Stadium and Vitor Reis has not been selected for Brazil's national team roster despite hopes of a senior debut in the months after his arrival at City, while there is no place for Matheus Nunes at Portugal and Nico O'Reilly with England.

Midfielders Claudio Echeverri (Argentina), Nico Gonzalez (Spain), and Rodri (Spain) also have no place with their national sides, while Phil Foden's request to England boss Thomas Tuchel for a break with his mental and physical interests in mind has been approved.

Among the attackers, Savinho has not been selected for Brazil while there is no place for Jack Grealish with the England squad.

On the subject of England and their Under-21 set-up ahead of this summer's European Championships, clarity is still being awaited concerning Rico Lewis and James McAtee – both of whom are eligible for selection but may be needed at the FIFA Club World Cup.

As for Omar Marmoush, there are no fixtures for Egypt in the coming weeks, thus allowing him some well-earned rest. John Stones (England) remains injured while Scott Carson (England) and Ilkay Gundogan (Germany) have both retired from international action.","{'href': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

Ahead of Saturday's showpiece in Munich, GOAL has selected a combined team based on performances in 2024-25

The curtain will come down on the European season this weekend when Paris Saint-Germain and Inter face off in what promises to be a thrilling Champions League final. Neither team were among the favourites for the competition back at the beginning of the league phase in September, but after taking differing routes to Saturday's showpiece, both will feel they are deserving of glory in Munich.

After winning just one of their opening five European matches, PSG managed to survive a potential early elimination before plotting their way through a knockout gauntlet that has saw them eliminate three successive Premier League teams in Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal. Luis Enrique's side did so while playing thrilling attacking football, thus hinting at just how much the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Neymar might have been holing them back on the continent.

Inter, meanwhile, are in their second final in three seasons after following up an impressive quarter-final win over Bayern Munich with an epic victory over Barcelona in the semis as they came out on top 7-6 on aggregate over the Catalans. And though the Nerazzurri haven't quite captured the hearts of neutrals in the same way as their opponents on Saturday, there is no doubt that they possess a number of fine individual talents who can light up any stage.

And so ahead of the most anticipated game of the year, GOAL has put together a combined XI from the two teams based on performances over the course of the 2024-25 season...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Pep Guardiola's empire finally came crashing down - but which players were most responsible for the fall and which ones still did themselves proud?

It is one thing to get to the top, it is quite another to stay there. Manchester City remained at the summit of English football longer than any team in history, but the empire that Pep Guardiola built came crashing down in 2024-25, their fall as astonishing as it was unexpected. City looked hungry to lift a fifth-consecutive title when they won seven of their opening nine league games, but once they were beaten at Bournemouth for their first defeat in 11 months, the dominoes started to fall.

City lost six out of eight league games between November and December, effectively surrendering the title to Liverpool after their limp defeat at Anfield. They also struggled to adapt to the new Champions League format, nearly being eliminated from the league phase before being outclassed by old foes Real Madrid in the knockout play-offs, exiting the competition at their earliest stage in 12 years.

There was a serious risk of them even missing out on qualifying for next season's competition, but when push came to shove, City gritted their teeth and won seven of their final 10 games to finish third on 71 points, 20 fewer than last season and their worst showing in the Guardiola era. They did reach the FA Cup final but lost to Crystal Palace in an infuriating match that summed up their overall campaign.

Napoli's success in winning the Italian Serie A title this season gave them a jolt of confidence and ambition for next season. One of their dream for next season would be to sign Kevin De Bruyne, who is leaving Man City, but the Partenopei might not have Antonio Conte in the dugout.

The Partenopei have just celebrated their fourth ever Scudetto title last weekend following their 2-0 victory against Cagliari. That victory sealed their first-place spot as they finished the season leading by one point ahead of their rival, Inter Milan.

Not keen on replicating their previous failure in competing after winning the league title, Napoli are already gearing up to improve their squad. As it was confirmed by the club's president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, who revealed to the media that his team wants to sign Kevin De Bruyne.

The Belgium international is leaving Manchester City this summer as his contract runs out, and they have agreed to end their tenure. De Bruyne has several suitors, but Napoli are not backing down and seem confident in their attempt to snatch the midfielder.

The latest reports stated that the player's representatives are still discussing contract details with the Italian outfit. Meanwhile, De Bruyne has yet to announce his decision and might need time before deciding which path he will take next season.

However, Napoli's confidence in signing De Bruyne for next season might have a slight obstacle as the club could change their coach again. The Partenopi's decision to take Antonio Conte as head coach earned them the Scudetto title this season, but things might be changing again.

As reported by Italian media, via Football Italia, there's a strong signal that Conte might be opting to end his adventure in Naples after just one season. The tactician reportedly hasn't been happy with how things were going at Napoli and has been making his displeasure visible since January.

From the club's failure in replacing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to the disappointment over training facilities, those things were part of Conte's complaints. The tactician's potential departure seems more likely following De Laurentiis' recent statement during Napoli's trophy parade.

The club president was praising Conte while wishing him the best in his professional future, hinting at a potential goodbye. If the former Inter and Chelsea boss does leave, reports claim that Napoli will try to replace him with Massimiliano Allegri.

Shortly after turning professional, an 18-year-old Ernesto Escobedo was looking for someone to practise with on clay in California. The future No. 67 player in the PIF ATP Rankings invited his cousin, then-13-year-old Emilio Nava, for a session at Match Point Academy in Santa Ana.

“There was one story that I'll never forget,” Escobedo told ATPTour.com. “We had one of the best practices ever, it was a three, four-hour practice. He kept up like no other and ever since then I just felt like he had something special in his tennis, 100 per cent. And on top of that, it was a very competitive practice. I was 18, he was 13. To see that at a very young age was cool.”

Not only did Escobedo become a Top 100 star, but his cousin is closing in on the mark himself. Nava, now 23, is No. 122 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and climbing. 

The American can make further progress Wednesday evening when he faces 10th seed Holger Rune on Court Philippe-Chatrier. It is safe to say he will bring his competitive spirit to the clay major's centre court. 

“By special I don't mean by how he was hitting the ball, but just his work ethic on the court,” Escobedo said. ""He competes very, very well and is just super eager. I think that is what makes someone special. Of course he had great shots at that age, but he also had the competitive drive and things that make a great player great.”



The son of two Olympians — mother, Xochitl (tennis), and father, Eduardo (track) — Nava has spent plenty of time around athletes from whom he learned the value of hard work. That carried over to his tennis journey. 

Near the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, Nava moved to Juan Carlos Ferrero's academy in Spain, where he trained with the likes of Carlos Alcaraz. He kept his base there until the end of the 2023 season, and Escobedo believes that was “a very important part in his career”.

“I think every player has their own journey. Some players like to be home, some players like to go somewhere else and train, but just the commitment that he had over there for four or five years I think shows who he is as a person and a player,” Escobedo said. “[He] is super committed to his tennis and to his craft, and seeing him do well at this stage of his career is awesome. Just seeing a cousin playing well and on the Tour giving their best, it's awesome.”

Nava said last year of the experience: ""I knew I needed to make some kind of sacrifice and some kind of decision to see if I want to make it, to see if I'm able to make it.""

The California native, who upon departing Spain first moved to Orlando, home of the USTA National Campus, now trains under Argentine coach Diego Cristin. That partnership has been successful, with the American enjoying the best season of his career. He won three consecutive ATP Challenger Tour events earlier this year in Asuncion, Concepcion and Sarasota, all on clay, before making a fourth final in Tallahassee.

The big-hitting, athletic right-hander will bring plenty of confidence into his showdown with Rune. It will be the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, but they met in 2021 at an ITF World Tennis Tour event, which Rune won in three sets.

“He's very explosive player, very aggressive player. Yeah, we know each other a bit from juniors,” Rune said. “Big serve, as I remember. He wants to go big on a lot of shots.”

 Lorenzo Musetti has wasted little time sending out a statement that he means business at Roland Garros. 

 The eighth seed on Wednesday raced past Daniel Elahi Galan 6-4, 6-0, 6-4 to reach the third round at the clay court major. Musetti converted six of 12 break points he earned, according to Infosys Stats, to wrap a two-hour, six-minute triumph and build impressively on his opening 7-5, 6-2, 6-0 triumph against Yannick Hanfmann. 

 “Honestly today was not easy to play because of the wind,” said Musetti. “I think I managed to stay there and play a solid match. That is what I needed. I had to raise the level, raise the battle, and I'm really happy to be in the third round.” 

Smooth sailing ⛵️Musetti cruises into the third round with a 6-4 6-0 6-4 win over Galan 🌊@rolandgarros | #rolandgarros | #musetti pic.twitter.com/fxABq16awK

 By increasing his Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Galan to 3-0, Musetti improved to 23-5 on clay since last July. During that period, his achievements include winning a bronze medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics and reaching at least the semi-finals at all three clay ATP Masters 1000 events in 2025, including a championship-match run in Monte-Carlo. 

 Musetti has suffered plenty of heartache at Roland Garros, where he has only lost to Novak Djokovic (twice), Stefanos Tsitsipas and Carlos Alcaraz. He led Djokovic by two sets to love in the fourth round on event debut in 2021, before retiring in the fifth set. A year later, he also led then-World No. 4 Tsitsipas by two sets before falling to a first-round defeat, while his 2024 third-round loss to Djokovic also came in five sets. 



 Yet Musetti has never been better placed to atone for these past disappointments. The Italian's stunning clay-court form has propelled him to sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, as he bids to make his Nitto ATP Finals debut on home soil. 

 He is also unlikely to fear anyone in his section of the draw, despite the presence of some high-quality rivals. Should he defeat Mariano Navone next, Musetti is seeded to meet 10th seed Holger Rune, the Barcelona champion, in the fourth round. The 15th seed Frances Tiafoe is the highest-ranked player Musetti could face in the quarter-finals. 

 “It's been a tremendous clay season so far, but the ambitions now are higher and of course here I never reached more than the fourth round,” said Musetti, who is competing at a career-high No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “Hopefully this year will be the year, and the mentality is to try and beat everyone… I have the chance to play against everyone here, and hopefully I will take these chances.” 

 Musetti's next opponent Navone booked his third-round spot by defeating Reilly Opelka 6-1, 7-6(1), 6-3, while 2023 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Hamad Medjedovic also advanced on Wednesday lunchtime. Medjedovic sank qualifier Juan Manuel Cerundolo 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 to advance to face Daniel Altmaier, a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 winner against Vit Kopriva.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Alcaraz drops set against Marozsan, reaches third round at Roland Garros","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-marozsan-roland-garros-2025-wednesday","Wed, 28 May 2025 14:48:45 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz recovered from a mid-match dip on Wednesday in Paris, where he moved past former foe Fabian Marozsan 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 to record his 20th Roland Garros victory.

The defending champion lost to Marozsan at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome two years ago and was troubled at times by the Hungarian's deft drop shot under the roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

However, with the alarm bells starting to chime after dropping the second set, Alcaraz quickly put to bed any concerns with a dominant performance in the third and fourth sets. The No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings upped his aggression and produced a number of stunning passing shots to become the first player born in the 2000s to earn 20 match wins at Roland Garros.

""It was a great, great match,"" Alcaraz said. ""I played well in the first set. I had really high confidence. In the second set he started to play much better, really aggressively and didn't miss at all. It was a little bit difficult dealing with his game in the second set but I was pleased to stay strong and refresh in the third set and I started to play better and better. I had a really good last two sets.""

Defending champ pushes ahead 👊Alcaraz locks his place in R3 with a 6-1 4-6 6-1 6-2 win over Marozsan... 🔥@rolandgarros | #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/NiAewHV9Wu

Alcaraz is aiming to become the first man to successfully defend the title in Paris since Rafael Nadal in 2019-20 and will next play Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard or Damir Dzumhur following his entertaining two-hour, nine-minute win.

Alcaraz now owns a 29-2 record on clay since last May, highlighted by his maiden Roland Garros title and a run to the silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The Spaniard has won ATP Masters 1000 titles on the surface in 2025 in Monte-Carlos and Rome, where he overcame World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the final and improved to a 7-4 lead in their gripping Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry.

Alcaraz was forced to withdraw from the Masters 1000 in Madrid due to an adductor injury, and wore a brace around his knee during his title run in Rome. Yet he has moved freely across his opening two matches in Paris, where he has played with no strapping.

Marozsan had enjoyed previous success against Alcaraz, defeating the 22-year-old in Rome in 2023. In a fun encounter in Paris, the Hungarian posed Alcaraz questions with his touch and net play, but Alcaraz had more of the answers in the cat-and-mouse exchanges, moving freely to pull the 25-year-old from corner to corner.

""Sometimes it is difficult to have fun on the court, I have to suffer,"" Alcaraz said on fighting during matches. ""It depends on the opponent as well. But most of the time I am trying to not think about anything else but enjoy playing and being in this kind of court.  I want to enjoy when I step onto court and not think about anything else. I want to play good tennis and make the people enjoy my matches.""

 Casper Ruud's hopes for another run at the Roland Garros title after a strong European clay swing ended with an injury-affected defeat to Nuno Borges on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The No. 41 in the PIF ATP Rankings Borges downed Ruud 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 at the clay-court major to become the first Portuguese man to reach the third-round in tournament history. Two-time finalist Ruud made a fast start on Court Suzanne-Lenglen but from the third set onwards was visibly hampered by a left knee issue, which he received treatment for. 

Borges with the upset… 🚨 He takes out 7th seed Ruud 2-6 6-4 6-1 6-0…@rolandgarros | #rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/Ifx0LY6v6n

 In his post-match press conference, Ruud explained that he had been managing pain in his left knee in the run-up to Roland Garros. 

 “It's hopefully nothing too serious. For the last couple of weeks, I've been kind of struggling a little bit with knee pain on and off,” explained the Norwegian. “That's why I decided to pull out of Geneva after Rome, do my best, and heal to be ready here. 

 “When you're practising, leading up to the tournament, it's easier to avoid certain movements that are painful. It's not painful. Everything is not painful. But certain movements out there are kind of what makes it painful. Certain shots are painful to do. When you're playing matches, you can't really control it in the same way. You do everything you can to get to every ball. Sometimes you kind of forget that this is a shot I shouldn't go for maybe in terms of pain in the knee. That's pretty much all.” 



 Ruud said he first felt the pain during April's Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, and he also revealed that he had a scan on the knee during his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title run at the Mutua Madrid Open. The 26-year-old, who is now 25-7 for 2025 according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, was also keen to praise the performance of Borges after the Portuguese levelled the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1. 

 “It's been okay in practice because, like I said, I'm able to control it a bit more,"" said Ruud. ""When you play a match, you go full on, no matter what happens. I don't want to take anything away from Nuno, because I think he played a phenomenal match, a really high level.” 

 For Borges, his reward for earning a maiden victory against a Top-10 opponent is a third-round meeting with Alexei Popyrin. The 25th-seeded Australian earlier downed Alejandro Tabilo 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. 

 “I was fighting a lot, especially that first set, I felt like I was completely drilled,” said Borges of his victory against Ruud. “He really played a huge intensity, and I wasn't handling the situation the best. It was too much for me. Then I just kept on trying and noticed he started to slow down a little bit, and obviously he wasn't 100 per cent today or I'm sure the result would not have been the same. 

 “I'm still proud of how I battled from the beginning until the end and gave myself a shot, and today I got lucky.”

Emma Raducanu has been knocked out of the French Open at the second-round stage as defending champion and four-time winner Iga Swiatek proved too powerful in a 6-1 6-2 victory in Paris.

Despite a promising and competitive start to proceedings, the first set raced away from Raducanu when Swiatek turned up her power game to register two breaks and a 5-1 lead, serving the set out for a comprehensive success in the end.

Swiatek broke Raducanu early into the second set, but the Brit missed the chance to hit straight back by failing to take three break-point chances after a couple of Swaitek double faults.

Instead, Swiatek registered a nervy hold after the longest game in the match, and kicked on from there to break Raducanu once more and serve out the match.

Speaking courtside after her victory - which extends Swiatek's winning run at the French Open to 23 matches in a row, having lifted the trophy in 2022, 2023 and 2024, she said:

""I felt good on court and I thought I could do whatever I planned and whatever I wanted to. I just needed to adjust to the wind, because the conditions were pretty tricky today.

""I'm happy that I did that well and I'm through.

""I honestly just love playing here, this place really inspires me and makes me work harder. Some time off before helped me a little bit and I'm just ready to fight for it and compete.""

Italian fourth seed Jasmine Paolini is also through to the third round after a 6-3 6-3 win over Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic, as is China's Qinwen Zheng after a 6-2 6-3 win over Colombian Emiliana Arango.

Ukraine's Elina Svitolina is also through after beating Hungary's Anna Bondar 7-6 (7-4) 7-5.

Top seed Aryna Sabalenka faces Switzerland's Jil Teichmann later on Wednesday for her second-round clash.

On the men's side of the draw, defending French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz booked his place in the third round after a dominant 6-1 4-6 6-1 6-2 victory over Hungarian Fabian Marozsan.

""It was a great match. I started playing well. In the first set, I had really high confidence. In the second set, he started to play much better and he was really aggressive,"" Alcaraz said.

""He didn't miss at all so it was a little difficult to deal with his game in the second set but I'm really happy I stayed strong and refreshed myself.

""In the third set, I started to play better and better which helped me have a really good last two sets... I just want to show good tennis. I want to make sure people are happy watching my match as well. That's the way I enjoy playing tennis.""

Elsewhere, Italy's Lorenzo Musetti progressed after a straight sets 6-4 6-0 6-4 win over Colombian Daniel Elahi Galan, Norway's seventh seed Casper Ruud was beaten by Portugal's Nuno Borges 2-6 6-4 6-1 6-0.

Raducanu won just three games as defending champion Swiatek raced to a 6-1 6-2 victory in the second-round clash 

Emma Raducanu is out of the French Open after suffering another heavy defeat to the four-time Roland Garros champion Iga Swiatek, who improved her record against the former US Open winner to 5-0. 

Swiatek defeated Raducanu 6-1 6-0 at the Australian Open earlier this year and although Swiatek came into the French Open struggling for form, the Pole was sharp from the off and illustrated why she is so supreme on the Paris clay. It led to another rout, with Swiatek overcoming an aggressive start from Raducanu to show her class and reel off a 6-1 6-2 win. 

Meanwhile, defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz is though after beating Hungary's Fabian Marozsan in four sets but two-time finalist Casper Ruud is out after the injured Norwegian was shocked by Portugal's Nuno Borges. 

Elsewhere in the women's singles World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka headlines proceedings on Court Suzanne Lenglen when she faces Switzerland's Jil Teichmann. 

Follow all the latest updates, scores, results and analysis from Roland Garros below:

Emma Raducanu has admitted she felt “exposed” by Iga Swiatek during her 6-1 6-2 defeat to the four-time French Open champion. 

While Swiatek has won the last three Roland Garros titles, Raducanu was playing on Court Philippe-Chatrier for the first time. 

“It was the first time playing a match on that court,” she said. “It's also different when it's filled and it's got everything around. You do feel like it is a big court. And it's different and it's new for me.

“It's a surrounding that she's obviously very comfortable with and she's played in it a lot of times. I think that did emphasise me feeling a bit of uncomfortable. But it's a good experience for if I ever play on that court again.

“It's difficult. You just don't really feel like there is that much space on the court, and certain moments you overhit, because you just feel constant pressure. 

“I definitely think I can improve certain areas of my game to maybe make me feel like I have less holes. Yeah, I'm just going to try my best to work on that.”

 Damir Dzumhur, of Bosnia and Herzegovina, takes out France's big-serving 30th seed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 

The World No 69 wins 7-6 6-3 4-6 6-4 and will play Carlos Alcaraz next. 

Matteo Gigante, the world No 167 who started the week in qualifying, is a set away from beating former French Open finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas. 

The Italian left-hander is causing Tsitsipas all sorts of problems, despite never winning a French Open match before this week. 

He leads the 20th seed 6-4 5-7 6-2 on Court Simonne-Mathieu. 

Aces: Raducanu, 2 | Swiatek, 3

First serve: Raducanu, 60% | Swiatek 67%

Win on first serve: Raducanu, 52% | Swiatek 70%

Win on second serve: Raducanu, 35% | Swiatek 60%

Winners: Raducanu, 8 | Swiatek, 32 

Unforced errors: Raducanu, 17 | Swiatek, 22 

Total points won: Raducanu 39 | Swiatek 63 

Break points: Raducanu 0/4 | Swiatek 4/8 

Iga Swiatek now has 23 consecutive wins at the French Open (not at Roland Garros, obviously, as she lost in the semi-finals at the Olympics). 

After Marta Kostyuk was knocked out, it will be either Jaqueline Cristian or Sara Bejlek (who defeated to Ukrainian) in the third round. 

“I love playing here,” Swiatek said. “This place inspires me and makes me work harder. I think having some time off before helped me a bit. I'm ready to fight for it and compete.”  

Speaking on TNT Sports, Tim Henman says that while Emma Raducanu will take the positives from her clay-court season, today's 6-1 6-2 defeat to Iga Swiatek will leave her feeling “pretty raw”. 

“She's out on Chatrier playing the best clay-court player of her generation and it was a one-sided contest. There were glimmers of opportunity but Swiatek demonstrated her ball-striking capabilities. It's a tough day at the office for Emma but I'm sure she will bounce back quickly.” 

In her on-court interview, the interviewer starts by asking Iga Swiatek: “Although it was not an easy match to play Emma, how did you manage to make it look easy?”

“Oh come on” Swiatek replies. “I'm not focussing on that. I felt good on court and I thought I could do whatever I wanted to. 

Iga Swiatek takes the second match point with a backhand winner! A supreme victory for the French Open champion. 6-1 6-2. 

She improves her winning record over Raducanu to 5-0. She made a decent start, with some close games early on, but once Swiatek started pulling away Raducanu could not respond. 

Swiatek holds up her hands as she puts away a sliced backhand volley, that takes a little clip off the top of the net. 

Two match points. 

Raducanu saves the first with a scorching forehand winner on the return. 

With wonderful footwork again, Swiatek moves into the short ball from Raducanu and steers the backhand winner. Raducanu said she couldn't push the ball back but it must be so demoralising to face Swiatek when she's on this form. 

Raducanu saves the love-break with a wide serve, then Swiatek nets on the backhand after Raducanu found some depth. Swiatek goes big on the forehand return and Raducanu can only get her racket on it as the Pole breaks. 

She'll serve for the match next.

 Casper Ruud's hopes for another run at the Roland Garros title after a strong European clay swing ended with an injury-affected defeat to Nuno Borges on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The No. 41 in the PIF ATP Rankings Borges downed Ruud 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 at the clay-court major to become the first Portuguese man to reach the third-round in tournament history. Two-time finalist Ruud made a fast start on Court Suzanne-Lenglen but from the third set onwards was visibly hampered by a left knee issue, which he received treatment for.

 In his post-match press conference, Ruud explained that he had been managing pain in his left knee in the run-up to Roland Garros. 

 “It's hopefully nothing too serious. For the last couple of weeks, I've been kind of struggling a little bit with knee pain on and off,” explained the Norwegian. “That's why I decided to pull out of Geneva after Rome, do my best, and heal to be ready here. 

 “When you're practising, leading up to the tournament, it's easier to avoid certain movements that are painful. It's not painful. Everything is not painful. But certain movements out there are kind of what makes it painful. Certain shots are painful to do. When you're playing matches, you can't really control it in the same way. You do everything you can to get to every ball. Sometimes you kind of forget that this is a shot I shouldn't go for maybe in terms of pain in the knee. That's pretty much all.” 



 Ruud said he first felt the pain during April's Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, and he also revealed that he had a scan on the knee during his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title run at the Mutua Madrid Open. The 26-year-old, who is now 25-7 for 2025 according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, was also keen to praise the performance of Borges after the Portuguese levelled the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1. 

 “It's been okay in practice because, like I said, I'm able to control it a bit more,"" said Ruud. ""When you play a match, you go full on, no matter what happens. I don't want to take anything away from Nuno, because I think he played a phenomenal match, a really high level.” 

 For Borges, his reward for earning a maiden victory against a Top-10 opponent is a third-round meeting with Alexei Popyrin. The 25th-seeded Australian earlier downed Alejandro Tabilo 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. 

 “I was fighting a lot, especially that first set, I felt like I was completely drilled,” said Borges of his victory against Ruud. “He really played a huge intensity, and I wasn't handling the situation the best. It was too much for me. Then I just kept on trying and noticed he started to slow down a little bit, and obviously he wasn't 100 per cent today or I'm sure the result would not have been the same. 

 “I'm still proud of how I battled from the beginning until the end and gave myself a shot, and today I got lucky.”

Carlos Alcaraz details his match against Fabian Marozsan and how he was able to bounce back after he dropped the second set. (0:31)

Clearly hampered by a bad left knee, two-time French Open finalist Casper Ruud dropped 13 of the last 14 games, lost 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 to Nuno Borges in the second round at Roland Garros on Wednesday and then revealed he had been playing in pain off-and-on throughout the clay-court season.

The seventh-seeded Ruud reached at least the semifinals each of the past three years in Paris -- finishing as the runner-up to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023 -- and this is his earliest exit at the tournament since bowing out in the second round in his debut in 2018.

Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz overcame a one-set blip to defeat Fabian Marozsan 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.

For the past several weeks, Ruud has been taking pain-killing and anti-inflammatory pills, and he did so again Wednesday. But Ruud said the knee began bothering him in the first set against Borges, who is ranked 41st and became the first Portuguese man to get to the French Open's third round. Borges will face Alexei Popyrin in the third round after the Australian player eased past Alejandro Tabilo in straight sets.

Ruud said the worst shot for his knee is an open-stance backhand, in which he slides on his left foot, so he has been avoiding it in practice.

""Certain movements out there are kind of what makes it painful. Certain shots are painful to do,"" said Ruud, who also reached the final at the 2023 US Open. ""When you're playing matches, you can't really control it in the same way [as in practice]. You do everything you can to get to every ball. Sometimes you kind of forget that this is a shot I shouldn't go for.""

Ruud was visited by a trainer and took some pills during Wednesday's match, but nothing seemed to help.

""It's a Slam. I love this tournament,"" Ruud said. ""Looking back, I tried my best to continue [and tried] to avoid the shots that are hurting. But towards the end, there were also other movements that started hurting, so it wasn't ideal.""

He said the problems began in his first clay event of the pre-French Open stretch, at Monte Carlo in April, and that he had medical exams a couple of weeks later in Madrid, where he won the title. Ruud pulled out of the Geneva Open, which was played last week.

Now he will have more tests done.

""I took five days completely off at home. It wasn't enough to make the pain go away,"" Ruud said. ""I wish I could stay here longer.""

Alcaraz was toppled by Marozsan on the clay courts of Rome two years ago and had moments of vulnerability on Court Philippe-Chatrier on Wednesday, but the 22-year-old ensured there would be no early ending to his bid for a fifth Grand Slam title.

""It was a great match. I started playing well,"" Alcaraz said. ""In the first set, I had really high confidence. In the second set, he started to play much better and he was really aggressive. He didn't miss at all, so it was a little difficult to deal with his game in the second set, but I'm really happy I stayed strong and refreshed myself.""

Alcaraz will next face Damir Dzumhur, who shrugged off a nasty fall to outlast big-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 7-6 (4), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.

Lorenzo Musetti continued his renaissance when he eased into the third round with a no-nonsense 6-4, 6-0, 6-4 victory against Colombian lucky loser Daniel Galan on Wednesday.

The eighth-seeded Musetti's main trouble was intermittent rain on Court Simonne-Mathieu as he set up a meeting with Mariano Navone, who defeated American Reilly Opelka 6-1, 7-6 (1), 6-3.

""It was a solid performance from the beginning until the end,"" Musetti said. ""I had some ups and downs during the first and the third set. Definitely I cannot complain about the level that I'm showing.""

Musetti, who reached the final at the Monte Carlo Masters and the semifinals in Madrid and Rome in the three big clay-court tournaments before Roland Garros, said things started clicking into place in Monte Carlo Masters, calling it a ""boost of confidence.""

Casper Ruud, the 7th-seeded Norwegian, lost to Portugal's Nuno Borges in the 2nd round of Roland Garros 2025. The two-time Roland Garros finalist lost to the world No. 41 in four sets.

Ruud conceded the second set 6-4 after winning the first set 6-2. Things got worse for him from that point as Borges claimed the next set 6-1. Ruud took a medical timeout at the end of the third set. But the fortunes hardly changed for the world No. 8. Borges ended the game in emphatic fashion by bagelling the clay court specialist. 

Result: Nuno Borges 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 Casper Ruud (7).

Borges said he was “completely drilled” in the first set, praising Ruud's intensity and admitting he couldn't handle it. 

It was the worst French Open finish for Casper Ruud in 7 years. 

Casper Ruud is the 2nd top 10 seeded player to get knocked out of the tournament in the opening two rounds. Fourth-seeded Taylor Fritz lost to Germany's Daniel Altmaier 5-7, 6-3, 3-6, 1-6. 

Defending Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz defeated Italy's Giulio Zeppieri 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in straight sets and moved to the third round. The Spaniard will face the winner between France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and Bosnia and Herzegovina's Damir Dzumhur.

A MAN cycled from Chalford to Wimbledon and back in a single day to raise money for his sports club.

Nathan Monk set off on his journey from the Chalford Sports and Social Club to Centre Court, Wimbledon, on Saturday, May 25.

He completed the round trip, which spans 224 miles, in 13 hours, 39 minutes, and 43 seconds.

Through his epic bike ride, Mr Monk is aiming to raise funds to help improve facilities at Chalford Tennis and Pickleball Club.

He said: ""The tennis and pickleball club is an important facility in the area for the members and community.

""I am a pickleball member and my family also play, as well as tennis.

""The club is run by volunteers and I am passionate about improving facilities for all members and giving something back to an amazing club.

""With improved facilities, we would then be able to offer wheelchair tennis and other open court programmes, allowing us to be more inclusive to those in the community.""

Chalford Tennis and Pickleball Club recently won the 2025 LTA Gloucestershire Club of the Year award for its 'outstanding work'.

Thanks to the £2,379 plus raised by Mr Monk so far on his Crowdfunder page, the club is hoping to be able offer wheelchair tennis and additional open court programmes, making it more inclusive for the community.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Jannik Sinner given 'fatal' French Open warning by Wimbledon winner","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/jannik-sinner-fatal-bar-physical-weakness-french-open","Wed, 28 May 2025 12:02:48 GMT","

Former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli has assessed that Jannik Sinner has made “enormous physical progress” while arguing the Italian still has “a fatal bar” opponents could exploit.

Sinner is vying for his maiden French Open title and fourth Grand Slam overall at the 2025 edition of the major.

The world No 1 defeated 75th-ranked Arthur Rinderknech 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 in the opening round at Roland Garros.

The 23-year-old is aiming to win his first Grand Slam tournament on a natural surface, having triumphed on the hard courts of the Australian Open (2024 and 2025) and the US Open (2024).

Sinner is playing just his second tournament since defending his Australian Open title in January as he was unable to compete for three months due to a suspension for failed doping tests.

At his comeback event earlier this month, Sinner won five matches to progress to the final at the Italian Open — where he was beaten by Carlos Alcaraz. Sinner won his only clay-court title to date at the 2022 Croatia Open.

John McEnroe offers intriguing take as he answers Carlos Alcaraz question

While Sinner has been lauded for his complete game and mental toughness, his physical staying power in long matches is the one area where questions remain.

The Italian has lost all of the seven longest matches he has played in his career — including the six that have reached the four-hour mark. He holds a 6-9 record in matches that have gone to a fifth set.

Speaking on Prime Video Sport France, Bartoli claimed Sinner's durability could be a factor in his French Open hopes as she asserted his rivals must push him to a certain time mark in matches.

“Sinner has taken on another physical dimension. He's not the same player at all,” said the former world No 7 (translated from French).

“We all remember a match he played here against Rafael Nadal [in 2020]. He pushed him around for a set and a half and we said to ourselves: ‘Wow, who is this new Italian who hits the ball very flat, who doesn't really have a clay-court game?'

“He's a puncher, a hitter. He's made enormous physical progress; today he's a real athlete. So we know that the 4:30 mark is a bit of a fatal bar for Sinner. Beyond that, he starts to get stuck physically, but we have to take him beyond 4:30 of play.”

The 23-year-old will take on French great Richard Gasquet — who is playing the final tournament of his career — in the second round at Roland Garros on Thursday.

Emma Raducanu has admitted she ""still feels bad"" about pulling out of her mixed doubles pairing with Andy Murray at Wimbledon last year and suggested she is unsure whether he has fully forgiven her.

Murray did not participate in the men's singles event at SW19 last year due to a back injury, instead choosing to only take part in the men's doubles and mixed doubles events. Having been knocked out of the men's competition alongside his brother Jamie, he was due to take to the court alongside Raducanu in what would have been his final outing at the All England Club.

However, Raducanu pulled out of the match due to ""some stiffness in her right wrist"" and, in doing so, ended Murray's Wimbledon career as he was not permitted to find a replacement partner due the draw already being made.

At the time, Murray was said to be ""disappointed"" by the decision, while his mother Judy branded it ""astonishing"" in a social media remark that she later clarified was intended to be sarcastic.

Raducanu later said she had sent the former men's world number one a ""long message"" to apologise and avoid any ""bad blood"" with him, adding that ""causing trouble"" was ""definitely the last thing I want"".

However, the incident has been brought up nearly a year on at the French Open as she was quizzed on who will coach her heading into this year's Wimbledon campaign.

The 22-year-old is looking for her seventh full-time coach in her short career but has said that she will keep former player-turned- commentator Mark Petchey on in a part-time role for Wimbledon.

Asked if she would consider working with Murray, who ended his coaching partnership with Novak Djokovic earlier this month, Raducanu ruled out approaching him and instead made another plea for his forgiveness.

“I hope he's forgiven me for last year, I still feel bad about it,” she said. “I'm looking forward to seeing him around and having a conversation.

""I think he would give great advice, he's been in a similar situation and would probably understand a lot of things that I'm also going through. But as to anything more, I don't know, that's very far out of thought.”

Raducanu will come up against defending champion Iga Swiatek in the second round of the French Open on Wednesday, having defeated China's Wang Xinyu in her opening match.

The British No.2 is currently getting acupuncture after suffering a back spasm in Strasbourg last week, while she required medical attention during her victory over Wang.

She was leading by six games to five in the opening set at Roland Garros when she returned to her chair and called for medical assistance from the physio, with two medics rushing to her aid.

The 2021 US Open Champion looked frustrated as the medics took her blood pressure, while she was also seen rubbing blocks of ice around her eyes.

However, she recovered to see out a gritty 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 win over Wang and set up a clash with Swiatek, who is aiming for a fifth French Open title in six years.

Ashlyn Krueger is the latest young American star to make inroads at the French Open.

The 21-year-old secured her place in the second round on Monday after overcoming Suzan Lamens 6-3, 6-4 in Paris.

It was a fine performance from Krueger, who's appearing in just her second French Open main draw.

The 6ft 1in emerging star failed to get past the first round in last year's edition, and after also falling at the same stage at the Australian Open earlier this year, a second-round Grand Slam appearance will surely satisfy her.

Krueger, who made her professional debut back in 2021, has consistently struggled at Grand Slams in her short career.

She's fallen at the first round in every single major she's appeared at, bar the US Open last year, where she reached the third round, and now this French Open win. 

Now in Paris, she joins a slew of young American players who have avoided an early exit, with Robin Montgomery and Hailey Baptiste also picking up first-round wins.

Krueger also has one of the best coaches in her team to help guide her progression.

That is former tennis player Michael Joyce, who also coached Maria Sharapova.

Joyce has worked with Krueger since 2021, after several stints with other players like Jessica Pegula and Victoria Azarenka.

Although his most successful stint was with the Russian Sharapova, whom he helped guide to three Grand Slams.

The Krueger-Sharapova connection goes beyond just coaching, though. 

Like the former world no.1 and two-time French Open champion, Krueger is tall, blonde, and extremely hard-hitting.

The American knew by the age of 11 she wanted to be a professional tennis player, when she saw five-time Grand Slam champion Sharapova succeeding at the highest level. “

She had the same body type as me,” Krueger said. “When you see someone that looks like you, it's really important. I saw her and said, `I want to do that.'”

Joyce is now working with Krueger, and he'll be the last person to be surprised should she make a run at the French Open after a steady upwards trajectory this year.

She started 2025 with a run to the quarterfinals of the Brisbane International, defeating big opponents on the way, including sixth seed Anna Kalinskaya.

Krueger then backed that victory up with another quarterfinal, this time in Adelaide, where she had to come through qualifying.

There, she achieved one of her biggest ever wins, beating fifth seed Paula Badosa before being forced to retire against top seed Jessica Pegula.

After a disappointing Australian Open, she then bounced back by reaching the final in Abu Dhabi, a WTA 500 tournament, losing to Belinda Bencic.

Nevertheless, Krueger, who is currently ranked 35th in the world, has remained optimistic about her year so far as she bids to make 2025 the most successful season of her career.

She even told Tennis Channel about one ambitious goal she has.

""Top 15 at the end of the year,"" she said.

When asked how she will get there? By having no regrets.

""Everything just connects [when she plays her best tennis], and I see the court really well,"" Krueger said. 

""I go for my targets and I have no hesitation. When I have no hesitation, everything just flows.

Krueger will have a mammoth task to reach the third round at the French Open, as she faces World No.6 Mirra Andreeva.

Six US Open wild card entries on the line; event to be held at USTA National Campus June 16-18

Press release written and distributed by the USTA

ORLANDO, Fla., May 28, 2025 – The United States Tennis Association (USTA) today announced the participants that will be competing in the US Open Wild Card Playoffs, set to be held at the USTA National Campus, June 16-18.

The new event featuring the top American collegiate players, which was announced earlier this month, will more than double the average number of American collegiate players that earn US Open wild cards this year, with six guaranteed US Open wild card entries up for grabs. The winners of the singles and doubles competitions will earn US Open main draw singles and doubles wild cards, respectively, while the men's and women's singles finalists will earn US Open qualifying wild cards.

The men's singles field is headlined by Columbia's Michael Zheng, who won the NCAA men's singles title last November, and Michigan State's Ozan Baris, who lost to Zheng in the NCAA men's singles final. The women's singles field will feature Auburn's DJ Bennett, who was the NCAA women's singles runner-up in November.

Jordan Thompson has fired a broadside at tour scheduling, describing the demands placed on players as “sh*t” while critical of the extension of several Masters tier tournaments to a fortnight that now matches the length of the grand slams.

The Australian, whose Roland Garros ended on Tuesday when he and Jason Kubler were defeated in the men's doubles, has struggled with a range of injuries this year after squeezing only seven days off to recuperate after enjoying a career-best season in 2024.

He said the challenges of staying inside the top 100, which is considered the range in ranking where players make a decent living, meant professionals were placing extra stress on their bodies in order to retain their place on the premier tour.

By extending tournaments including the Madrid Masters and Italian Open to a fortnight, players are forced to wait at tournaments for longer and this has eaten into the time Aussies have to sneak home for a brief break to see family and friends.

“Unfortunately with the ATP schedule and how sh*t it is, we can't afford to take breaks because you let other people just have an opportunity to pass you on the rankings and get more prize money and you just feel like you're missing out on an opportunity,” he said.

 “I can't stand the schedule. I hate the two week (Masters) events and I think it's even tougher for Aussies. The last few years I've been away ... after every Aussie Open (and) I've come back at probably the start of December because I've got to wait until Davis Cup (is over).





 “I know there are opportunities to go home throughout the year, but it is so far to get back to Australia and I don't see the benefit of going there for less than 10 days, because by the time you acclimatise there, on an island in the middle of nowhere that is a completely different time zone, you've just got to come back and compete again. So I just don't see how that's beneficial for any tennis player.”

The Australian's critique comes at a time where the relationship between the tours and the playing group is fraught. 

The Novak Djokovic-founded PTPA recently issued a law suit against the tours, among other affiliated parties, on several bases.

Top 10-ranked players also met with representatives of all grand slam bodies including Tennis Australia in Paris last week to discuss issues including prize money percentages per event revenue.

And there is frustration among the playing group that the Masters events have been extended, squeezing out smaller tournaments, to allow organisers to further their commercial interests.





Thompson, who claimed a maiden ATP Tour singles title last year and partnered the now-suspended Max Purcell to a US Open doubles title and a spot in the elite ATP Tour Finals, said he did not know a player who enjoyed the extended time frame at select Masters events.

“I haven't spoken to a player who likes the two week events. I mean, you are there for an eternity,” he said. 

“It feels like a couple of times I've made the doubles final and I've been in the same city for over 17 days, and we're at one tournament. Why is one tournament taking that long to finish? I mean, why do we need a day off for playing? They are three set matches. 





“It should just be like the Paris Masters (which is a) one week event. Why do we need to turn that into a two week event? It's just a waste of time in my opinion and I know a lot of other players feel the same.” 

By virtue of his national duties, with Australia pressing deep into the Davis Cup finals in recent years, Thompson said the off-season had become almost non-existent in the sport.

“Our off-season is a pitiful three weeks. That's rubbish. I've got some worse words for our off-season. It's just a joke,” he said. 

“For an Australian, it's great that we play in Australia, but if you play Davis Cup, you literally can take maybe seven days off and that's your off season, because then you're back into training and you're leaving before Christmas. 

“Our 2025 season started in 2024. I mean, that's just ridiculous. I mean, where's the tennis players break? I just feel like there is no time to rest or have a holiday.”

Nine's Wide World of Sports

The extension of several Masters tier tournaments has made an already demanding tour even more difficult to navigate, Australian tennis player Jordan Thompson says.

Thompson expressed frustration over the tour schedule as the Australian has struggled to replicate his career best year in 2024.

The Sydneysider has only had seven days off in 2025 as schedule changes mean players have less time to rest and spend time with family.

Thompson was knocked out of his Roland-Garros doubles campaign on Tuesday and spoke of the challenges the modern day player faces.

The recent trend of extending 1000 events to span over two weeks has raised questions about player wellbeing and also the impact it has on the sport.

Traditionally 1000 events were condensed into a week of top-level competition with the top players competing.

With the extension of all but two of the tournaments to 12 days, and a 96 draw instead of 64, there's a feeling among players the changes drag out the tournament, with the first week often lacking entertainment, resembling more of a qualifying event than a showcase of the best tennis on tour.

The extension of these events forces players to wait at tournaments for longer, leaving less time to recover. And such is the competition for rankings points and prizemoney, players are pushing themselves through injury to maintain their grip.

""Unfortunately with the ATP schedule and how shit it is, we can't afford to take breaks because you let other people just have an opportunity to pass you on the rankings and get more prize money and you just feel like you're missing out on an opportunity,"" he said.

""I can't stand the schedule. I hate the two week (Masters) events and I think it's even tougher for Aussies. The last few years I've been away, after every Aussie Open (and) I've come back at probably the start of December because I've got to wait until Davis Cup (is over).

""It should just be like the Paris Masters (which is a) one week event. Why do we need to turn that into a two week event? It's just a waste of time in my opinion and I know a lot of other players feel the same.""

The tour schedule has been a huge gripe of the playing group for some time and formed part of the lawsuit taken against tennis' governing body.

While players are unhappy about the new arrangement, fans are also short-changed during the extended version.

The absence of top match-ups and star players in the early stages, leaves fans waiting days for clashes that usually top the bill in a one-week event.

For a player like Thompson, who also has to juggle Davis Cup duties as well, it leaves little time for anything but tennis.

""Our off-season is a pitiful three weeks. That's rubbish. I've got some worse words for our off-season. It's just a joke,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Musetti maintains rapid Roland Garros start","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/musetti-galan-ruud-borges-roland-garros-2025-wednesday","Wed, 28 May 2025 13:01:56 GMT","

 Lorenzo Musetti has wasted little time sending out a statement that he means business at Roland Garros. 

 The eighth seed on Wednesday raced past Daniel Elahi Galan 6-4, 6-0, 6-4 to reach the third round at the clay court major. Musetti converted six of 12 break points he earned, according to Infosys Stats, to wrap a two-hour, six-minute triumph and build impressively on his opening 7-5, 6-2, 6-0 triumph against Yannick Hanfmann. 

 “Honestly today was not easy to play because of the wind,” said Musetti. “I think I managed to stay there and play a solid match. That is what I needed. I had to raise the level, raise the battle, and I'm really happy to be in the third round.” 

Smooth sailing ⛵️Musetti cruises into the third round with a 6-4 6-0 6-4 win over Galan 🌊@rolandgarros | #rolandgarros | #musetti pic.twitter.com/fxABq16awK

 By increasing his Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Galan to 3-0, Musetti improved to 23-5 on clay since last July. During that period, his achievements include winning a bronze medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics and reaching at least the semi-finals at all three clay ATP Masters 1000 events in 2025, including a championship-match run in Monte-Carlo. 

 Musetti has suffered plenty of heartache at Roland Garros, where he has only lost to Novak Djokovic (twice), Stefanos Tsitsipas and Carlos Alcaraz. He led Djokovic by two sets to love in the fourth round on event debut in 2021, before retiring in the fifth set. A year later, he also led then-World No. 4 Tsitsipas by two sets before falling to a first-round defeat, while his 2024 third-round loss to Djokovic also came in five sets. 



 Yet Musetti has never been better placed to atone for these past disappointments. The Italian's stunning clay-court form has propelled him to sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, as he bids to make his Nitto ATP Finals debut on home soil. 

 He is also unlikely to fear anyone in his section of the draw, despite the presence of some high-quality rivals. Should he defeat Mariano Navone next, Musetti is seeded to meet 10th seed Holger Rune, the Barcelona champion, in the fourth round. The 15th seed Frances Tiafoe is the highest-ranked player Musetti could face in the quarter-finals. 

 “It's been a tremendous clay season so far, but the ambitions now are higher and of course here I never reached more than the fourth round,” said Musetti, who is competing at a career-high No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “Hopefully this year will be the year, and the mentality is to try and beat everyone… I have the chance to play against everyone here, and hopefully I will take these chances.” 

 Musetti's next opponent Navone booked his third-round spot by defeating Reilly Opelka 6-1, 7-6(1), 6-3, while 2023 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Hamad Medjedovic also advanced on Wednesday lunchtime. Medjedovic sank qualifier Juan Manuel Cerundolo 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 to advance to face Daniel Altmaier, a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 winner against Vit Kopriva.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz drops set against Marozsan, reaches third round at Roland Garros","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-marozsan-roland-garros-2025-wednesday","Wed, 28 May 2025 14:48:45 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz recovered from a mid-match dip on Wednesday in Paris, where he moved past former foe Fabian Marozsan 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 to record his 20th Roland Garros victory.

The defending champion lost to Marozsan at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome two years ago and was troubled at times by the Hungarian's deft drop shot under the roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

However, with the alarm bells starting to chime after dropping the second set, Alcaraz quickly put to bed any concerns with a dominant performance in the third and fourth sets. The No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings upped his aggression and produced a number of stunning passing shots to become the first player born in the 2000s to earn 20 match wins at Roland Garros.

""It was a great, great match,"" Alcaraz said. ""I played well in the first set. I had really high confidence. In the second set he started to play much better, really aggressively and didn't miss at all. It was a little bit difficult dealing with his game in the second set but I was pleased to stay strong and refresh in the third set and I started to play better and better. I had a really good last two sets.""

Defending champ pushes ahead 👊Alcaraz locks his place in R3 with a 6-1 4-6 6-1 6-2 win over Marozsan... 🔥@rolandgarros | #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/NiAewHV9Wu

Alcaraz is aiming to become the first man to successfully defend the title in Paris since Rafael Nadal in 2019-20 and will next play Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard or Damir Dzumhur following his entertaining two-hour, nine-minute win.

Alcaraz now owns a 29-2 record on clay since last May, highlighted by his maiden Roland Garros title and a run to the silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The Spaniard has won ATP Masters 1000 titles on the surface in 2025 in Monte-Carlos and Rome, where he overcame World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the final and improved to a 7-4 lead in their gripping Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry.

Alcaraz was forced to withdraw from the Masters 1000 in Madrid due to an adductor injury, and wore a brace around his knee during his title run in Rome. Yet he has moved freely across his opening two matches in Paris, where he has played with no strapping.

Marozsan had enjoyed previous success against Alcaraz, defeating the 22-year-old in Rome in 2023. In a fun encounter in Paris, the Hungarian posed Alcaraz questions with his touch and net play, but Alcaraz had more of the answers in the cat-and-mouse exchanges, moving freely to pull the 25-year-old from corner to corner.

""Sometimes it is difficult to have fun on the court, I have to suffer,"" Alcaraz said on fighting during matches. ""It depends on the opponent as well. But most of the time I am trying to not think about anything else but enjoy playing and being in this kind of court.  I want to enjoy when I step onto court and not think about anything else. I want to play good tennis and make the people enjoy my matches.""

Zheng Qinwen won a tough two-setter over Emiliana Arango at Roland Garros to set up a third-round meeting with 18-year-old Victoria Mboko, who improved to 42-5 in 2025 with a win over Eva Lys.

Zheng Qinwen may be only 22 years old, but she's already having to fend off hungry newcomers at Roland Garros.

The No. 8 seed overcame the challenge of Emiliana Arango 6-2, 6-3 in a 1-hour, 37-minute contest that was a good deal tougher than the scoreline suggested. Arango was one of nine players making her Grand Slam debut in this year's main draw, and Zheng will next face another -- the surging 18-year-old qualifier Victoria Mboko, who advanced 6-4, 6-4 over Eva Lys.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores | 411

Zheng's win over Arango was the Olympic gold medalist Zheng's eighth consecutive victory on the clay courts of Roland Garros -- a very different venue to her only previous meeting with the Colombian. That came during the more modest days of a COVID-era ITF W25 in Hamburg in 2021, a stretch when Zheng crisscrossed Europe by car chasing ranking points to break into the Top 100. They met in the first qualifying round. Zheng was a 6-4, 6-4 victor, and went on to win the trophy, one of six ITF titles she racked up in a 10-month timeframe.

Four years on, Zheng will face a player who's been putting together a similarly spectacular run at ITF level. Mboko has traveled to the Caribbean, the United States, the United Kingdom and Portugal to rack up five titles this year, as well as reaching her first WTA 125 final in Parma.

The Canadian's two outings at WTA 1000 level both ended in three-set second-round defeats to Top 15 players, Paula Badosa in Miami and Coco Gauff in Rome. In the first major of her career, Mboko has yet to drop a set as she's improved her season record to a remarkable 42-5.

Against Lys, No. 120-ranked Mboko excelled in all areas of the game. She claimed an opening break with a booming backhand winner, and though Lys pegged her back, struck again at 4-4 with a pair of superb forehands down the line. The teenager delivered a perfect drop shot-lob combination en route to serving out the first set and converted her first match point with her second ace of the day.

Having been in Mboko's position, Zheng knows how she feels -- and how motivated she'll be to notch an upset. She doesn't intend to let it happen.

""Every time I see young player coming, they have a lot of hungry, for sure,"" she told press. ""They fight a lot, for sure, because it's their dream place. But same as me, it's my dream place too.

""When you arrive in the professional tour, you don't think about anymore about the age because everybody's the same. You just face another opponent. Doesn't matter for me.""

Mboko, who is still settling into the Grand Slam routine of a day off between matches, said she wanted to keep herself relaxed, and would only start think about playing Zheng ""the night before"" their clash.

""I feel like I don't really like to put a lot of expectations on myself or on the outcome of the match,"" she said. ""I mean, the only expectations that I can feel right now is that it's going to be a very difficult match. Of course it's going to be very tiring. I'm going to have to build points very long, and I'll have to bring out my best tennis.""

Moving on to R3 🔜#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/wDLjtDVCjV

Zheng pays tribute to Arango's defense

The roar Zheng let out after converting her third match point was indicative of the bruising, physical exchanges she'd had to endure to quell the World No. 85, particularly in a second set in which 22 points lasted nine shots or more -- frequently grueling rallies in which both players threw both heavy topspin and biting slices at each other. Fifteen of those were won by Arango.

""It's not easy to play against her,"" Zheng told on-court interviewer Marion Bartoli. ""She had great defense skills. When I see a short ball I say, 'OK, you got to go to the net to finish the point whatever happens,' because if we stay on the baseline she's going to put all the balls back, which is a very difficult match.""

That tactic paid off for Zheng, who won 18 out of 21 points at net and tallied 31 winners overall.

Paolini eases past Tomljanovic in straight sets

Zheng was joined by another Top 10 seed, No. 4 Jasmine Paolini, who came through 6-3, 6-3 over Ajla Tomljanovic on Court Philippe-Chatrier. The Rome champion extended her winning streak to eight matches and counting.

The Italian fell before the third round in her first 16 Grand Slam main draws. Now, she has reached that stage for the sixth major in a row. Last year's finalist was in control for the majority of her first encounter with Tomljanovic, striking 24 winners and capturing nine out of 11 points at net.

After sealing a 3-0 double-break lead in the second set with a return winner, Paolini's only blip of the contest came as she committed back-to-back double faults to drop serve for the only time. The Italian was able to find her best tennis in the most important moments, though. At 4-3, she fended off a point for Tomljanovic to level the set, then found a spectacular crosscourt forehand en route to holding. In the final game, Paolini outdid Tomljanovic with a reflexed passing shot, before the Australian coughed up her third double fault of the day down match point.

Paolini will next face lucky loser Yuliia Starodubtseva, who made it into the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time by defeating Anastasia Potapova 7-6(4), 6-2.

The second triple header of the season comes to a close in Spain this weekend, and with upgrades and a new technical directive coming into effect, there could be a lot at stake for F1 Fantasy teams.

It's not too late to join the free-to-play game to compete for the great prizes on offer each week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

If you're in need of help or inspiration, the Strategist has reviewed seven F1 Fantasy assets that can help guide your team through this final stanza before a short one-week break between races.

Teams are likely to bring plenty of new parts to Barcelona, so keep an eye on the practice sessions to see how they get on, and remember to lock in your teams before Qualifying starts on May 31 at 1500 local time (1300 UTC).

Race Highlights: 2025 Monaco Grand Prix

Lando Norris got his 2025 campaign back on track with his maiden Monaco win brought him to within three points of team mate Oscar Piastri ($24.6m) in the Drivers' Championship.

Although this was only the Briton's second win of the season, he has managed top-four finishes in every Grand Prix so far.

This consistency has also been on display in F1 Fantasy – the McLaren driver has scored more than 30 points in every race weekend this season, buoyed by securing the fastest lap (worth 10 extra points in F1 Fantasy) in five of the eight races so far this year.

Norris finished P2 in Spain in 2024, where he also had the fastest lap, and will be looking to go one better this time around in Barcelona.

Norris' Monaco victory closed the gap in the Drivers' Championship to just three points

Carlos Sainz continues to build momentum after recording a fourth consecutive Grand Prix points finish for Williams last weekend in Monaco.

The Spaniard now turns his attention to his home race and a circuit where he has a strong record.

Since his debut with Toro Rosso in 2015, Sainz has finished in the points in all 10 Grands Prix he has participated in at the Barcelona circuit.

With Yuki Tsunoda and Charles Leclerc securing bonus Driver of the Day points at their home races this season, could Sainz be in the running to do the same this weekend as a crowd favourite with another good result?

Sainz will be looking to impress in Spain once again this weekend

Oliver Bearman comes onto the F1 Fantasy radar after averaging six game points in his last two outings.

Most interestingly, the young Briton has the worst Qualifying record on the grid this season for drivers that have completed all eight race weekends.

However, the Haas racer is first among all drivers for positions gained per race (4.6) and third for overtakes per race (4.1) this season.

These metrics are a perfect cocktail for F1 Fantasy points for a driver like Bearman at a circuit like Barcelona that provides plenty of overtaking opportunities.

Bearman has already delivered some strong F1 Fantasy results in his debut season

Isack Hadjar is coming off arguably one of his strongest F1 performances in Monaco, securing P6 for Racing Bulls at an extremely challenging circuit.

The rookie has scored 26 game points across the last four races – tied most among all drivers currently priced under $9.5m.

Requiring a mere two game points for a maximum price rise of $0.6m because of his recent strong results, the French driver becomes an attractive option at an affordable price point.

Look no further than Hadjar this weekend if you're looking to increase your cost cap.

Hadjar has made a mockery of his price tag on several occasions this year

Although Fernando Alonso has had a rather challenging 2025 season so far, there is a glimmer of hope for F1 Fantasy strategists looking for cheap alternative at an affordable price.

The Aston Martin racer has endured four retirements through eight race weekends, plaguing his ability to challenge for points on a regular basis.

However, the Spanish veteran has now hit the $4.5m price floor in F1 Fantasy, meaning he cannot lose any further value at his current price.

With consecutive Q3 appearances in Imola and Monaco, this may suggest the tide is turning for Alonso's season, and the home crowd at his back could push him to his first points finish this season.

Other drivers to monitor: Max Verstappen, Oscar Piastri

Alonso has been dogged by inconsistency this season but will want to bounce back at home

McLaren return to the Strategist's watchlist after their fifth consecutive weekend of 80 or more F1 Fantasy points in Monaco.

The Woking-based outfit are also the only team to have had both drivers feature in Q3 in every Qualifying session this season, securing them the maximum teamwork points (+10) every weekend.

They also continue to exercise something of a stranglehold over the fastest lap, having set six in the eight race weekends so far this season.

Although they are the most expensive asset in F1 Fantasy, McLaren continue to deliver every race weekend to justify their premium price tag.

McLaren continue to set the bar high in F1 Fantasy every race weekend

Red Bull average 44.1 fantasy points per race, a meagre 3.2 points shy of second-placed Ferrari in the F1 Fantasy Teams' standings.

The Spanish Grand Prix is something of a stronghold for Max Verstappen, the Dutchman having recorded eight podiums in his last nine visits to Barcelona – including three consecutive race victories between 2022 and 2024.

The Milton Keynes-based squad is also second only to McLaren for Qualifying teamwork points over the last five races – averaging eight points per Qualifying session in that span.

Keep an eye on Red Bull through free practice as a low-owned differential (selected by only 10% of players) this weekend.

Other constructors to monitor: Ferrari, Williams

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on free practice to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline.

Much has been made of exactly where this year's McLaren is deriving its advantage from – and there's been a lot of focus on how well it controls its rear tyre temperatures and the part the car's brake duct design plays in that.

But an advantage in F1 is very rarely about just one golden feature and is invariably about how well designed and integrated the whole car is.

They fill more stadiums than Springsteen and sell as many albums as Taylor Swift. But the world's most successful K-pop band still faces one last hurdle: growing up.


							By 

	Nicole Fell



	There's mounting evidence of Seventeen's cultural dominance around the planet, from sold-out stadium shows and chart-topping albums in the U.S. and Japan to festival-headlining sets in Mexico and Germany. But nowhere is it more apparent than in the group's home city of Seoul. The area surrounding the headquarters of their label Pledis Entertainment's parent company, Hybe, is covered in Seventeen. The gloomy and humid weather on a recent May morning doesn't stop a herd of fans from snapping pictures and taking in the coffee shop across the street, where the faces of Seventeen — comprising members S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, The 8, Mingyu, DK, Seungkwan, Vernon and Dino — paper the outer walls. Stretched across a nearby bus stop is a banner wishing Joshua a happy birthday. His bandmate DK has his own birthday banner just a few storefronts down. The 28-year-old's smiling face can be seen in beauty ads running on a loop in Seoul's subway cars.

	The whole city seems to be celebrating the group's 10th anniversary and the recent release of its fifth studio album, Happy Burstday. A party is held on the man-made islands known as Sebitseom, along Seoul's Hangang River, featuring a giant floating Seventeen light stick and a first-of-its-kind performance at the nearby Jamsu Bridge. Fans who couldn't snag a seat to the special performance did anything they could to see the group, even by jumping in yachts that pulled up next to the stage to watch from the water.

	











	It's hard to imagine Seventeen's global profile getting any larger, but the group's ascendance to the top of pop shows no sign of slowing. The 13-member outfit was the world's biggest group in 2024, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI)'s state-of-the-industry report, which tracks sales and streams. The organization ranked Seventeen third in total, just behind solo acts Taylor Swift and Drake and ahead of U.S. household names like Billie Eilish, The Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar. Their 2023-2024 Follow Tour in Asia was the highest-grossing K-pop tour of 2024, raking in $98.4 million across 24 shows.


	The Hybe building is the ultimate temple to the group's success, currently wrapped in a message that reads “Seventeen will challenge eternity.” That may be, but there's little they can do about the march of time. It's a moment of transition for Seventeen. On one hand — as all K-pop boy groups must do at some point — Seventeen is facing inevitable change as members of the group begin mandatory military service. South Korean law states that all eligible men must enlist before turning 30. Jeonghan, the eldest of the group at 29, and Wonwoo, 28, are currently serving and therefore unable to participate in any promotions. (Both performed on the new album before enlisting.)


	At the same time, Seventeen is grappling with change of a more philosophical nature: wrestling over what the band should become. This reckoning perhaps is best exemplified by Happy Burstday's track list, which features 13 solo songs — one for each member — and only three group tracks. The bandmembers, by their own admission, have focused heavily on group activities until now, even though several of them have also put out solo releases over the past decade.

	











	Any boy group that started as young Seventeen must contend with the quandary of how to age gracefully alongside its music and fans. Somewhat rarely for K-pop, Seventeen's members have had a heavy hand in the trajectory of their careers, as their label's founder, Sung Soo Han (whose official title, tellingly, is Master Professional), explains. “The Seventeen members have been deeply involved not only in the creative process but also in shaping the group's overall direction, making decisions and guiding the team themselves,” he says. Pledis, which Han founded in 2007, has been Seventeen's label for their entire career. In addition to Seventeen, the agency has produced several domestically popular K-pop groups like After School and NU'EST, along with their latest boy group, TWS, which debuted to great fanfare in 2024.


	To understand Seventeen, and why they've lasted this long, it's important to understand the K-pop ecosystem as a whole. It's not a genre — in fact many groups, including Seventeen, explore several different musical styles throughout their careers — but rather a specific way of promoting and releasing music. What perhaps best defines K-pop is the intensity of its relationship with fans, both on social media and in more intimate in-person encounters. Communication apps allow fans to “text” directly with their favorite K-pop idol. VIP concert tickets might include a send-off, where fans gather inside the stadium as the performers walk through snapping photos and signing “photocards” (another K-pop specialty; think baseball or Pokémon trading cards but instead it's your favorite artist and it comes with each album). In recent years, K-pop groups have frequently collaborated with Western artists and released English-language songs. Happy Burstday alone includes collaborations with Pharrell Williams and Timbaland. The group released their first English single, “Dar+ling,” in 2022.  

	











	Most members of K-pop groups spend their adolescence preparing for this job under tightly organized trainee programs. Typically run by Korean entertainment companies like Pledis, these programs require aspiring stars to undergo years of grueling vocal, dance and language training for the chance to join a group. Seventeen's years of apprenticeship were largely broadcast through the online show Seventeen TV, which showcased and introduced Pledis' trainees. While not all members featured on that show went on to debut with Seventeen, some who left joined other K-pop groups or pursued adjacent entertainment careers. Seven-year contracts are the standard when starting out in K-pop, and in 2021, all 13 members of Seventeen renewed their contract with Pledis Entertainment, a year earlier than expected.


	When Seventeen started, K-pop was at a nascent phase globally. “Since their debut, the K-pop landscape has expanded noticeably,” Han says. He adds that the globalization has the company “establishing customized promotional strategies that reflect the cultural characteristics and specific needs of fans in each region.”


	Seventeen's 2015 debut EP, 17 Carat, sold roughly 1,400 albums in its first week on Korea's Hanteo chart. By contrast, Happy Burstday, released May 26, recorded more than 2.2 million sales in its first day. As impressive as the numbers are, the group's most significant evolution has been the maturation of its “concept” — a key term in the world of K-pop, where groups might have an overarching storyline of superhuman powers, pirates or vampires — and their visual direction. For most of Seventeen's career, the focus sonically and visually has been on youth. Over the past few years, as the members grew from teenagers to men, their sound and look have also grown.

	











	On Happy Burstday, Seventeen is experimenting with harder sounds and darker visual themes. “We are ready to reinvent ourselves,” says S.Coups, who sat for an interview alongside three of his bandmates, Joshua, Dino and The 8, in a dance practice room at the Hybe headquarters. The 29-year-old — dressed casually before he rushes off to get into the full glam an 11-member photo shoot requires — serves as the group's leader as well as the head of its rap unit (one of three Seventeen teams, along with the performance and vocal units). Onstage, S.Coups is a commanding, charismatic presence. Offstage, among his fellow group members, he seems lighthearted and playful, laughing throughout the conversation. Unlike Western boy groups, the leader is not an unofficial designation (like NSYNC's Justin Timberlake or One Direction's Harry Styles) but a well-defined role typically involving logistical responsibilities. These days, however, the rapper says he considers himself “a member of Seventeen rather than the leader” because of how his group mates have stepped up.


	“We are standing at a new starting line, preparing for a new path ahead and ready to blaze a new trail,” S.Coups continues. The move to include solo tracks on the album was part of a long-term strategy. “Most of the members are going to enlist in the military soon. Up until now, we've mostly focused on our group promotions,” says 28-year-old Hoshi, the leader of the performance unit. Another strong personality onstage, Hoshi is calm and unfailingly polite, asking his group member Vernon, a native English speaker, to offer this reporter water before he fully sits down. 

	











	“We would like to show more of our individualities, each of the members' personalities and capabilities, so that when the time comes and we get back together again as a group, we‘ll be able to showcase ourselves as a better Seventeen,” adds Hoshi. The group has already begun this process through subunit releases, in which smaller configurations of the group will release a single or EP separate from Seventeen albums. Hoshi is a member of the unit BSS, along with vocalists DK and Seungkwan, and recently released a single album under the two-person unit HxW with Woozi. Jeonghan and Wonwoo released a subunit single album last year, prior to enlisting, under the name JxW. 


	“I just tried to make music that was genuine, that reflected our wholeheartedness and that was what our fans loved best and what we prefer to do as well,” says Woozi. The 28-year-old is arguably Seventeen's “maestro,” to quote the title of the group's 2024 single, as he's spent the past decade shaping the group's identity as Seventeen's lead producer. The bleached-blond Busan native, who in our interview sits contemplatively among group members Mingyu, Jun and Seungkwan, is the leader of the vocal team. The unit structure is tied to the group's name: 13 members, three units and one team, totaling Seventeen. Although the members are assigned to a specific unit, each member might sing, rap and dance in the group; their unit is their specialty.


	The tribulations of adolescence have been the central theme of Seventeen's music from the beginning, but they've also defined the members' relationships with one another as they have spent their entire young adulthood together. “We were housemates at one point for a long time, and that means we had to go through the good moments, bad moments, happy moments, angry moments at the same time,” says Dino, a member of the performance unit.

	











	Despite being one of the eldest in his family, Dino is, at 26, the youngest in Seventeen. When he debuted with the band, he effectively gained 12 older brothers, who alternately tease and care for him. S.Coups, sitting beside Dino for this conversation, breaks into giggles when I ask Dino about some of the ribbing he's been the target of over the past decade. “I think it really helped me grow more mature very quickly, and I think I learned many more lessons than a normal kid my age would learn at that age,” he says.


	Despite having not chosen their bandmates — that was Pledis' job — the members of Seventeen say they share an ironclad bond to one another, and an equally strong commitment to the group, which remains their anchor. Last year, Jun, the only one seriously pursuing an acting career, had to sit out the North American leg of their 2024 Right Here World Tour and the group's Lollapalooza Berlin gig because he was shooting a film and television series in China. Yet despite his acting ambitions, he was determined to return for the group's latest release. “I had my alone time for some time, and now I'm back with the group again,” the 28-year-old says. “In the lead-up to this album, I put a lot of thought into how I can showcase a new side of myself during this promotion.”


	The bond may never have been broken, but it's surely been strained, as would any relationship that involves seeing one another nearly every day for a decade. Mingyu, a member of the rap unit, jokes that they've worked things out “through endless fights,” which causes fellow group mate Seungkwan, a member of the vocal unit and subunit BSS, to jump in to clarify. “We've never taken it physically or hit each other,” the 27-year-old explains.

	











	Adds Mingyu, “Scars have to be made and healed, made and healed.”


	“There isn't an age gap [anymore],” Joshua, a member of the vocal unit and an L.A. native, says. And, adds Seungkwan, “Even though it was [Pledis] that brought us together, we're now almost like family.”


	Nearly all the members of Seventeen were teenagers when they debuted. As positive as they are, they acknowledge the difficulties of growing up in the public eye. “We've been doing this since we were teenagers, so we don't know a life of being unknown throughout our 20s,” says Vernon, a member of the rap unit who was born in New York before moving to Korea at a young age. The fully bilingual 27-year-old regularly intervenes to clarify a translation for his group members, Hoshi and DK, and even stops the conversation briefly to praise the translator on how skilled she is. 


	Vernon says the unrelenting spotlight has made the group more “reserved,” a word that feels at odds with Vernon's current punk-inspired look but in keeping with his pensive personality. “I know I had a hard time trying to understand myself in this process, and I'm sure the members did as well,” he says.


	Vernon considers every question carefully before answering, weighing his words. Which is why it's so much more meaningful when he expresses the reality of stardom's occasionally choreographed nature: “Actually, being restricted of free speech in a way, it does kind of block our process of trying to understand ourselves, so I guess that was the hardest part.”

	











	Nearly all the members of the group must complete their 18-month-minimum military service in the coming years. The exceptions are Joshua (a U.S. citizen), The 8 and Jun (Chinese citizens), and S.Coups, exempt because of an ACL injury. “We are doing our best to adapt to it,” DK says of the changing dynamics as members begin to enlist. Adds Hoshi: “This is something that has been inevitable for us all along. We have been prepared. We have a lot of projects that we have discussed with the company very thoroughly up until now.”


	Woozi and S.Coups are optimistic about the group's future. “We understand that the fans are very sad that some of us are going to be away, but among ourselves, [we] don't consider this to be a really huge deal because we know that we are going to stay together,” Woozi says. “We should consider this as quite a long preparation phase for the next album that's going to be even better and greater.”


	But, on the flip side, says S.Coups, “I think this can be a great opportunity for the members who are still remaining; [they] can stick together and make something great to showcase to the fans. It can also be a great time for members who have been mentally or physically exhausted to recharge themselves.”


	Seventeen seemingly thrives under high-stress conditions in part because of their focus on mental and physical health. When this subject is broached, S.Coups, Dino and Joshua excitedly point to their bandmate The 8 as their expert of wellness. “I do a lot of rehabilitation. I hit the gym very often [and] receive personal training,” says The 8. “For my mental health, I do a lot of meditation, and each member has their own way of relieving stress,” adds the 27-year-old.

	











	“On my off days, I try to not think about work at all and just stay at home and relax,” DK explains of his routine.


	Adds Joshua: “We also have a lot of hobbies that we try to find to recharge. Mentally, we also do counseling, too, to help us out,” noting that the bandmates have always been given the resources to consult a professional when they're having a hard time.


	When asked how Pledis can ensure the safety and sanity of young performers, Han says the company has consistently offered aid to its artists when they need it. “We are committed to supporting our artists so they can grow into healthy, well-rounded individuals, both physically and emotionally,” he notes, adding that Hybe operates in-house clinics for all artists and trainees.


	While Western music markets still haven't fully figured out how K-pop acts fit into the overall landscape — which leads to groups like Seventeen arguably not getting the same recognition as other acts with similarly stratospheric sales and impact — the band remains unfazed. “We try not to dwell on those things because [the] people who would recognize us [will] recognize us at some point. At the end of the day, all we have to do is just try our best,” Woozi says. “What we're trying to do is just tell our own personal story for the people who are listening and the people who love us.”


	The reflective Vernon echoes that sentiment. “Honestly, I don't really care if everyone understands it or not because we're just happy and extremely grateful to be where we are right now,” he says.

	











	Adds Woozi: “Rather than arguing with people who don't like us and asking why they're not liking us, I think we should just focus on our thing and run our own race. People have their own preferences and their own taste, and you just have to leave it up to them. There's no reason asking them why they like a certain person — that's too immature.”

Also starring Ben Wang and Joshua Jackson, the sixth film in the series centers on a kung fu prodigy who enters a high-stakes martial arts competition to help a new friend.


							By 

	Frank Scheck



	Take a dose of the original Karate Kid tetralogy, add some elements from the 2010 remake, finish it off with a soupçon of the Netflix series Cobra Kai, and you have the Frankenstein's monster of a franchise continuation that is Karate Kid: Legends. While no one could begrudge the seemingly ageless Ralph Macchio and beloved action star Jackie Chan the opportunity to reprise their roles of Daniel LaRusso and Mr. Han, respectively, this latest addition to an apparently unkillable franchise adds nothing original to the formula. It's a formula that works, to be sure, making for a pleasant enough time filler. But that's about it.

	With Daniel and Mr. Han relegated to the outskirts of the story for long stretches before the final act, the Jonathan Entwistle-directed film mainly revolves around Li Fong (a very appealing Ben Wang, American Born Chinese), a young kung fu prodigy still traumatized by seeing his beloved older brother murdered right in front of him. His mother (Ming-Na Wen), a doctor, doesn't approve of his continuing to study martial arts under the guidance of his teacher Mr. Han. When she suddenly decides to move with Li to New York City for a new job, she gives him one rule: “No fighting.”

The Bottom Line

	
	New kid, same old formula.
	



Release date: Friday, May 30Cast: Jackie Chan, Ralph Macchio, Ben Wang, Joshua Jackson, Sadie Stanley, Ming-Na Wen, Aramis Knight, Wyatt OleffDirector: Jonathan EntwistleScreenwriter: Rob Lieber

									Rated PG-13,
								1 hour 34 minutes			






	It's not hard to guess that rule is going to be broken quickly. Shortly after arriving in town, Li strikes up a budding romance with Mia (Sadie Stanley), the daughter of the owner of a pizza shop around the corner. This doesn't sit well with Mia's very jealous ex-boyfriend Connor (Aramis Knight, oozing villainy as if to the Karate Kid manor born), who gives Li a black eye with a vicious sucker punch.


	But that's not the only thing forcing Li to break his mother's decree. Mia's father Victor (Joshua Jackson, coming off like he prepared for his role by watching old Bowery Boys movies), a former championship boxer, is in serious hock to the sensei at the martial arts academy where Connor trains. When a trio of thugs show up to violently collect, Li reveals his skills by fighting them off. This impresses Victor so much that he decides the only way he can pay off his debt is to return to the ring, with Li as his unlikely trainer.

	











	Yes, the karate kid is now the teacher, at least for a while — cuing the inevitable quirky training montage with Li putting Victor through his paces in what are apparently the least crowded subway cars in all of New York City.


	When Victor's opponent cheats and nearly kills him in the ring (it's a given that all of the opponents in this series are dastardly), Li decides that the only way he can help him pay off his debt is to enter a citywide tournament with a $50,000 cash prize. This is when Mr. Han shows up out of the blue to train Li. Except that since his specialty is kung fu, not karate, he takes a detour to California and recruits Daniel to help, using their mutual friendship with the late Mr. Miyagi as inducement. Cue the second quirky training montage, much of it taking place on a rooftop garden with a view of the Chrysler Building, with the two Karate Kid veterans putting Li through such exercises as (in a nod to the 1984 original) “jacket on, jacket off.”


	It's a lot for a movie coming in at 94 minutes, including credits. And the plot is just awful, crammed with so many cliches that you're barely done chuckling at one before another kicks you in the head. By the time the film reaches its climactic bout in yet another open-air rooftop with an even more impressive skyline view (thankfully, it never rains in New York City), the goodwill generated by the performers has long since worn off.


	True to its title, Karate Kid: Legends dutifully pays homage to its predecessors, even starting off with a clip from 1986's The Karate Kid Part II featuring a young Macchio and Pat Morita. There are numerous callbacks to past installments, and the end credits feature a cameo by one more franchise veteran. At one point, Daniel comments of his late mentor, “Every time I have a chance to pass on a piece of his legacy, it's never the wrong choice.” The studio executives who greenlit this project would certainly agree.

This marks the first revival of the 1988 Broadway musical with music by ABBA's Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.

Business Writer


Lea Michele, Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher will star in a Broadway revival of Chess this fall. 


	The revival of the musical, which features music by ABBA's Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus and Tim Rice, will feature a new book by Dopesick creator Danny Strong. Michael Mayer, who also directed Michele in Spring Awakening and Funny Girl, will direct the production. 




	The revival will take place at a Shubert theater, with the exact dates and theater to be announced at a later date.

	The production marks the first Broadway revival of the musical, which opened on Broadway in 1988 after debuting in 1986 in the West End. The show describes itself as a chess tournament between an American and Soviet chess player, as the two also fight over the woman torn between them.

	While the West End show ran for three years, the book of the show was significantly altered when Chess came to Broadway, where the production ran for only two months. Rice wrote the book for the London production, while playwright Richard Nelson wrote the revised book for Broadway. Since then, the score has developed a cult following and subsequent productions, which have continued to adapt the book. 


	Lorin Latarro, who choreographed Waitress on Broadway, will choreograph the production. 


	Michele returns to Broadway after stepping in as Fanny Brice in Funny Girl on Broadway in September 2022 and remaining in the role for one year. The Glee star also originated the role of Wendla in Spring Awakening. 

	











	Tveit won a Tony Award for his leading role in Moulin Rouge and appeared in the most recently revival of Sweeney Todd opposite Sutton Foster, in addition to starring in Catch Me If You Can, in the role of Frank Abagnale Jr., and also originating the role of Gabe in Next To Normal. 


	Christopher has played George Washington in the Broadway production of Hamilton, Seymour in Little Shop of Horrors Off-Broadway and Pirelli in the most recent revival of Sweeney Todd, among other roles. 


Chess is being produced on Broadway by Tom Hulce, Robert Ahrens and The Shubert Organization along with Creative Partners Productions

The maestro of monsters is returning to Toronto to analyze the mechanics and emotional impact of iconic genre pics by David Cronenberg, John Fawcett and Vincenzo Natali for TIFF Cinematheque in July. 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Guillermo del Toro's film school will be back in session in Toronto this summer when the Oscar-winning director hosts a lecture series on Canadian horror movies at TIFF Lightbox. 


	The July 9 to 13 curated showcase for TIFF Cinematheque, entitled From Rabid to Skinamarink: Canadian Movie Madness, will see the maestro of monsters take audiences through a series of iconic genre pics like David Cronenberg's sophomore feature Rabid (1977), Vincenzo Natali's Cube (1997) and John Fawcett's supernatural fright pic Ginger Snaps starring Katharine Isabelle (2000) to reveal and explain their horror genre beats.

	The Mexican director will also explain the mechanics of Bruce McDonald's Pontypool (2008), and Kyle Edward Ball's feature directorial debut, Skinamarink (2022) for their own visual and emotional impacts on audiences.


	Del Toro has made Toronto a second home after Los Angeles. And the Canadian city has hosted production for a number of his movies, including Mimic, the Oscar-winning The Shape of Water, Crimson Peak, Pacific Rim, Nightmare Alley and more recently the Netflix adaptation of Frankenstein. His TV series The Strain was also shot locally. 


	That proximity has allowed del Toro to develop a close association with the Toronto International Film Festival and its year-round headquarters, TIFF Lightbox. His master classes on filmmaking techniques often coincide with production on his latest movie projects in Toronto. And del Toro has hosted an earlier lecture series at TIFF Lightbox on Mexican cinema, Alfred Hitchcock films and film noir pics.


	The prolific director's creative ties to Toronto also includes key positions in his locally-shot movies, besides himself as director and Hollywood leads, being filled by Canadians down to longtime producer and collaborator J. Miles Dale, the production designer, costume designer, editors and other technical posts.   

	











	TIFF Lightbox and del Toro have also partnered on a free, upcoming outdoor screening of The Shape of Water as part of the film festival's 50th anniversary this summer.

The pickup makes the comedy Max's longest-running live-action series. 


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


Hacks is entering the record books at Max.


	The streamer has renewed the series for a fifth season, which will make Hacks the longest-running live-action show in Max's (admittedly not very long) history. Series creators and showrunnners Paul W. Downs, Lucia Aniello and Jen Statsky announced the renewal Tuesday evening at an Emmy FYC screening in Los Angeles. 




	The pickup for the Emmy-winning comedy from Universal Television comes two days before its fourth season finale. The current season has seen Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) realize her dream of hosting a late-night talk show — though with more strings attached than she would like — with Ava Daniels (Hannah Einbinder) as her head writer.

Hacks premiered in May 2021, when the streaming service where it runs was known as HBO Max. It has continued since the platform changed its name to Max in April 2023 — and with the renewal, season five will stream on the re-renamed HBO Max. (Depending on when in the summer Warner Bros. Discovery pulls the trigger on the name change, And Just Like That and Peacemaker could also become HBO Max-Max-HBO Max originals, though neither has run as long as Hacks.) 


	“Yes! More! We congratulate Hacks' singularly talented cast and crew and our great partners at Universal Television,” said Sarah Aubrey, head of original programming at Max.


	Added Universal TV president Erin Underhill, “Like Deborah Vance herself, Hacks only gets bolder, sharper, and more iconic with time. We're beyond thrilled to keep the laughter rolling with Jen, Paul, Lucia, our extraordinary cast and crew, and our partners at Max.”

	











	Along with Smart and Einbinder, Hacks stars Downs, Megan Stalter, Carl Clemons-Hopkins, Mark Indelicato and Rose Abdoo. Recurring actors Dan Bucatinsky, Helen Hunt, Tony Goldwyn, Kaitlin Olson, Jane Adams, Lauren Weedman, Christopher McDonald, Poppy Liu, Lorenza Izzo, Johnny Sibilly, Paul Felder, Polly Draper, Luenell and Aristotle Athari reprised their roles in season four, joined by series newcomers Julianne Nicholson, Michaela Watkins, Bresha Webb, Robby Hoffman, Eric Balfour, Danny Jolles, Gavin Matts, Grover Whitmore, III, Holmes, Jasmine Ashanti, Katy Sullivan, Matt Oberg, Sandy Honig and Jake Shane. 


	Downs and Aniello executive produce via their Paulilu company, and Statsky exec produces through her First Thought Productions. Michael Schur of Fremulon, David Miner of 3 Arts, Morgan Sackett and Joe Mande also executive produce.

ATEEZ, J-Hope and other touring acts brought K-pop to an unprecedented midyear showing. 


													By
												

	Eric Frankenberg



	On Wednesday (May 28), Billboard revealed its midyear Boxscore charts, celebrating the top-grossing and best-selling artists, venues, and concert promoters around the world between Oct. 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025. Amid the pop, rock, R&B and Latin acts that blanket the Top Tours ranking, an unprecedented string of K-pop artists are in the mix, with five such acts among the all-genre top 50.


SEVENTEEN leads the pack, as it did for K-pop on midyear recaps for 2024 and 2023. But after grossing $30 million on the 2023 list, and $67.5 million for 2024, the group is No. 3 on the overall tally with $120.9 million and 842,000 tickets sold, according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore. The group is sandwiched between Shakira at No. 2 ($130 million) and Eagles at No. 4 ($112.2 million).


	SEVENTEEN is the highest-ranking Korean act ever on the all-genre midyear list, surpassing BTS' No. 4 rank in 2022. BTS did manage a matching No. 3 rank on 2019's year-end tally, but hadn't played enough shows in the first half of that chart year to appear on the midyear chart.


	Not only has K-pop's top artist essentially doubled its midyear gross for the second consecutive year, but the bench is deepening. This year's all-genre top 50 includes five K-pop acts, up from three in 2023 and 2024, and two in 2022. The threshold for K-pop's top five is $25.1 million at the midyear point – this time last year, it was $3.1 million.


	After SEVENTEEN, ATEEZ and J-Hope are next at Nos. 2-3 on Top Tours by Genre (K-pop), each with earnings of more than $28 million. The latter is the first K-pop soloist to make the midyear overall Top Tours chart, though he previously was included with his fellow BTS bandmates. ENHYPEN and TOMORROW X TOGETHER round out the list, also within a couple percentage points of one another above the $25 million mark.


	These four groups and one soloist made their millions while proving the international strength of Korean artists. During the six-month tracking period, they toured arenas and stadiums throughout Asia (SEVENTEEN, J-Hope, ENHYPEN and TOMORROW X TOGETHER), Europe (ATEEZ and TOMORROW X TOGETHER), Mexico (J-Hope) and the U.S. (SEVENTEEN and J-Hope).


	Altogether, K-pop acts on the midyear Top Tours chart brought in a collective $228 million and sold 1.6 million tickets from 78 shows. That marks a 79% increase over the genre's 2024 showing, which itself was a 93% jump from 2023. In just two years, K-pop has more than tripled its presence on the midyear chart.


	Scroll down for details on the top five K-pop acts on Billboard's midyear Boxscore report. The midyear tracking period covers all reported shows, worldwide, between Oct. 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025.

The label's rock roster includes Badflower, Daughtry and Sammy Hagar.

	Melinda Newman



Gebbia Media has acquired Big Machine Rock from HYBE America for an undisclosed price in an effort to move into the rock space.


	Big Machine Rock has been part of Big Machine Label Group (BMLG), which was founded by CEO Scott Borchetta in 2005. SB Projects bought BMLG in 2019 and, in 2021, HYBE bought Ithaca Holdings, which included SB Projects and BMLG for $1.05 billion.  


	Big Machine Rock's current roster includes Daughtry, Badflower, Sammy Hagar and Ryan Perdz. Since its move into rock in 2017, BMLG has placed hits across Billboard's rock charts, including Mainstream Rock Airplay and Alternative Airplay, with past and present acts like Badflower, Cheap Trick, Daughtry, Friday Pilots Club, Ayron Jones, L.A. Rats, Motley Crue, Pretty Vicious, Starcrawler and The Struts.


	“Growing up with incredible music by iconic artists like Sammy Hagar, Van Halen and The Doors, I recognize the importance of bringing rock to a new generation of listeners and fans who are ready to embrace it,” said David Gebbia, CEO of Gebbia Media, in a statement. “Big Machine Rock embodies the Gebbia Media approach: bold, cross-generational, and deeply in touch with the culture. This acquisition allows us to further our mission of empowering artists through investment in robust catalogs and cross-platform expansion.” 


	The move is also expected to expand Big Machine Rock's global reach.

Heather Luke-Husong will continue to serve as GM of the Nashville-based imprint. 


	“Gebbia Media's investment will allow Big Machine Rock to grow into a full-fledged label completely focused on rock,” says Borchetta, who is also chairman of labels for HYBE America. “They will continue to be distributed through our family of labels and will stay connected to the Big Machine mothership.”


	Gebbia Media is a subsidiary of Siebert Financial Corp. 


	“By bringing Big Machine Rock into the Gebbia Media portfolio, we're aligning visionary talent with the resources and stability of a diversified financial platform, ensuring long-term growth and cultural impact,” said John J Gebbia, CEO of Siebert Financial.


	In the music space, Siebert has also formed partnerships with Larry Jackson's GAMMA and L.A. Reid LLC for the female trio SIMIEN, building on Gebbia Media's alliance with artist and entrepreneur Akon.


	As part of the agreement, Borchetta will join the advisory board of Siebert Financial.

As Teddy Swims' ""Lose Control"" sets a new record for Hot 100 longevity, other smashes have also enjoyed seemingly endless chart runs. What's behind these mega-hits?


													By
												

	Jason Lipshutz


Editor


	Teddy Swims makes history on this week's Hot 100: “Lose Control,” the singer-songwriter's soulful pop-rock anthem, spends its 92nd week on the chart, breaking the record that it shared with Glass Animals' “Heat Waves” as of last week and setting the new longevity mark for the nearly 68-year-old song chart.

	After debuting on the Hot 100 back in August 2023, “Lose Control” only topped the chart for 1 week, back in March 2024. Yet the song remains in the top 20 more than a year later (coming in at No. 11 on the latest chart), after spending a record-setting 63 weeks in the top 10.

	“The burn has been minimal,” Alex Tear, Vice President of music programming at SiriusXM + Pandora, tells Billboard of the breakthrough hit's maintained momentum. “The audience reaction is something that we completely adhere to — subscribers tell us what they want to hear, and how often they want to hear it… And [‘Lose Control'] is still undeniable, pure mass appeal.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Swims' smash hasn't been alone in spending months upon months in the Hot 100's upper tier. Before Morgan Wallen's new album I'm the Problem cleared out a sizable chunk of the chart this week with its 29 new debuts, the top half of the Hot 100 was littered with hits that had spent months — and in some cases, over a year — on the tally.


	Some of them, like “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” by Shaboozey, “Die With a Smile” by Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars and “I Had Some Help” by Post Malone and Wallen, have stuck around after logging multiple weeks at No. 1; others, like Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things,” Gigi Perez's “Sailor Song” and Sabrina Carpenter's “Espresso,” never reached the top spot, but have lingered near it since mid-2024. Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” may have just spent 13 straight weeks atop the Hot 100 before being dethroned by Wallen and Tate McRae's “What I Want” this week, but even that smash collaboration spent 12 weeks on the chart before reaching its peak in late February.


	The Hot 100 always includes a wide swath of ubiquitous hits — but rarely have so many of those hits endured at once. On the Hot 100 dated May 24, zero songs in the top 10 had spent a single-digit number of weeks on the chart. The average number of weeks spent on the chart by the songs in the top 20 was 30.35 weeks; five years ago (on the Hot 100 dated May 30, 2020), that average was 18.75 weeks. On the recent Hot 100, a total of nine songs in the top 20 had spent 30 weeks or more on the chart; 10 years ago (on the Hot 100 dated May 30, 2015), that total was one song in the top 20.


	What's causing this period of smashes that last forever on the chart? Part of the explanation for the lack of 2025 chart movement is the glut of new pop voices from 2024 spilling over into a new year, says Spotify editorial lead Talia Kraines. “I think that 2024 was such a crazy year for pop music, and incredible new songs and artists, that was years in the making,” she says.

	











	Kraines points to artists like Chappell Roan, whose “Pink Pony Club” is approaching 50 weeks on the Hot 100, and Charli XCX, whose 2020 song “party 4 u” is just now hitting the chart, who helped define the mainstream last year while also boasting ample back catalogs for fans to explore on streaming services. “They were fully formed propositions,” says Kraines. “I feel like a whole new generation found their new favorite artist and their new favorite song, and they're digging in on that.”


	Chart longevity may also be a product of post-pandemic timing, says Michael Martin, SVP of programming at Audacy. After all, before “Lose Control” logged 92 weeks on the chart, The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” and Glass Animals' “Heat Waves” were quarantine-era anthems that previously set the record in April 2021 and October 2022, respectively.


	The fact that the record has been reset three times in the past five years nods to how the lifespan of a mega-hit changed to account for audience appetites. “Everybody wanted comfort food, right?” says Martin of pandemic-era pop. “People wanted things they knew, like their favorite TV show that they binge-watched again. There's something about that familiar song that they loved and wanted to keep hearing.”


	Yet Kraines points out that the key difference between the music industry of five years ago and the industry today is how viral hits are located and promoted by labels to set up longer chart runs. At the dawn of the TikTok era, unknown artists with a viral spark were quickly signed and pushed to radio programmers and streaming services; now, artists like Swims (who was signed to Warner Records in late 2019 after some YouTube covers made noise) are often developed for years before a single receives mainstream promotion.

	











	“We're seeing that the whole nature of artist development takes time,” says Kraines. “And songs that maybe don't come out of the gate super hot are definitely growing.” Case in point: “Lose Control” debuted at No. 99 on the Hot 100, then spent a record 32 weeks climbing to the top of the chart. “People are taking more time to sit with music and enjoy it — they're not just one-and-done,” adds Kraines.


	Meanwhile, the streaming era has included less distinction between singles being actively promoted by artists and album cuts that have no shot at extended chart runs. Last year, Billie Eilish launched her Hit Me Hard and Soft era with “Lunch” as the focus track, but quickly pivoted when fans embraced “Birds of a Feather” on streaming services. Demand for “Feather” has remained strong across platforms since its release — so radio programmers kept playing it, streaming services kept it high on their flagship playlists, and the song just crossed the one-year mark on the Hot 100.


	One key to that type of extended run, says Tear, is the smart deployment of follow-up singles — songs from a popular artist that prevent listeners from getting tired of their mega-hit, but don't necessarily get in its way, either. A generation ago, radio stations couldn't feature multiple songs by the same artist in heavy rotation, but now that streaming has blurred those lines, programmers can balance a handful of songs by the same artist and ultimately extend the life of a smash.


	“The audience wants to hear more than one song being played over and over again,” Tear explains. “I'm now able to go two, three, four songs deep [per artist], like we do with Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone and Teddy Swims. That relieves a little bit of the fatigue, and they stay around longer.”

	











	Paradoxically, the fragmentation of popular music — and how the streaming era has affected the number of songs that reach cultural ubiquity — may be the reason why we now have so many smash hits that stick around forever. Veteran radio programmer and consultant Guy Zapoleon has spent his career chronicling 10-year music cycles of popular radio, and says that modern “lack of consensus” caused by the proliferation of music platforms means that, when a song does become huge, it stays huge for longer.


	“Because there's so many different sources to go to, it's difficult for songs outside the very biggest songs to become hits,” says Zapoleon. “And because of that, those songs take a while to become hits, and then they stay there for the longest period of time —  longer than we've ever seen in the history of music.”


	The good news is that this industry era of extended chart runs emphasizes hit songs regardless of who they're coming from. While A-listers like Kendrick Lamar, SZA and Morgan Wallen have topped the Hot 100 in recent months, the top 10 has been rife with new artists scoring their first chart hits in 2025, just as it was last year.


	“You can keep delivering listeners songs like ‘Lose Control' that they're just not tired of, but you can also deliver the new artists that they're asking about — Doechii, Sombr, Alex Warren, Lola Young, Ravyn Lenae,” Martin points out. “So I don't think there's stagnation in new product, or in new artists.”

	Hosted by TikTok for Miley's superfans, the superstar personally invited those in the room. And while they knew they would be among the first to hear her new album – the event was billed as a listening session – what they didn't know was that Miley would be performing songs old and new.

	After singing along to already-released tracks including “Something Beautiful,” “End of the World,” “More to Lose” and the much-teased “Easy Lover,” Something Beautiful‘s remaining six songs (not including interludes) earned a variety of first takes. “This is a long one,” said one fan of “Golden Burning Sun.” And of “Pretend You're God” another said it was reminiscent of “Midnight Sky,” while another questioned if they heard saxophone, though their friend was too busy dancing to answer. Second to last track “Reborn” sounds like it could have existed on Lady Gaga's Mayhem in another form and closing track “Give Me Love” caused a hush to fall over the crowd. “No skips,” said one fan over applause. 


	As the room started to realize the album was over, heads slowly craned to the back entrance. “Is she coming?” whispered one fan, wondering if Miley would show. And at promptly 6:59 p.m., she did.

	Joined by drummer Maxx Morando, guitarist Jonathan Rado and pianist Michael Pollack – all of whom co-wrote and or co-produced on the album – Cyrus opened with the ballad “More to Lose.” She then addressed the intimate room: “Playing these nights at Chateau, they were invite-only, super exclusive, just my closest friends and my family and this was the way I discovered the album. Because if it can't stand up with me [and my band], then what are we even doing?” 


	“Because for me, I love making music with everybody on this carpet – I don't do stages now,” she continued with a laugh. “Watching [the album] become this butterfly and have this metamorphosis and evolution, it's so reflective of my life and everything I'm experiencing.”


	Cyrus and her band then delivered the sultry “Easy Lover” followed by her Hot 100 No. 1 smash “Flowers” (“this has been one of the most exciting songs I have gotten to put out into the universe,” she said). And while starting to speak of her journey over the past two decades with her fans, she cautioned, “I'm not singing ‘The Climb,' but I could…'” – and thankfully, Pollack took that as a green light to begin playing the song on keys. More thankfully, Miley took the bait and soared through a portion of the beloved hit. She then closed her 45-minute set with “End of the World.”


	“We really did grow up together,” Miley said. “As we grow, there's things we gain and things we leave behind – and I've never wanted that to be you.”


	She then teased that Something Beautiful is “just the appetizer,” revealing, “My next album is about to be extremely experimental, so have fun with that.”

	











	As Brandi said earlier of her sister, “her evolution is always a surprise…I have personally seen the passion and precision she pours into every detail … it's why everything she does is so sickening.” 


	“Thank you for being here with our family and close friends in this amazing, special place,” Brandi concluded. 


	And for longtime Miley fans, it's not only a special place but a sacred one, too. As Miley mentioned, we've all seen the clips online of her performing at the Chateau for a chosen few as she pieced her album together. But tonight, it was her biggest fans who were the chosen ones — and it really was something beautiful.

The long-running venue currently known as the Axis Club will be rebranding under its original name, The Mod Club, christened with a special concert from Daniel Caesar on June 14 as part of Billboard Canada The Stage at NXNE.

Inside the Mod Club

A classic venue is returning to Toronto.

The Axis Club in Toronto will be changing its name back to The Mod Club. The local venue was originally known as The Mod Club Theatre until 2020. It closed and reopened the following year with new management and a new name, The Axis Club.

Now owned by Live Nation, the venue is returning to its classic name. 

The Mod Club became a Toronto staple as a smaller-sized venue that hosted internationally renowned artists, iconic acts in their early days and acoustic performances from household names. Toronto singers The Weeknd and Daniel Caesar played pivotal early shows at the 600-capacity venue before going on to achieve international access and headlining arenas.

The Mod Club's revival will be commemorated with an intimate concert from Daniel Caesar on June 14 as part of Billboard Canada The Stage at NXNE.

“I'm really glad to be coming back to The Mod Club to play after all these years,” says Caesar. “That place will always have a special place in my heart.”

The Mod Club began in the early 2000s, first as a series of popular parties inspired by 1960s British ""mod"" culture by Bobbi Guy and Platinum Blonde frontman Mark Holmes. It found its permanent home at 722 College Street in Toronto's Little Italy in 2002, and grew into an institution hosting legendary club nights and shows by artists like Amy Winehouse, The Killers, Sia and many more. 

“We are excited to be a part of The Mod Club's return to Toronto and solidifying its long-term future as a key part of Toronto's music scene,” says longtime owner Manuel DaCosta. “We look forward to welcoming fans as we usher in an exciting new era for the venue.”

DaCosta partnered with Live Nation in 2023 to help elevate the venue and has been involved throughout its evolution. The new era will include a fresh lineup of concerts and events, with an aim to recapture the spirit that defined The Mod Club shows during the theatre's original run.

""What I Want"" debuts at No. 2 on the Canadian Hot 100, keeping ""Greedy"" as her sole No. 1 in her home country. Wallen occupies 37 spots on this week's chart following the release of his new album.

Tate McRae's new collaboration with Morgan Wallen is a hit on the charts.

Their song ""What I Want"" has debuted at No. 2 on the Canadian Hot 100 on this week's chart dated May 31. While it enters just shy of the top spot, still behind Alex Warren's ""Ordinary"" in Canada, it debuts at No. 1 on the U.S. Hot 100, becoming McRae's first-ever No. 1 on the American chart.

The ""Tennessee Orange"" singer faced backlash for saying that the Carter family ""invented"" country music.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Shaboozey is coming to Megan Moroney‘s defense after a remark she made during the duo's American Music Awards presentation landed her in hot water with some viewers Monday (May 26).


	In a comment on the “Tennessee Orange” singer's latest Instagram post Tuesday (May 27), ‘Boozey spoke out against the “hateful comments” Moroney has been receiving since the ceremony and called her “an incredibly talented, hard-working artist who's doing amazing things for country music.” 


	His response comes a day after the pair presented favorite country duo/group to Dan + Shay at the 2025 AMAs, during which Moroney read off the teleprompter that the very first act to win the prize had been the Carter family, “who basically invented country music.” (The Carter family is comprised of A.P Carter, Sara Dougherty Carter and Maybelle Addington Carter, according to the Country Music Hall of Fame, which also refers to them as “The First Family of Country Music.”) 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	In that moment, the “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” singer seemingly gave Moroney a side-eye, with some viewers interpreting his expression as a silent disagreement or protest. Since the show, many people online have pointed out that Black musicians pioneered the genre and, despite being all-too-frequently excluded from history, influenced several of country's earliest superstars — though some of that discussion has manifested in vitriolic comments on the “Am I Okay?” artist's profile. 

	











	But in his reply on Moroney's post, Shaboozey clarified that his reaction “had nothing to do with” his partner on the AMAs stage. “I've got nothing but respect for her,” he continued. “I've seen some hateful comments directed at her today, and that's not what this moment was about.” 


	“Let's not twist the message,” added the Virginia native. “She is amazing and someone who represents the country community in the highest light!”


	Both ‘Boozey and Moroney had big years in 2024, with the former tying Lil Nas X's record for longest-running No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 after “A Bar Song” clocked its 19th week in the top spot, and the latter earning her first-ever top 10 album on the Billboard 200 with Am I Okay? reaching No. 9 on the chart. But Shaboozey's success has been particularly meaningful in a genre that has historically struggled to recognize Black artists, even in modern times.


	Shortly before commenting on Moroney's post, the “Good News” musician refocused the conversation on what's important following the AMAs. “When you uncover the true history of country music, you find a story so powerful that it cannot be erased …,” he wrote Tuesday morning on X. 


	He added, “The real history of country music is about people coming together despite their differences, and embracing and celebrating the things that make us alike.”


The American Music Awards are produced by Dick Clark Productions, which is owned by Penske Media Eldridge, a joint venture between Eldridge Industries and Billboard parent company Penske Media.

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Olivia Cooke is set to star in the Neon thriller Brides from Watcher director Chloe Okuno, who will direct from a script she wrote. The pic will be produced by Anthony Bregman and Stefanie Azpiazu through Likely Story. Neon will release Brides theatrically.


	The film follows Sally Bishop (Cooke) and her husband, who travel to a remote Italian villa whose owner, a mysterious count, takes a peculiar interest in Sally. Cooke steps in for Maika Monroe, who had scheduling issues with her Universal film Reminders of Him. 


	As a filmmaker, Okuno's feature debut was the psychological thriller Watcher, starring Monroe and Burn Gorman, which premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival and went on to play several other festivals. Drawn to genre-based material that aims to excite and unsettle, her other works include writing and directing the award-winning horror short Slut and the “Storm Drain” segment of the anthology series V/H/S/94, as well as directing episodes from Showtime's Let the Right One In and the James Wan-produced series Teacup.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Best known for her roles in Ready Player One and Me, Earl and The Dying Girl, Cooke is coming off the second season of HBO's Game of Thrones prequel series House of the Dragon. She recently wrapped production on the Amazon series The Girlfriend opposite Robin Wright.


	She is repped by CAA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners and The Artists Partnership.


	In Cannes last week, Neon earned its sixth consecutive Palme d'Or win with Jafar Panahi's It Was Just an Accident, which the company acquired at the festival, and won a total of six awards across all films including Grand Prix for Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value. Also in Cannes, Neon debuted Julia Ducournau's Alpha, Raoul Peck's Orwell: 2+2=5, and Michael Angelo Covino's Splitsville starring Dakota Johnson and Adria Arjona, which Neon also produced. The company acquired North American rights to Sirât from Oliver Laxe; The Secret Agent from writer-director Kleber Mendonça Filho; and Ugo Bienvenu's animated feature Arco with Natalie Portman.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	The summer box office just got a lot deeper.


	Following the biggest Memorial Day weekend of all time with an updated near $330 million haul last week per Comscore, the theatrical release schedule now has a rhythm with something for everyone, at least for a while. Definitely through Labor Day weekend, at least, with New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites. Gearing up business even more is the fact that 45% of K-12 schools are out for good this summer starting Friday.


	The big new event film going this frame is Sony's Karate Kid: Legends, which was made for a thrifty net $45M before P&A and is a complete homage to the Karate Kid of yore, the new Jackie Chan paradigm and the Cobra Kai fandom. It's expected to do $25M-$30M at 3,600 locations, including a share of PLF screens, and even though it's impossible for Ralph Macchio's Daniel-son and Chan's Mr. Han to kick Disney's Lilo & Stitch to the mat, that's a great second- or third-place haul for exhibitors this weekend. Previews start Thursday at 2 p.m. The review embargo that lifted at the time of this post hasn't registered on Rotten Tomatoes.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







The Karate Kid is a 41-year old film franchise counting five previous movies. The 2010 reboot with Chan and Jaden Smith owns the franchise's record opening with $55.7M. It's also the series' highest-grossing title at the box office, with $176.6M domestic and $359M worldwide.


	Meanwhile, Lilo & Stitch is looking at a second frame of $60M, off 59%, which is in the vicinity of previous Disney Memorial Day live-action takes of classic toons Aladdin (-53%) and Little Mermaid (57%). We're getting word that Tuesday was fantastic; at the time of this post, we're still waiting on those numbers. The final four-day total on Lilo & Stitch was $182.6M, still the best debut Memorial Day weekend has ever seen. If you have a great movie, Hollywood, people will break off from the barbeque.

	











	Paramount's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning will stay afloat with all those Imax screens, dipping an expected 50% for a second weekend of $32M. The eighth Tom Cruise Ethan Hunt movie finaled at $79M the four-day holiday box office.


	Also looking to break out is the follow-up film from Australian twin brothers Danny and Michael Philippou, Bring Her Back, at 89% fresh. I wouldn't underestimate this second film from the duo after their Sundance smash Talk to Me, which minted more than $48M stateside. Projections are $5M-$7M for this movie about foster teens (one of them visually impaired) in peril with a their new foster mom played by Sally Hawkins — who we all know from sweet natured roles ala The Shape of Water, but here, she's an amazing monster. A24 financed the movie and sold foreign rights to Sony.


Talk to Me ranks as A24's third-highest opening for a horror movie at $10.4M after Ari Aster's Hereditary ($13.5M) and the Hugh Grant's Heretic at $10.8M. One thing is for certain: This is a twisted movie, like you've never seen before.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


EXCLUSIVE: Is it just two mates sitting around watching the UEFA Champions League final on a summer Saturday, or is it Tom Cruise and David Beckham opening the gates of Paramount cross-promotion heaven?


	We may never truly know the answer to that grand puzzle, but we do know that after Cruise's Paramount-distributed Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning shattered franchise records in its Memorial Day opening weekend, the four-time Oscar nominee will be live onscreen with the former England captain and Inter Miami co-owner for Paramount+'s Beckham & Friends Live on Saturday to watch Paris Saint-Germain play Inter Milan.

	











	It will come just a few weeks after Cruise celebrated at Beckham's star-studded 50th birthday party in London, and represents a big get for Beckham's latest big step in front of the camera.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Put it this way, with Shari Redstone looking for a regulatory sign-off on the $8 billion sale of Paramount Global parent company National Amusements to David Ellison's Skydance, Saturday's UEFA final is the company's sports equivalent of putting all your golden eggs in one basket.


	With more famous friends also likely on the mainly unscripted deck, Cruise and Beckham will have CBS Sports' Kate Scott to keep the conversation going, as she has in the two previous Beckham & Friends Live shows. The livestream for the match is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. ET on Paramount+. A Beckham- and Cruise-less version of the game will air on CBS, as well as Paramount+.

	











	During the Champions League semifinals, Beckham — who does sponsorship and self-branding at the dizzying heights Cruise relentlessly markets his movies — was paired with Scott, director Guy Ritchie and Emmy winner Stanley Tucci on May 6. The result was more stilted than one would expect, or certainly than CBS Sports wanted. It surely is one reason why things kicked up for the show the next day with Scott, James Corden and The Handmaid's Tale alum Joseph Fiennes sitting with Beckham. To keep the patter more punchy, Arsenal legend Thierry Henry also swung by for a bit to watch PSG, one of Beckham's old clubs, eventually beat the Gunners.


	The May 31 final sees favorite PSG hoping to snag its first UCL win, while three-time winner Inter is as close to old hands at this as you can be at the top levels of European soccer.


	Paramount+ Presents Beckham & Friends Live is produced by CBS Sports' Pete Radovich with UEFA Champions League, Authentic Brands Group and Relevent Sports.

Country singer Alex Miller is mourning the tragic death of his band's drummer, Mark Laws. The season 19 “American Idol” alum paid tribute to his bandmate via social media on May 27, 2025, revealing how heartbroken he is over the musician's passing. 

“My heart is truly broken at the passing of my drummer Mark Laws,” Miller wrote on a post with multiple photos of Laws playing with his band. “My grandad once told me that you'll have lots of friends in your life, but finding a try friend is something that is rare and special. My grandad was a true friend, and so was Mark Laws. His loss to me is devastating. Please pray for his family for me. 🙏”

Miller did not share any details about Laws' death, but according to The Tennessean, Laws was shot on May 25 in Cumberland Gap — a mountain pass located near the point where Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia meet. 

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks told WRIL-FM that Laws' 25-year-old stepson, Maxwell Madon, has been arrested and charged with criminal homicide. According to Citizen Tribune, the shooting happened at a home where Madon lived with his grandparents. After Madon assaulted his grandfather, the outlet reported, Laws arrived to intervene but was shot in the process and pronounced dead at the scene. He was 62. 

Laws spent the last five years as drummer and band leader for Miller's touring band, per The Tennessean. But he was also beloved by other musicians he played with over the years, including Little Jimmy Dickens, Bill Carlilse, Larry Cordle and Pam Perry.

Kentucky singer Stephanie Bastin also paid tribute to Laws on Instagram, writing that she, too, was “so heartbroken at the loss of my dear friend Mark Laws.” 

Noting the many places where he'd played drums for her, Bastin shared, “Mark was a good dude. He was like family. Genuine. Good hearted. Prayers for all his friends, family, and bandmates. This is a huge loss for so many. Mark was currently the drummer for Alex Miller. 💔”

Miller's career took off right after he was on “American Idol” in 2021. The judges loved the 17-year-old's sound and charisma, but when Miller didn't heed their advice and try a non-country tune during Hollywood Week, he didn't make the Top 24 cut. 

Nevertheless, he'd already made a big impression viewers and on judge Luke Bryan, who later FaceTimed with Miller to invite him to perform at the Grand Ole Opry, a dream come true for the teen.

After the show, Miller quickly secured a management team and signed with Nashville-based Billy Jam Records, according to his website. He has since released three albums and is frequently on the road with his band, opening for a bevy of well-known country artists, including Drake Milligan and King Calaway. In the spring of 2025, he released a new single, “The Byrd,” featuring country legend Tracy Byrd. 

Miller's loss of his drummer isn't his band's first brush with tragedy. In February 2024, a car collided with his tour bus in Kentucky and the car's driver was killed. Miller was not injured in the crash, nor were his bandmates, according to a statement posted to his Instagram account. But they were all shaken up by the tragedy and will now need to come to grips with another tragedy one year later.

Two-and-a-half years after marrying rising country star Kylie Morgan, “The Voice” alum Jay Allen confirmed on May 27, 2025, that he and Morgan have decided to divorce. The season 22 contestant's social media announcement came two days after he celebrated one year of sobriety. 

“It's with peace in my heart that I feel it's time to share this,” he wrote in white text on a black background on Instagram and Facebook. “Kylie and I separated 6 months ago and made the decision to get divorced. I've been on a journey of sobriety, healing, growing, leaning into God, and I've moved on. I will always care for Kylie & wish her the best … GOD'S PLAN IS GREATER. *Proverbs 3:5-6”

Allen and Morgan married in late November 2022, weeks after he was eliminated from coach Blake Shelton's team on “The Voice” and two months after the couple's initial wedding date. Their nuptials were postponed due to Hurricane Ian, which “demolished” their wedding venue, Allen told Fox News.  

Even on their second attempt, they forgot their marriage license, Morgan told People at the time, and had to get remarried the next day with the document in hand. Nevertheless, they seemed over the moon about their union at the time. 

“I was the girl who swore she would never get married because I was already married to my dreams,” Morgan told the outet, noting that she took a week off from touring with John Rich to get married. “Being an independent woman pursuing her dreams, I always felt as if I had to apologize or dim my ambition for the sake of my relationships. With Jay, I never had to explain myself, apologize, or pull back from my goals.”

Fans grew curious about the couple's status, though, when the singers stopped posting about one another in late 2024. Meanwhile, a good friend of Morgan's, songwriter Sam DeRosa, took issue with Allen's one-sided divorce announcement. 

“Damn, dude,” she wrote in the comment section. “I always try to be neutral and stay out but this ain't it. You feel it's ‘time to share this' because it feels right for YOU, but you post this without her knowledge or consent, so she'll wake up to the chaos & the drama …but you will ‘always care' and ‘wish her the best' ? idk dude this feels a bit selfish to do with no heads up. I wish you peace but this really breaks my heart to see on the internet.”

At the time of publication, Morgan had not publicly commented on Allen's announcement, but she has been busy on the road in recent weeks, playing the Grand Ole Opry on May 9 and opening for Megan Maroney. 

When Allen competed on “The Voice,” he was initially on Gwen Stefani's team before her husband, Shelton, stole the country singer during the season 22 Battle rounds. However, Shelton later let him go during the Knockout rounds and acknowledged at the time fans were quite upset with him for doing so. 

Allen was a fan-favorite on the show who shared early on how he lost his mom to early-onset Alzheimer's when she was 54. Before his mom's 2018 death, Allen wrote his song “Blank Stares,” which went viral and has helped him raise significant funds for research, per the Alzheimer's Foundation. 

He has also been open about his sobriety journey, including sharing his one-year milestone on May 25, which he celebrated by getting baptized. 

“Today I celebrated 1 year of sobriety by publicly rededicating my life to Jesus,” the singer wrote. “It took every second of 365 days, but I can now finally look in the mirror and be proud of the man looking back at me. Thank you to every beautiful person who has had my back along the way, and thank you God for loving me and leading me through my darkest & loneliest days.”

Latin music singer Becky G shares she would “love to collaborate” with Sabrina Carpenter.

Becky G spoke with Entertainment Weekly at the American Music Awards and played a game of “Collab, Cover, or Concert?”. Her options for the three picks were Beyonce, Post Malone and Carpenter.

Needing a #SabrinaCarpenter and Becky G collab ASAP. Becky G plays a round of “Collab, Cover, or Concert?” 🎵 #Beyonce #PostMalone #AMAs @Sabrina Carpenter 

The “Mayores” singer shared she would want to be front row at Beyonce's concert and noted she is “the greatest show woman of all time, love her.” Becky G also said she would love to cover a song of Malone's as the cover would not be expected. Finally she shared she would love to collaborate with Carpenter.

Comments quickly flooded the comments section to share their excitement for a collaboration between the two singers.

“A Sabrina & Becky G collab is needed!!!” one fan wrote.

“Manifesting Becky x Sabrina collab,” another fan shared.

Although Rebbeca Marie Gomez, better known as Becky G, has various Spanish albums under her belt, the singer first got her foot in the door via her songs in English such as “Shower” and “Can't Stop Dancin'“.

Becky G's most recent musical release is the track “QUE HACES” along side the Latin music singer Manuel Turizo.

The two artists brought their new track and dance moves to the American Music Awards on Monday night as they performed the song.

Becky G and Turizo sang the  track's flirty lyrics at the award show. “Tell me what you're doing this Friday and the rest of your life/Because I don't have any plans.”

Becky G went home with the award for Favorite Female Latin Artist at the American Music Awards.

“I am so honored to be in this category and be one of your favorite Latina artists,” Becky G said on the stage as she accepted the award. “I want to dedicate this award to my Chicano community. Honestly, this award wouldn't be possible for those who came before us, and I know we share in our struggle as well as our wins. Los quiero mucho [I love you all so much].”

Fans took to the comments section to share their support for the singer's achievement. 

“Yess Becky G deserves so much,” one fan wrote.

Fans noted Becky G's accomplishment in the category as she has won three times.

“Since this category was created in 2020, Becky has won 3 out of 6 (2020, 2021, 2025) Well deserved,” one fan wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Good Bones' Star Karen E. Laine Announces Major Career Shift","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/good-bones-karen-laine-lawyer-indianapolis/","Wed, 28 May 2025 16:06:44 GMT","

After nearly a decade of renovating homes on HGTV, former “Good Bones” star Karen E. Laine has shifted her focus and returned to her work as a lawyer. In an Instagram post on May 28, 2025, Laine announced that she has joined the Indianapolis law firm of criminal defense attorney Josiah Swinney.

“I have been a lawyer for over 30 years, and was on HGTV's ‘Good Bones' for 9 seasons,” Laine wrote, captioning a post that featured photos of her and Swinney. “Followers are used to seeing my crafting and home improvement content, which I will continue to post, but there will be some changes because I am excited to be joining Josiah Swinney to restart my criminal defense practice.” 

The career shift is the latest personal change for Laine, 62, whose hit show ended in late 2023 after a fallout with her daughter, “Good Bones” co-star Mina Starsiak Hawk. Laine has since split from her fourth husband and sold the North Carolina property where she had planned to retire after restoring it for a 2024 “Good Bones” spinoff. 

A post shared by Karen E Laine (@kelaine217)

Laine earned a Juris Doctor degree from Indiana University's McKinney School of Law in 1992 and worked for years as a prosecutor and criminal defense attorney before turning full-time to her other passion of home restoration. 

She and Starsiak Hawk built a mother-daughter home renovation business in Indianapolis called Two Chicks and a Hammer after renovating their first home together in 2007. HGTV came calling in 2014, and the first episodes of “Good Bones” premiered in 2016. Laine decided to retire in 2019 and sold her half of the business to Starsiak Hawk, but continued to appear on the show. 

“When asked if it was hard to transition from law to home renovation,” Laine wrote in her May 28 Instagram post, “I explain the similarities: I meet people charged with a crime or a run down house on their worst day. It is my job to understand what went wrong, and then use my skills to turn the story in a new direction.” 

“As an attorney,” she continued, “I am committed to protecting the constitutional rights of people charged with crimes. Justice requires vigorous representation and finding that in the 21st century means websites and search engines. Help people who have been charged with a crime find me by leaving a five-star review at defenselawindiana.com”

A post shared by Karen E Laine (@kelaine217)

After “Good Bones” ended, Laine planned to retire in Wilmington, North Carolina — a spot she'd visited and fallen in love with years before. Following her split from husband Roger Rominger, whom she was with for eight years, Laine transformed a dilapidated Wilmington home into a unique personal oasis on “Good Bones: New Beginnings,” a spinoff that aired on HGTV in August 2024. 

That November, Laine had a change of heart and listed the home for $500,000. She revealed on Instagram in January that she'd purchased a new fixer-upper in Greenfield, Indiana — located about 25 miles east of Indianapolis. 

When a fan asked why she had returned to the area, Laine wrote, “five grandkids in Indy that weren't there when I bought the Wilmington house tipped the scales a different direction. The Wilmington house is for sale and until it sells, I visit there regularly”

At the time of publication, the Wilmington home still hadn't sold. After a $51,000 price reduction in March, the property was taken off the market in May. 

In a May 15 update on the renovations to her Indiana home, she told a fan of her move, “I also miss Wilmington and still hope to live their full time some day, but family priorities required that”

Jenna Ortega knows that Wednesday Addams would have a few qualms with just how popular the “Wednesday” Netflix series has proven to be. In a new interview, Ortega told Harper's Bazaar that the titular character would probably “hate” the commercialization of the hit show, and would certainly shy away from the public adoration of being an icon.

“She doesn't care,” Ortega said of how Wednesday would view the fame. “It's pretty funny, when you think about it. She's an outsider, but now she's on these mugs, cereal boxes, and T-shirts. You're just thinking, ‘Oh, man, she would hate this!'” 

 










Ortega added that Wednesday is almost too blunt for her own good: “I mean, God, if you could speak to everybody like Wednesday — just say what you truly mean — it would be amazing!”

Yet Ortega can also relate with her own overnight rise to being a household name. “I was so stunned that I didn't really process it. I still haven't,” she said of being a hit Hollywood star now. “What's so strange about a character like Wednesday is that Wednesday is an outcast and an outsider — but she's also a pop-culture icon. So, in a strange way, I feel like I've become a pop actor — if that makes sense. And that's something I never saw for myself.”

 










Ortega continued, “I'm very grateful for my audience. And I want to be able to give back to them. But I also want to do things that are creatively fulfilling to me. So it's finding that balance of doing movies that they might be interested in and then doing movies that I'm interested in.” 

Playing the Wednesday character has impacted Ortega's own tastes, too. “I definitely feel like I have a bit more Gothic taste than I did when I was a teenager,” she said. “I've always been into dark things or been fascinated by them, but I was a Disney kid, and the whole thing is being bubbly and kind and overly sweet.”

Ortega isn't the only Tim Burton star who has spoken out about the commercialization and cult fandom. “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” actor Michael Keaton (and Ortega's co-star for the recent sequel) previously told Empire that he had to somewhat overlook the zeitgeist iconography from the 1988 original movie.

“There's been so much merchandising of it, I had to drop back to where it started,” Keaton said. “I had to go, ‘What was my unusual imagination even thinking about when I was developing it in the first place?' As opposed to seeing a coffee mug or a golf-club cover [adorned with Betelgeuse's face].”

Keaton added that witnessing the lore of Betelgeuse in the merchandising world was a “fucking weird” experience. “To be honest with you — I'm being very frank — it was off-putting, to look and go, ‘I don't want to look like all these little things, fuck that — what was the thing that started this?,'” Keaton said.

Aziz Ansari finally has fortune on his side: The writer/director's long-awaited “Good Fortune” is almost here after strike delays. “Good Fortune” stars Keanu Reeves as Seth Rogen‘s guardian angel (yeah, the casting is almost too good to be true), with Ansari also co-starring in addition to helming the feature. 

“Good Fortune” was first announced in April 2023; the project is being billed as Ansari's directorial debut after his “Being Mortal” production fell in limbo as of April 2022 amid actor Bill Murray's sexual misconduct allegations on the set of the Searchlight Pictures film. (Murray later claimed the investigation stemmed from a miscommunication.) Rogen was also attached to star in “Being Mortal,” in addition to leading “Good Fortune.” Of course, with “The Studio” Season 2 already in the works, who knows if Rogen will still have time to be “Mortal” as well.

The official synopsis for “Good Fortune” reads: “A well-meaning but rather inept angel named Gabriel (Reeves) meddles in the lives of a struggling gig worker (Ansari) and a wealthy venture capitalist (Rogen).”

Ansari also produces along with Anthony Katagas and Alan Yang; Aniz Adam Ansari, Jonathan McCoy, Christopher Woodrow, and Connor DiGregorio executive produce. The film is a Lionsgate feature in association with Media Capital Technologies, and is a Garam Fiilms / Keep Your Head / Yang Pictures production.

In addition to starring alongside Rogen in “Good Fortune,” Reeves is teaming up with another “Superbad” alum, Jonah Hill, for Apple film “Outcome.” Hill will direct and produce the film about a damaged Hollywood star (Reeves) who must dive into the dark depths of his past to confront his demons and make amends after he is extorted with a mysterious video clip. He also will appear in “Ballerina” and the untitled fifth “John Wick” film.

Rogen, meanwhile, is among the voice cast for Andy Serkis' “Animal Farm” movie alongside Steve Buscemi, Glenn Close, and Kieran Culkin. He additionally will star in Kristen Stewart's stoner comedy “The Wrong Girls.”

Lionsgate will premiere “Good Fortune” in theaters October 17. Check out the teaser below.

In the pantheon of unnecessary legacy sequels — distant continuations that dig up decades of history to occasionally transcendent but mostly exasperating effect — it's hard to come up with a film that gains less from its connections to the work it's tied to than “Karate Kid: Legends.” Partly, there's a deep sense of redundancy: the iconic '80s “Karate Kid” martial arts franchise has already been the subject of a six-season sequel series “Cobra Kai” that just concluded a mere three months ago, which had flaws but nonetheless inspired affection for its cheeky reverence to the cheesy charms of the 1984 original film.

 










But more importantly, “The Karate Kid,” for as much as it reigns supreme as one of the most famous sports/martial arts films of its time, is an exceedingly simple story about a boy, his mentor, the girl he has a crush on, and the bully whose ass he kicks. A movie that carries the weight and mythos to power decades later sequel films? Not exactly. And in tying its story to the saga of Daniel LaRusso, “Karate Kid: Legends” resorts to repeating his journey entirely, leading to a martial arts film that has limited new moves compared to what audiences have seen 40 years ago.

Although “Legends” begins with old footage from “The Karate Kid Part II” of a baby-faced Ralph Macchio as David, and the late Pat Morita as his beloved trickster mentor Mr. Miyagi, for much of its running time, it's strongest connection to the franchise at large actually comes from the (slightly over)hated 2010 “Karate Kid” update, which starred a very young Jaden Smith as a boy who moves to Beijing and trains under kung fu master Mr. Han, played by an actual kung fu master Jackie Chan. If you haven't seen that remake/now retconned in sequel, it's easy to miss this and assume Han is an original character — nary a reference to Smith's pupil is to be found. That's a good thing for a movie that's already overburdened by the past, but it's a bizarre coincidence how Han had no less than two young students with remarkably similar coming-of-age journeys.

In this film, his protégé is Li Fong (Ben Wang), a quiet teenager who gets dragged out of Han's dojo by his protective mother (Ming-Na Wen, utterly wasted) to move to New York City. His mother is determined for him to leave his fighting days behind and focus on his SATs, but Li is more interested in flirting with Mia (Sadie Stanley), the cute pizza parlor employee around the block. Said flirting gets him in the crosshairs of Connor (Aramis Knight), Mia's ex and a karate practitioner who studies at a dojo run by a shady master while training for the Five Boroughs Tournament, a series of fights occurring across the city. If that sounds remarkably like the storyline of the 1984 film, with some proper nouns subbed out (“Los Angeles” for “New York City,” “Under 18 All-Valley Karate Championships” for “Five Boroughs Tournament”), then, well, that's the intent. 

 










There's one or two wrinkles here to switch things up: having already trained extensively in martial arts, Li is plenty capable in fighting already, and the first obligatory training sequence is actually him coaching Mia's former boxer dad Victor (an ultra charming Joshua Jackson, easily the film's MVP) to help him get back in the ring. Instead of being a vaguely fascist aryan masculinity cult like the iconic Cobra Kai, Connor's dojo is run by mobsters and loan sharks. But it's not exactly a surprise when circumstances push Li to enter the Five Burroughs Tournament to settle his beef with Connor and win Mia's heart, or that Han eventually follows him to the States to fill in the Miyagi role. From there, “Karate Kid: Legends” pretty much hits every beat of the original film to a tee, and while much of that is just par for the course for any sports drama, it's explicit aping of its source material just exposes the glaring flaws of its execution.

The debut directorial feature film by Jonathan Entwistle (best known for creating the Netflix TV series “The End of the Fucking World” and “I Am Not Okay With This;” star of the latter Wyatt Oleff gets a fun side part as Li's math tutor-turned-wingman), “Legends” mostly looks like a slightly upscale version of a Netflix show, a “Cobra Kai” episode made on a bigger budget. There's some fun graffiti-style graphics here and there when the Five Burroughs Tournament kicks off, but otherwise, the film's New York City feels absent of grit (it won't be a surprise to learn the movie was filmed in Montreal). The fight choreography is passable but never impressive, and an over-reliance on shaky quick cuts drains out some much needed physicality. It doesn't help that there's surprisingly few of them, and that the film has little interest in compellingly building out its pulpy karate-fueled world, rushing through the Five Burroughs Tournament at the end without taking advantage of the concept.

 










Not helping the fights hit to their fullest potential is that we don't have much opportunity to care about the people fighting them. Wang tries his best, but Li is a wafer-thin cut-out without much charm, and his romance with the equally vapid Mia lacks spark. Connor is somehow more of a one-dimensional monster than Johnny Lawrence of the original films, and there's zero juice to his rivalry with Li considering how little the characters actually interact. Most shortchanged by the script is Wen, whose character's trauma and relationship with her son is set up as the film's emotional core, just for her to get confined to the margins of the narrative and for her conflict to resolve with little fanfare. There's some interesting potential in telling “Karate Kid” story that actually centers on its Asian characters rather than leaving them in mentor or supporting roles, but “Legends” doesn't seem to actually care about that possibility at all.

Not helping the unbalanced narrative is that, in between rehashing all the plot points of the original, it needs to bring the hero of the original back. Despite his prominent place on the poster, Macchio is actually in the movie less than you'd think, only appearing in the third act, but it's not welcome when he finally makes his entrance. That's no disrespect to the actor, but Daniel's presence saps time away from characters who desperately need more development. Han and Li's student-teacher relationship in particular is diluted and lacks necessary grounding, and there's little compelling friction between the two masters to make up for it. Macchio gets very little to do in fact, and his presence has almost zero meaningful impact on Li. He could be cut out entirely, if the movie didn't care about reminding the audience of the original.

 










“Remind the audience of the original” seems to be all that “Legends” really aspires to, unfortunately, rather than using its decent cast to tell their own story. Notably, the closing scene doesn't even feature Li or his supporting cast, instead pairing off Daniel and a cameo from the franchise's past for an extended, unfunny gag. It's as if the movie itself is finally giving in to what it presumes audience members are actually here for, while tacitly admitting that none of the new things it brings to the table have the punch (or the kick) to stand alone.  

Sony Pictures will release “Karate Kid: Legends” in theaters May 30.

Eddie Alcazar is the under-the-radar, up-and-coming visionary filmmaker who's collaborated with everyone from Steven Soderbergh to Darren Aronofsky and The Weeknd. Soderbergh executive-produced Alcazar's 2018 sci-fi debut “Perfect” before teaming up with the filmmaker again for his 2023 black-and-white Sundance premiere “Divinity,” which IndieWire deemed one of that year's “best-looking movies.”

Aronofsky, meanwhile, executive-produced Alcazar's short film “The Vandal,” released by New Yorker Studios in 2021. And filmmaker Alcazar, who also works as a writer and game developer, also wrote and directed The Weeknd's stop-motion music video “Red Terror” earlier this year.

But Alcazar's next project is “Bullet Time,” a hand-drawn TV pilot, fours years in the making, that he created and directed that tributes the Golden Age of '90s animation (think “The Ren & Stimpy Show,” which immediately comes to mind when you see the surreal trailer below). Alcazar hopes the DIY, tactile approach to the storytelling will be an antidote to AI-driven times. Danny Elfman also composed the music.

IndieWire debuts a first look at the project before it heads to the Fantasia genre film festival this summer. Watch below.

Here's a synopsis: “In a surreal world fueled by retro gaming nostalgia and Saturday morning cartoon mayhem, Bullet Time follows Bullet — an emotionally unstable bull terrier — as he battles his way through a bizarre digital gaming universe. Fueled by frenetic action, heart, and absurd humor, ‘Bullet Time' delivers a visually explosive ride that blends '90s cartoon weirdness with cutting-edge animation and a pulse-pounding original score.” Alcazar produces the project with Javier Lovato. Bob Jaques (“Ren and Stimpy,” “SpongeBob SquarePants”) serves as animation director, while voice actors include Eric Bauza, Luis Bordonada, David Firth, and Uly.

“Happy to finally share a project that holds a lot of meaning to me,” Alcazar said in a statement. “Four years ago, this film was started, and at the same time, I lost my dog Bullet, who I still think about everyday. His memory kept me going as I made this animation. This experience instilled a stronger appreciation to all the talent and detail that goes into the cartoons we all grew to love.”

He added, “The '90s seemed like a golden era of cartoon inspiration, innovation, and love, and I wanted to go back to that feeling. The team behind this project are a mix of experienced talent from classics like ‘Ren & Stimpy,' ‘Pee Wee's Playhouse' and ‘Big Adventure,' and ‘Gumby' to name a few. Plus, a combination of fresh new artists who were also inspired by the houses they built. Finishing this all completely hand drawn animation TV pilot as we turn towards the AI age feels a bit bitter sweet. Times do change but I hope the appreciation of hard work and passion doesn't and that we will always find value in creation from skills and experience. Without it we are lost. … Without it things will lose all meaning.”

 










The full Fantasia Festival lineup will be announced soon, with the event running July 18 to August 4. But we can confirm “Bullet Time” will be featured. Watch the trailer below.

I assumed my first few moments around Turnstile would go something like this: congratulate them on their success, small-talk-small-talk-small-talk, inquire about new material they're working on, and wait for the perfect window to ask how it feels to be the biggest thing in hardcore music. But, instead, the band instinctively senses that I, too, am from Baltimore, and our conversation launches into hyperlocal IRL Yelp reviews of the city's beloved—and maligned—spots for late-night eats. There's Sip & Bite, in Canton, which is best saved for when you're drunk and desperate. There's the '50s-sci-fi-themed Lost City diner, in Station North, which opens for only a few months at a time every seven years or so for no detectable reason.

And then there's the Papermoon diner, in Remington, that's littered with wacky toys: old Pez dispensers trapped inside the glass of the front counter, an army of '90s action figures staring out the window, baby dolls hanging from the ceiling in a very unsettling manner. “I sent some friends from out of town there, and they went just to get a milkshake and they wouldn't seat them,” Brendan Yates, the band's frontman, remembers of its quirks. “They're like, ‘Oh, you can't just order a milkshake. If you want to be seated, you have to get a whole meal.' ”

For Yates, it's a relief to talk about Baltimore in a way that isn't let me explain to you how much of a hidden gem this place is. It's early spring and the city is finally starting to poke its head up from the misery of winter. The Orioles are back on the field, newly aspiring joggers crowd the park walkways that are otherwise barren, and old heads are breaking out their three-wheeled Slingshots again, playing Jeezy so loud that windowpanes tremble.

Despite our exchange about the city's quirkiest holes-in-the-wall, we've settled in the back room of the more sensible Artifact Coffee. Pat McCrory, one of Turnstile's guitarists, orders the Ham Jam, a seriously buttered sandwich stacked with collard greens, eggs, cheese, sliced ham, and spicy jelly. As we trade memories of Baltimore's greasy spoons, there's a sense of calm from everyone here; in conversation, the band members engage earnestly but, at various points throughout our time at Artifact, I catch each of them silently basking in the serenity of a sunny morning. It's meditative.

BRENDAN YATES, VOCALS

This is the speed at which these guys live when they're not leading congregations of folks who delight in opening up pits at concert halls and stadiums across the globe, which is most of the time. For the past few weeks, the hardcore heroes have been luxuriating in this rare lull, savoring their last few moments of tranquility before hitting the road ahead of the release of their fourth studio album, Never Enough, which, fittingly, emphasizes the importance of taking your time and sitting in stillness.

You could call it a reaction to the past four years for Turnstile, the most commercially successful and busiest stint of their 15-year existence. In 2021, they released their third album, Glow On, which took them from a standout in the hardcore realm to a superstar band in a world that doesn't produce superstar bands anymore. They broke containment and went wide. In December of 2021, a few months after the album's release, they made their late-night television debut on Seth Meyers. They eventually opened up for their childhood heroes, Blink-182, on a world tour. The fact that “Blackout,” “Holiday,” and “Alien Love Call” were all nominated for Grammys is the final piece of evidence that fans and skeptics would point to and say: See what I mean?

DANIEL FANG, DRUMS

FRANZ LYONS, BASS

PAT MCCRORY, GUITAR

MEG MILLS, GUITAR

But the beauty of Glow On was that it felt like a natural progression for Turnstile, a band that always distinguished itself by embracing and incorporating elements of non-rock music and going full genre bender—dream pop, funk, and the DC-based go-go sound all showed up at one point or another. Critical acclaim and A-list cosigns followed. Demi Lovato identified them as their favorite band; Metallica frontman James Hetfield rocked out to them side stage at a festival. More recently, at this year's Coachella, Charli XCX suggested it'd be a “Turnstile Summer.” Never Enough should validate their new position in the pop culture sphere—or maybe even combat the idea that they have to be validated at all.

Turnstile's bold, creative direction only adds to the band's appeal. The video for the lead single, “Never Enough,” will be part of a larger project when they're done rolling things out, one that turns the album into a long music film—think of it as a more extended take on 2021's 11-minute short, Turnstile Love Connection. In the first chapter, blue morning light rests over waves crashing against a shoreline, and off into the distance, Yates rides a jet ski, almost comically unbothered by the chop of the sea. McCrory jams on his guitar in a valley of sprawling green mountains. Bassist Franz Lyons rocks out in the crowded intersection of a bustling metropolis. Daniel Fang drums relentlessly in the middle of a desert. Meg Mills, the band's new guitarist, strums away in a wintry terrain, surrounded by snow.

“To even bring that idea to life wouldn't really have been possible years ago,” Yates says of the globe-spanning video, on a Zoom call the week prior to meeting in person. “And just the fact that we have the friends, the resources, and the ability to designate all this time to build something like that—you don't sell a music video, you know? You make it for yourself. You build something that feels really connected to the music and you're trying to establish a feeling.” It seems that feeling, when put into the context of the earth, is: We are a small, insignificant component of the equation. And if you quiet yourself long enough to revel in that fact, maybe there's a semblance of peace on the other side.

The single shares a large chunk of DNA with “Mystery,” Glow On's opener. Both songs have a dreamy buildup and flashes of intensity thanks to Fang's drumming, but there's much more of an ambient slant to “Never Enough.” The band is asking for a heightened level of sensitivity. More space. More time to reflect. “There's this kind of outro on [‘Never Enough'] that's probably obnoxiously long to a listener that maybe just wants to get in and out,” Yates says. “But for us, it was very intentional. It felt really important to sit in that moment. And the amount of space you take up is equally as important as the space that you sit back on.”

To incorporate all this space, the band decamped to record much of the album at The Mansion—a Laurel Canyon music studio compound that birthed some of the biggest rock moments in history: Red Hot Chili Peppers' Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Jay-Z's “99 Problems,” LCD Soundsystem's This Is Happening, to name just a few. Turnstile set up in the house's living room after everyone got out of bed and started chipping away at new material. “We're not the kind of band that lives in studios,” says Yates. “It's usually: write everything at home and keep everything very personal. And then, when the band feels like it's at a point where this is an album, we're like, ‘Okay, let's go into a studio.' There's something cool about living in a house and recording and living in music for a bit.”

For the album, Yates took over main production duties for the first time in the band's career, but the group also reenlisted rock producer Will Yip—who fully helmed 2018's Time & Space—to chip in some additional production work. Beyond conceptual intent, it's arguable that the ambient notes that rule so much of the new album are also indicative of how much access the band now has to state-of-the-art studios. The sound of hardcore is born out of intention and immediacy, but also time and money. “We used to be a band that was like, ‘Yo, all right, we can record an album, but the dude said it's gonna be like $500 and we gotta get it done in four days,' ” says Yates. “We didn't get to spend too much time on it.” Now, having gone four years without dropping an album, the group is feeling understandably excited about finally getting to share new material.

“Anytime we're going into forward-facing mode, I feel like everybody starts getting cues from each other,” Franz Lyons says back at the café. “We're editing songs [from the album], and you keep getting hype from adding that one little piece. Then a video comes out, and that's another piece. We've been listening to the record forever now. But now it's like bubbling.”

This sort of communal urgency is where they thrive. “Ninety percent of the time, we all share space every day. And we're working together to do something bigger,” McCrory adds. “And then when you go home, you're like, I'm gonna ride my bike, or, I'm climbing by myself. The isolated things are the biggest brain shift.” For McCrory it was almost like they'd been living in a collective consciousness. “If it was only me by myself doing everything all day, I'd probably be like a caveman or something.”

BRENDAN'S CHILDHOOD CASSETTE PLAYER.

Turnstile have been sharing their lives since 2010 when they recorded their first 7-inch, Pressure to Succeed. Before then, the majority of members had been active in the Baltimore-DC hardcore scene for a few years, from teens into early adulthood, and, even in the early days, most were playing in other area bands. Two of those that grew alongside Turnstile were Trapped Under Ice and Angel Du$t, both cofounded by Justice Tripp, a Baltimore hardcore legend. The former started in the late 2000s and went on to offer a combination of thrashing and head-banging hardcore that bordered on punk. (Yates played as the band's drummer in his early career, and he still performs with the group when he can.) Angel Du$t are a more experimental take on the genre, rife with melodies and skate-punk vocals. In that band, Yates and McCrory contributed guitar while Fang drummed. Early Turnstile—and their current form, one could argue—live somewhere in the middle of these sensibilities.

The first LP, 2015's Nonstop Feeling, opens with a sample from Dem Raider Boyz, a step squad from Fang's high school days. The vast majority of the album consisted of hot-blooded riffing and the occasional, collective “woo!” to punctuate escalations of energy. But even on “Blue by You,” Yates uses a somber tone to sing about what could be interpreted as the gradual nature of a romantic partner mentally checking out. Time & Space, their first album with the rock and metal label Roadrunner and their introduction to the mainstream, is the true sample of the textural ambitions Turnstile had for their music, even if not fully realized. Some interludes felt like mellow elevator music; one of Lauryn Hill's backup singers, Tanikka Charraé, contributed an unexpected R&B detour (“Bomb”) a quarter of the way through. Diplo also added some production to “Right to Be.”

If Time & Space was divisive for hardcore purists, Glow On was a line in the sand. With every album Turnstile have released over the last decade, someone takes issue with how much they color outside of hardcore's lines. But, at this point, they've already gotten used to dealing with detractors. It's like aging millennials scoffing at the NBA stars of today, upset that the new style of play is centered around three-point shooting and up-tempo scoring rather than the conservatively paced, defense-wins-championships approach they grew up adoring. At the end of the day, it's still professional basketball, ain't it?

“I wouldn't say I'm bothered by it, but it's something I feel like I can't subscribe to,” Yates tells me. “Because everyone has a different idea of what they want, how they define a certain culture or genre. But, to me, growing up going to hardcore shows, it's hard to just subscribe to that dialogue, only because I think it's something that is not defined by the sonics of it. It's more grounded in community.” The bigger Turnstile get, the more that fans will try to chip away at their armor. Maybe if, having signed to a division of Warner Music Group and amassing unlikely fame, they would have picked up and moved to New York or Los Angeles, these critiques would have more of an effect on the band.

But, as Yates alluded to, Turnstile are still very much a part of the community they sprouted from. With the exception of Mills, the whole band lives in or around the North Baltimore area where the heavy music scene has thrived for decades. Their music videos still feature people from that world, and, as massive as they've become, they still try to show love to the same small venues they were playing 10 years ago. “People can be from the same place geographically, but not necessarily, like, overlap culturally at all. And I think Baltimore, it naturally creates a little bit of a glue,” says Yates.

“When you're really connected to your community and the people that support you, you can go really far out of bounds,” Paramore's Hayley Williams says of Turnstile's approach. “Sure, you might leave some people behind and they might always relate to you more nostalgically, but when you're true to your own ambitions and exploration, more often than not, if it's good, the right people will follow. As a person who's in a band that has been similarly musically agnostic, I look at them and they're a beacon.”

Baltimore, and the band's decision to remain there, adds to the Turnstile allure. But as much as Turnstile love to remain rooted in Charm City, it would be disingenuous to say they're unchanged by Glow On's success. The difficulties of making an album with limited studio time are no longer an obstacle that needs to be cleared, and, obviously, there's an ease that comes with not having to worry about your collective survival outside of music. “I think it definitely changed all of our lives, but, simultaneously, it didn't,” Yates says. “We've been touring in bands for so long and this band has existed for so long, we've just been doing the same thing, and constantly growing, and growing [in the] understanding of what we wanna do. But what did change are just the opportunities and visibility and the ability to play the main stage. Like, we played a festival before on the tent stage in the back parking lot, but now we're actually playing to thousands of people.”

After we finish up our breakfast sandwiches at Artifact, I hitch a ride to Lyons's crib with Fang, who unnecessarily apologizes for his car's messiness. From the outside, Lyons's house is a textbook Baltimore row home with a modest porch made for relaxing on a nice day or having a smoke while you people-watch. But once you step in, it's a master class in DIY home improvement. The living room has new, deep-brown wooden floors and when you look up, the same wood has been used for a slick, cabinlike drop ceiling. “All this wood is from a church in West Baltimore. All the planks still have the address,” Lyons points out. We all settle into the kitchen at a round white table with ample seating. I start to talk to them about the makings of Never Enough, but not before Yates FaceTimes Meg Mills, who's at home in London before she flies over to the East Coast next week.

Mills vividly remembers joining the band while it was supporting Blink-182 at a show in St. Paul, Minnesota. “I was definitely thrown in at the deep end,” she says, propped up on Lyons's kitchen counter through Yates's phone. “There was a bit of a technical difficulty as well that makes it even more memorable. We hadn't had a chance to rehearse with the whole lighting setup for the stage. Obviously, enormous venue, the biggest amount of people I've ever played to. The lights came on, and they were like maximum brightness; could not see a thing for the entire set. I came offstage like, Wow, that was really intense. I'm gonna have to get used to doing that every night. And everyone was like, ‘Why the heck were the lights so bright?' ”

Never Enough is Turnstile's first album without founding member and guitarist Brady Ebert. In an Instagram story from the Turnstile page in 2022, the band announced Ebert's departure and wished him well. Yates declined to comment further, but instead sang Mills's praises. “Building chemistry in a band, you need to prioritize communication and friendship over everything. I think the rest works itself out,” he says. “It's a full-time job in itself. It's infinitely imperfect, like any relationship. So you can either choose to ignore that or choose to always be watering it and accept that. Meg coming in has been such a great addition.”

The new album isn't the kind of sonic leap that Glow On was following Time & Space. But there's more space on every song, fuller orchestrations and lusher arrangements, synth leads, horn lines. Members of BadBadNotGood, the electronic-jazz band with whom Turnstile collaborated on an EP in 2023, contribute horn parts. There are a few digital filigrees and subtones added by the experimental pop wizard A. G. Cook. A whole posse of guests expands the sonic world of the band. “I Care” feels like an anthem for sunny days in California; “Seein' Stars” sounds uncannily like a Police song. Yates's delivery is even more melodic this time around, reverb and backing vocals allowing him to ping around your headphones. “Birds” is an energetic onslaught; Fang's drums send you into shock while Yates, as he tends to do at least a few times every album, leans into his Zack de la Rocha bag, half rapping.

But, for me, the most rewarding stretch of the album is squarely in the middle. “Sunshower” starts off with maniacal guitar riffs, and Yates's energy matches perfectly as he shares, “Just when I thought that I could never get it right / Now I'm taking flight / And my head is overjoyed / And this is where I wanna be.” The first half beats you over the head, but the second half washes over you with a serene flute riff played by the former Sons of Kemet and the Comet Is Coming bandleader Shabaka. That dissolves into the pounding “Look Out for Me,” which hits even harder after you've been mellowed out. On the hook, Yates yelps, “Now my heart is hanging by a thread!” Then, the outro of the song removes all percussion and cues heart-monitor-sounding synths that build up to a dreamy, Baltimore club–inspired drum pattern. Like the go-go nod that closed “Blackout” on Glow On, this pays respects to Turnstile's home turf. It's also the band's longest song ever, nearing seven minutes.

It all comes back to extending moments to their absolute zenith, so that some sort of clarity is at the end of the tunnel. In reality, Never Enough doesn't depart very far from where Glow On left off—at least in its general sound palette. But you do get the sense that they, at some point, in the process of becoming the biggest thing in hardcore over the past four years, had gotten to a place where shit was becoming too loud, too demanding, too routine, and a feasible way to disrupt that energy was to begin manipulating time.

“Maybe there's a psychological reason why there might be some of this kind of desire for certain stillness around these chaotic bits,” Yates ponders. “Something about it feels important to breathe for a second amongst that.” It's not that the chaotic moments are absent in Never Enough, but there's a sense that they're all collectively learning that one must also revel in those moments of calm to keep a sound mind.

It's a refreshingly honest approach. After 15 years of grinding it out and becoming the heir apparent to the biggest, actually good band in mainstream rock, the world has watched Turnstile for the past couple years and wondered, How the hell are you gonna follow up something as groundbreaking as Glow On? This is what they did. They didn't try to reinvent heavy music. They didn't go for showstopping features. They leaned in to what's been burning at their core and utilized hardcore as a tool to confront those feelings head-on.

“This record made room just to experience that kind of dynamic and that kind of energy, but also to embrace moments of stillness,” Yates says. “In my head I'm like, No one's got patience in this day and age to listen to a seven-minute song, but I guess it doesn't matter if they do or not. I think we need to go there and we need to live there and embrace being there. It kind of just challenged the idea of, why do I need to keep moving? In some ways, there's an idea of existing as a small speck in a big universe, which can bring peace to perspective.”

Whitney have announced a North American tour. The Chicago band will begin the trek on June 12, in Cleveland, before stopping in Boston, Salt Lake City, and elsewhere. Whitney are currently slated to wrap things up on August 15 in Kalamazoo, Michigan. See their tour dates below.

Along with the tour news, Whitney have released the song “Darling,” their first new music since 2023. Listen to the track below.

Speaking of “Darling” in press materials, Whitney's Max Kakacek and Julien Ehrlich said: “There's something to be said for a two-minute-or-less gem that aims for the heart. Songs like ‘Gonna Hurry' by Dolly Parton and ‘Take Care' by Big Star come to mind—poignantly written goodbyes emphasized by the fact that both songs are over as quick as they started. In the case of ‘Darling' the song transitions into a second act that serves to accept a goodbye instead of leaving it up in the air, but we think the song ultimately feels like it's over too soon in the best way possible.”

Whitney released their most recent studio LP, Spark, in September 2022.

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

Rusia-IDK / Warner

Reviewed:

May 28, 2025

The avant-garde Spanish collective Rusia-IDK has set the bar for the rest of the scene coming out of Madrid with their genre-blending experimental music. Though all five members are excellent, tight-knit, and supportive of each other's solo projects, there's always someone who gets more recognition on the global stage. For Odd Future, it was Tyler, Frank, and Earl. For Spain's most interesting group, it would be free-wheeling experimentalist Ralphie Choo and the more reclusive—but no less compelling—Rusowsky.

A classically trained pianist with a taste for unhinged beats and sentimental love songs, the 26-year-old producer has been co-architecting the strange, danceable, and thought-provoking soundscape that has put Rusia-IDK on the map. A “kinky Figaro,” if you will. On his debut, DAISY, Rusowsky goes full-throttle, doling out both mournful piano ballads and bouncy mosh-pit tracks with ease.

Like many producer-fronted albums, DAISY is impeccably curated. Right from the start, “KINKI FÍGARO” taps rising experimental rapper Jean Dawson, who ushers us out of an orchestral intro and into a hard beat that lays out the album's possibilities and its off-kilter approach. Ravyn Lanae's cheeky chorus on the angelic “pink + pink” prances around rattling percussion and handclaps before Rusowsky's voice comes through a flurry of electronic harp. His vocoder-tinged duet with Kevin Abstract on “Liar?” keeps a song about feeling lonely with a partner humorous and light.

The early 2000s are alive and well on DAISY. Rusowsky channels Timbaland's polyrhythms and softens them with pitched-up guitar strums ready for a slow dance on lovelorn “SOPHIA” and “BBY ROMEO,” where Ralphie Choo appears for one of their reliably excellent tag-teams. Andalusian Y2K icons Las Ketchup are sampled to brilliant effect on “Johnny Glamour.” A rumba built around twinkling piano that also interpolates his early Ralphie Choo-assisted single “Dolores,” Rusowsky successfully makes a bridge between generations of Spanish pop.

The legendary chorus of Panamanian reggaetonera Lorna's “Papi Chulo… Te Traigo El Mmmm” serves as the jumping off point of club juggernaut “sukkKK!” Though minor neoperreo diva La Zowi adds very little with her vapid verses, the song is saved by the sheer fun of its expansive chaos. During its all-too-short two minutes, a fuzzed-out bass ready for a sweaty mosh pit breaks into handclaps, an explosion of electronica, and the top of a '90s dembow drum machine that quickly turns into Brazilian funk.

DAISY isn't tied to any specific narrative, but its name seemingly evokes a key reference. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, as the HAL 9000 supercomputer shuts down, the proto-AI sings an 1894 standard called “Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)”. Rusowsky's “4 Daisy” might be an answer, the original song's “I'm half crazy all for the love of you” channeled by way of layered guitar and Rusowsky crooning, “If you always looked at me like that/I know I'd die” in Spanish. Really listen to his lyrics: beneath the multitude of effects and the playful sonic laboratory's explosion is a hand reaching out to be touched. With the robotics of modern production and the freakish and sweet longings of the human heart, Rusowsky has achieved something as expansive and existential as it is technically impressive and touching.

On the night of a snowstorm in Detroit this January, I slid across icy roads like Connor McDavid in a rental car to hit up a HiTech DJ set. Not too many others made it out, but the ghettotech group—MCs and producers Milf Melly, King Milo, and 47 Chops—were behind the boards in their hometown shouting dancefloor commands and flicking knobs like it was one of those storied Detroit club nights. I wandered the renovated warehouse-turned-venue as partygoers did their own thing: Their homies jitted in front of the decks, a couple gently grinded against a column, an old head two-stepped with a drink in his hand, a double date faced off on the pool table. The trio's new album, HONEYPAQQ Vol. 1, feels like that: a night spent overhearing dancefloor pleas, lovers' arguments, and drunk jokes at a basement party where everyone knows each other.

True to the low-stakes turn-up spirit of ghettotech, a fast, hyperlocal genre of dance music born decades ago out of strands of Detroit DJ culture (Jeff Mills, The New Dance Show, countless radio and underground DJs) and imported regional club music (Miami bass eroticism, Chicago house soul), HiTech's superpower is that they don't do too much. The guys layer sitcom-plot situations and lusty party commentary over their explosion of ticking hi-hats, booty-poppin' bass, and cut-up vocals. On “Shadowrealm,” a high-energy techno blur featuring ZelooperZ, there's a date at a Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles that I can only assume is taking place at 4 a.m. after the club. On “Empty Bus Stop,” a girl catches their eye at the function and out come the pitched-down intrusive thoughts: “Do you want some Casamigos?” (reasonable offer), “Or do you want some head?” (coming on strong). They make you itch for a sloppy night of your own.

Ghettotech is a DJ's and producer's genre and HiTech's work reflects that. Similar to other regional dance music genres, like bounce or juke, the drum patterns and synths are often so familiar that the beats are more about the tiny details a DJ might come up with on the fly during a set: the faded laser beams in the euphoric “Spank!,” the “ayyys” in the second half of “Empty Bus Stop” that instantly turn the groove into a dance battle, or the brief few seconds of buffering that interrupt the twerk romance of “Norf Cold 304's.” That impulsive streak carries over to the guests. Milfie's casual speak-sing on “Audishawty” sounds like she was just hanging out and happened to lay down some vocals. Rob Apollo drops by “Girl U So Fine” to land the tape's funniest line: “Busting through that IUD, I'm tryna' make a miracle.” That feeling of friends partying and making music to make the partying even better is what HiTech is all about.

HONEYPAQQ Vol. 1 doesn't hit quite as hard as their 2023 breakout tape Détwat did. In the last few years more Detroiters have dipped a toe into ghettotech—for example, Black Milk, J.U.S., and Lelo—but Détwat caught me off guard because of how HiTech went all-out with their funny, nasty, funky update of a homegrown genre. It's a hard feeling to replicate, especially considering that HONEYPAQQ Vol. 1 feels tamer. No relationship drama on this tape is as hilariously specific as “Whyyoufuggmyopps,” though I get a kick out of “Queenbootyathenaaphrodite” where, with tinny vocals that resemble an old Memphis rap cassette, they get into a back-and-forth on the dancefloor: “Shakin' ass and I still ain't let that nigga hit/Let a nigga hit, yeah, let a nigga hit, yeah.” And there's nothing as outrageous as “Pocketpussy” (not much is), but the smooth “Take Yo Panties Off” is like PG-13 2 Live Crew. But who wants PG-13 2 Live Crew? If you're gonna be dirty, be fuckin' dirty. Make my skin crawl. Still, that softening might be the reality of a group on a mission to take its intimate club nights from underground raves in Detroit to stages as big and corporate as Coachella.

Radiohead and the Smile frontman Thom Yorke has contributed the theme song “Dialing In” to the forthcoming Apple TV+ series Smoke. The previously unreleased track—which Yorke has performed live under its former title “Gawpers”—is available to stream for the first time. Listen to “Dialing In” below, and check out the trailer for Smoke.

Smoke follows a detective (Jurnee Smollett) and an arson investigator (Taron Egerton) who are trying to catch a pair of serial arsonists wreaking fiery havoc across the Pacific Northwest. Speaking of Yorke's theme song in press materials, Smoke creator and executive producer Dennis Lehane said: “Working with Thom Yorke was as much an honour for me as working with Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, or Richard Price. I've somehow been blessed with collaborating with living legends who were also formative influences on my own creative life. Thom is definitely that. In addition, he took a basic concept I gave him and delivered a song that perfectly embodies the show and absolutely crushes.”

Yorke recently released Tall Tales, his new collaborative album with electronic producer Mark Pritchard.

							By 

	Charisma Madarang



	Health influencers flocked to the White House last week for a press event celebrating the release of a report by Donald Trump‘s “Make America Healthy Again” or “MAHA” commission, chaired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.


	The 72-page document, titled “The MAHA Report: Make Our Children Healthy Again,” asserts that “today's children are the sickest generation in American history in terms of chronic disease” and pointed to its analysis of drivers of childhood chronic disease. While parts of the report blame poor nutrition, environmental chemicals, and over-medicalization, other parts contradict scientific consensus.


	This, unsurprisingly, did not dampen the mood at the White House, which has become a gathering place for pro-Trump propagandists and MAGA influencers. In one social media video, Paul Saladino, M.D., an influencer with nearly three million followers who has advocated for an animal-based diet and is otherwise known as Carnivore MD, filmed from a room of podcasters, boasting that along with interviewing Kennedy, he had also packed his own raw milk and raw meat lunch. “I am in D.C. in for the big announcment of the MAHA chronic disease report,” said Saladino, holding up a flask. “I've got a raw milk smoothie in here that is raw milk, blueberries, honey, and raw meat actually,” he added, “We're taking America back, guys.”In a separate Instagram post, shared by Lineage Provisions, a supplement and meat stick company co-owned by Saladino, shared a video of Saladino taking raw milk and honey shots with podcaster Max Lugavere and Brigham Buhler, during which Lugavere chuckles, “We're about to trigger so many food scientists.”

	











	A surge of raw milk evangelism among conservatives, anti-establishment figures like Kennedy, and tradwives and homesteaders on social media has led to MAGA's most recent anti-science battle. Although there's little evidence of the health benefits of drinking unpasteurized milk, the risks are well-documented. People who drink raw milk are at risk of contracting the H5N1 avian influenza virus, E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter bacterial infections.

	











	Between 2009 and 2014, raw milk and cheese — which are only consumed by 3.2 percent and 1.6 percent of the U.S. population, respectively — are responsible for causing 96 percent of illnesses from dairy contamination, according to a 2017 study in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a peer-reviewed journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Before the introduction of commercial pasteurization in urban areas in the early 1900s, milkborne illnesses including diphtheria, tuberculosis, and “summer diarrhea” were a serious threat to public health.

	And to be clear, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) explained in a March 2024 advisory: “raw milk can contain a variety of disease-causing pathogens, as demonstrated by raw milk can contain a variety of disease-causing pathogens, as demonstrated by numerous scientific studies.”


	However, the rise of raw dairy products's popularity have coincided with a growing distrust of America's health care system. “People don't trust the [American] health care system — and with good reason,” Céline Gounder, MD, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at New York University and Bellevue Hospital, and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, previously told Rolling Stone. “It's first and foremost about profit, not caring for patients or cultivating a healthy population.” When people are poorly served by the health care system, Gounder said they seek alternatives like consuming raw milk that give them a sense of control.


	Now, of course, America's chief health agency — the Department of Health and Human Services — and vital agencies like the FDA and CDC are being overseen by Kennedy and other allies in his MAHA movement.

	While the MAHA commission report sought to address many of the nation's health concerns among children — stating the general agreement that poor diet, lifestyle, and exposure to environmental chemicals are harmful — it doesn't address socioeconomic inequalities that lead to chronic illnesses.


	“They acknowledge that ultra-processed foods are cheaper, but aren't acknowledging that growing poverty and the wealth gap is leading more people, and children, to relying on cheaper foods,” Carmen Marsit, a professor of environmental health at Emory University, told NPR.

	The MAHA report also doubts the current vaccine schedule, echoing calls by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine conspiracy theorist who recently admitted that he doesn't think he's qualified to dispense medical advice.


	Unfortunately, the man pushing alternative medicine over vaccination amid a measles outbreak — and who's plugging dietary choices that will most likely land people on the toilet before they reap any bonafide health benefits — is America's top health official.

							By 

	Nancy Dillon



	Last July, Priscilla Presley claimed in a stunning lawsuit that she was the victim of a “meticulously planned” financial elder-abuse scheme that defrauded her out of more than $1 million. The author, actress, and ex-wife of Elvis Presley alleged that Florida memorabilia dealer Brigitte Kruse “duped” her into signing “unconscionable and unenforceable” contracts that gave Kruse full control of her finances and exclusive rights to her valuable name, image, and likeness.


	Kruse disputed the allegations, claiming Presley was facing “impending financial ruin” when she stepped in to help rescue the cultural icon. In her own breach of contract lawsuit filed against Presley in October 2023, Kruse said she essentially shut down her auction business to help manage Presley's life full-time. She said her 51 percent share of Priscilla Presley Partners — the main company formed to own and control Presley's publicity rights — reflected her indispensable role. (Presley received 49 percent.)

	











	A pivotal moment described in both lawsuits was a videotaped document-signing session held at Kruse's Florida home on Jan. 8, 2023. At the meeting, Presley was represented by Florida lawyer Lynn Walker Wright as Presley signed contracts formalizing several new companies. Presley claims she was ambushed and defrauded, adding that Walker Wright was Kruse's “friend” and that she was asked to sign the documents “with little to no explanation of the contents of each agreement.”

	











	In a sworn statement last year, Presley said Walker Wright failed to advise her of potential downsides, including that the agreements gave her only minority interests in everything — in some cases, only 20 percent. Presley's lawsuit called Kruse a “con artist and pathological liar” who took advantage of an “elderly” mark. (Presley was 77 at the time.)


Rolling Stone has now obtained a recording of that meeting. The video, being shared publicly for the first time, gives a new window into arguably the most crucial juncture in the high-profile and deeply contentious legal battle.

	Presley's supporters will note the dramatic moment when Presley makes clear, on camera, that she hadn't had a chance to read the documents. “Jeez, it's a lot of paperwork. I'm glad I didn't have to sit here and read it,” Presley says. “I'm glad you read it,” she continues, reaching out to pat Walker Wright's arm.


	But at other stages of the meeting, Presley states more than once that she is signing the contracts of her own free will because she trusts Kruse. She appears fully cognizant throughout the 27-minute video and looks relaxed and polished, dressed in a designer outfit. At one point, she discusses having attended a high-profile social engagement the night before, where she met President Donald Trump. “It was actually quite a fun evening. It really was,” Presley says. “We sat at the table with Trump and his beautiful wife, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was very entertaining. I got to meet his family.”

	“Mrs. Presley, has anyone tried to twist your arm or [is anyone] in any way unduly influencing you into making any decisions that we're going to have you sign off on today?” Walker Wright asks, with Presley seated next to her in the home theater at Kruse's Florida residence.


	“No, not at all,” Presley says in a soft voice. Presley confirms on-camera that it was her decision to award Kruse power of attorney and install Kruse as a new co-trustee of her estate alongside Presley's cousin, Barbara Iversen. 


	In the video, Walker Wright explains that Kruse and Iversen are replacing Presley's former business manager, Barry Siegel, and asks why Presley is seeking the switch. “I believe in them,” Presley says of Kruse and Iversen. “And I trust them, and they know a lot about my business.”

	Walker Wright then asks Presley if there's anyone else she wants in the room for the document signing. “Probably Brigitte,” Presley says. Walker Wright acknowledges for the camera that Kruse has joined them in the room. “Hi, Ms. Presley,” Kruse says in a soft voice from a position off-camera. When Presley confirms she personally requested that Kruse join them, as a “witness,” Kruse calls the gesture “so sweet.”

	











	The first document Walker Wright asks Presley to sign is an acknowledgement that Walker Wright is representing Presley personally while also acting as the lawyer who drafted the contracts between Kruse, Presley, and a third partner, business adviser Kevin Fialko.


	“It's a document that protects me, so all three of you all know that I've got the hat on where I've done the LLCs, but I'm representing you personally, so nothing is in conflict,” Walker Wright says. Without missing a beat, the lawyer turns to the signature page, and Presley signs. (Walker Wright later stated in a declaration filed in California that she saw no conflict in her role representing both Kruse and Presley because the parties signed self-prepared agreements in October 2022 outlining their business relationship. She determined the partnership had “already been negotiated,” she wrote.)


	In the video, Presley signs the document creating Priscilla Presley Partners, the company that gave Kruse the controlling 51 percent stake in Presley's intellectual property. “This company now will manage your name, image, and likeness, and it is very private and confidential, so I'm gonna have you sign that first so I can put that away,” Walker Wright says.


	“Do I get copies of these?” Presley asks.


	“Yes, ma'am,” Walker Wright responds. “There's only one set of originals, because I don't want there to be more than one. They will go back with me today. I will be in charge of the chain of custody of this.” (Walker Wright stated in her September declaration that she shared at least some of the documents with Presley's San Diego-based attorneys ahead of time. In a separate declaration filed in November, Presley said she had “no knowledge” of that.)


	In the video, Walker Wright then describes the document giving Kruse power of attorney. “[It] means that she can manage your business affairs when you can't. This means that she can do your banking for you. This means that she can speak to, I don't know, business persons for you.… This is what she will have to take care of your business. It is good during your lifetime,” Walker Wright says.


	“I don't like thinking about this stuff,” Kruse says, off-camera, referring to any suggestion she might need to make decisions for Presley due to incapacitating illness.


	“Neither do I,” Presley says, eliciting laughter in the room.


	“I will always work with Navarone on that,” Kruse says, still off-camera, referring to Presley's adult son Navarone Garibaldi. “I will be hand in hand with Navarone, always. If anything ever happens, my thing is, I just want to be there for him.”

	











	Presley thanks Kruse, placing a hand to her heart. Walker Wright then has Presley sign a residential lease for a property owned by Kruse's husband. The lawyer mentions the husband, Vahe “Mike” Sislyan, by name, but does not specify on camera that it's a five-year lease. “It is going to be your Florida address, because you are going to be our neighbor,” the lawyer says.


	“Yes,” Presley responds. “OK, I get it.” The moment is notable considering Presley has claimed in multiple filings that she did not want or need the lease, never occupied the Orlando property, and had no idea Kruse's husband owned it.


	When it was time for Presley to sign the contract creating Virtual Recollections — the company set up to develop Presley-related holograms, NFTs, and other digital products — Walker Wright said nothing on camera about how Kruse and Fialko would receive separate 40 percent shares while Presley would receive a 20 percent share. In her lawsuit, Presley called the split “egregious and outrageous.” “I only need your signature right there,” the lawyer says on the video, turning to the signature page.The next document was for a similarly titled company, Recollections of Priscilla Presley, which was set up to collect money from any transactions where Presley offers her personal recollections to authenticate — and ostensibly increase the value of — Presley family memorabilia. That contract, signed by Presley, gave Kruse 47 percent, Presley 43 percent, and Fialko 10 percent.


	“Let me just see something,” Presley says, taking the document and flipping to a prior page. The lawyer asks if she's looking for the “percentages.” Presley says yes. The lawyer flips to the ownership breakdown page. “I do want to talk to her about this,” Presley says, referring to Kruse. Walker Wright then sets that contract aside. At this point, Presley makes the comment that she's glad she didn't have to read the contracts. 


	In a statement sent to Rolling Stone, Presley's lawyer, Wayne Harman, says his client stands by her claim that Kruse and Fialko took advantage of her. “Ms. Presley trusted Ms. Kruse and Mr. Fialko, and believed them when they promised that their efforts to have complete control over her finances were for Ms. Presley's benefit. When Ms. Presley discovered the extent of what they had done, including, as she alleges in the complaint, transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars from her bank accounts to their own, and declaring that they had a majority interest in Ms. Presley's own name, image, and likeness in perpetuity, she was devastated,” Harman says. (Fialko and his lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.)

	











	At another point in the video, Presley asks if it's even an option for her to act as trustee of her own trust while she's still alive, and only designate Kruse and Iversen as successor co-trustees (meaning they would take over only after Presley's death). Walker Wright says she can. Kruse then steps in, advising Presley that it's best to make them co-trustees ahead of time. 


	“It's the inevitable, anyways,” Kruse says. “You're always going to be the boss,” Kruse assures Presley. “I don't think so,” Presley says with a laugh.


	The video ends with Walker Wright leaving the room so Presley could speak with Kruse about the Recollections contract. Though it's not shown on camera, the document was eventually signed that day. It was later attached as an exhibit to court filings in the civil cases.


	In a second video from the same day, also obtained by Rolling Stone, Presley is heard describing why she decided to designate Kruse as her medical power of attorney. “I trust her, and she's been through this, and I've watched her with someone very close to her. I was impressed with the love and the care and the attention that she gave this loved one. And I trust her with me,” Presley says. Reached by phone, Kruse says Presley was referring to her efforts caring for a longtime friend who died of cancer.


	Speaking to Rolling Stone, Kruse denies taking advantage of Presley. Kruse says she was working for Presley seven days a week leading up to their dispute and “thoroughly” discussed with her the ownership breakdowns of the various companies. She claims Presley agreed to the percentages before the signing meeting because she agreed Kruse and Fialko were doing the “heavy lifting” in terms of monetizing her intellectual property. (Presley still owns her first name, Priscilla, but she previously forfeited her right to exploit the Presley surname when she received a $6.5 million payment in a deal back in 2005.)


	“I truly cared for this woman like I would my own parent,” Kruse says. “I never needed to hook my wagon to Priscilla Presley. As a matter of fact, the worst mistake I ever made was trying to help her.”


	In the elder-abuse lawsuit, Presley and her lawyers blasted Walker Wright, saying her decision to videotape her own client, especially with Kruse in the room, crossed a line. In her sworn statement, Walker Wright stood by her actions. “I had videotaped other clients executing estate planning and other documents in the past if I had any concern that a document would possibly later be contested,” she said.

	











	“Lynn Walker Wright categorically denies any claims of elder abuse or any other claims in the lawsuit by Ms Presley,” Walker Wright's lawyer, Jennifer Eden, says in a statement to Rolling Stone. She says Presley “dismissed all claims against my client,” noting that the claims were dropped “with prejudice,” meaning they cannot be filed again.


	In her preemptive lawsuit filed first in 2023, Kruse alleged that Presley illegally walked out on their agreements when her financial circumstances changed in the wake of Lisa Marie Presley's death. As Rolling Stone previously reported, two weeks after Lisa Marie died on Jan. 12, 2023, Presley challenged a 2016 amendment to her daughter's trust that removed her as a co-trustee. Presley later reached a settlement with granddaughter Riley Keough that granted her a $1 million lump-sum payment, a $100,000 annual salary, and burial rights near Elvis at Graceland.

	Kruse claimed that once Presley's financial situation changed, she “cut off all communication” with Kruse and excluded her from opportunities to capitalize on Sofia Coppola's Priscilla, the film adaptation of Presley's memoir Elvis and Me. Kruse also claimed Presley redirected the “request booking” button on her personal website to an email address not associated with Priscilla Presley Partners, an alleged violation of their partnership. Speaking to Rolling Stone, Kruse calls Presley's elder-abuse lawsuit “heartbreaking,” saying it took a wrecking ball to her reputation and career. “It's all been ruined because I tried to help her,” she says.


	But Presley and her lawyers aren't backing down. They claim Kruse and Fialko attached themselves to Presley to boost their own profiles. In the suit, they accuse the pair of having “the audacity” to demand that Priscilla's settlement with Keough over Lisa Marie's death include a promise that Keough would do her best to get Kruse and Fialko invited to Priscilla's eventual funeral. In a declaration filed in March, Presley also claimed Kruse attempted to get a credit on Priscilla, and that her interference “strained” Presley's relationship with Coppola. 


	“Financial elder abuse is an extremely serious matter that often goes unreported, and the perpetrators are often those closest to the victims; those who have gained the victim's trust and isolated him or her from her family, friends, and trusted advisers,” Harman says.

	











	“The circumstances leading up to Ms. Presley's claims in this case are not easy for her to discuss, but she gained the courage to take action by knowing that it will bring awareness” to a “significant problem,” he says. “We look forward to the court holding defendants fully accountable for their actions.”


	As Kruse's business lawsuit and Presley's elder-abuse complaint continue to unfold on separate coasts, the parties are waging a fierce battle over which court is the right venue. Kruse has been fighting to have all aspects heard in Florida, where she lives and alleges she was wronged. Presley is fighting for California, where she lives and alleges she was the victim of a “ruse.” Harman says California has “a strong policy and statutory scheme to protect its citizens against elder abuse.”

	The judge overseeing the California case has set a hearing for July 17. In a recent ruling, he upheld Presley's fraud claims against Fialko while dismissing a conspiracy claim. The judge found that while some of the disputed contracts include clauses favoring Florida law, Presley's fraud and elder-abuse allegations should be governed by California statutes. Fraud “is a defense to enforcement of a contract,” the judge wrote in an order earlier this month.


	In the Florida case, an evidentiary hearing on Presley's motion to dismiss for alleged lack of jurisdiction is set for July 21. No matter where the legal feud eventually lands, the video of the document signing in 2023 will undoubtedly play a significant role.

Republican Rep. Mike Flood appeared before his constituents today in Nebraska for a town hall that turned ugly as he tried to defend President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” the reconciliation package the House of Representatives passed last week, and which is expected to force millions of Americans off their health care coverage and food aid.


	Unfortunately, Flood hadn't actually read the bill. 


	Flood could barely get through a sentence without facing boos and heckling from the audience. At one point, when asked about a provision in the GOP's massive reconciliation package that would restrict the judiciary's ability to hold government officials in contempt, Flood said he did not agree with the provision, before admitting that the “provision was unknown to me when I voted for that.”


	“I've taken an oath as a state senator, I've taken an oath as a member of Congress, and I support our court system, and I do believe that the federal district courts when issuing an injunction should have legal effect,” Flood said in response to the question. “In fact, I relied upon that when the Biden administration was in place, the federal courts did a tremendous amount of good work.

	“This provision was unknown to me when I voted for the bill. OK? Next question, next question,” Flood added of the legislation, which passed through the House last week and is now being considered in the Senate. 


	The confession prompted a loud round of jeering from attendees. Flood eventually interjected, telling the crowd that he was “not going to hide the truth.” 

	











	The congressman then stated that he was “going to very clearly tell the people in my conference that we cannot support undermining our court system, and we must allow our federal courts to operate an issue, injunctions.” 


	It was the tense peak of an acrimonious event. In another instance, when Flood insisted that he was a true supporter of the Constitution, one audience member shouted “then do it” from the crowd.

	In holding the town hall, Flood actually bucked advice from Republican leadership, who earlier this year advised members of the party to avoid town halls and other confrontations with constituents over the GOP's unpopular policy initiatives. 


	Other Republicans — including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) — who have gone forward with public constituent meetings have faced the rage of voters upset over mass firings, public corruption, and the president's continued defiance of the courts. The “big, beautiful” bill's proposed cuts to social safety net programs in order to fund tax breaks for the wealthy aren't very popular, either.

	But Republicans remain steadfast in their commitment to fulfilling Trump's policy platform, even if it's unpopular, and even if it kicks millions of Americans off their health insurance. As his constituents yelled at him, an exasperated Flood complained that he understood “that you can get an applause line when you call me a fascist.”


	“But I'm not,” he insisted.

	A stunt performer has sued Kevin Costner and the production companies behind Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 2 over an alleged unscripted rape scene. In the lawsuit, Devyn LaBella accuses the film of not giving her notice nor asking for her consent to record, and of not including a mandatory intimacy coordinator during the scene.


	LaBella is suing the production companies and Costner for sexual discrimination, harassment, and creating a hostile work environment. She also alleges that she faced retaliation after reporting the incident, as she claims she was not called back for further work on the film series, nor by the stunt coordinator who had hired her before.


	“On that day, I was left exposed, unprotected, and deeply betrayed by a system that promised safety and professionalism,” LaBella told The Hollywood Reporter, which broke the news today. “What happened to me shattered my trust and forever changed how I move through this industry.”


	Marty Singer, Costner's attorney, told Rolling Stone that the lawsuit had “absolutely no merit” and is “completely contradicted by [LaBella's] own actions — and the facts.”

	











	“[Costner] always wants to make sure that everyone is comfortable working on his films and takes safety on set very seriously,” Singer said, including an alleged text message screenshot in which LaBella thanked the stunt coordinator for her “wonderful weeks” on set.


	According to the lawsuit, LaBella was hired for Horizon 2 as the stunt double for actor Ella Hunt in the movie. The lawsuit claims that Hunt negotiated a mandatory intimacy coordinator for all nude or intimate scenes. (SAG-AFTRA also requires intimate scenes to follow regulations that include consent and a closed set.)

	











	LaBella claims that all went well through a scripted rape scene that was detailed and rehearsed with an intimacy coordinator and stunt coordinator. However, the following day, on May 2, 2023,  the lawsuit alleges that those rules were not followed when Costner asked LaBella to stand in for Hunt in an unplanned scene of sexual violence involving a different character, played by Roger Ivens. (Hunt had allegedly refused to perform the scene.)

	“Mr. Ivens violently rustled Ms. LaBella's skirt up as if trying to penetrate her against her will,” the lawsuit states, alleging that the scene had not been rehearsed, no intimacy coordinator was present, and the actions were visible to the crew.


	Costner's attorney contested the allegation. “As a stunt performer on Horizon 2, the scene in question was explained to Ms. LaBella, and after she performed the rehearsal in character with another actor, she gave her Stunt Coordinator supervisor a ‘thumbs up' and indicated her willingness to then shoot the scene, if needed (which she was not),” Singer wrote.

	In her suit, LaBella claims she was “terrified” after the experience and raised concerns to stunt coordinators and the film's intimacy coordinator. She also alleged that her career came to an “abrupt halt” after the situation, leaving her feeling “worthless.” However, Singer claimed that “she was in good spirits and made no complaints” to the stunt coordinators involved with the movie, including during a dinner the night of the alleged incident.


	LaBella and her attorneys are requesting that a jury decide whether punitive damages are warranted. According to the complaint, the lawsuit aims not only to seek compensation but also to “address the continued failures at the highest levels of Hollywood production companies to comprehend and address the impacts of performing in sexually explicit and violent ‘scenes' and the need for intimacy coordination.”

	There are dozens upon dozens of memorable eccentrics, delusional antiheroes, blustery authority figures, sad sacks, screw-ups and all-too-lovable schmucks that populate the 12 feature films and handful of shorts directed by Wes Anderson. It is safe to say that there's nobody else like Anatole “Zsa Zsa” Korda in his back catalog. (The gentleman's name alone, being a sui generis mixture of European gentry, old Hollywood callbacks and references to two different film directors, is pure chef's kiss.) An international magnate of mystery, “a maverick in the fields of armaments and aviation,” and a celebrity business tycoon whose decisions have seismic effects on the mid-20th century's global economy, Korda has no passport and no country he calls home. He simply resides on top of the world. As played by Benicio Del Toro with equal parts Shakespearean gravitas and Looney Tunes goofiness, he is an apex predator in a bespoke pinstriped suit. Even Royal Tenenbaum would step aside to let this titan of industry pass.

	











	Such headline-making success breeds envy and enemies, of course, which is why a cabal of Korda's rivals keep sabotaging his planes; when we meet Zsa Zsa, he's just survived the umpteenth in-flight bombing and crash landing. One can only walk away from so many assassination attempts before their luck runs out. Which is why Korda is keen to secure his legacy. His master plan is twofold: First, he must convince his only daughter, Liesl (Mia Threapleton), to become the heir to his fortune; Korda doesn't believe his nine young sons, who run the gamut from mischief-makers to nincompoops, are up to the task. The only caveat is that she must avenge his death should he perish. There are several problems with this initial stage, however, given that Liesl has been estranged from her father for years and believes he murdered her mother. Oh, and also, she's a novitiate who wants nothing more than a convent to call her own.

	The second part centers a vast infrastructure project involving a tunnel, a waterway and a “hydroelectric embankment.” Never mind the who, what, how, or why of it — dubbed “the Phoenician Scheme” and laid out via a series of intricate shoeboxes that speak more to the aesthetic favored by the famously fastidious filmmaker than anything else, this is Korda's bid for immortality. Except the enigmatic Anti-Zsa Zsa committee that's been bankrolling all those plane bombs have also just tanked the market in terms of the materials needed to build all of this. So Korda must trot the globe in order to ensure that his various investors can “cover the gap” vis-à-vis the funding. He's decided to drag Liesl and Bjorn (Michael Cera), a tutor he's hired from Oslo, along for company. Maybe this man who's used to getting what he wants can convince the nun to get with the program. If Korda happens to bond with his offspring, that's a bonus.

	Both a continuation of Anderson's highly imitable, endlessly meme-able strain of filmmaking — has any other name-above-the-title auteur of the last 30 years been so associated with one consistent, defining signature style? Please submit your answers via old-timey telegraphs — and an expansion of his thematic preoccupations, The Phoenician Scheme finds our man Wes in a somewhat pensive mood. Father figures have always loomed large in his work, dating back to his debut movie Bottle Rocket (1996), and along with Del Toro and cowriter Roman Coppola (no stranger to patriarchs with large shadows), he's concocted one doozy of a screen dad. Korda thinks nothing of sequestering his nine sons in a mansion of their own across the street, so they'll stay out of his hair. When several jump at the site of a praying mantis that Bjorn produces during a rare group lunch at his place, Korda barks, “Are we mice, or men?!” Liesl, for her part, is not happy to be summoned out of the blue after six years of no contact. She's also aghast when she finds out he's been spying on her from afar. “It's not called spying when you're the parent,” Zsa Zsa replies. “It's called nurturing.”


	But at the press conference at Cannes, where the film premiered last week, Anderson made a point of mentioning that he, Coppola and Del Toro are all raising daughters, and how that aspect factored into the schematics of his latest work. The director doesn't need to fret about his legacy, but there's an inherent worry about the responsibilities of fatherhood embedded into the DNA of this espionage-thriller-meets-ensemble-comedy. It's easy to be anxious about being not just a dad but a bad dad, and while there's zero sense that Anderson is exorcising personal demons — that's not his style — the underlying feeling that Korda has come around entertaining the idea of some relationship with his spiritually questing firstborn too late in life is present even in the broader, more outré moments.

	Not that The Phoenician Scheme isn't playful, or filled with the surface pleasures so many of us have come to cherish about Anderson's specific visual template. Longtime production designer Adam Stockhausen outdoes himself here, creating vivid worlds that run the gamut from exotic, Casablanca-style nightspots to underground-tunnel meeting spaces to treacherous jungle landscapes. Working with Bruno Delbonnel (Amelie, Across the Universe, Inside Llewyn Davis) for the first time, Anderson takes advantage of the French cinematographer's facility with color, lighting, and an almost faded-Kodachrome look to this 1950s period piece. The cast, per usual, is vast and to die for: Jeffrey Wright delivers rat-a-tat dialogue as a sea captain living a true life aquatic; Benedict Cumberbatch rocks a bitchin' Rasputin beard as Korda's brother; Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston do a daffy double act as American businessmen who challenge Zsa Zsa and a prince played by Riz Ahmed to a trial by basketball; Scarlett Johansson shows up briefly as a cousin who runs a utopian commune; the always great Richard Aayode is a revolutionary who commits the sin of shooting up Mathieu Amalric's chic dance club. A few straight-outta-Andrei Rublev vignettes in black and white suggest an afterlife in which God is played, naturally, by Bill Murray.

	Rather, it's that these set pieces and the supporting cast all serve to further buffer, goose and/or cast a different angle on the central relationship between Zsa Zsa and Liesl. And though most of The Phoenician Scheme is technically a three-hander, with Cera's nebbishy academic adding to the screwball vibe (on a scale of one to Swedish Chef from The Muppets, his Oslo accent is roughly a six), this is really a two-person joint. Thank god Anderson cast the leads he did. As with a lot of great actors who can switch their pitches up at will, you probably take Benicio Del Toro for granted. The way he lends his alpha male industrialist both a sense of authority, a hint of a swindler's con artistry, and a slight befuddlement mixed with buried pride over how Liesl stands up to him, all while keeping perfect comic time, is a prime example of why he's forever courting generational GOAT status. And Threapleton, a relative newcomer, is a major find. It isn't just that she can hold her own against her formidable scene partner; it's that she works perfectly in tandem with him while distinguishing Liesl via a less-is-more performance. Told that her life will change irrevocably when she inherits her father's fortune, the nun gives a barely discernible shrug. It's like a silent-comedy routine in miniature.

	











	The duo aren't the only reason Scheme works as well as it does, but they do help lay an emotional foundation that gives Anderson room to build upon. The best of his movies — Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel — find a way to gel a bigger-picture pathos with the idiosyncrasies, stylistic tics, tricks, and storytelling modes that has made him a beloved figure among both film nerds and discerning viewers desperate for watching big stars have fun. We'd rank this one right next to those. It ends on the closest thing to a simple life that this larger-than-life figure can imagine, taking its sweet time so you can savor the sublime nature of the moment that much more. You leave impressed that Anderson can still manage to do what his does best without succumbing to self-parody here. The blueprint may be familiar. But it's still a pretty foolproof plan.

	After spending months lying to the American public on behalf of the Trump administration, billionaire Elon Musk is now performing distress over Republicans passing deficit-increasing tax breaks for the ultra wealthy. 


	In an interview with CBS News at the headquarters of SpaceX, Musk said that he was “disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.”


	“I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion,” Musk said, referencing how Trump — and thus the Republican Party — has been calling the policy package the “big, beautiful bill.”


	Trump and the GOP's massive reconciliation package — which will make permanent the president's 2017 tax giveaway to America's wealthiest households —  is expected to raise the federal deficit by up to $4 trillion. Musk, who played an active role in the first months of Trump's administration as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has returned his attention to his companies after widespread public backlash to his in-government antics.

	











	When tapped to lead DOGE, Musk promised that the organization would cut federal spending by “at least” $2 trillion. In reality, the over-empowered initiative has likely cost taxpayers at least $135 billion through its chaotic firing-and-rehiring of federal workers, according to an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service. The analysis did not include the added costs of litigation related to DOGE's work, the impact of disruptions to federal programs, and the potential loss of tax revenue stemming from DOGE's firings at the IRS. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In a separate interview with The Washington Post, Musk added that he felt DOGE became “the whipping boy for everything.” 


	“Something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it,” he added, without providing a specific example.

	While DOGE and Musk are definitely not responsible for all of the chaos and mismanagement that has defined the first months of Trump's second administration, they had a hand in much of it. Musk spoke at Cabinet meetings as if he were a fully fledged agency head despite only holding a temporary employee status at the White House. DOGE destroyed or gutted entire agencies — including the United States Agency for International Development — fired tens of thousands of federal workers with little notice, and attempted to gain access to all manner of sensitive government data systems. The pseudo-agency's teardown of the federal government has not been popular with Americans, and Republicans faced so much backlash at town hall events that the party advised lawmakers to stop holding them.


	House Republicans are now facing backlash at town halls over the tax bill, though. Rep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.) was booed lustily on Tuesday night as he tried and failed to defend his support of the bill, which in addition to raising the deficit is expected to kick millions of Americans off Medicaid. Flood admitted to his constituents that he hadn't even read the bill before voting for it.

We go over these alien films and dissect which are our favorites. 

'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' 

Do you ever look up into the night sky and wonder whether or not we're all alone? Well, there are a ton of great movies that do that, and then try to provide answers to what would happen if we learned we were not alone. 

Today, I want to go over a list of UFO movies, that is, movies directly centered on unidentified flying objects, and their place in our society. 

So don't think of these as the best alien movies, think of these as a niche within a niche. 

Hopefully, we can find some poignant answers to life's biggest questions. 

Let's dive in. 


            
                1. Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)
            
            
        Steven Spielberg's masterpiece is arguably the quintessential UFO film. This is such a poignant and emotional look at what it would mean to make contact with life from elsewhere. The story is driven by the escalating appearances of mysterious lights and craft, leading to an obsessive quest for understanding by ordinary people. The UFOs themselves are central to the awe and wonder of the film.And you'll never forget the music. 
            
                2. Arrival (2016)
            
            
        To me, this feels like one of the most realistic depictions of what an alien invasion would entail. The crafts here land, but the real unidentifiable things in this movie are the human reactions to them. The film deeply explores humanity's attempt to understand the purpose and origin of these inexplicable objects before significant direct interaction with their occupants.
            
                3. Contact (1997)
            
            
        I love this movie so much. I think I watched it five times last year because I got so into it and the actual science depicted in the film. Based on Carl Sagan's novel, this Robert Zemeckis film stars Jodie Foster as a scientist who discovers a signal from an extraterrestrial intelligence, leading to a journey to make first contact. It's a more scientifically grounded and philosophical exploration of the implications of alien communication and it asks huge questions of the people in the movie that translate to the audience. 
            
                4. Flight of the Navigator (1986)
            
            
        As a kid, this VHS tape was heavy in rotation. This family-friendly film centers on a boy's encounter with a sleek, sentient alien spacecraft. Much of the film explores the ship's incredible abilities, its distinct design, and the mystery of its journey and purpose, making the UFO itself a key character.
            
                5. Independence Day (1996)
            
            
        This is also one of those massive cultural movies that I just thought was deeply fun and inventive. The sheer scale and destructive power of the city-sized UFOs are the primary drivers of this blockbuster. The initial awe at their arrival quickly turns to terror as their devastating capabilities are unleashed. There are points in this movie where I have no idea how the humans are going to make it out alive, and I've probably seen it like 20 times. It has such a fun hook and ending. 
            
                6. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)
            
            
        UFOs have been in our minds since the dawn of cinema, and this science fiction classic stands with the best of them. The iconic flying saucer that lands in Washington, D.C. is a powerful thematic symbol. Its seamless design, advanced capabilities, and the silent, imposing presence of Gort, the robot guarding it, create an immediate sense of technological superiority and alien mystery before Klaatu even delivers his message of warning. It's a very prescient movie. 
            
                7. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)
            
            
        Another Spielberg classic, E.T. is a heartwarming tale of friendship between a lonely boy and a gentle alien stranded on Earth by his own UFO. The movie takes so many distinct points of view, but the idea of the recurring man with the keys, who turns out to be full of wonder, just like a child, sort of sums up the way we all think about UFOs. It remains a beloved film for its emotional depth and timeless story of understanding and connection.
            
                8. War of the Worlds (2005)
            
            
        I could have made a whole list of just Spielberg movies. His modern adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel offers a visceral and terrifying depiction of an alien invasion, focusing on the desperate struggle for survival of one family. Its intense action and unsettling imagery make it a memorable entry in the genre.It has real 9/11 vibes and seems to be a deep exploration into the way the world handles terror and how hard it is to go back to our normal lives after trauma. 
            
                9. District 9 (2009)
            
            
        This is one of those movies that feels like it happened in real life. It uses UFOs for an allegory about immigration and humanity. Neill Blomkamp's powerful and thought-provoking film uses the arrival of alien refugees as a biting deconstruction of xenophobia and social injustice.
            
                10. Signs (2002)
            
            
        I am a massive fan of this crop circle movie, and I think it's one of Shyamalan's best. This thriller explores a family's experience with the sudden appearance of crop circles and the growing dread of an impending alien presence. It's a film that masterfully builds suspense and plays on primal fears of the unknown.And it all hinges on the core performances of an amazing cast. 
            
                11. Nope (2022)
            
            
         Jordan Peele's sci-fi horror film features a mysterious, predatory UFO that terrorizes a remote California horse ranch. It's such a good story about predators, prey, and documenting history that I often forget the alien aspect of the movie..even though the film is dedicated to the characters observing, attempting to understand, and ultimately trying to capture evidence of the elusive and uniquely designed object in the sky, which behaves more like a living creature than a traditional spacecraft.
            
                Summing It All Up 
            
            
        So, there you have it. That's my list for the best UFO movies, but by no means is it prescriptive. I'm sure you have a bunch to add, and I'm always looking for more of these kinds of films to watch. 

Steven Spielberg's masterpiece is arguably the quintessential UFO film. 

This is such a poignant and emotional look at what it would mean to make contact with life from elsewhere. 

The story is driven by the escalating appearances of mysterious lights and craft, leading to an obsessive quest for understanding by ordinary people. The UFOs themselves are central to the awe and wonder of the film.

And you'll never forget the music. 

To me, this feels like one of the most realistic depictions of what an alien invasion would entail. 

The crafts here land, but the real unidentifiable things in this movie are the human reactions to them. The film deeply explores humanity's attempt to understand the purpose and origin of these inexplicable objects before significant direct interaction with their occupants.

I love this movie so much. I think I watched it five times last year because I got so into it and the actual science depicted in the film. 

Based on Carl Sagan's novel, this Robert Zemeckis film stars Jodie Foster as a scientist who discovers a signal from an extraterrestrial intelligence, leading to a journey to make first contact. 

It's a more scientifically grounded and philosophical exploration of the implications of alien communication and it asks huge questions of the people in the movie that translate to the audience. 

As a kid, this VHS tape was heavy in rotation. This family-friendly film centers on a boy's encounter with a sleek, sentient alien spacecraft. 

Much of the film explores the ship's incredible abilities, its distinct design, and the mystery of its journey and purpose, making the UFO itself a key character.

This is also one of those massive cultural movies that I just thought was deeply fun and inventive. The sheer scale and destructive power of the city-sized UFOs are the primary drivers of this blockbuster. 

The initial awe at their arrival quickly turns to terror as their devastating capabilities are unleashed. 

There are points in this movie where I have no idea how the humans are going to make it out alive, and I've probably seen it like 20 times. 

It has such a fun hook and ending. 

UFOs have been in our minds since the dawn of cinema, and this science fiction classic stands with the best of them. 

The iconic flying saucer that lands in Washington, D.C. is a powerful thematic symbol. Its seamless design, advanced capabilities, and the silent, imposing presence of Gort, the robot guarding it, create an immediate sense of technological superiority and alien mystery before Klaatu even delivers his message of warning. 

It's a very prescient movie. 

Another Spielberg classic, E.T. is a heartwarming tale of friendship between a lonely boy and a gentle alien stranded on Earth by his own UFO. 

The movie takes so many distinct points of view, but the idea of the recurring man with the keys, who turns out to be full of wonder, just like a child, sort of sums up the way we all think about UFOs. 

It remains a beloved film for its emotional depth and timeless story of understanding and connection.

I could have made a whole list of just Spielberg movies. His modern adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel offers a visceral and terrifying depiction of an alien invasion, focusing on the desperate struggle for survival of one family.

 Its intense action and unsettling imagery make it a memorable entry in the genre.

It has real 9/11 vibes and seems to be a deep exploration into the way the world handles terror and how hard it is to go back to our normal lives after trauma. 

This is one of those movies that feels like it happened in real life. It uses UFOs for an allegory about immigration and humanity. 

Neill Blomkamp's powerful and thought-provoking film uses the arrival of alien refugees as a biting deconstruction of xenophobia and social injustice.

I am a massive fan of this crop circle movie, and I think it's one of Shyamalan's best. 

This thriller explores a family's experience with the sudden appearance of crop circles and the growing dread of an impending alien presence. It's a film that masterfully builds suspense and plays on primal fears of the unknown.

And it all hinges on the core performances of an amazing cast.

These were elaborate and intricate, almost Rube Goldberg-like ways to kill people that escalated time and time again. When you see a movie like this, it delivers the promise of the premise, and everything about it just explodes.

Most fast food chains have a cookie-cutter look to their franchises, which is why it's super exciting when you find one that stands out from the crowd. While the golden arches are largely indistinguishable from restaurant to restaurant, there are indeed several interesting McDonald's locations around the world that you may or may not be familiar with. Case in point, Roswell, New Mexico, is home to a very special and regionally appropriate UFO-shaped McDonald's, a tourist attraction perfect for extraterrestrial enthusiasts and Mickey D's fanatics alike.

Built in 2005 near an alleged UFO crash site, the cosmic-themed restaurant features a silver saucer-shaped structure where patrons can dine. Attached is a UFO-themed Play Place for the kiddos to enjoy and the main building with the order counter. To add to the fun, there's a few silver alien statues near the drive-thru and at night the saucer lights up to make it look extra otherworldly. The menu is mostly the same as other regular locations, with the exception of McDonald's green chile double cheeseburger which is available only in New Mexico.

When visiting Roswell, you can't miss the overload of extraterrestrial-themed attractions. In case you're unaware of the UFO-related history behind this town, in 1947, a rancher just outside Roswell found strange debris, including metallic sticks and foil reflectors, in his sheep pasture. While the United States Air Force and government has long passed it off as a fallen weather balloon, many people still doubt this claim, believing they were covering up evidence of an alien spaceship.

Besides the Roswell location, there are several unique McDonald's around the world that are worth visiting, like the U.S. McDonald's that features an international menu or the only McDonald's location that has a ""Ski-Thru"" Window.

Heading to the West Coast, Barstow, California, features a McDonald's resembling a train station, complete with train cars that have been transformed into dining areas. The world's oldest McDonald's is also in the Golden State (in Downey), featuring a classic 1950s look that has remained over the years. Meanwhile, in Arizona, you'll find the only teal arches in the world, an effort to match the aesthetic of the red rock and blue sky landscape in Sedona.

On the opposite coast, enjoy a lobster roll at the Freeport, Maine, Mansion McDonald's, a colonial home built by William Gore in 1850 and converted into a Mickey D's in 1984. The unique building choice was largely in effort to maintain the historical town's aesthetic. Another Mansion McDonald's, dubbed the McMansion, is located in New Hyde Park, New York. The late 18th-century farmhouse features a grand staircase and veranda that was transformed into an elegant dining area.

Indeed, McDonald's has converted quite a few historical buildings into fast food eateries. For instance, Penang, Malaysia is home to the Birch House McDonald's, a colonial mansion that was once the headquarters of a 19th-century tin smelting company. In Melbourne, Australia, you'll find McDonald's Clifton Hill, a beautiful Art Deco style building that once operated as the United Kingdom Hotel.

We go over these alien films and dissect which are our favorites. 

'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' 

Do you ever look up into the night sky and wonder whether or not we're all alone? Well, there are a ton of great movies that do that, and then try to provide answers to what would happen if we learned we were not alone. 

Today, I want to go over a list of UFO movies, that is, movies directly centered on unidentified flying objects, and their place in our society. 

So don't think of these as the best alien movies, think of these as a niche within a niche. 

Hopefully, we can find some poignant answers to life's biggest questions. 

Let's dive in. 


            
                1. Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)
            
            
        Steven Spielberg's masterpiece is arguably the quintessential UFO film. This is such a poignant and emotional look at what it would mean to make contact with life from elsewhere. The story is driven by the escalating appearances of mysterious lights and craft, leading to an obsessive quest for understanding by ordinary people. The UFOs themselves are central to the awe and wonder of the film.And you'll never forget the music. 
            
                2. Arrival (2016)
            
            
        To me, this feels like one of the most realistic depictions of what an alien invasion would entail. The crafts here land, but the real unidentifiable things in this movie are the human reactions to them. The film deeply explores humanity's attempt to understand the purpose and origin of these inexplicable objects before significant direct interaction with their occupants.
            
                3. Contact (1997)
            
            
        I love this movie so much. I think I watched it five times last year because I got so into it and the actual science depicted in the film. Based on Carl Sagan's novel, this Robert Zemeckis film stars Jodie Foster as a scientist who discovers a signal from an extraterrestrial intelligence, leading to a journey to make first contact. It's a more scientifically grounded and philosophical exploration of the implications of alien communication and it asks huge questions of the people in the movie that translate to the audience. 
            
                4. Flight of the Navigator (1986)
            
            
        As a kid, this VHS tape was heavy in rotation. This family-friendly film centers on a boy's encounter with a sleek, sentient alien spacecraft. Much of the film explores the ship's incredible abilities, its distinct design, and the mystery of its journey and purpose, making the UFO itself a key character.
            
                5. Independence Day (1996)

                6. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)
            
            
        UFOs have been in our minds since the dawn of cinema, and this science fiction classic stands with the best of them. The iconic flying saucer that lands in Washington, D.C. is a powerful thematic symbol. Its seamless design, advanced capabilities, and the silent, imposing presence of Gort, the robot guarding it, create an immediate sense of technological superiority and alien mystery before Klaatu even delivers his message of warning.

                7. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)
            
            
        Another Spielberg classic, E.T. is a heartwarming tale of friendship between a lonely boy and a gentle alien stranded on Earth by his own UFO. The movie takes so many distinct points of view, but the idea of the recurring man with the keys, who turns out to be full of wonder, just like a child, sort of sums up the way we all think about UFOs. It remains a beloved film for its emotional depth and timeless story of understanding and connection.
            
                8. War of the Worlds (2005)
            
            
        I could have made a whole list of just Spielberg movies. His modern adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel offers a visceral and terrifying depiction of an alien invasion, focusing on the desperate struggle for survival of one family. Its intense action and unsettling imagery make it a memorable entry in the genre.It has real 9/11 vibes and seems to be a deep exploration into the way the world handles terror and how hard it is to go back to our normal lives after trauma. 
            
                9. District 9 (2009)
            
            
        This is one of those movies that feels like it happened in real life. It uses UFOs for an allegory about immigration and humanity. Neill Blomkamp's powerful and thought-provoking film uses the arrival of alien refugees as a biting deconstruction of xenophobia and social injustice.
            
                10. Signs (2002)
            
            
        I am a massive fan of this crop circle movie, and I think it's one of Shyamalan's best. This thriller explores a family's experience with the sudden appearance of crop circles and the growing dread of an impending alien presence. It's a film that masterfully builds suspense and plays on primal fears of the unknown.And it all hinges on the core performances of an amazing cast. 
            
                11. Nope (2022)
            
            
         Jordan Peele's sci-fi horror film features a mysterious, predatory UFO that terrorizes a remote California horse ranch. It's such a good story about predators, prey, and documenting history that I often forget the alien aspect of the movie..even though the film is dedicated to the characters observing, attempting to understand, and ultimately trying to capture evidence of the elusive and uniquely designed object in the sky, which behaves more like a living creature than a traditional spacecraft.
            
                Summing It All Up

Scientists in Colombia are currently studying a mysterious sphere, dubbed the Buga Sphere, believed by some to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The object was spotted flying over Buga, in the Valle del Cauca department of western Colombia, on March 2 and was later recovered in the area. The sphere's unusual characteristics have sparked global attention and fueled speculation about its origins.Researcher Jose Luis Velasquez, who inspected the object, noted that it shows no welds or joints, features that would typically indicate human manufacturing. ""It is a very rare piece ... I've never seen a piece like this,"" Velazquez said, according to People magazine. He and his team conducted X-ray scans on the sphere and discovered it consisted of three metal-like layers and contained nine microspheres in its interior.Velazquez believes that the lack of welds or joints bolsters the theory of the sphere's extraterrestrial origin. He added that the sphere appears to have mysterious symbols carved on its surface. Witnesses reported seeing the orb floating erratically in the sky, zigzagging before crashing near a forest. These observations have led some to conclude that the object could be a UFO.  Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a member of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics and the founder of the Institute for Love and Time (TILT), expressed skepticism about the sphere's origins. ""It looks so human made to me,"" she told Fox News. Mossbridge suspects the Buga Sphere might be a piece of artwork rather than an object of alien technology.""It looks to me like a really cool art project,"" Mossbridge said, advising against jumping to conclusions too quickly. She urged thorough vetting before declaring anomalies in mysterious discoveries. ""Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project,"" she suggested, referring to the international research initiative founded by Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, which aims to rigorously study potential extraterrestrial artifacts.Mossbridge framed the mysterious object as part of a bigger picture in which humanity must confront its own limitations. ""We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had,"" she noted. She explained that prior grandiose beliefs in total mastery blind society when ""something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world.""The physicist emphasized the importance of using non-governmental, non-partisan research groups like the Galileo Project and the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies to investigate such phenomena. ""They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters, and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things,"" Mossbridge told Fox News.

""Because, for instance, the sphere in Colombia is in a different country. So, what are the rules about how we deal with something that's interesting that's found there?"" she asked.While the sphere is currently being studied by researchers in Mexico, the next steps for identifying its origin remain unclear.The Pentagon and NASA have recently addressed the topic of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). A November 2022 report from the Pentagon documented numerous instances where balloons, birds, and satellites were mistakenly identified as UAPs. Similarly, a NASA report in 2023 concluded that most UAPs are likely attributable to balloons, aircraft, or sunlight reflections, rather than evidence of extraterrestrial life.Officials at the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022 to track UAPs, have stated there is no evidence suggesting that any cases they examined have extraterrestrial origins. Federal efforts to investigate UAPs have prioritized potential risks to national security and air safety rather than delving into theories about their origins. Despite her skepticism about the Buga Sphere, Mossbridge acknowledged the significance of continued inquiry into unexplained phenomena. ""Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them,"" she said.Mossbridge believes that such mysteries can have a unifying effect on humanity. ""When people start focusing on something that's bigger than us, it really powerfully changes behavior for the better,"" she said according to Newsweek.""As humans, we want to feel safe, so we want to say this is how things work,"" Mossbridge said. ""It's a real trick of just noticing how human psychology works and allowing ourselves to know everything. The safest thing we can do is try to discover what's true.""

Despite her skepticism about the Buga Sphere, Mossbridge acknowledged the significance of continued inquiry into unexplained phenomena. ""Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them,"" she said.Mossbridge believes that such mysteries can have a unifying effect on humanity. ""When people start focusing on something that's bigger than us, it really powerfully changes behavior for the better,"" she said according to Newsweek.""As humans, we want to feel safe, so we want to say this is how things work,"" Mossbridge said. ""It's a real trick of just noticing how human psychology works and allowing ourselves to know everything. The safest thing we can do is try to discover what's true.""




Velazquez believes that the lack of welds or joints bolsters the theory of the sphere's extraterrestrial origin. He added that the sphere appears to have mysterious symbols carved on its surface. Witnesses reported seeing the orb floating erratically in the sky, zigzagging before crashing near a forest. These observations have led some to conclude that the object could be a UFO.  Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a member of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics and the founder of the Institute for Love and Time (TILT), expressed skepticism about the sphere's origins. ""It looks so human made to me,"" she told Fox News. Mossbridge suspects the Buga Sphere might be a piece of artwork rather than an object of alien technology.""It looks to me like a really cool art project,"" Mossbridge said, advising against jumping to conclusions too quickly. She urged thorough vetting before declaring anomalies in mysterious discoveries. ""Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project,"" she suggested, referring to the international research initiative founded by Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, which aims to rigorously study potential extraterrestrial artifacts.Mossbridge framed the mysterious object as part of a bigger picture in which humanity must confront its own limitations. ""We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had,"" she noted. She explained that prior grandiose beliefs in total mastery blind society when ""something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world.""The physicist emphasized the importance of using non-governmental, non-partisan research groups like the Galileo Project and the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies to investigate such phenomena. ""They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters, and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things,"" Mossbridge told Fox News.

May 28, 2025

Dave Schindele, a former U.S. Air Force missile officer, in this present-day photo, was involved in a UFO incident at a missile launch control center in the Minot missile field in 1966.


A former Minot Air Force Base Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile officer who was involved with a 1966 UFO incident in the Minot missile field, will be a member of a “UAP (unidentified aerial phenomena) and Nukes Panel: Disturbing Confrontations Over Nuclear Bases” on Friday during the Contact in the Desert Conference.

Dave Schindele of Mukilteo, Washington, a retired Air Force captain, will be among several panelists, including Robert Salas, also a former Air Force missile officer. Salas was involved in an event at Malmstrom AFB, Montana, in 1967, similar to the one Schindele was involved in at Minot AFB in 1966. Ten nuclear missiles were temporarily disabled, taking them offline during the event Salas was involved in. The panel will be led by host Steve Bassett, a UFO (unidentified flying object)  lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group.

The conference, being held in Indian Wells, California, is the world's largest UFO and UAP conference.

According to conference information, reports of UFOs over nuclear facilities have been documented over several decades, raising concerns about national security. 

Schindele was stationed at Minot AFB from July 1965 to May 1968. He wrote a book, “It Never Happened, Volume I,” on his research and documentation about the Minot incident and others. The book was published in 2017. He is working on a second volume and hopes to have it published in 2026.

This photo of Capt. Dave Schindele was taken at Minot Air Force Base when he was a Minuteman I intercontinental ballistic missile launch crew commander in the 1960s.

Schindele was among military veterans involved in UFO incidents who spoke at a mock congressional hearing, “Citizens Hearing on UFO Disclosure,” presented by Bassett at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

In 2023, Schindele was one of former military members interviewed by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established by the Department of Defense in 2022 to investigate the UFO situation.

An interview with Schindele about the UFO incident in the Minot missile field is included in a new documentary, “UFOs Are Monitoring Nuclear Weapons GLOBALLY,” narrated by Jesse Michels and released on YouTube a few months ago.

Schindele provided information earlier this month to The Minot Daily News about the incident he was involved in 1966 while stationed at Minot AFB and his interest in the Contact in the Desert event.

Schindele's personal account follows:

Over fifty-eight years ago, I and my crew commander, Major Gordon Tollerud, relieved/replaced a Launch Crew at “November Flight,” on September 25, 1966. This was not just an ordinary crew changeover, because the crew we relieved had just been involved in a very critical national security incident, where a UFO paid a visit to November Flight overnight and took down all ten of its nuclear tipped Minuteman ICBM missiles, which had been under careful control of the crew we relieved. 

My commander and I were the first people to arrive at the Launch Facility, where we interviewed six security guards, a site manager, and cook, who were all top-side and viewed the UFO directly. And then we interviewed the launch crew in the Launch Control Capsule sixty feet below ground. In an extensive debriefing of the outgoing crew, they were totally mystified as to how all the missiles became disabled with a “guidance and control system malfunction,” which was during the time the UFO was seen top-side. 

“When the crew returned to base, they were directed to sign a non-disclosure agreement and severely told to never talk or mention the incident again for as long as they should live. My commander and I then inherited ten un-launchable missiles, where we had to coordinate with maintenance and security crews to bring the missiles back to “Alert” status, which probably took many days. But my commander also received a phone call overnight from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) directing that we both must never talk of the incident again. 

When relieved by a new crew the following day, I attempted to again question the head security guard top-side, but he then said, “I'm sorry sir, but I have been directed to never speak of the incident again.

Of special interest to me is that my crew commander and I were never questioned by the Air Force about the incident, and neither were the people we debriefed at November Flight. And neither was Robert Salas, who had an identical incident six months later at Malmstrom AFB. 

This told us two things. First was that the incident was very real, that UFOs do exist! Second was that the incident happened many times previous. It happened all over the nation at many missile sites, otherwise we all would have all been severely questioned. The Air Force wanted us to forget the incident so that other missile crews and the public would never find out. But this now brings to my mind the many security guards throughout the missile fields who had to deal with incidents and alarms from the missile sites. They were also told to forget what they saw, or what they had to “endure,” with all of them getting no needed help from the Air Force or Veterans Administration. Some went through what I should not describe, since it is quite disturbing, and I know the names of several of them.

Special interest

Of great interest to me is that Paul Hynek will be at the event called “Contact in the Desert” at the end of this month, where I will be a panelist. His father, Allen Hynek, was scientific investigator for Air Force Project Blue Book, and I will be giving Paul some documents his father exchanged with Colonel Richard Lemanski, who was Deputy Commander of Minot Air Force Base when I was there. 

The first document was written by Allen Hynek on December 6, 1966, which was the same day that The Minot Daily News carried a major headline detailing a “Launch Control Center Saucer” at Mike Flight. Another document verifies that Major Chester Shaw of Minot AFB sent a UFO report (which I previously had) to Blue Book of the same UFO incident that occurred at “Mike Flight” involving crew commander Val Smich of my squadron in August 1966, which was before the incident I was involved with. The fact that Allen Hynek spent much time with Colonel Lemanski on base, probably in November 1966, and kept up a long relationship with Lemanski for many years, is amazing to me. The copies of the letters and other material was given to me by Lemanski's daughter Valerie, after she read my book titled “It Never Happened.”

The Pew Research Center recently announced that nearly a third of Americans consult astrology, tarot cards, or fortune tellers at least once a year. Most said they do so for fun, and don't base major life decisions on their star sign, but the findings underscore that paranormal beliefs are entrenched in America. According to a 2022 poll from YouGov, two-thirds of Americans said they'd had at least one of 13 possible paranormal experiences. Bigfoot sightings, ghost hunting, consuming Benadryl to see the Hat Man: The national imagination can be wild — it can also be dangerous. The MAHA movement is in power, and so is pseudoscience. President Donald Trump has nominated Casey Means to be the next surgeon general, though she doesn't have a medical license and has questioned the vaccine schedule for children. Means is no stranger to woo-woo, as some call it. In one newsletter, she said that she worked with a medium and asked “the trees” if they would help her find true love.

In The Ghost Lab: How Bigfoot Hunters, Mediums, and Alien Enthusiasts Are Wrecking Science, journalist Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling links the rise of paranormal belief to a corresponding decline in scientific literacy and the collapse of public institutions. The trend didn't happen on its own, he writes. In New Hampshire, where his reporting unfolds, state legislators have slashed funding for colleges and universities like the state flagship campus, which he argues leaves fewer bulwarks against pseudoscience as the years go by. He profiles the paranormal Kitt Research Initiative whose members hunt for ghosts, “cleanse” buildings of spirits, and host support groups for survivors of alien abduction. Hongoltz-Hetling tracks their activities and their complex relationships with reality and with each other  alongside the social consequences of New Hampshire's libertarian streak. Distrust festers, and so do conspiracy theories, as locals try to make sense of life on Earth in an individualistic — and idiosyncratic — fashion outside the confines of mainstream science or academia. Ghost hunting, for example, offers participants a chance to gild their belief in an afterlife with something that can feel like scientific research, and it's becoming a booming industry. The line between grift and true conviction can be difficult to detect, but it's unquestionably true that bad actors are making a lot of money off people desperate for answers. So what's a skeptic to do?

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

How did you discover the Kitt Research Initiative?I started looking when I realized that the contextual themes that were of interest to me were going to lead me to the paranormal community. I cast a wide net, and I spoke to a lot of different people with a lot of different connections in the paranormal-enthusiast world. So I talked to a warlock who was elected to the state legislature. I talked to a woman who owned a haunted crêpe restaurant. I spoke to paranormal podcasters. And then in the Kitt Research Initiative, I really found what I was looking for, which was a story that was compelling on its own but that was also a good encapsulation of the themes that I was exploring.

One thing that was appealing about it was that it represented a diversity of viewpoints within the paranormal community. So in one team under one roof, all working on this shared goal, we had a ghost hunter, and a psychic medium, and a paralegal who heard voices in her head that she was trying to find out the answers to, and an empath, and a Bigfoot hunter who also happened to be an alien abductee. They had their fingers in so many facets of the landscape, and that was a really critical upside that made me know that they had to be the subjects.

Is it possible to make a clean distinction between paranormal belief and religious belief?I cannot. There are a lot of experts who are talking about an emerging new religion in America that is this hodgepodge of beliefs under the banner of New Age spirituality. But I will say that what distinguishes the current paranormal community from a church community is that a church community parallels science and other institutions in our world because it relies on a shared understanding of facts. It's dogmatic. The facts conflict with the facts of science, but at the end of the day, they're united under a collective, unified belief system. And what distinguishes the paranormal community is that they do not have that shared set of beliefs. Their views are immensely varied and diverse, and in fact, the facts are not particularly of the most interest to them. The idea of this shared reality in which we can all agree on a single truth is not the highest priority for them. Instead, what's really cherished and held above all else is the personal experience and the individual experience. And this plays to the rise of individuality and individualism in our culture and society. It also speaks to what it is that makes paranormal beliefs so incompatible with institutional beliefs, whether we're talking about church and religion or whether we're talking about government and medical science and all the rest of it.

You note this in your book, but a lot of Americans hold paranormal beliefs. Based on your reporting, do you have a sense of what makes these beliefs so appealing?It's an idea that I've been surprised by, or a conclusion that I've been surprised to arrive at. I think that humans evolved with a deep-seated appreciation for supernatural experiences. I think we are born to have a sense of wonder, and we're born to get caught up in the narrative. We believe in science despite that human nature, not because of it, and paranormal beliefs are able to tickle a part of our brain that we really need tickled. Institutions are failing to tickle that part of our brains. And this is one of the things that's led to the rise of these beliefs over the last 20 years or so. I think it is that capacity to encapsulate a belief system in a narrative and further to encapsulate that belief system in a narrative that is about you, the individual who is experiencing that paranormal event. So it's one thing to go to church and talk about a god up in the sky who's mediated by a priest. It's a very different thing to walk into a haunted house and have a spirit make contact with you, because then you are the star of the story and it's a very empowering and a very exciting experience to undergo.

Your reporting on the Kitt Research Initiative unfolds against a very serious political backdrop. As you note in the book, there's a decline in scientific literacy and institutions are not doing well. Can you explain how those trends have played out specifically in New Hampshire? I'm thinking about the cuts to the state flagship university.New Hampshire has always been on the leading edge of national distrust, right? It's the only state with a vibrant secessionist movement. And as the country as a whole has slid towards a less trustful place, New Hampshire has been ahead of that curve as well. And so in some ways it's like the canary in the coal mine for where our country is going.

The attacks that are happening on public education played out in New Hampshire about 10, 12 years ago, where a group of legislators were elected who reflected the views of the people of the state, and the people of the state didn't particularly care about education. New Hampshire has always had the lowest per capita support of higher education in the country. It's been that way for decades. Things like public radio and PBS and cooperative extensions and all of these other ancillary services that are provided by the higher-education system all suffered horrifically under these cuts. The university has been hollowed out, and entire departments are faltering because they can't provide a decent enough education to get graduate students invested in their program. The University of New Hampshire is still on its feet, but other private colleges that suffered this lack of general public trust more directly have collapsed entirely. So we've seen the closure of hundred-year-old college institutions because of this rise of distrust.

As I was reading your book, I thought about the rise of RFK Jr.and what we now call the MAHA or “Make American Healthy Again” movement. You note in the book that not everyone you spoke to professed anti-vaccine views, for example, but I was curious to know if you're seeing a link between the trends you're reporting on and the entrenchment of pseudoscience at the national level. Yeah, I absolutely see that connection. Trump tried to appoint a ghost hunter as a federal judge in 2017. The willful disbelief of scientific institutions that's so deeply at the heart of MAGA and MAHA more specifically is also endemic to the paranormal community. But what is different about them is that when I reported on the libertarians, those libertarians were already sort of a lost cause.

I reported on the fringe of the medical community, and the same is true. There was a moment in time when institutions and more collective forms of activism could have scooped those people up, but they lost them. They lost both of those communities. Now, when I look at the paranormal community, I'm seeing an even larger group, given the widespread popularity of paranormal beliefs. But this group is very, very gettable. So they have this deep distress of institutions, and that's very damaging. But they haven't folded into a political box in the way that libertarians and the alternative healing community has. Many of them have a back-to-nature, Earth Mother vibe that is very consistent with collective action, but they haven't yet broken along political lines.

One of the big questions that I had when I finished the book is this: What's a skeptic to do? Skeptics have been working so hard for a long time to debunk creationism and defend vaccines. And yet here we are in this moment where they're really on the back foot. So I'm curious, how do we reach people with paranormal beliefs and get them to trust institutions again without sacrificing the integrity of scientific research?I'm going to tell you that you're not going to like my answer, because nobody does, including myself. So institutions think that by debunking and debasing these beliefs that they are preventing them from becoming legitimized. They don't want to chime in on the legitimacy of these worldviews because according to the scientific process, they are just junk science, they're ridiculous. And what is actually happening is that the scientists and evidence-based institutions are the ones who are becoming delegitimatized. They've kicked too many people out of the tent, and they've been too mean while they're doing it, honestly. And so what you have is a lot of people who are operating in these belief systems who are not necessarily stakeholders in society.

So if you are a psychic or a medium, of which there are 80,000 practicing professionally in the United States today, and think of all the followers that all the psychic mediums have beneath them, you don't necessarily have any stake in society because society doesn't recognize your profession as legitimate. And if you are an alien abductee, you feel like you can't go to the doctor because you get laughed out of the doctor's office. So instead you go to some alternative system. If you're hearing voices in your head, maybe you're going to turn to a ghost hunter for an explanation rather than a therapist or a psychologist. And so in order to overcome that, we need to set up systems and protocols within institutions that honor and find a place for these belief systems. Medical science has found no evidence of God, but there's a chaplain in every hospital, and if a patient comes in to a doctor and starts talking about God, the doctor is not going to distance themselves from that person. So we need to do sort of a multifaceted effort to create stakeholders out of this community. And I think we need to provide the licensing systems and certification systems for psychics, for fortune tellers, for mediums, for ghost hunters, so that all of those people can be held accountable for the power that they hold over the general public. It's okay to go help somebody talk to their recently departed loved one and alleviate some grief, but it's not okay to tell someone that they're cursed and that they have to pay you $12,000 to remove that curse.

In the book, you talk about what happens, biologically, when we die. As someone who used to be a religious believer and is now an atheist, I know that when I changed my views about the afterlife, I fundamentally reoriented my relationship to reality. How fundamental are beliefs about the afterlife to the communities that you're talking about? And is there a point where that belief ever becomes damaging or even harmful?I would say the vast majority, if not 100 percent, of the paranormal community believes in an afterlife. I've never met an atheist Bigfoot hunter.The real danger, I think, is the fragmented nature of the beliefs. When somebody has a license to craft their own reality, and that reality is receiving both tacit and explicit support from others in a broad community of believers, you are opening the door to give people really horrific justifications for really horrific acts. One person I spoke to believed that he was in thrall to some entities from another dimension, and he believed that he needed more or less constant sex in order to keep the dark urges of one of these entities at bay. This belief was embraced by people who were totally benign, nice people within the paranormal community, who essentially endorsed these views because the culture is to endorse every view and to value every personal experience. And then that guy wound up doing some horrific acts of sexual abuse and murder before he was stopped by authorities. So I think the beliefs in themselves are typically benign, but when you have this Petri dish in which anything can grow, that's a problem.

The search for extraterrestrial life has long gone back and forth between scientific curiosity, public fascination and outright scepticism. Recently, scientists claimed the “strongest evidence” of life on a distant exoplanet – a world outside our solar system.

Grandiose headlines often promise proof that we are not alone, but scientists remain cautious. Is this caution unique to the field of astrobiology? In truth, major scientific breakthroughs are rarely accepted quickly. 

Newton's laws of motion and gravity, Wegener's theory of plate tectonics, and human-made climate change all faced prolonged scrutiny before achieving consensus. 

But does the nature of the search for extraterrestrial life mean that extraordinary claims require even more extraordinary evidence? We've seen groundbreaking evidence in this search beforehand, from claims of biosignatures (potential signs of life) in Venus's atmosphere to Nasa rovers finding “leopard spots” – a potential sign of past microbial activity – in a Martian rock. 

Both stories generated a public buzz around the idea that we might be one step closer to finding alien life. But on further inspection, abiotic (non-biological) processes or false detection became more likely explanations.

In the case of the exoplanet, K2-18 b, scientists working with data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) announced the detection of gases in the planet's atmosphere – methane, carbon dioxide, and more importantly, two compounds called dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). As far as we know, on Earth, DMS/DMDS are produced exclusively by living organisms.

Their presence, if accurately confirmed in abundance, would suggest microbial life. The researchers even suggest there's a 99.4% probability that the detection of these compounds wasn't a fluke – a figure that, with repeat observations, could reach the gold standard for statistical certainty in the sciences. This is a figure known as five sigma, which equates to about a one in a million chance that the findings are a fluke.

So why hasn't the scientific community declared this the discovery of alien life? The answer lies in the difference between detection and attribution, and in the nature of evidence itself.

JWST doesn't directly “see” molecules. Instead, it measures the way that light passes through or bounces off a planet's atmosphere. Different molecules absorb light in different ways, and by analysing these absorption patterns – called spectra – scientists infer what chemicals are likely to be present. This is an impressive and sophisticated method – but also an imperfect one. 

It relies on complex models that assume we understand the biological reactions and atmospheric conditions of a planet 120 light years away. The spectra suggesting the existence of DMS/DMDS may be detected because you cannot explain the spectrum without the molecule you've predicted, but it could also result from an undiscovered or misunderstood molecule instead.

Given how momentous the conclusive discovery of extraterrestrial life would be, these assumptions mean that many scientists err on the side of caution. But is this the same for other kinds of science? Let's compare with another scientific breakthrough: the detection and attribution of human-made climate change. 

The relationship between temperature and increases in CO₂ was first observed by the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius in 1927. It was only taken seriously once we began to routinely measure temperature increases. But our atmosphere has many processes that feed CO₂ in and out, many of which are natural.

So the relationship between atmospheric CO₂ and temperature may have been validated, but the attribution still needed to follow.

Carbon has three so-called flavours, known as isotopes. One of these isotopes, carbon-14, is radioactive and decays slowly. When scientists observed an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide but a low volume of carbon-14, they could deduce that the carbon was very old – too old to have any carbon-14. Fossil fuels – coal, oil and natural gas – are composed of ancient carbon and thus are devoid of carbon-14.

So the attribution of anthropogenic climate change was proven beyond reasonable doubt, with 97% acceptance among scientists. In the search for extraterrestrial life, much like climate change, there is a detection and attribution phase, which requires the robust testing of hypotheses and also rigorous scrutiny.

In the case of climate change, we had in situ observations from many sources. This means roughly that we could observe these sources close up. The search for extraterrestrial life relies on repeated observations from the same sensors that are far away. In such situations, systematic errors are more costly. 

Further to this, both the chemistry of atmospheric climate change and fossil fuel emissions were validated with atmospheric tests under lab conditions from 1927 onwards. Much of the data we see touted as evidence for extraterrestrial life comes
from light years away, via one instrument, and without any in situ samples.

The search for extraterrestrial life is not held to a higher standard of scientific rigour but it is constrained by an inability to independently detect and attribute multiple lines of evidence. 

For now, the claims about K2-18 b remain compelling but inconclusive. 

That doesn't mean we aren't making progress. Each new observation adds to a growing body of knowledge about the universe and our place in it. The search continues – not because we're too cautious, but because we are rightly so.

Invented to make beef last long journeys to market, Bovril became a famous British kitchen staple. Less well-known is its link to an odd, pioneering science fiction novel.

A stout black jar of Bovril with a cheery red top lurks in many a British kitchen, next to tins of treacle and boxes of tea. The gooey substance, made of rendered-down beef, salt and other ingredients, can be spread on toast or made into a hot drink, but what many people don't realise is that this old-fashioned comfort food has a surprising link to science fiction.

The ""Bov"" part of the name is easy enough to decipher – from ""bovine"", meaning associated with cattle. But the ""vril"" bit? That's a different story, literally.

In 1871, an anonymous novel was published about a race of super-humans living underground. The narrator of The Coming Race, who has fallen into their realm during a disastrous descent into a mine shaft, is shocked to learn that they are telepathic, thanks to the channeling of a mysterious energy called vril.

""Through vril conductors, they can exercise influence over minds, and bodies animal and vegetable, to an extent not surpassed in the romances of our mystics,"" the narrator realises. Vril gives them strength, as well, rendering them capable of incredible feats. The people call themselves the Vril-Ya, and their society seems in many ways superior to that of the surface dwellers. (Read more from the BBC about the weird aliens of early science fiction.)

The Coming Race was a runaway bestseller. It eventually became clear that the anonymous author was Edward Bulwer-Lytton, the prominent politician and writer (and, to give you a sense of his prose, the first person to start a novel: ""It was a dark and stormy night…""). It became such a cultural touchstone that 20 years later, the Royal Albert Hall in London played host to the Vril-Ya Bazaar and Fete, to raise money for a school of massage ""and electricity"".

In 1895, a writer for The Guardian newspaper started a review of a new novel with this statement: ""The influence of the author of The Coming Race is still powerful, and no year passes without the appearance of stories which describe the manners and customs of peoples in imaginary worlds, sometimes in the stars above, sometimes in the heart of unknown continents in Australia or at the Pole, and sometimes below the waters under the earth."" The work under review? The Time Machine, by H G Wells.

And so you can see how, in the 1870s, when John Johnston, Scottish meat entrepreneur, was coming up with a name for his bottled beef extract, ""vril"" was a tip-of-the-tongue reference. Beef extract was not, on its own, a terribly compelling product. Johnston and other makers of the substance were responding to a demand for beef products in Europe, where raising cattle was prohibitively expensive, and the growth of cattle ranches in South America, Australia and Canada.

There was no way to get fresh meat from these far-flung places to Europe. But rendering the meat down into a paste and sealing it in jars yielded a shelf-stable product that could make the long journeys involved. (Johnston was not the only player in the meat extract game – Justus von Liebig, one of the founders of organic chemistry, founded Leibig's Extract of Meat Company to commercialise his process. The company later went on to produce Oxo bouillon cubes and Fray Bentos pies.)

How do you make a salty meat paste sound nourishing? By linking it to a fantastical substance with great powers. An excitable advert for Bovril in the program from the Vril-Ya Bazaar reads, ""Bo-VRIL is the materialised ideal of the gifted author of 'The Coming Race'… it will exert a marvellous influence on the system, exhilarating without subsequent depression, and increasing the mental and physical vitality without taxing the digestive organs. It is a tonic as well as a food, and forms the most Perfect Nourishment known to Science.""

More like this:

• Can your body become intolerant to meat?

• An odd-tasting oil that packed a healthy punch

• The rise and fall and possible rise of the oyster

The Coming Race has had a somewhat ominous afterlife. Members of the theosophy movement, including the spiritualist medium Madame Blavatsky, claimed that vril was real. Willy Ley, a German rocket enthusiast writing about conspiracy theories in Germany during the rise of the Nazis in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction, said there was a society in Berlin that believed in vril: ""They knew that the book was fiction, Bulwer-Lytton had used that device in order to be able to tell the truth about this 'power'.

""The subterranean humanity was nonsense, Vril was not. Possibly it had enabled the British, who kept it as a State secret, to amass their colonial empire.""

Odd bedfellows, for a cup of meat tea.

Southwest border encounters once again were at record lows in April at just 12,035, according to the latest data compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recording record lows for the third month in a row.

Overall, illegal immigration has been reduced, from 559,009 from February through April of 2024 down to just 34,762 in 2025 since President Donald Trump took office, a drop of 94 percent. It's the lowest ever on record in data dating all the way back to 2000.

The swift change came as President Trump declared a national border emergency on Jan. 20 under the National Emergencies Act, immediately deployed the military to the border, resuming construction of the southern border wall, declaring gangs and drug cartels to be terrorist organizations and expediting their removal under the Alien Enemy Act and by the Attorney General.

Now, more help is on the way after the passage by the U.S. House of Representatives of President Trump's signature legislation the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by a slim 215 to 214 vote on May 22.

The vote came two days after President Trump rallied House Republicans in a closed-door meeting to get the bill across the finish line. Trump closed the deal.

One item that probably didn't hurt was it adds $46.5 billion of critical border wall and other barrier construction funds. When Paul Ryan was House Speaker the American people couldn't get him to add two bricks to the wall in 2017.

The bill also adds another $4.1 billion to hire more Border Patrol agents, $2 billion for retention and signing bonuses, $1 billion for more inspection equipment and $2.7 billion for more surveillance equipment.

The president is always the most powerful when he has Congress' backing, and so it is with securing the southern border that the enfeebled former President Joe Biden left open on purpose to flood the country with millions of illegal alien refugees.

According to data compiled by the United States Border Patrol encounters and the Office of Field Operations inadmissibles by the Office of Immigration Statistics, there were some 10.8 million border encounters all told from January 2021 to November 2024.

Now, the House has done its part to secure the border, with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act headed to the Senate and President Trump hoping to sign the bill into law by July 4. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and President Trump all campaigned on securing the border, and soon they'll be able to show they got it done in Congress. Stay tuned.

According to THR, Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. are reuniting for Psychic Sam, a new comic book about a man who can predict murders before they happen. The project launched on Kickstarter today (as of this writing, they've nearly reached their goal), but there's already talk of a movie.

“It's about a guy with a big gun who goes out and solves problems. He hears voices in his head that tell him to kill bad guys,” said Millar in the announcement. “The only trouble is, the bad guys haven't done anything yet. But every time he ignores it, someone innocent dies. It's only a matter of time before the bodies pile up.” It's been over 15 years since Millar and Romita Jr. worked together on Kick-Ass, which spawned a feature film adaptation and a sequel.

Speaking of movies, producer Ivan Atkinson (The Gentlemen) is onboard to develop Psychic Sam as a feature. In his newsletter, Millar teased, “We'll start spilling the beans on the writers, director and who we've got lined up for Sam over the coming weeks and months. It's UNBELIEVABLY exciting and a chance to work with some old friends again (wait 'til you see WHO). Johnny and I are really pumped about this and can't wait to share what we've been working on.“

Millar said the project came about after he received offers from Marvel to do a big crossover series and from DC to do a Superman project. While he pondered what to do, he got a call from Romita Jr. “Johnny and I did Wolverine together early in my career and loved working together so much that we created Kick-Ass to work on a few years later,” he said. “Kick-Ass spawned movies, t-shirts, Halloween costumes and even Pez dispensers and we've always talked about working together again, but never found the right project. At the same time, Guy Ritchie's brilliant producer Ivan Atkinson and I had been talking about doing a movie together and just looking for the right vehicle. Ivan has produced some of my favourite movies and TV shows in recent years from The Gentlemen to Wrath of Man to Paramount's recent MobLand. So, again, I wanted to make this something great if we were finally going to be working together.” 

He then decided to use the time he'd put aside for the potential Marvel and/or DC projects to develop something new. “Not Marvel, not DC, not even one of my Millarworld projects at Netflix,” he said. “Johnny and I would create something exclusively for the Kickstarter market (which we'd never tried before) and team up with Ivan to make the movie at the same time.“

One of the incentives offered on the Psychic Sam Kickstarter campaign is the chance to appear in one of the issues as a murder victim. Sounds fun.

A spokesperson for Melania called the theory 'completely false'

 First Lady Melania Trump is dismissing a viral online theory that the President Donald Trump's administration is targeting Harvard University after it allegedly rejected their son Barron Trump.


 ""Barron did not apply to Harvard, and any assertion that he, or that anyone on his behalf, applied is completely false,"" a spokesperson for Melania, 55, tells PEOPLE.


 PEOPLE reached out to Harvard University admissions, but did not immediately hear back.


 Barron, 19, is currently a student at New York University. His college admissions have been the subject of speculation since the Trump administration's Tuesday, May 27, decision to slash all remaining federal funding to the Ivy League institution. The move came after Harvard refused to bow to the administration's list of demands issued in April, which targeted Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, the admission of international students and more.


 The remaining federal funds to be cut add up to $100 million, per the New York Times. Over the course of the last month, the Trump administration has frozen about $3.2 billion in grants and contracts with Harvard, the outlet additionally reports.

 The most recent letter delivered to Harvard officials instructs the Ivy League institution to respond to the contract cancellations by June 6. Anything deemed vital will be transferred to other vendors, the New York Times reports.


 Last week, the Trump administration attempted to stop international students from attending Harvard. On Friday, May 23, the university sued the administration and a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, per the Times.


 In April, a researcher at Harvard said that their research monkeys were at risk of being euthanized amid the slashed federal funding. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a stop-work order to researchers that month.


 Sarah Fortune, the lead scientist on a tuberculosis study being conducted at Harvard, told The Boston Globe in April, “It's such a heavy responsibility to work with them and to just be asked to kill them halfway through the study...""


 While Harvard has fought the Trump administration in court, fellow Ivy League institution Columbia University agreed to the administration's demands in March, allowing new government oversight for their Middle East studies department and more.

 The Trump administration asserts that these demands to higher education institutions are aimed at curbing anti-semitism and discrimination against female athletes, but critics of such policies have accused them of actually being anti-Palestinian and anti-transgender athletes.

People who believe in conspiracy theories may be more likely to exhibit specific cognitive biases also found in individuals with subclinical delusional thinking, according to a pair of new studies published in Applied Cognitive Psychology. The research found that cognitive tendencies such as jumping to conclusions, emotional reasoning, and anomalous perception were significantly associated with both general and specific conspiracy beliefs.

Conspiracy theories are widely held beliefs that certain powerful groups secretly conspire to achieve harmful goals. These theories are not supported by strong evidence, yet they persist across cultures and political contexts. Events like the January 6 U.S. Capitol riot and the public embrace of conspiracy narratives by influential figures have made it increasingly important to understand the psychological foundations of conspiratorial thinking.

The researchers behind the current study wanted to explore whether some of the same cognitive patterns found in delusional ideation—typically studied in the context of psychosis—might also be present in individuals who are prone to conspiracy theories. Although conspiracy beliefs are not considered clinical delusions, both involve believing things that lack evidentiary support and often resist counterevidence. By focusing on cognitive biases commonly associated with psychosis, the researchers hoped to clarify whether these patterns help explain why some people are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories.

“I team teach a course at Southern New Hampshire University about the psychology of conspiracy theories,” explained Professor Peter Frost, the corresponding author of the study. “My colleague and I came across research showing that teaching people to recognize logical fallacies and cognitive biases can decrease people's belief in conspiracy theories. That led some student researchers and I to question whether some people who are prone to cognitive biases are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. The other authors on the paper are undergraduates from SNHU.”

The researchers conducted two studies using online surveys distributed through social media platforms such as Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram. Both studies used the Cognitive Bias Questionnaire for Psychosis (CBQp), a 30-item tool designed to measure cognitive biases related to delusional thinking. Participants were not informed of the questionnaire's link to psychosis to avoid biasing their responses.

In the first study, the researchers collected data from 200 participants, the majority of whom were white and female, with an average age of 37. Participants also completed the Generic Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (GCBS), which measures a person's general tendency to endorse conspiracy theories across domains like government, health, and extraterrestrials. (For example, “A small, secret group of people is responsible for making all major world decisions, such as going to war.”)

The second study followed a similar procedure with a new sample of 182 participants, averaging 41 years old. This time, the researchers used a custom questionnaire that asked participants to rate their agreement with 14 specific contemporary conspiracy beliefs. These included theories related to global elites, immigration policy, and public health. (For example, “Moon landings have never happened, and the proofs have been fabricated by NASA and the US government,” “The current U.S. border policy and/or certain groups of people are secretly doing things to change the racial mix of the country,” and “The earth is actually flat and/or hollow.”)

In both studies, participants answered questions from the CBQp assessing seven types of cognitive biases: anomalous perception (perceiving stimuli that are not present), catastrophizing (expecting the worst), dichotomous thinking (seeing things in black-and-white terms), emotional reasoning (relying on feelings over logic), intentionalizing (assuming others' actions are intentional and malicious), jumping to conclusions (making snap judgments without sufficient evidence), and interpreting ambiguous events as threatening.

In the first study, the researchers found that five of the seven cognitive biases were positively associated with generalized conspiracy beliefs. The strongest relationship was with jumping to conclusions, which had a correlation coefficient of 0.67. Anomalous perception also showed a strong relationship (r = 0.54), followed by moderate correlations with intentionalizing, interpreting ambiguous events as threatening, and emotional reasoning. Catastrophizing and dichotomous thinking did not show statistically significant correlations in this sample.

Together, the cognitive biases explained more than half (56%) of the variation in participants' general tendency to believe in conspiracies. This finding supports the idea that people who are more susceptible to certain thinking errors are also more likely to endorse conspiratorial ideas, even if they are not experiencing clinical symptoms of delusion.

In the second study, which focused on specific conspiracy beliefs, the researchers found a similar pattern. Jumping to conclusions was again the strongest predictor (r = 0.57), followed by anomalous perception (r = 0.45) and intentionalizing (r = 0.32). Emotional reasoning and threat interpretation also showed modest correlations, while catastrophizing and dichotomous thinking did not reach statistical significance.

Although the second study explained a smaller portion of the variance in conspiracy belief (about 37%), the pattern of findings closely mirrored those from the first study. This suggests that the same cognitive biases may underlie both general beliefs in conspiracies and more context-specific conspiracy theories tied to current events.

“I was not sure how this study would turn out,” Frost told PsyPost. “We kept seeing research showing that belief in conspiracy theories, like QAnon, tends to occur for emotional reasons. It offers justification and scapegoating that, at least in the short run, addresses emotional issues. Our research shows that some cognitive biases, like jumping to conclusions and intentionality, are strongly correlated with conspiratorial thinking. Even if conspiracy theories serve some emotional need, it is easier to justify them if you possess certain cognitive biases.”

The results contribute to a growing body of research showing that conspiracy thinking is not simply a matter of ignorance or personality but may stem from underlying cognitive patterns. While belief in conspiracies is not itself a sign of mental illness, the study found that biases commonly observed in people with subclinical delusional ideation—such as interpreting random or ambiguous information as meaningful or hostile—are also present among conspiracy believers.

“There is a part of our population that, although not clinically delusional, engage in thinking that is associated with delusional thinking,” Frost explained. “They tend to jump to conclusions without carefully considering evidence. They perceive things that others don't, like ghosts or spirits. They suspect intention where there is no evidence for it. They might substitute emotional reactions for reason when making important decisions. These are the risk factors that make some people more susceptible to believing in conspiracy theories.”

“Before social media and the internet, we had to mix with people that might not share our same views. Today, if you believe that some people are actually lizards—the reptilian conspiracy theory—you can surround yourself with like-minded people in a chat. Even though only 4% of people tend to believe in this theory, encountering others who have a similar belief can embolden a cognitive bias that might not have manifested had the person been in more mixed company.”

While the studies offer valuable insights, they have some limitations. Both relied on self-reported data and non-random online samples, which may not be fully representative of the general population. The participants were disproportionately white and female, limiting the generalizability of the findings across different demographic groups.

Another limitation is that the study design was correlational. It cannot determine whether cognitive biases cause conspiracy beliefs or if belief in conspiracies reinforces these biases over time. Longitudinal or experimental research would be needed to explore questions of causality.

“We don't know if cognitive biases make certain people more susceptible to conspiracy theory belief or if going down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories results in greater susceptibility towards cognitive biases,” Frost noted. “There may also be a bidirectional influence.”

Despite the caveats, the research offers new evidence that conspiratorial thinking is closely tied to specific patterns of cognitive bias. While not diagnostic of mental illness, these biases reflect systematic ways of processing information that can leave people more vulnerable to unverified and often harmful beliefs.

“The ultimate goal for me is to understand the causes behind why conspiracy theory belief spreads,” Frost said. “Once we understand the causes better, it would be easier to help prevent it or remediate it. Too many of my students tell me how belief in conspiracy theories has led to rifts in their families. This is a trend, now in the mainstream, that is causing significant stress for far too many families and friends.”

“I also believe that our research suggests that too many people are susceptible to cognitive biases and logical fallacies. Critical thinking or at least recognition of illogical arguments could help prevent people from believing in disinformation. A democratic society relies on basic logic and critical thinking. Our educational system needs to teach this at an early age, along with media literacy.”

The study, “Cognitive Biases Associated With Specific and Generalized Beliefs in Conspiracy Theory,” was authored by Peter J. Frost, Alyssa Simard, Lauren Iraci, Serena Stack, Carolyn Gould-Faulkner, Abby Alexakos, Manny Fernandez, and Shubham Oza.

A new study suggests life feels like it speeds up during periods of personal growth and satisfaction. Rather than routine making time seem short, researchers found that fulfilled, nostalgic memories are more likely to make the past feel like a blur.

A study using brain scans shows that flashes of insight reorganize neural patterns in the visual cortex and engage memory and emotion regions, helping embed the solution more deeply in long-term memory.

A new study finds that a therapeutic video game, AKL-T01, improved task-switching and processing speed in people with post-COVID cognitive deficits. While sustained attention did not improve, participants reported better quality of life and reduced fatigue after six weeks of gameplay.

A new study reveals that creative metaphor generation involves shifting patterns of brain activity, with alpha oscillations playing a key role at different stages of the process, offering fresh insight into the neural dynamics behind verbal creativity.

A new study using direct brain recordings reveals that human economic decision-making is not localized to a single brain region. Instead, multiple areas work together, with high-frequency activity encoding risk, reward probability, and the final choice itself.

A study combining brain scans and gameplay data reveals that players with more efficient visual attention and stronger white matter connections excel at StarCraft II. The results highlight how neural traits shape success in cognitively demanding video games.

A new neuroimaging study reveals that listening to emotionally charged music during memory recall can change how we remember events. The music not only shaped what participants remembered but also altered the emotional tone of their memories one day later.

A new study suggests that unusual experiences like déjà vu or premonitions are not only common but linked to a distinct psychological trait called subconscious connectedness. Researchers found that people high in this trait reported significantly more anomalous experiences.

ASKAP J1832-0911, which is periodically throwing out pulses of radio waves and X-rays, could be a brand-new cosmic object.

Astronomers have discovered a mysterious object flashing strange signals from deep space, and they have no idea what it is.

The object, named ASKAP J1832-0911, spits out pulses of radio waves and X-rays for two minutes straight, once every 44 minutes.

Detected by Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and NASA's Chandra X-ray observatory, the strange repeating signals are currently unexplained — and unravelling this cosmic mystery could reveal new physics, according to the researchers who discovered it. The team published their findings May 28 in the journal Nature.

""This object is unlike anything we have seen before,"" lead study author Andy Wang, an astronomer at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, said in a statement. ""ASKAP J1831-0911 could be a magnetar (the core of a dead star with powerful magnetic fields), or it could be a pair of stars in a binary system where one of the two is a highly magnetised white dwarf (a low-mass star at the end of its evolution).""

""However, even those theories do not fully explain what we are observing,"" Wang added. ""This discovery could indicate a new type of physics or new models of stellar evolution.""

ASKAP J1832-0911 is a long-period transient (LPT), a class of rare and extreme astrophysical events that sweep out beams of radio waves like cosmic lighthouses. First discovered in 2022, thus far ten LPTs have been catalogued by astronomers.

Unlike traditional pulsars, which are produced by neutron stars and spit out radio signals every few seconds or milliseconds, LPTs emit pulses at intervals of minutes or hours apart — a period previously thought to be impossible. This has made the cause of the signals, and how they are able to switch on and off at long and regular intervals, a mystery among astronomers.

After discovering the signals using the ASKAP telescope, the researchers turned to the Chandra X-ray observatory (which was coincidentally pointing at the same patch of sky) to double check what they had found. Chandra's observations confirmed ASKAP J1832-0911's presence, while also making the first-ever detection of an LPT in X-rays.

—Immensely powerful 'magnetar' is emitting wobbly radio signals in our galaxy — and scientists can't explain them

—Strange radio bursts that outshine entire galaxies may come from colliding neutron stars

—Faint radio signal from ancient star cluster could be rare 'missing link' black hole

""Discovering that ASKAP J1832-0911 was emitting X-rays felt like finding a needle in a haystack,"" Wang said. ""The ASKAP radio telescope has a wide field view of the night sky, while Chandra observes only a fraction of it. So, it was fortunate that Chandra observed the same area of the night sky at the same time.""

The astronomers believe that the detection of an LPT emitting radio waves and X-rays simultaneously could offer them a valuable clue as to what's producing them, as any theory that explains the object must now account for both types of emission.

To assemble more of the puzzle, the researchers suggest that more detections using radio and X-ray telescope pairs should be made.

""Finding one such object hints at the existence of many more,"" second author Nanda Rea, an astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute for Space Studies in Spain, said in the statement. ""The discovery of its transient X-ray emission opens fresh insights into their mysterious nature.""

By most popular accounts, the universe started with a bang some 13.8 billion years ago. But what happened before the Big Bang? And how do we know it happened at all?

Cosmologist Niayesh Afshordi and science communicator Phil Halper offer a tour of the peculiar possibilities: bouncing and cyclic universes, time loops, creations from nothing, multiverses, black hole births, string theories, and holograms.

Incorporating insights from Afshordi's cutting-edge research and Halper's original interviews with scientists like Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose, and Alan Guth, Afshordi and Halper compare these models for the origin of our origins, showing each theory's strengths and weaknesses and explaining new attempts to test these notions.

But most of all, Afshordi and Halper show that this search is filled with wonder, discovery, and community—all essential for remembering a forgotten cosmic past.

Niayesh Afshordi is professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Waterloo and associate faculty at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada. His prizewinning research focuses on competing models for the early universe, dark energy, dark matter, black holes, holography, and gravitational waves.

Phil Halper is a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and a science popularizer. He is the creator of the popular YouTube series Before the Big Bang, which has had several million views. His astronomy images have been featured in major media outlets including The Washington Post, the BBC, and The Guardian, and he has published several papers in peer-reviewed journals.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Former smartphone titan BlackBerry is back, with a new CEO and autonomous driving tech at the wheel","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/rob-magazine/article-blackberry-ceo-john-giamatteo/","Wed, 28 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

BlackBerry is nothing like the company whose smartphones once ruled the world. Now it's looking to dominate another market entirely — inside your car

As a kid, John Giamatteo had a single dream: to one day lead an NFL team to the Super Bowl, just like his underdog-turned-icon hero, Joe Namath.

But by his sophomore year of high school, he knew it wasn't going to happen. He'd virtually stopped growing, ending up at 5-foot-9, and his coach dropped him from quarterback to defence. That's when his dad—a one-time phone repairman-turned-manager—gave his crestfallen son a pep talk. “He pulled a pen out of his pocket and said, ‘You're going to make a career with this pen. You're going to get an education, and you're going to have a professional career. That's going to be your journey,'” Giamatteo recalls more than 40 years later. 

That journey led him to begin his career at Nortel Networks in the 1980s. Now the native of Long Island, N.Y., has the first quarterback gig of his career, leading another notorious Canadian tech company: BlackBerry Ltd.

Before we go any further, yes, BlackBerry is still a thing. If you haven't been paying attention (and you're not alone), the company that popularized the smartphone and built Waterloo, Ont., into a tech hub, gave up on handsets in 2016, and went all in on software and services. Through its QNX subsidiary, it's now a leading supplier to automakers of the sophisticated operating systems that underpin autonomous and advanced driver-assistance functions. If your car stops you from veering into oncoming traffic, you probably have BlackBerry to thank. It also sells secure communications software to governments, and critical infrastructure providers like ports and nuclear power plants.

That's not to say the company formerly known as Research In Motion was in particularly good shape when Giamatteo became CEO in December 2023. Under his predecessor, John Chen—hired in November 2013 to be its saviour—revenue growth was tepid, and the company was bleeding cash. BlackBerry was a jumble of businesses, and the board was considering a spinout of QNX to revive the stock, which was languishing at under $4, about where it had been 20 years earlier. (All currency in U.S. dollars.)

A year and a half later, BlackBerry is on its most stable footing since the iPhone and Android blew up its business in the late 2000s. Giamatteo and his team have slashed $150 million in annual costs, refinanced its debt, cut the headcount by 37%, shed more than a quarter of its real estate space and sold its once-promising cybersecurity business, Cylance, for a huge discount. BlackBerry has also narrowed its net loss to near break-even—though the bigger story is that adjusted operating earnings have soared, and it's generating cash again. 

The stock jumped in December on the Cylance news and soared above $6 early this year, though it's since given up its gains thanks to the economic uncertainty unleashed by Donald Trump. But company followers are happy with the rebirth in motion. “The tough decisions that needed to be made have been made,” says Niall O'Keeffe, co-founder of Fifthdelta, a U.K. hedge fund manager that bought into BlackBerry in 2021. Giamatteo, he says, has put BlackBerry “back on offence, where it's generating cash and can actually invest in the fast-growing areas.” 

Even EdgePoint Wealth Management—which invested in BlackBerry between 2008 and 2012, and later called that a mistake—has bought back in, amassing 12.2 million shares.

With revenue of $535 million in its last fiscal year, the company now has greater control over its destiny than at its 2011 peak, when that topline number was $19.9 billion. It “has completely turned the corner,” says BlackBerry's chair, Dick Lynch, who oversees a board that has largely turned over in the past couple of years. “We know the businesses we're in, we know how to optimize those businesses, and we know what we need to do to grow them.” Giamatteo, Lynch adds, “has been a very positive, transformative event.” 

But investors expect more. “It's always going to be, ‘What will you do next year?'” Giamatteo says. One part of that answer is: Deliver solid revenue growth at QNX. But it also means confronting a decision in the not-too-distant future that could cut much of BlackBerry's ties to Waterloo. “Anything is on the table if it makes sense for shareholders.” 

Giamatteo is nothing like BlackBerry CEOs past. He's not mercurial and sharkish like Jim Balsillie or a technologically consumed genius like Mike Lazaridis. He certainly bears no resemblance to the soft-spoken Thorsten Heins, the towering German technocrat who briefly succeeded the company's longtime co-CEOs. And he's a dramatic departure—a welcome one, according to employees—from the aloof and imperious Chen. As CEO, Chen had his own car and driver (paid for by BlackBerry), flew by private jet for work (or, if a jet wasn't available, in first class—a stipulation in his contract), and travelled with an entourage that included a security detail and chief of staff. 

Giamatteo, meanwhile, is perfectly happy to fly coach on cross-country hops (he's based in Dallas but typically visits Canada at least once a quarter). His hotel of choice is distinctly middlebrow, too: Hilton's Homewood Suites or La Quinta. 

“He's a kind of Bruce Springsteen of the executive world,” says chief people officer Jennifer Armstrong-Owen, who joined Giamatteo at BlackBerry after working with him at Seattle-based RealNetworks in the 2000s, one of several former co-workers who followed him on his Canadian adventure. “He's the same person to the bellhop, to the waiter, as he is to a CEO.” 

With his slicked-back salt-and-pepper hair, fondness for business-casual attire and distinctive accent reminiscent of fellow Long Islander Billy Crystal, Giamatteo comes off as a congenial what-you-see-is-what-you-get everyman (one who says “holy cow” a lot). He's not the visionary type. “I'm more of the operational guy who's making the trains run on time,” he says.

Chen was no visionary, either, but he was paid like one. When he was hired in 2013, fresh off his turnaround of database software vendor Sybase, Chen received stock awards worth more than $84 million, with a salary of $1 million and a guaranteed annual bonus of $2 million. When his contract was renewed in 2018, he got another $106.3 million worth of stock awards. Giamatteo, meanwhile, is paid $700,000 annually and can earn up to that amount in bonus, though it's not guaranteed. His stock award upon becoming CEO was worth just $6 million.

“I like to think of myself as a pretty simple person,” says Giamatteo, who has three adult daughters with his wife, Stephanie. “I live a private life. I'm very family oriented. I generally don't get too involved in that kind of media stuff.” 

Indeed, it took a year to persuade him to sit down with Report on Business magazine for his first media interview as CEO. That might not be due solely to Giamatteo's modesty. In April 2024, four months after his appointment, a former executive sued both Giamatteo and BlackBerry for sexual harassment, discrimination and wrongful termination. By November, a California judge had tossed all complaints against him and many (but not all) claims against BlackBerry. “I'm very pleased that all of the claims against me were dismissed with prejudice, which is a statement,” he says (this means the claims can't be refiled). “I know who I am. I know my values that I was brought up with.”

By his own account, Giamatteo had an “extraordinarily happy” childhood in the largely middle-class hamlet of Bellmore, N.Y., on the south shore of Long Island, within walking distance of his extended family. When his two older siblings moved out, they stayed in Bellmore, too. “It was definitely our family town,” he says. The Giamatteos were staunch Italian Catholics, and every weekend they piled into the station wagon and headed to church, where John was an altar boy. When he wasn't at mass or in school, he was usually outside playing street hockey, baseball and, of course, football. 

In 1986, during his second year of undergrad at St. John's University, a private Catholic school in Queens, Giamatteo had two life-altering experiences: He spent a term in Europe, which opened his eyes to the world beyond Bellmore; and he applied for a summer internship at Nortel, at his sister-in-law's suggestion. He spent the summer at Nortel's Wall Street office, and after graduating from St. John's, he returned as a financial analyst supporting regional sales teams. 

For Nortel, those were the glory days. AT&T had been busted up earlier that decade, and all those recently hatched “Baby Bells” were upgrading their networks with digital switching and transmission technology. Giamatteo gained notice in the early 1990s after he internally championed a team member's suggestion that Nortel aggressively lowball its bid for a big switching contract. By foregoing margins on the deal, Nortel could win higher-margin sales of follow-on offerings once the equipment was installed. The gambit worked, and it influenced how Nortel bid on contracts elsewhere.

Giamatteo joined Nortel's leadership development program, rotating through sales, customer support and product roles before landing a coveted international posting in 1999 in Asia, overseeing a sevenfold sales increase in Korea. After the telecom bubble burst in 2001, he was sent to Japan to rationalize the business and return it to profitability—which he did. By his late 30s, Giamatteo was president of Nortel Asia Pacific, with his eye on the CEO suite.

It wasn't meant to be at Nortel, however. After an accounting scandal consumed the company, Giamatteo moved to Seattle in 2005, becoming chief operating officer of streaming pioneer RealNetworks, where he lasted five years before his young family got tired of the rain. In 2010, they uprooted for Dallas, where he became COO of an insurance software provider called Solera Global Technology. He was supposed to run the business while the CEO focused on the big picture, but things didn't go according to plan. “Four months into the job,” he says, “I realized the CEO didn't really want to let go.” 

Giamatteo demonstrates new technology by Seeing Machines, a QNX partner, which helps keep drivers focused by detecting when they've fallen asleep, are using their phone, or have stopped watching the road.

From there, he moved to cybersecurity business AVG Technologies, again as COO, to help take it public. “We needed someone who had the maturity, could build the systems to take things we were doing and grow it,” says Dale Fuller, then AVG's chair. “John was an integral part of that. He had the natural skills to be a leader.”

AVG went public, but the board passed over Giamatteo in favour of a higher-profile outsider as CEO. Disappointed, he hit the road again, landing in 2013 at cybersecurity giant McAfee as president and chief revenue officer of its consumer business. Private equity firm TPG bought control of McAfee in 2017 and signed senior leaders to three-year contracts. When those were up, Giamatteo was packaged out. 

At 53, he was well off, unemployed and unable to work for a rival for a year. As the pandemic took hold, he got fit, golfed and cooked, wondering whether to get back in the game. 

Then BlackBerry called looking for someone to run its cybersecurity division. Even though it wasn't for the top job, Giamatteo was keen, once his non-compete ended. He figured the CEO post would open up before long, since Chen was in his mid-60s. “He'd been a bridesmaid for a long time,” says John Dimitropoulos, who worked with Giamatteo at Nortel, RealNetworks and McAfee, and is now BlackBerry's chief strategy officer. “He said to me, ‘I think this is the one.'”

By the time Giamatteo joined BlackBerry in 2021, Chen's lustre was long gone. The veteran Silicon Valley turnaround artist had arrived eight years earlier, initially skeptical he could fix the floundering smartphone franchise but lured with that rich stock award. BlackBerry was in full-blown crisis. Its touchscreen phones, based on the new BlackBerry 10 operating system, were a flop. During Chen's first few months, BlackBerry shed thousands of employees, wrote down unsold phone inventory and sold off most of its real estate. That year, BlackBerry posted a $5.9-billion net loss. 

Chen was loath to let the phone business die on his watch, but after three years of further declines, he gave up. Fortunately, the business remained a significant source of cash. CrackBerry users who clung to their devices kept paying service fees that yielded $3.5 billion during Chen's tenure. And its server software, originally used by organizations to manage their BlackBerrys, and later other mobile devices, remained a viable, albeit declining, business known today as BlackBerry Unified Endpoint Management. 

Meanwhile, BlackBerry copied other fallen tech stars by shaking down companies it claimed were using its trove of intellectual property, suing if necessary to get them to pay for licences. Those efforts generated another $1.4 billion in revenue over the eight fiscal years ended Feb. 28, 2023. The company even won a $940-million arbitration award from chipmaker Qualcomm in 2017 after overpaying upfront royalties for phone sales that never materialized. 

While those revenues kept BlackBerry alive, it couldn't remain a corporate fungus feeding off decaying assets forever. Chen believed its traditional strength in cybersecurity was a solid foundation for expansion. In 2014 and 2015, BlackBerry paid a combined $765 million for three companies that today make up the core of its Secure Communications business: secure messaging company Secusmart; AtHoc, maker of a crisis communications platform for government agencies; and Good Technology, a rival device-management business.

The stock had a decent run, and in spring 2018, BlackBerry reported its first annual net profit in six years. “I would not call us in a turnaround mode anymore,” Chen told Bloomberg TV. “Now we're really delivering.”

Lead director Prem Watsa, who'd recruited Chen and was chair of the compensation, nomination and governance committee, negotiated a five-year contract extension for the CEO. Later that year, BlackBerry bought Cylance for $1.4 billion, its biggest acquisition ever.

But BlackBerry's results remained choppy, and none of the acquired businesses seemed to blossom. Plus, the senior ranks were in constant flux: A former Boeing and Cisco executive joined as president in 2019 and left that same year. His replacement lasted just 17 months. Cylance founder Stuart McClure got $29 million in restricted equity to stick around after the acquisition because the board deemed his leadership critical. He bolted after just a few months, leaving behind his earn-out.

Chen's autocratic, distant management style didn't help. “He'd remind you in executive meetings that he was the decider,” says one BlackBerry insider. Few employees ever got the chance to meet him, since he worked from an office in San Ramon, Calif. (Chen didn't respond to an interview request.)

Meanwhile, Chen's pay package generated unwelcome attention, which picked up after BlackBerry's stock price quadrupled and then retreated over a few days in January 2021. Retail investors, spurred by social media investment mavericks like WallStreetBets, were speculating wildly in shares of faded companies like GameStop, AMC and, yes, BlackBerry. The “meme stock” moniker embarrassed the company's employees and perplexed regulators. “No one had ever seen that sort of thing before,” says Lynch. “It was a disruption to the evidence of what progress we were actually making.” 

CFO Tim Foote, who led investor relations at the time, had built BlackBerry's credibility with institutional investors, only to see many sell into the rally. “And then they were all gone,” he says. “By the time the tide goes out, you were back to square one.”

Even worse, the meme-stock surge unlocked three million of Chen's restricted stock units that were meant to vest when they hit certain price thresholds—but from a fundamentals-driven share-price appreciation, not a bogus rally. Chen's windfall automatically triggered the sale of $24.8 million of his stock to cover his tax bill. That wasn't his fault, but the optics were terrible.

At BlackBerry's annual meeting in June 2022, goaded by proxy advisers including Glass Lewis & Co., shareholders flunked the company in a non-binding say-on-pay vote. They also nearly voted out Watsa, whose Fairfax Financial is BlackBerry's largest investor. Watsa left the board in February 2024.

Chen's final year at BlackBerry was grim. A $600-million sale of its legacy smartphone patents fell through when the buyer couldn't raise the necessary financing, and BlackBerry finally unloaded the portfolio in early 2023 for $200 million plus future royalties. That prolonged sale process suppressed licensing revenue, which diminished cash flow. So did weaker financial performance by its cybersecurity business. Cash and short-term investments dwindled, and BlackBerry faced a deadline to repay $365 million in debentures in late 2023 (which it partly financed by issuing higher-yielding notes after Giamatteo took over). The stock reached its lowest level in 20-plus years, down 40% from when Chen joined. 

There was little the board could do, however. Chen's contract contained a time bomb. If he was terminated—or even if the board reduced his authority, duties or responsibilities, or made a material change to strategy that he disagreed with—it would force the vesting of a $90-million cash payment. In its weakened state, BlackBerry couldn't afford to ditch him. “It totally neutralized the board,” says another company insider. “They were not able to make John do anything he didn't want to do. They were stuck with him” until his contract expired on Nov. 3, 2023. 

By that time, the board had a good idea who its next CEO would be. It had quietly initiated a process to select someone who understood the business and its complexities, and who would “be credible in all aspects, to all audiences,” as Lynch puts it. Giamatteo, he says, “had a following of people who thought he was really good at what he did.” 

The quarterback from Long Island was finally getting the callup—albeit to what looked like a last-place team. 

It was mid-October 2024, and analysts were gathered at the New York Stock Exchange for BlackBerry's first investor day of the Giamatteo era. The morning event kicked off with a video that started with one question on a big screen: “Do you know what the company BlackBerry does today?”

What followed were responses from random people on the streets of New York. “Uhhh, I didn't know they still existed,” one man said. A young woman recoiled in disbelief that BlackBerry was even still alive.

Moments later, Giamatteo emerged onstage. “When people hear the name BlackBerry,” he told the crowd, “quite often one question comes to mind: ‘BlackBerry, are you still around?'”

Over the next few hours, he and his team would highlight what they'd been up to over the past 10 months. Breaking the ice with a little humility signalled Giamatteo wasn't afraid to address the company's challenges and faded legacy.

Giamatteo's down-to-earth leadership style has already lightened the mood inside BlackBerry. He readily mixes with employees and is “not this iconic thing you're never going to talk to who stands on a pedestal. He's just in the group—no entourage, no security,” says QNX's COO, John Wall. “It's a completely different style” than Chen's. 

Phil Kurtz, BlackBerry's chief legal officer, adds that when Giamatteo holds town halls, he feeds off employees' energy rather than just broadcasting remotely to the masses. “He wants and accepts very candid feedback,” says Kurtz. “It's easy to feel appreciated.”

BlackBerry has undergone more than a culture shift. Giamatteo has remade how the company operates. And while it hasn't quite regained darling status among investors, hundreds of millions of people still use BlackBerry's products. 

The company's standout division is QNX, whose sophisticated operating system dominates the so-called software-defined vehicle (SDV) space even more than BlackBerry once did the handset market. Today, roughly one-fifth of cars built each year are software-defined, and QNX is in 90% of them. That's more than 255 million vehicles with QNX on board. And as automakers increasingly shift to building computers on wheels, QNX sits in pole position.

When two ex-Citadel hedge fund managers set up Fifthdelta in 2021 to invest in industrial companies in the automotive space, everyone they surveyed talked up SDV. “And what was consistent across every original equipment manufacturer, every car company, was QNX,” says O'Keeffe. When they started digging, he says, “we got very excited.” Car makers were abandoning their own software-development efforts and choosing QNX. The product was cheap—automakers pay an average of about $10 per car—so those that chose QNX were unlikely to replace it. Within months, BlackBerry was Fifthdelta's top holding.

QNX was founded in 1980, building the nucleus of powerful operating systems. Its tech was embedded in Cisco routers, nuclear power plants, air traffic control systems and credit card authorization systems. By the time BlackBerry bought the Ottawa-based company in 2010 for $200 million (it had been owned since 2004 by car stereo maker Harman International), it was also making digital infotainment systems for upscale cars. That's not what interested Lazaridis, however: He wanted QNX engineers to build BlackBerry's next mobile-device OS. BlackBerry “couldn't have cared less” about QNX's automotive venture, says Kurtz, who worked on the deal. “It paid its bills. No one did anything to kill it, but it wasn't given a ton of oxygen.” From 2010 to 2014, says Wall, who led QNX's car software group, “nobody was paying attention to me.” 

Well, maybe no one inside BlackBerry. While its handset business disintegrated in Waterloo, Apple set up shop next to the QNX facility in Ottawa and began picking off dozens of its engineers to work on its autonomous electric vehicle project, Titan. The defectors included QNX founder Dan Dodge, a University of Waterloo prodigy who preached that software was the key to modern life. (Apple came after Wall, too, but he says he preferred working with customers to hatching internal projects.) Meanwhile, car makers were adopting Google's Android OS for their infotainment needs, and Wall was concerned his business would disappear, “just like what happened to BlackBerry.” 

There was an off-ramp, however: Wall's group saw that it could develop other systems inside increasingly digitized vehicles. The group pivoted hard in the mid-2010s, developing advanced driver-assistance and safety systems, then broadened its offerings so customers could use its platform elsewhere in the car, too. QNX was conceding the infotainment war to conquer a much bigger opportunity. By the 2020s, big automakers were asking it to build a vehicle-wide foundational platform that would underpin the digital cockpit, as well as the instrument clusters, surround-view sensor systems—and even support infotainment applications.

The ploy worked. In fiscal 2025 (ended Feb. 28), QNX generated revenue of $236 million, up from $130 million in 2021. The long-term fundamentals remain sound, despite some automaker delays and industry uncertainty due to Trump's tariff war. BlackBerry is also exploring further uses for QNX tech in the medical, industrial and rail sectors.

As Giamatteo became CEO in late 2023, BlackBerry abandoned a plan to take QNX public but retain majority control. Investors weren't keen on it, says Giamatteo, and he didn't think it was the solution to creating near-term value. Instead, he zeroed in on BlackBerry's cybersecurity division, where he'd spent two years as president. During that time, Giamatteo overhauled its go-to-market sales and marketing strategy, and consolidated its bloated R&D group. With the entire company under his charge, he established QNX and cyber as two standalone units, and focused on stopping the rapid decline in BlackBerry's cash reserves, in part by eliminating roles in finance, legal, HR and IT. 

As Giamatteo and his team dug deeper, they isolated the cybersecurity unit's biggest problem: Cylance. It had come to market with anti-virus software driven by artificial intelligence that protected devices from the cloud. Revenues grew robustly, reaching $151 million the first full year BlackBerry owned it. But as people worked remotely in the pandemic, making networked devices more vulnerable to attacks, market demand shifted toward products that provided detection, response and remediation—known as EDR—capabilities. While Cylance tried to stop malware invasions, EDR also fought the problem from inside, like battling a rodent infestation. Big companies embraced EDR, and demand for Cylance from Fortune 500 companies withered. Cylance shifted to serving smaller companies, but sales kept declining. It tried to catch up by building its own EDR offerings but that was expensive, and larger competitors vastly outspent it on marketing. By last October's investor day, Cylance was on track to generate $90 million in revenue and lose more than $50 million that fiscal year. BlackBerry couldn't afford to keep that up, Giamatteo told analysts.

Another revelation: Cylance's losses obscured a decent bottom-line performance from the rest of the cyber unit. With Cylance, it was barely breaking even. Without Cylance, it was a cash cow, generating $52.3 million in operating profits last year. The management team decided Cylance was “probably a better asset outside the company,” says Giamatteo.

In late 2024, BlackBerry announced it was selling Cylance to U.S.-based Arctic Wolf Networks, paying $144.6 million, barely 10% of what BlackBerry had shelled out for it. Nonetheless, analysts were pleasantly surprised—it was like found money for an asset they'd deemed worthless. 

The cyber unit (since rebranded as Secure Communications) now has a narrower customer set of governments and critical infrastructure providers, which has focused its sales and marketing efforts, according to Jean Treadwell, the group's marketing VP, and another recruit who worked with Giamatteo at Nortel and McAfee. 

But the rest of Secure Communications will probably find itself following Cylance out the door eventually. The unit might now have a better financial profile, but O'Keeffe says it remains a hodgepodge of a business that's far less exciting than its corporate sibling. “Selling is the outcome we'd like to get to eventually,” says O'Keeffe.

Blackberry's standout division is QNX, whose sophisticated operating system dominates the software-defined vehicle (SDV) space even more than it once did the handset market.

It's not hard to see why. QNX has a strong long-term growth story. Secure Communications doesn't, and it's dragging down BlackBerry's valuation. Though the units are roughly the same size, QNX is worth far more. CIBC analyst Todd Coupland values it at seven times estimated fiscal 2027 sales and 30 times forecast operating earnings. He pegs the cyber unit's value at three times 2027 sales and 12 times earnings. That makes QNX worth between $2.25 and $5.01 per share, compared to just $0.39 to $1.95 for Secure Communications.

BlackBerry has plenty of options. Secure Communications is profitable, resilient and has great customers in a solid market—the ideal profile for a private equity takeout. BlackBerry could sell it and invest the proceeds in QNX, acquire another company, buy back shares or retire its $200-million debt. Or it could hang on and try to squeeze out some growth—though opportunities are limited. Its best hope is Secusmart, whose SecuSuite secure messaging platform features tight protocols and locked-down features that make it a strong alternative to Signal for sensitive government communications—a fact BlackBerry has promoted around Washington, D.C., in the wake of the Signalgate scandal. 

Or BlackBerry could wait out the current market volatility and keep banking cash from Secure Communications. “Those are the big questions getting asked” by the company's leadership, says Dimitropoulos. “Which of those gives the greatest shareholder value and the best return? And if there's a market slowdown, is cash king—or is cash flow king? Is having a big balance sheet the right thing to do in a downturn, or making a bunch of cash flow so you can fund your business through the downturn that might be ahead?” 

Of course, selling Secure Communications would greatly shrink BlackBerry's presence in Waterloo, and it's a good bet the remaining company would take a new name (probably QNX). Giamatteo doesn't seem particularly sentimental about the prospect. For now, he says, selling is not part of the plan. “But if we felt the best outcome for shareholders was to divest the business, I don't think we'd hesitate.”

But let's give the guy a minute. He's barely arrived, and he's already done what his predecessors failed to do: stop the bleeding and give BlackBerry options. When your biggest problem is figuring out what to do with your growing pile of cash, that's a good start.

Out with the old, in with the younger – that's the only way to explain a baffling new poll which revealed that a majority of New York Democrats would prefer to be represented by far-Left Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), who the White House has already started to call the “Democrat Party leader”, than the more moderate Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. It's a stinging rebuke of Schumer's leadership, at a moment when the Democrats are scrambling to reinvent themselves after last November's nationwide defeat.

The poll, which was commissioned by The Jewish Voters Action Network, pitted Schumer against AOC in a hypothetical Senate primary race. AOC led Schumer by an impossible-to-ignore 54 per cent to 33 per cent among likely Democrat voters – and 45 per cent to 33 per cent among Jewish Democrats. The latter figure is particularly eyebrow-raising considering AOC's long paper-trail of anti-Israel views and votes.

Back in 2021, AOC cried on the House floor when a bill providing funding for Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system passed. Then in May 2024, AOC was one of the first – and certainly one of the most influential – US politicians to brand Israel's operations in Gaza a “genocide”. In 2019, AOC helped back a resolution put forth by fellow “Squad” member Ilhan Omar defending boycotts, in what was widely seen to be a show of support for the anti-Israel BDS movement. And last October, AOC called upon the US to impose an arms embargo against Israel.

The disconnect between AOC's strident anti-Israel viewpoints and her popularity among Jewish Democrats is striking. It is also alarming – and not just for Schumer, who at 74 is now serving his fifth term in the Senate while contending with a 55 per cent unfavourability rate. The AOC numbers arrive as the Congresswoman makes her clearest stabs yet for national-level leadership, including a potential 2028 run for the White House.

Earlier this spring, AOC joined Bernie Sanders on a cross-country “Fighting the Oligarchy” tour, which included a stop at the influential Coachella music festival. The tenor of their message is clear: America has “a government of billionaires, by billionaires and for billionaires”.

Despite the duo's penchant for private jet travel to ferry them from venue to venue, AOC has emerged as a viable player for the presidency. In April, Nate Silver, considered by many as America's leading political pollster, declared AOC to be his pick for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. A Yale Youth poll, meanwhile, placed AOC at a close second among younger voters against former vice-president Kamala Harris in a hypothetical match-up for the White House.

What's most concerning for both Schumer and the Democrats are the fundamentals behind Schumer's decline. From the Left, Schumer has faced attacks for being too centrist, too conciliatory – particularly when he agreed to advance a Republican funding bill in March to avoid a government shutdown. Nearly every House Democrat voted against the bill in an act of united anti-Trump resistance. Schumer's failure to join them led many progressives to call for his resignation. AOC bitingly described Schumer's vote as an “acquiesce”.

Meanwhile, Jewish voters are turning against the Senator, who they believe has turned against Israel. “The only thing Chuck Schumer knows about anti-Semitism is how to spread it,” declared a controversial column in the New York Post in March. The complaints against Schumer are myriad: failing to pass the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, reportedly advising Columbia University to “ignore” the backlash over accusations of anti-Semitism on campus, and even suggesting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be voted out of office mere months after Hamas's October 7 massacre.

And so, here we are, Schumer is sinking, AOC is surging and their party is desperate for a rebrand. Which is why AOC increasingly holds all the cards. For one thing, her favourability rating holds up well, at least compared to other Democrats. But it's the tenor of AOC “favourability” that truly makes her a threat. Her base of socialists, minorities, students and social-justice warriors are united by a near obsession with the progressive causes – identity, climate change, economic inequality – that President Trump despises most. Schumer's centrism, on the other hand, has left him looking powerless, futilely seeking compromise with a raging White House hell-bent on dismantling everything the Democrats hold dear.

AOC must know that even she could fall victim to the Left's new purity spiral. She was heckled and branded a “war criminal” at a Town Hall-style meeting this month for not doing enough to end the Gaza “genocide”. Which is why, for AOC to keep on winning, she'll need to engage in even more brazen acts of #resistance. That's certainly what her base wants of her. Cult-like in their affection – small donors helped propel AOC to a record $9.6 million fund-raising haul in the first three months of the year – her fans are aggressive, score-settling and confrontational. In other words, they're a lot like Trump supporters, but in reverse – all meta and no Maga.

So does that make AOC the Trump of the Left? While Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker and Rahm Emanuel position themselves as logical, moderate, electable 2028 players, AOC – like Trump – is doubling-down on the radicalism that has got her this far in the first place.

It's working for socialist New York mayor candidate Zohran Mamdani, who has surged to second place in polling for the upcoming election, despite an even more odious anti-Israel record than AOC. Of course succeeding in deep blue Gotham reveals little in regard to a national run. But if the Democrats ultimately decide they need their own “Trump” to beat Trumpism, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez might be the best (and only) option they have.

Iranian foreign minister says there can be no further talks if UK and European position is zero uranium enrichment

Iran's foreign minister has threatened to end all talks with European officials over its nuclear programme after Peter Mandelson, the UK ambassador to Washington, appeared to side with US calls to eliminate Iran's uranium enrichment facilities.

It was not clear if Lord Mandelson's remarks during a question and answer session at the Atlantic Council in Washington revealed an unannounced change in UK policy or if, in seeking to side with Donald Trump, he had spoken in a way to allow misinterpretation.

After five rounds of talks between Iran and the US mediated by Oman, the two sides remain at loggerheads over Iran's continued ability to enrich uranium, which Tehran regards as a sovereign right and which the US fears leaves open a path to an Iranian nuclear bomb.

After Mandelson's comments, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, posted on social media on Wednesday: “If the UK position is ‘zero enrichment' in Iran, there is nothing left for us to discuss on the nuclear issue.”

He said such request was a clear violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and violated Britain's commitments in the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA), the agreement to contain Iran's civil nuclear programme that the UK and other world powers signed with Iran in 2015.

Under the JCPoA, Iran is entitled to enrich uranium to up to 3.75% purity subject to an intrusive inspection regime.

Speaking later to reporters on a visit to Oman, Araghchi said: “This tweet was in response to a British official who had talked about zero enrichment. I said there explicitly that we continued our consultations with three European countries during this period, but if their position is zero enrichment, we will no longer have any talks with them about nuclear issues.”

He continued: “They must determine their own position, and we are not joking with anyone on the issue of enrichment.”

On Tuesday, Mandelson had said: “Iran since the theocratic revolution has never been in a weaker state than it is now. Weakened by economic sanctions, weakened by the heavy pounding that its proxies have taken, weaker because of the growth of public opinion, especially amongst young people in Iran, away from the regime. Iran is vulnerable. But it still retains enrichment facilities which can produce … a nuclear bomb. And we can't accept that.

“So Britain strongly support the [US] president's initiative in negotiating away these enrichment and related facilities in Iran. We support what Steve Witkoff [the US special envoy to the Middle East] has been doing in his negotiations, which are making some progress.”

The British Foreign Office said when asked for comment: “We remain committed to taking every diplomatic step to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, including through snapback [of sanctions] if necessary. That is the UK's longstanding position, which has not changed.

“We have urged Iran to engage with President Trump's offer of a negotiated solution and we continue to liaise closely with our allies and partners on this in support of regional stability and to secure peace in the Middle East.”

Trump has spoken of a good announcement within days, but many of his predictions about diplomatic breakthroughs have proved optimistic

No date has been set for a sixth round of talks, but in a potentially important concession Iran has announced it may be willing to have US, and not only UN, inspectors visit and monitor its controversial nuclear programme. Iran has already offered to revert to much lower levels of enrichment, and for its stocks of highly enriched uranium to be put out of use, probably in a third country such as Russia.

After Trump unilaterally left the agreement in 2018, Iran responded by enriching to much higher levels that took its nuclear programme close to the purity levels required to make a nuclear bomb.

The proposal for US inspectors was made in Tehran by Iran's nuclear chief, Mohammad Eslami on Wednesday and came as Oman hosted the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in a further attempt to break the deadlock in the talks.

One idea is for an interim minimal agreement to be reached in which some US economic sanctions are lifted and inspections are fully restored.

The UK, France and Germany have in effect been sidelined in the US-led talks over the nuclear programme, but senior Israeli officials have been holding talks with Witkoff and the CIA.

The Iranian foreign ministry briefed three European officials in Geneva two weeks ago but European officials have remained silent on the US conduct of the talks.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Mission control at SpaceX lost contact with the upper stage of the Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built. This was Starship's ninth uncrewed test flight.

SpaceX's Starship rocket made an uncontrolled reentry after losing contact with mission control on Tuesday.

""Just to confirm, we did lose contact with the ship officially a couple of minutes ago. So that brings an end to the ninth flight test,"" said SpaceX's Dan Huot during a live feed.

The launch was the ninth uncrewed test flight for Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, which SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wants to use for interplanetary travel and to colonize Mars.

What do we know about the test?

The spacecraft, which is divided into two stages — the Starship vessel that is mounted on top of a SpaceX Super Heavy rocket booster — blasted off from SpaceX's Starbase launch site on the Gulf Coast in southern Texas at 7:36 p.m. EDT (2336 GMT).

The rocket later leaked fuel, spun out of control and reentered the Earth's atmosphere, and likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean, officials said.

SpaceX, which is owned by billionaire Musk, confirmed that Starship had suffered from ""a rapid unscheduled disassembly.""

The likeliest cause of the loss of attitude control ""appears to be a propellant leak or engine failure in the upper stage, leading to a spin during reentry,"" SpaceX explained.

The company added that data suggests ""a leak disrupted control"" which were similar issues encountered during the two previous tests, which also ended in failure.

""With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's test will help us improve Starship's reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multi-planetary,"" the company said.

The last two attempts ended in explosions.

The previous two Starship test flights never made it further than the Caribbean, with the tests both ending mere minutes after blasting off.

British officials face being banned from the United States if they are found to have breached the free speech rights of American citizens.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said foreign officials “complicit in censoring” American citizens and media companies will be denied entry to the US.

The visa ban could apply to individuals working for Ofcom, which is the regulator responsible for policing Britain's online safety laws. The US State Department has repeatedly raised concerns over the laws' capacity to curtail freedom of expression.

The announcement is understood to have taken British officials by surprise. Diplomats were seeking clarity from the White House last night.

Announcing the measure, Mr Rubio said: “For too long, Americans have been fined, harassed, and even charged by foreign authorities for exercising their free speech rights.

“It is unacceptable for foreign officials to issue or threaten arrest warrants on US citizens or US residents for social media posts on American platforms while physically present on US soil.”

He went on to highlight online, saying: “It is similarly unacceptable for foreign officials to demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies or engage in censorship activity that reaches beyond their authority and into the United States.”

Britain's online harms laws have drawn the ire of free speech advocates and economists, who warn their broad provisions to tackle harmful online content could lead to excessive censorship and deter investment from American tech giants.

The Online Safety Act is despised by Donald Trump's administration because of the massive fines it can levy on US tech companies.

Under the law, social media giants face fines of up to £18 million or 10 per cent of their annual revenue if they fail to remove harmful content from their platforms.

“In some instances, foreign officials have taken flagrant censorship actions against US tech companies and US citizens and residents when they have no authority to do so,” Mr Rubio said.

“We will not tolerate encroachments upon American sovereignty, especially when such encroachments undermine the exercise of our fundamental right to free speech.”

In the aftermath of the Southport attack in which Axel Rudakubana murdered three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club, officials threatened to arrest, prosecute and extradite American officials who violated hate speech laws.

“We will throw the full force of the law at people. And whether you're in this country committing crimes on the streets or committing crimes from further afield online, we will come after you, Sir Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said at the time.

Mr Rubio's move is the latest in a series of highly unusual interventions by the Trump administration who are increasingly concerned about freedom of expression in the UK.

On Sunday, The Telegraph revealed the White House was “monitoring” the case of British woman, Lucy Connolly.State Department officials are examining the treatment of Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, who was jailed for 31 months over a social media post about the Southport attacks.

Campaigners raised her case with Mr Rubio as part of a wider effort to challenge what they regard as draconian hate speech laws across Europe.

Before the intervention, The Telegraph revealed Mr Trump had sent US officials to meet five British pro-life activists over censorship concerns.

The diplomats from the US bureau of democracy, human rights and labour travelled to London in March in an effort to “affirm the importance of freedom of expression in the UK and across Europe”.

They met with officials from the Foreign Office and challenged Ofcom on the Online Safety Act.

Despite the apparent rift, Foreign Office sources said the UK and US would work together to protect freedom of speech across the world.

Asked for a statement, a spokesman for the Foreign Office referred to remarks Sir Keir Starmer made in February when visiting the US:  “We've had free speech for a very, very long time in the UK, and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly we wouldn't want to reach across US citizens, and we don't, and that's absolutely right. But in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there.”

UN experts said that the law is explicitly written to target Palestinian children.

A group of UN human rights experts is raising alarm over a recently-passed Israeli law that allows children as young as 12 years old to be sentenced to life in prison, saying that the legislation is likely a violation of international human rights law.

The experts say that the law, passed late last year, is crafted specifically to target Palestinian children, as Israeli authorities often accuse Palestinian children of terrorism while not charging Israeli children the same way — one fixture of Israel's apartheid system.

“[A]uthorizing up to life imprisonment for children as young as 12 years old is not consistent with international law,” the experts wrote in a statement this month. “Under [the Convention on the Rights of the Child], the arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child must be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.”

The statement was signed by UN special rapporteur for the occupied Palestine territory, Francesca Albanese, as well as Ben Saul, special rapporteur on the promotion of human rights in counterterrorism; Farida Shaheed, special rapporteur on the right to education; and K.P. Ashwini, special rapporteur on racism and intolerance.

Israel often accuses children of terrorism for actions like throwing stones at Israeli soldiers or at cars, with Israeli forces killing many children for stone throwing over the decades and Israeli lawmakers passing a minimum sentence of three years for the act. 

Israeli officials have also long framed all Palestinians, including children, as terrorists. 

This has led to the detention and killing of huge numbers of Palestinian children under Israeli occupation. According to a recent report by Defense for Children International-Palestine (DCIP), the proportion of children in administrative detention — meaning that they are being held without charges — has reached a record high amid Israel's genocide.

Citing numbers from the Israeli Prison Service, DCIP reports that nearly 40 percent of Palestinian children detained in Israeli prisons are being held without charges. This amounts to 119 of the 323 imprisoned by Israeli authorities, which represents “both the highest number and the highest proportion” in DCIP's records on administrative detention.

“These figures highlight Israel's continued criminalization of Palestinian childhood and its deepening disregard for fundamental legal protections,” the group wrote, adding that children and their families are frequently forbidden from contacting their lawyers by Israeli authorities.

The Israeli Knesset has sought to further punish these families in another recent law condemned in the UN experts' statement.

That law, passed last year, allows child welfare benefits to be taken away if children are convicted of terrorist offenses. Experts say that the legislation is “overbroad” and not backed by evidence that such a punishment would deter supposed terrorist acts.

“We note that Israeli law does not withdraw benefits from children convicted of other serious offences, suggesting that the Amendment does not legitimately aim to suspend benefits that may be unnecessary while the child is in detention, but serves an ulterior punitive purpose,” the experts wrote.

This legislation, too, is aimed at punishing Palestinian children and their families, experts say, and is likely a violation of international law.

Israel was put on the UN's list of international violators of children's rights last year due to thousands of “grave violations” against children throughout Israel's genocide in Gaza. However, Israel has continued to act with impunity, and UNICEF reported on Tuesday that Israel has killed or injured at least 50,000 children since October 2023 — with other estimates of casualties being far higher.

A team of four staffers with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) can now access a Treasury Department system, a federal judge ruled on May 27 in a win for the Trump administration.

U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas allowed four employees with DOGE, which is associated with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, to access the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which is used by the federal government to distribute trillions of dollars in payments. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by Democratic-led states.

The four members of DOGE with access to the Treasury system are Thomas Krause, Linda Whitridge, Samuel Corcos, and Todd Newnam, according to the judge, who also noted that another team member, Ryan Wunderly, was allowed to access it in April.

“There is little utility in having this Court function as Treasury's de facto human resources officer each time a new team member is onboarded,” Vargas wrote.

Later in the ruling, the judge wrote that the four members of DOGE “have satisfied the conditions to be carved out of the definition of Restricted Personnel, [and] they shall be permitted access to Treasury Payment Systems on the same terms as Wunderly.”

“For the avoidance of doubt, however, Defendants are not required to obtain a judicial determination that a particular individual has satisfied the Training, Vetting and Mitigation Procedures before such person may be granted access to Treasury Payment Systems,” the order concluded.

The ruling marks a victory for DOGE and the Trump administration, which have faced a handful of lawsuits over the task force's access to various government systems.

In the Treasury case, a group of Democratic-led states filed a lawsuit to block DOGE's access, leading Vargas to issue a temporary injunction, but she allowed the task force to create a system to access the data with appropriate safeguards intact.

James, a Democrat, had argued that President Donald Trump “does not have the power to give away Americans' private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress,” adding that DOGE has “no authority to access Americans' private information and some of our country's most sensitive data.”

Lawyers for the Trump administration have argued in court filings that what the states had requested in their lawsuit is an overreach of their authority.

“Plaintiffs confirm in their opposition that they seek something remarkable: A court order commanding that a segment of an executive agency be cordoned off from properly named ‘political appointees,' while giving access to select ‘civil servants,'” they wrote.

“The government is aware of no example of a court ever trying to micromanage an agency in this way, or sever the political supervision of the Executive Branch in such a manner.”

Also on May 27, a federal judge in a separate case allowed a group of 14 states to move ahead with a lawsuit challenging DOGE and Musk's attempts to cut federal spending, rejecting the administration's efforts to dismiss the matter.

In that case, the states' lawsuit could proceed against Musk and DOGE because it made a plausible claim that Musk's cost-cutting activities were “unauthorized by any law,” according to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan's ruling in a Washington federal court.

The attorneys general of New Mexico, Oregon, and 12 other states filed their lawsuit in February, alleging that Trump has given Musk “unchecked legal authority” without authorization from the U.S. Congress. The lawsuit seeks to halt DOGE's efforts to slash federal spending and shut down U.S. agencies disfavored by Trump.

            Healthy people who regularly smoked marijuana or consumed THC-laced edibles showed signs of early cardiovascular disease similar to tobacco smokers, a new small study found.
    


            “To my knowledge, it's the first study looking at THC's impact on vascular function in humans,” said senior study author Matthew Springer, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.
    


More frequent marijuana use may damage an important memory skill



            “We're looking at a window in the future, showing the early changes that may explain why smoking marijuana has been linked to later heart disease,” Springer said. “It appears the act of smoking and the THC itself both contribute to those changes in different ways.”
    


            Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the component of marijuana that provides a high. Prior research on mice found damage to blood vessels that supply oxygen to vital organs after exposure to marijuana smoke, Springer said. Whether marijuana smoke would impact the human vascular system, however, was unknown.
    


            “We found that vascular function was reduced by 42% in marijuana smokers and by 56% in THC-edible users compared to nonusers,” lead study author Dr. Leila Mohammadi, an assistant researcher in cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco, said in an email.
    


            The research only shows an association, Springer said. “We can only state that the cannabis users have poor vascular function, not that cannabis use causes poor vascular function,” he said via email.
    


            The findings on THC-laced edibles was surprising, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.
    


            “Could it be that other forms of marijuana — teas, tinctures, edibles — are perhaps not as benign as we once thought?” said Freeman, who was not involved in the study. “We need larger studies to make a better conclusion about this finding.”
    


            A single layer of endothelial cells lines all of the body's blood vessels. When functioning properly, these specialized cells release chemicals such as nitric oxide that control the relaxing and contracting of the canal, thus regulating blood flow. Healthy endothelium cells also play a role in local cell growth and help prevent blood clotting.
    


Marijuana hospital visits linked to dementia diagnosis within 5 years, study finds



            When endothelial cells are inflamed, plaque buildup can increase in arteries over time, potentially causing heart attacks, strokes and heart failure. Damage to small blood vessels can also cause kidney and lung disease, comas, delirium, and dementia.
    


            The study, however, did not measure plaque, so the findings do not mean that blood vessels were currently blocked, Springer said.
    


            “The vessels just don't grow in diameter in real time when they need to pass more blood, indicating an unhealthy vessel wall that presages later cardiovascular disease,” he said.
    


            Prior studies have found strong links between marijuana use and later cardiovascular disease. A February 2024 study found smoking, vaping or eating marijuana led to a  significantly higher risk of heart attack and stroke, even if a person had no existing heart conditions and did not smoke or vape tobacco.
    


            Stroke risk rose 42% and the risk of heart attack rose 25% if cannabis was used daily, and risk climbed as the number of days of use of marijuana rose, the study found.
    


Young adult cannabis consumers nearly twice as likely to suffer from a heart attack, research shows



            Using marijuana every day can raise a person's risk of coronary artery disease by one-third compared with those who never partake, a February 2023 study found.
    


            The American Heart Association advises people to refrain from smoking or vaping any substance, including cannabis products, because of the potential harm to the heart, lungs and blood vessels. Guidance released in 2020 pointed to studies that found heart rhythm abnormalities, such as tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, could occur within an hour after weed containing THC was smoked.
    


            The 55 participants in the study were divided into three groups: people who smoked (not vaped) marijuana three or more times a week for at least a year, people who consumed THC edibles at least three times a week for at least a year, and nonusers. None of the 18- to 50-year-old people in the study were tobacco smokers or vapers, and all had little exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke.
    


Does marijuana weaken heart muscles?



            Researchers performed an ultrasound on the major artery in the upper right arm in each person, then applied an extremely tight blood pressure cuff for five minutes. After the cuff was removed, the artery was rescanned to see how well it had dilated, or widened, to handle the increased flow of blood, a process that needs the release of nitric oxide to occur.
    


            Damage to the endothelial cells that regulate dilation was related to the dose, according to the study. Study participants who used more marijuana had a greater risk of damage to blood vessels that carry oxygen to the body's organs.
    


            “Higher cannabis use — whether smoked or ingested — is associated with poorer vascular function, highlighting the cardiovascular risks that increase with higher potency and frequency of use,” Mohammadi said.
    


            Additional tests of the neck and thigh checked the stiffness of each person's blood pressure walls. Compared with people who never used marijuana, cannabis users didn't appear to have additional stiffness of the walls of blood vessels, the study found.
    


            A separate analysis added blood serum from cannabis smokers and edible users to commercially purchased cultures of endothelial cell in the laboratory. Blood from people who used edibles laced with THC didn't appear to harm the cells — they continued to produce adequate nitric oxide. However, the endothelial cells incubated in serum from marijuana smokers released 27% less nitric oxide than those treated with blood from nonsmokers.
    


Many Americans wrongly believe exposure to marijuana smoke is safer than tobacco, study finds



            That evidence is similar to what is found in tobacco, Springer said, pointing to a prior study by his team showing endothelial cells incubated in serum from tobacco smokers released 39% less nitric oxide than nonsmokers.
    


            “The observations that marijuana smokers and THC users each have poor vascular function might make people conclude that the THC is responsible for all of this and the smoke is irrelevant,” Springer said.
    


            That would be an ill-advised conclusion, according to Springer, as there are reasons to believe that marijuana smoke itself is as responsible as THC for the damage to blood vessels.
    


            “Rats exposed to marijuana smoke with no cannabinoids at all also had vascular and cardiac impairment, plus tobacco smoke is known to cause heart disease and it has no THC,” Springer said.
    


            “So you do yourself no favors by switching from smoking tobacco to marijuana. Smoking marijuana just gives you a double hit — the smoke and the THC,” he said.
    


            As for marijuana edibles, teas, tinctures and the like?
    


            “In people, there's like a Goldilocks zone for everything — too much doesn't do right, too little doesn't do right, but just right does fine,” Freeman said. “We need further investigations to see if there is a Goldilocks zone to be found.”

BERLIN, Germany (AP) — Three people in Germany were charged with working for one of Russia's intelligence agencies and could have been plotting to kill a man, the German Federal Prosecutor's Office said Wednesday.

The three men arrested in the “particularly serious case” on June 19, 2024 in Frankfurt were identified as Robert A., a Ukrainian citizen; Vardges I., an Armenian national; and Arman S., a Russian citizen. Their full names weren't released in line with German privacy rules.




“The spying operation presumably served to prepare further intelligence operations in Germany, possibly even leading to killing,” the German Federal Prosecutor's Office said.

German prosecutors said at the beginning of May 2024, Vardges I. received an order from a Russian intelligence agency to spy on a man living in Germany who fought in Ukraine's armed forces after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. 

To do this, Vardges I. recruited Robert A. and Arman S., who are accused of trying to lure the man to a meeting in a cafe in downtown Frankfurt with the aim of identifying him and gathering further information about him. Because the man had previously been in touch with German police, no meeting ever took place, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said, adding that the three men remain in custody. 

The charges against the men, filed May 16, are the latest in a series of cases across Europe where Ukrainians and other nationals are accused of working on behalf of Russia's intelligence services.

In May, German prosecutors said three Ukrainians were arrested in Germany and Switzerland on suspicion of agreeing to send parcels containing explosive or incendiary devices from Germany to Ukraine, apparently at the behest of people acting for Russia.

In April 2024, two German-Russian men were arrested in Germany on suspicion of espionage, one of them accused of agreeing to carry out attacks on potential targets including U.S. military facilities in hopes of sabotaging aid for Ukraine, prosecutors said. 




Western officials have accused Russia and its proxies of staging dozens of attacks ranging from arson and sabotage to cyberattacks and espionage since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 

Russia has previously been accused of trying to kill people in Germany who have a connection to the war in Ukraine.

In July 2024, Western officials said a plot was uncovered to kill Armin Papperger, CEO of defense company Rheinmetall which provides weapons to Ukraine. 

In 2019, a Russian national, Vadim Krasikov, was convicted in Germany of killing a Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya. Krasikov was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released as part of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine in 2024. 

At his sentencing, German judges said Krasikov had acted on the orders of Russian authorities, who gave him a false identity, passport and the resources to carry out the killing.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan said Tuesday it plans to use some slightly radioactive soil stored near the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant on flower beds at Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's office to show it is safe to reuse.

The soil was removed from across the Fukushima prefecture as part of decontamination work following the 2011 nuclear disaster and has since been in interim storage. Some of it has since reached levels safe enough for reuse, officials say.

Using the soil at Ishiba's office in Tokyo is aimed at reassuring the public it is safe. The government said that it plans to reuse the soil for flower beds and other purposes within the grounds of government agencies. The plan is based on guidelines set by the Environment Ministry in March and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

The timing and other details for the soil use still need to be worked out and the government is expected to compile a roadmap for the project around the summer. 

The Fukushima disaster resulted in large amounts of radioactive materials spewing out from the plant, polluting surrounding areas, leaving some areas still uninhabitable and requiring further decontamination work.

Japan is stuck with large volumes of the dirt, chopped trees and other debris collected during intensive decontamination work. It has 14 million cubic meters of dirt and other materials — enough to fill 11 baseball stadiums — stored at a sprawling outdoor facility straddling the towns of Futaba and Okuma, near the Fukushima plant. The soil does not include any from inside the plant.




The government has pledged to find disposal sites for the soil outside of the prefecture by 2045, with officials suggesting low risk material could be used to build roads and in other public works projects across the country. 

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, at the soil task force meeting, called for a government-wide effort to promote understanding for the soil use for reconstruction projects and to show good examples, starting with the Prime Minister's Office.

The Environment Ministry said that the soil will be used as foundation material and safely covered with top soil thick enough to keep radiation at negligible levels.

But there is much public unease. The government has already been forced to discontinue a plan to experiment using some of the soil in flower beds at several public parks in and around Tokyo following protests.

The IAEA is providing assistance with the Fukushima decommissioning process, which requires removing more than 880 tons of melted fuel debris.

In 2023 Japan began discharging treated radioactive wastewater from the plant into the sea to reduce the risk of accidental leaks and to make space to build facilities needed for melted fuel removal.

National Republican Senatorial Committee chair Sen. Tim Scott tells Fox News Digital his goal is 55 seats in next year's midterm elections

The National Republican Senatorial Committee is revisiting a much-maligned year-old photo from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.

The NRSC, which is the campaign arm of the Senate GOP, marked National Hamburger Day on Wednesday with a new video titled, ""We Grill Right,"" which spotlights Schumer's viral social media post from last year's Father's Day.

In the photo that appeared in the 2024 post, Schumer appeared to place a slice of cheese on an uncooked burger patty.

ONLY ON FOX NEWS: SENATE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN CHAIR REVEALS HOW MANY SEATS HE'S AIMING FOR IN 2026

""Our family has lived in an apartment building for all our years, but my daughter and her wife just bought a house with a backyard and for the first time we're having a barbeque with hot dogs and hamburgers on the grill!"" Schumer wrote in his post.

Schumer was quickly grilled on X, formerly Twitter, by a chorus of conservatives who pilloried his cooking skills, and the longtime senator soon deleted the post. He was also called out by late-night host Stephen Colbert.

DEMOCRATS' NEW SENATE CAMPAIGN CHAIR REVEALS KEYS TO WINNING BACK MAJORITY IN 2026

Fast-forward a year and the NRSC, in their video maligning Schumer, urged voters to ""join a real party, the Republican Party. We grill right.""

The NRSC was also selling related merchandise on its website, including beer koozies that read, ""I grill like I vote. Right.""

The NRSC also used their email release to also highlight recent reports, confirmed by Fox News, that some Democratic strategists and consultants were spending millions of dollars to better communicate with male and working-class voters, whom the party has struggled to court in recent election cycles.

DEMOCRATS' STRATEGY SESSION TO BETTER COMMUNICATE WITH MALE VOTERS RIDICULED

""Shouldn't take much to know how to grill a burger or correctly call a pick six, but apparently for Democrats, figuring out how to be a normal American takes at least $20 million — and even that won't be enough,"" NRSC regional press secretary Nick Puglia claimed in a statement.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel outlines the key findings issued by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

A candy company has removed an ingredient from its popular and colorful rainbow candies.

Skittles, owned by Mars Wrigley, will no longer be made with titanium dioxide.

A spokesperson for Mars Wrigley, which is based in New Jersey, confirmed to Fox News Digital this week that the company has removed titanium dioxide from its Skittles portfolio in the United States.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought addresses Democrats' criticism that DOGE is a 'big scam' and lays out his goals for the department's cuts on 'The Story.'

An Obama-appointed federal judge has largely rejected the Trump administration's request for the dismissal of a DOGE-related legal challenge, though she did dismiss President Donald Trump as a defendant, while otherwise allowing the wranglings to proceed.

""Defendants seek to dismiss President Trump as a defendant because the court may not enjoin the President in the performance of his official duties,"" a memorandum opinion notes, adding, ""The court agrees.""

The memorandum opinion and order are signed by Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

""Defendants' motion to dismiss Count I against President Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States, is GRANTED. Defendants' motion to dismiss Count I against all other defendants and Count II is DENIED,"" the order declares.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a Justice Department spokesperson said, ""This Department of Justice has vigorously defended President Trump's ability to conduct official duties and will continue to do so whenever those actions are challenged in federal court.""

President Donald Trump pushed back on Wednesday on the characterization of his tariff policy as “chickening out” after he announced and then paused tariffs on other countries multiple times.

Trump objected to the description when asked by a reporter, saying it was part of his wider strategy.

“We have the hottest country anywhere in the world. … Six months ago, this country was stone-cold dead. We had a dead country. We had a country, people didn't think it was going to survive, and you ask a nasty question like that,” the president said.

“It's called negotiation. You set a number. And if you go down, if I set a ridiculous high number and I go down a little bit, a little bit, they want me to hold that number, 145% tariff. Even I said, ‘Man, that really got up,'” he continued, saying he brought the number down after negotiations.

Wall Street is banking on Trump reneging on his tariff threats, to the extent that it helped buoy an unprecedented market rally. Investors have adopted an acronym for their new trade strategy: “Trump always chickens out,” or TACO. The strategy holds that Trump will always renege on tariff threats, so it's best to buy the dip following the immediate panic caused by new tariff announcements.

The president reiterated that he wasn't a fan of the term.

“But don't ever say what you said, that's a nasty question. To me, that's the nastiest question,” he added.

Trump's April announcement of “Liberation Day,” imposing hefty tariffs on nearly every country, triggered a period of massive market volatility.

April 7 saw some of the most volatile behavior in market history. The S&P 500 witnessed one of the most dramatic swings, taking place over 15 minutes, from 10:10 a.m. to 10:25 a.m.

At 10:10 a.m., traders became aware of an erroneous report amplified by CNBC, claiming Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Within 10 minutes, the S&P 500 added $3 trillion. The White House Rapid Response X page quickly shot down the report, calling it “wrong” and “fake news.”

Once traders heard about the denial at 10:20 a.m., the S&P 500 lost $2.5 trillion in five minutes.

The same pattern was reflected in the Nasdaq and Dow Jones.

Announcements of trade deals, tariff deadline extensions, and the lowering of tariffs all helped contribute to a market revival after an initial crash. The market has now regained most of its value, partially due to the TACO strategy.

“So, the returns are somewhat conclusive: The TACO trade has worked and buying stocks on extreme tariff-related threats has worked,” Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said, according to Market Watch.

STOCK MARKETS SURGE AFTER US AND CHINA AGREE TO SLASH TARIFFS

Despite it paying off so far, however, he warned that long-term prospects are less certain.

“What will determine the next 15%-20% in this market isn't Trump's tariff talk. Instead, it's the economy and whether it can hold up amidst tariffs, policy volatility, higher interest rates, no Fed rates cuts, and pressure on consumer spending,” Essaye said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

In the movie Friendship, one man will stop at nothing to get his bro back.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

Men will literally, as the meme goes, do anything to avoid therapy. They'll start wars. They'll become obsessed with the Roman empire. They'll join more improv teams than they could possibly need. The meme captures the exaggerated nature of the “male-loneliness epidemic” narrative: Despite a recent study finding that American men and women are roughly equally lonely, the idea that men are especially unable to cope with social isolation persists.

But for Craig Waterman, the protagonist of the new film Friendship, male loneliness is no myth. Played by the comedian Tim Robinson—best known as the mastermind behind the sketch-comedy series I Think You Should Leave—Craig is, to put it mildly, dreadful at making friends. He's an intrusive thought in human form, the embodiment of the speed bump he had the city install on his street. He's a tightly wound collection of eccentricities attempting to come off as an everyman, and as such, his co-workers can't stand him. His teenage son won't go see the “new Marvel” with him. Even his wife, Tami (played by Kate Mara), would rather hang out with her ex-boyfriend. In other words, Craig is a weirdo who's perfectly in keeping with Robinson's oeuvre of over-the-top characters: He knows he's not fitting in, but he desperately wants to anyway. That he fails again and again to perform a more socially acceptable version of himself leaves him anxious, frustrated, and at times enraged.

It's no wonder, then, that Craig can't seem to accept when a relationship is over. Friendship traces how Craig and his neighbor Austin (Paul Rudd), a jovial weatherman, quickly bond and then break apart. At first, the pair get along beautifully: Craig goes to see Austin perform with his band, and Austin takes Craig mushroom foraging. But when Craig ruins an evening with Austin's buddies, Austin cuts him off. Craig's attempts to repair their closeness only make the situation worse before veering into the bizarre. The result is a film that's both funny and unnerving; it examines the absurdity of modern male-bonding rituals and the lengths a person will go to get someone else, especially a new friend, to like them.

Read: An unlikely model for male friendship

Friendship often plays like a horror movie; the director, Andrew DeYoung, deploys techniques that shroud the story in suspense: dramatic cinematography, slow zooms, an off-putting lo-fi score. Robinson, meanwhile, has a knack for pulling faces that make him seem harmless yet somehow creepy. In an early scene, when Craig watches Austin perform, he imagines himself as the band's drummer. Craig's open-mouthed, wide-eyed expression can be interpreted as admiration, but it can also scan as obsession. He looks like he is about to start drooling.

The film is full of visual gags like that, many of which do little to move the plot forward. A guy named Jimp has to repeat his name multiple times before Craig understands him. When Craig tries a recreational drug, he hallucinates about wandering into a Subway sandwich shop; what follows made me laugh so much that I teared up. At work, Craig fills his coffee mug to the brim, shuffles through the office hallways trying not to spill a drop, and then stiffly sips from the rim during a meeting. These scenes come off as irrelevant sketches shoehorned into the story, but they capture how Craig perceives the world around him. Even in the most normal of circumstances, his social awkwardness leads to him doing or fixating on something unusual—and then struggling to understand why others don't see his point of view.

Yet Robinson never makes Craig out to be a complete outcast—he's just a guy who's baffled by how people get along. His deceptively nuanced performance makes Friendship somewhat compassionate as a study of how exhausting social mores can be to grasp. On the disastrous night when he meets Austin's friends, for instance, Craig copies everyone around him, grabbing a beer, delivering self-deprecating jokes, and agreeing to some casual sparring. But when he punches his new pal hard enough to make him fall over, the other men's silence befuddles him. Wasn't that what they'd wanted him to do, in cheering him on so enthusiastically? Later in the film, Craig takes Tami out on a date that, unbeknownst to her, involves exploring a hidden network of underground tunnels; he had so much fun trekking through them with Austin. Tami dislikes the experience, however, leaving Craig confused. Why is an adventure okay in one context and not in another? Would she have enjoyed herself if she were with someone who more easily commanded respect, like Austin? Is Craig really the problem—or are the unspoken expectations defining human interaction the actual culprits?

Read: How the passionate male friendship died

Friendship doesn't really pursue any answers to those questions, and the film is too slight and scattershot to be able to offer illuminating insights. Instead, it fearlessly—and wackily—reckons with how confounding people can be in their bid for one another's approval: at work, at home, at their new friend's house while dressed in their finest Ocean View Dining clothing. (It's the only brand that fits Craig just right.) More than anything, Robinson delivers a fantastic showcase for his particular brand of humor. His shtick—characters who seem like average middle-aged men until they open their mouth—has won him a cult following, but it's likely not for everyone. For those who prefer less cringe, well, take it from Craig himself: There's a new Marvel out.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Powerful Silicon Valley leaders are prioritizing their utopian vision of the future over the concerns of people in the present.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

Technologists currently wield a level of political influence that was recently considered unthinkable. While Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency slashes public services, Jeff Bezos takes celebrities to space on Blue Origin and the CEOs of AI companies speak openly of radically transforming society. As a result, there has never been a better moment to understand the ideas that animate these leaders' particular vision of the future.

In his new book, More Everything Forever, the science journalist Adam Becker offers a deep dive into the worldview of techno-utopians such as Musk—one that's underpinned by promises of AI dominance, space colonization, boundless economic growth, and eventually, immortality. Becker's premise is bracing: Tech oligarchs' wildest visions of tomorrow amount to a modern secular theology that is both mesmerizing and, in his view, deeply misguided. The author's central concern is that these grand ambitions are not benign eccentricities, but ideologies with real-world consequences​.

What do these people envision? In their vibrant utopia, humanity has harnessed technology to transcend all of its limits—old age and the finite bounds of knowledge most of all. Artificial intelligence oversees an era of abundance, automating labor and generating wealth so effectively that every person's needs are instantly met. Society is powered entirely by clean energy, while heavy industry has been relocated to space, turning Earth into a pristine sanctuary. People live and work throughout the solar system. Advances in biotechnology have all but conquered disease and aging. At the center of this future, a friendly AI—aligned with human values—guides civilization wisely, ensuring that progress remains tightly coupled with the flourishing of humanity and the environment.

Musk, along with the likes of Bezos and OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, aren't merely imagining sci-fi futures as a luxury hobby—they are funding them, proselytizing for them, and, in a growing number of cases, trying to reorganize society around them. In Becker's view, the rich are not merely chasing utopia, but prioritizing their vision of the future over the very real concerns of people in the present. Impeding environmental research, for instance, makes sense if you believe that human life will continue to exist in an extraterrestrial elsewhere. More Everything Forever asks us to take these ideas seriously, not necessarily because they are credible predictions, but because some people in power believe they are.

Read: The rise of techno-authoritarianism

Becker, in prose that is snappy if at times predictable, highlights the quasi-spiritual nature of Silicon Valley's utopianism, which is based on two very basic beliefs. First, that death is scary and unpleasant. And second, that thanks to science and technology, the humans of the future will never have to be scared or do anything unpleasant. “The dream is always the same: go to space and live forever,” Becker writes. (One reason for the interest in space is that longevity drugs, according to the tech researcher Benjamin Reinhardt, can be synthesized only “in a pristine zero-g environment.”) This future will overcome not just human biology but a fundamental rift between science and faith. Becker quotes the writer Meghan O'Gieblyn, who observes in her book God, Human, Animal, Machine that “what makes transhumanism so compelling is that it promises to restore through science the transcendent—and essentially religious—hopes that science itself obliterated.”​

Becker demonstrates how certain contemporary technologists flirt with explicitly religious trappings. Anthony Levandowski, the former head of Google's self-driving-car division, for instance, founded an organization to worship artificial intelligence as a godhead​. But Becker also reveals the largely forgotten precedents for this worldview, sketching a lineage of thought that connects today's Silicon Valley seers to earlier futurist prophets. In the late 19th century, the Russian philosopher Nikolai Fedorov preached that humanity's divine mission was to physically resurrect every person who had ever lived and settle them throughout the cosmos, achieving eternal life via what Fedorov called “the regulation of nature by human reason and will.”

The rapture once preached and beckoned in churches has been repackaged for secular times: In place of souls ascending to heaven, there are minds preserved digitally—or even bodies kept alive—for eternity. Silicon Valley's visionaries are, in this view, not all cold rationalists; many of them are dreamers and believers whose fixations constitute, in Becker's view, a spiritual narrative as much as a scientific one—a new theology of technology.

Let's slow down: Why exactly is this a bad idea? Who wouldn't want “perfect health, immortality, yada yada yada,” as the AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky breezily summarizes the goal to Becker? The trouble, Becker shows, is that many of these dreams of personal transcendence disregard the potential human cost of working toward them. For the tech elite, these are visions of escape. But, Becker pointedly writes, “they hold no promise of escape for the rest of us, only nightmares closing in.”​

Perhaps the most extreme version of this nightmare is the specter of an artificial superintelligence, or AGI (artificial general intelligence). Yudkowsky predicts to Becker that a sufficiently advanced AI, if misaligned with human values, would “kill us all.”​ Forecasts for this type of technology, once fringe, have gained remarkable traction among tech leaders, and almost always trend to the stunningly optimistic. Sam Altman is admittedly concerned about the prospects of rogue AI—he famously admitted to having stockpiled “guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to”—but these worries don't stop him from actively planning for a world reshaped by AI's exponential growth. In Altman's words, we live on the brink of a moment in which machines will do “almost everything” and trigger societal changes so rapid that “the future can be almost unimaginably great.” Becker is less sanguine, writing that “we just don't know what it will take to build a machine to do all the things a human can do.” And from his point of view, it's best that things remain that way.

Read: Silicon Valley braces for chaos

Becker is at his rhetorically sharpest when he examines the philosophy of “longtermism” that underlies much of this AI-centric and space-traveling fervor. Longtermism, championed by some Silicon Valley–adjacent philosophers and the effective-altruism movement, argues that the weight of the future—the potentially enormous number of human (or post-human) lives to come—overshadows the concerns of the present. If preventing human extinction is the ultimate good, virtually any present sacrifice can and should be rationalized. Becker shows how today's tech elites use such reasoning to support their own dominance in the short term, and how rhetoric about future generations tends to mask injustices and inequalities in the present​. When billionaires claim that their space colonies or AI schemes might save humanity, they are also asserting that only they should shape humanity's course. Becker observes that this philosophy is “made by carpenters, insisting the entire world is a nail that will yield to their ministrations.”​

Becker's perspective is largely that of a sober realist doing his darnedest to cut through delusion, yet one might ask whether his argument occasionally goes too far. Silicon Valley's techno-utopian culture may be misguided in its optimism, but is it only that? A gentle counterpoint: The human yearning for transcendence stems from a dissatisfaction with the present and a creative impulse, both of which have driven genuine progress. Ambitious dreams—even seemingly outlandish ones—have historically spurred political and cultural transformation. Faith, too, has helped people face the future with optimism. It should also be acknowledged that many of the tech elite Becker critiques do show some awareness of ethical pitfalls. Not all (or even most) technologists are as blithe or blinkered as Becker sometimes seems to suggest.

In the end, this is not a book that revels in pessimism or cynicism; rather, it serves as a call to clear-eyed humanism. In Becker's telling, tech leaders err not in dreaming big, but in refusing to reckon with the costs and responsibilities that come with their dreams. They preach a future in which suffering, scarcity, and even death can be engineered away, yet they discount the very real suffering here and now that demands our immediate attention and compassion. In an era when billionaire space races and AI hype dominate headlines, More Everything Forever arrives as a much-needed reality check. At times, the book is something more than that: a valuable meditation on the questionable stories we tell about progress, salvation, and ourselves.

The administration's recent crackdown could have a powerful deterrent effect.

During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump endorsed a novel idea: Foreign students who graduated from college in the United States would automatically get a green card, instead of having to scramble for a new visa or leave the country entirely. “They go back to India; they go back to China,” he told the tech-plutocrat hosts of the All-In Podcast in June. He lamented the loss of students who “become multibillionaires employing thousands and thousands of people,” and declared, “It's so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools.”

But now that he's back in power, Trump seems determined to scare foreign students away from enrolling in American universities in the first place. Yesterday, Politico reported that the State Department had instructed embassies and consulates to hold off on scheduling new student interviews while the administration considers expanding the vetting of prospective students' social-media accounts, likely for perceived anti-Semitic or pro-terrorist posts.

Would-be foreign students are likely to notice a wider pattern: In March, plainclothes officers arrested Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student, and detained her in Louisiana for more than six weeks, apparently because the government had construed a pro-Palestinian op-ed that she had co-authored as “activities in support of Hamas.” Since Trump retook office, the government has quietly terminated about 4,700 foreign students' ability to study the U.S. Last week, the administration announced that it had revoked Harvard's ability to enroll any international students.

Nicole Hallett, a University of Chicago law professor, cast the administration's recent strategy as a major shift in American immigration policy, which previously welcomed foreign students. “In past administrations, there has been an attempt to go after undocumented immigrants and people with serious criminal convictions,” Hallett told me. “What we're seeing here is an attempt to target groups of noncitizens that previously, I think, considered themselves to be fairly safe from immigration enforcement.”

Read: The end of college life

The administration has broadly connected foreign students with pro-Palestinian protests and the harassment of Jewish students on university campuses. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that the administration will not grant visas to students who want to participate in movements “doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus.” In a letter to Harvard, which draws 27 percent of its student body from overseas, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the school “has invited foreign students, who engage in violent behavior and show contempt for the United States of America, to its campus.”

The administration is demanding that Harvard provide information about international students' coursework, disciplinary records, illegal activities, and history of participating in protests. The school says it has provided the information required by law—a response that the administration deems incomplete. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem declared in a letter that the university had refused to adequately answer questions about its international students “while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies.”

Harvard's experience is a cautionary tale for foreign students considering other schools, especially because Trump has said that other universities could face similar scrutiny. The State Department's latest move could have more immediate effects at institutions across the country. An estimated 1.1 million foreign students are enrolled in the United States. Closely vetting the social-media accounts of the hundreds of thousands of foreigners who apply for student visas every year will be time-consuming. As the Öztürk case suggests, the government's grounds for revoking student visas may be opaque and expansive, ensnaring not only terrorism supporters but also students with a mere political disagreement with the administration.

The thousands of students who have lost permission to be in the U.S. appear to have been targeted for having had contact with law enforcement. But many had been charged with only minor offenses—including underage drinking, overfishing, or violating traffic laws. (Some of the affected students told reporters they were unsure what had triggered the action.)

After facing more than 100 legal challenges from such students—and setbacks in dozens of those cases—the administration said that it would temporarily restore students' legal status while it developed a new framework for visa cancellations. Trump faces other obstacles in the court system: A judge temporarily blocked the administration's move to revoke Harvard's ability to host international students.

Thomas Chatterton Williams: Trump's Harvard whiplash

But even if universities and foreign students challenging Trump's policies ultimately prevail in court, his recent campaign could nevertheless have a powerful deterrent effect. It is bound to unsettle one of America's most successful export industries—selling undergraduate and graduate degrees to intelligent foreigners—and disrupt the considerable scientific and technological research that overseas students enable at major universities. In the 2023–24 academic year, international students contributed almost $44 billion to the U.S. economy. They supported 378,000 American jobs. And they founded companies; about a quarter of the billion-dollar start-ups in America were founded by someone who came to the United States as an international student. “The smartest people in the world voluntarily move to the United States,” Kevin Carey, vice president of education and work at New America, told me. “Many of them stay on and live here, start companies, do all these things that we want. It all starts with student visas. If you cut that off, they'll go somewhere else.”

Yet that outcome fits neatly into Trump's “America First” ethos while helping the administration hurt elite universities. Vice President J. D. Vance said in an interview with Fox News that international students are “bad for the American dream for a lot of kids who want to go to a nice university and can't because their spot was taken by a foreign student.” Trump himself told reporters that Harvard had too many foreign students “because we have Americans that want to go there.”

Cutting off the flow of foreign students would financially hobble higher education. Many universities rely on wealthy international students to pay full freight and subsidize the cost of educating American students. But if the Trump administration is bent on limiting the number of foreign students who study in the United States, it has many tools at its disposal to accomplish this. It could simply reject more individual students' visa applications, an approach that would be difficult to challenge in court because of the deference that consular decisions generally receive. “People applying for visas are in a kind of Constitution-free zone,” Daniel Kanstroom, a Boston College law professor, told me.

In a telling shift, Harvard, which typically expects admitted students to turn down other schools when accepting its offer, will now allow international students to accept a second offer of admission from a university overseas, in case their U.S. visa falls through.

The outcome of the president's strategy seems clear: fewer foreign students in America. As Trump understood last year, this will come at a considerable cost to the country.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The real cost of forcing foreign students away from elite universities like Harvard.

by  Bryan Walsh

In 1965, then-French finance minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing came up with the “mot juste” for describing the way that the supremacy of the dollar provided the foundation for the financial supremacy of the US. The fact the dollar was so dominant in international transactions gave the US, d'Estaing said, an “exorbitant privilege.” Because every country needed dollars to settle trade and backstop their own currencies, foreign countries had to buy up US debt, which in turn meant that the US paid less to borrow money and was able to run up trade and budget deficits without suffering the usual pain. The exorbitant privilege of the dollar was that the US would be able to live beyond its means. 

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

It's always been an open question as to how long that privilege would last, but President Donald Trump's harsh tariff policies, paired with a budget bill that right now would add trillions to the budget deficit, might just be enough to finally dislodge the dollar. Annual federal deficits are already running at 6 percent of GDP, while interest rates on 10-year US Treasuries have more than doubled to around 4.5 percent over the past few years, increasing the cost of interest payments on the debt. As of the last quarter of 2024, 58 percent of global reserves were in dollars, down from 71 percent in the first quarter of 1999. The dollar may remain king, if only because there seems to be no real alternative, but thanks to the US' own actions, the exorbitance of its privilege is already eroding — and with it, America's ability to compensate for its fiscal fecklessness.

But the dollar isn't the only privilege the US enjoys. Since the postwar era, America's best universities have led the world. Harvard, Princeton, MIT, CalTech — these elite universities are the foundation of the American scientific supremacy that has in turn fueled decades of economic growth. But also, by virtue of their unparalleled ability to attract the best minds from around the world, these schools have given the US the educational privilege of being the magnet of global academic excellence. In the same way that the dollar's dominance has allowed the US to live beyond its means, the dominance of elite universities has compensated for the fact that the US has, at best, a mediocre K-12 educational system. 

And now that privilege is under attack by the Trump administration. Cutting off federal funding for universities like Columbia and Princeton and eviscerating agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation were bad enough — but the administration's recent move to bar international students from Harvard would be a death blow, especially if it spread to other top schools. 

The ability to attract the best of the best, especially in the sciences, is what makes Harvard Harvard, which in turn has helped make the United States the United States. Just as losing the privilege of the dollar would force the US to finally pay for years of fiscal mismanagement, losing the privilege of these top universities would force the country to pay for decades of educational failure. 

As Vox contributor Kevin Carey wrote this week, foreign students are a major source of financial support for US colleges and universities, many of which would struggle to survive should those students disappear. But the financial picture actually understates just how much US science depends on foreign talent and, in turn, depends on top universities like Harvard to bring in top students and professors.

An astounding 70 percent of grad students in the US in electrical engineering and 63 percent in computer science — probably the two disciplines most important to winning the future — are foreign-born. Nineteen percent of the overall STEM workforce in the US is foreign-born; focus just on the PhD-level workforce, and that number rises to 43 percent. Since 1901, just about half of all physics, chemistry, and medicine Nobel Prizes have gone to Americans, and about a third of those winners were foreign-born, a figure that has risen in recent decades. It's really not too much to suggest that if all foreign scientists and science students were deported tomorrow, US science would grind to a halt.

Could American-born students step into that gap? Absolutely not. That's because as elite as America's top universities are, the country's K-12 education system has been anything but. 

Every three years, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is given to a representative sample of 15-year-old students in over 80 countries. It's the best existing test for determining how a country's students compare in mathematics, reading, and science to their international peers. 

In the most recent PISA tests, taken in 2022, US students scored below the average for OECD or developed countries in math; on reading and science, they were just slightly above average. And while a lot of attention has been rightly paid to learning loss since the pandemic — one report from fall 2024 estimated that the average US student is less than halfway to a full academic recovery — American students have lagged behind their international peers since long before then. Other wealthy nations, from East Asian countries to some small European ones, regularly outpace American peers in math by the equivalent of one full academic year.

To be clear, this picture isn't totally catastrophic. It's fine — American students perform around the middle compared to their international peers. But just fine won't make you the world's undisputed scientific leader. And fine is a long way from what the US once was. 

America was a pioneer in universal education, and it did the same in college education through the postwar GI Bill, which opened up college education to the masses. By 1950, 34 percent of US adults aged 25 or older had completed high school or more, compared to 14 percent in the UK and 11 percent in France. When NASA engineers were putting people on the moon in the 1960s, the US had perhaps the world's most educated workforce to draw from.

Since then, much of the rest of the world has long since caught up with the US on educational attainment, and a number of countries have surpassed it. But thanks in large part to the privilege that is elite universities like Harvard or the University of California, and their ability to recruit the best, no country has caught up to the US in sheer scientific brainpower. Take away our foreign talent, however, and US science would look more like its K-12 performance — merely fine.

It seems increasingly apparent that the Trump administration wants to make an example of Harvard, proving its own dominance by breaking a 388-year-old institution with strong ties to American power and influence. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to cancel all remaining federal contracts with Harvard, while Trump himself mused on redirecting Harvard's $3 billion in grants to trade schools. 

Grants and contracts are vital, but they can be restored, just as faith in the US dollar might be restored by a saner trade policy and a tighter budget. But if the Trump administration chooses to make the US fundamentally hostile to foreign students and scientific talent, there may be no coming back. Politico reported this week that the administration is weighing requiring all foreign students applying to study in the US to undergo social media vetting. With universities around the world now competing to make themselves alternatives to the US, what star student from Japan or South Korea or Finland would choose to put their future in the hands of the Trump administration, when they could go anywhere else they wanted?

The US once achieved scientific leadership because it educated its own citizens better and longer than any other country. Those days are long past, but the US managed to keep its pole position, and all that came with it, because it supported and funded what were far and away the best universities in the world. That was our privilege, as much as the dollar was. And now we seem prepared to destroy both.

Should that come to pass, we'll see just how little is left.

Meta has been working on plans to open physical stores and hire retail workers, Business Insider has learned.

The company has a project to expand its retail footprint, which is not broadly known internally yet, according to an internal communication seen by BI. The communication also said Meta planned to hire retail employees.

Meta has only one physical retail space, Meta Store, which it opened on its campus in Burlingame, California, in 2022. The store lets shoppers test out some of its hardware products, including its Meta Quest VR headsets and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, much like its rival Apple, which has more than 500 retail stores globally.

It's unclear how many stores Meta might open or on what timeline, but it experimented with the idea last year by opening a pop-up store, Meta Lab, to sell its smart glasses in Los Angeles.

Meta declined to comment.

An expansion could boost its sales of hardware products, such as smart glasses. Meta sold more than 1 million units last year. In an all-hands meeting earlier this year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it was a ""great start"" but ""not going to move the needle and the business in a core way."" He added that 2025 would offer an indication of whether the product line will become a ""long-term grind"" or whether AI glasses will become a ""really prominent computing platform"" in the near term.

The company is also on a mission this year to ""drive sales, retention, and engagement,"" Andrew Bosworth, its chief technology officer, said last year in an internal memo. He also said Meta planned to launch half a dozen more AI-powered wearables this year.

Meta is set to face more competition, with OpenAI this month acquiring the former Apple design chief Jony Ive's startup, IO, to build a new type of device for the artificial intelligence era.

Big Tech companies have a history of venturing into retail stores. Amazon opened its first brick-and-mortar store in late 2015 and has since expanded with different brands, including Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go. But it has scaled back some of those stores in recent years.

Apple, meanwhile, has made brick-and-mortar an important part of its sales strategy. It has sleek stores around the world that are designed to allow consumers to explore its suite of products and engage with the brand.

Microsoft closed all of its retail stores amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but continues to operate a small number of Experience Centers and more than 40 Innovation Hubs.

Elon Musk is breaking with President Donald Trump — and Republicans in Congress — in a major way.

The tech titan and de-facto DOGE leader firmly criticized the ""big beautiful bill"" — the spending bill that will form the core of Trump's legislative agenda — in a forthcoming interview with CBS, a clip of which was released on Tuesday.

""I was like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,"" Musk said. ""I think a vote can be big, or it could be beautiful. I don't know if it could be both.""

The Tesla CEO, in his capacity leading the White House DOGE office, has focused intensely on trying to cut spending from the federal budget.

Musk initially predicted that DOGE would cut at least $2 trillion in spending. He's since revised the number down a couple of times, and last month, he told reporters that DOGE had saved just $160 billion in federal spending and cut 20,000 government jobs, or about 1% of the federal workforce.

The ""big beautiful bill"" in its current form ultimately increases the deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the legislation would add $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.

That's primarily because it extends the tax cuts that Trump and congressional Republicans enacted in 2017. The bill also includes Trump campaign promises like no tax on tips, and it makes some cuts to Medicaid.

The bill is now in the Senate, where fiscal hawks have pledged to oppose the bill unless it makes further cuts. Republicans hope to get it to Trump's desk by July 4.

""I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful. But I don't know if it could be both.""Tech billionaire Elon Musk tells CBS Sunday Morning's @Pogue he was ""disappointed"" to see the Trump-backed ""big beautiful"" spending bill, which passed in the House last week.Musk said… pic.twitter.com/LUcuTaNYrs

Musk, meanwhile, recently said that he would be scaling back his work with DOGE.

""In the grand scheme of things, I think we've been effective. Not as effective as I'd like. I think we could be more effective. But we've made progress,"" Musk said on April 30.

Investors have called on Musk to spend more time on his businesses after his work at DOGE sparked boycotts and protests against Tesla.

Last week, Musk embarked on a media blitz to reaffirm his commitment to Tesla. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Musk said he planned to cut down on his political spending.

""In terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,"" Musk told Bloomberg. ""I think I've done enough.""

Musk later told CNBC that he would still be spending time in Washington. Musk said in a Tesla earnings call last month that he planned to scale down his involvement with DOGE to focus on Tesla.

""My rough plan on the White House is to be there for a couple days every few weeks. And to be helpful where I can be helpful,"" Musk told CNBC.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The next Apple operating systems will be identified by year, rather than with a version number, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That means the current iOS 18 will give way to “iOS 26,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan is still private.

Israel has deployed laser weapons during its ongoing war to deflect “scores” of aerial attacks, including from drones, the Defense Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. This is the first time the country has acknowledged the use of directed-energy technologies in the battlefield.

The systems were described as a less powerful “prototype” of the 100-kilowatt Iron Beam laser interceptor that will be operational in Israel by the end of the year. The Defense Ministry also released footage of what it said were the lasers intercepting fixed-wing drones in the sky. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Shares of chip design software makers Cadence and Synopsys tumbled in Wednesday trading after The Financial Times reported that the White House told them to stop selling to clients in China.

Cadence closed more than 10% lower while Synopsys closed down by more than 9%.

The Bureau of Industry and Security under the U.S. Commerce Department sent letters to both companies and to Siemens, the newspaper said.

Synopsys declined to comment. Cadence and Siemens representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The report follows the Trump administration's decision to get rid of the Biden-era chip ""Diffusion Rule"" that limited the export of artificial intelligence processors to China. 

Nvidia celebrated the change, but it's not clear how forthcoming policy from the White House might affect Nvidia's business. Nvidia reports results after the bell on Wednesday.

Earlier this month the Bureau of Industry and Security issued a warning about using Huawei Ascend AI chips, saying organizations that adopt them could be subject to enforcement action. 

A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said the move undermined the two countries' preliminary trade agreement and demanded that the White House ""correct its mistakes.""

Federal Reserve officials at their meeting earlier this month worried that tariffs could aggravate inflation and create a difficult quandary with interest rate policy, minutes released Wednesday show.

The summary of the May 6-7 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee reflected ongoing misgivings about the direction of fiscal and trade policy, with officials ultimately deciding the best course was to keep rates steady.

""Participants agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had increased further, making it appropriate to take a cautious approach until the net economic effects of the array of changes to government policies become clearer,"" the minutes said. ""Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proves to be more persistent while the outlooks for growth and employment weaken.""

Though policymakers expressed concern about the direction of inflation and the vagaries of trade policy, they nevertheless said that economic growth was ""solid,"" the labor market is ""broadly in balance"" though risks were growing that it could weaken, and consumers were continuing to spend.

As it has done since the last cut in December, the FOMC kept its benchmark federal funds rate in a target between 4.25%-4.5%.

""In considering the outlook for monetary policy, participants agreed that with economic growth and the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to wait for more clarity on the outlooks for inflation and economic activity,"" the summary said.

The post-meeting statement noted that ""uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further."" Also, the committee said meeting its dual goals of full employment and low inflation have been complicated due to policy uncertainty.

Since the meeting, officials have repeated that they will wait until there's more clarity about fiscal and trade policy before they will consider lowering rates again. Market expectations have responded in kind, with futures traders now pricing in virtually no chance of a cut until the Fed's September meeting.

Trade policy also has evolved since the Fed last gathered.

Tariffs and ongoing saber-rattling between the U.S. and China eased a few days after the central bank meeting, with both sides agreeing to drop the most onerous duties against each pending a 90-day negotiation period. That in turn helped kindle a rally on Wall Street, though bond yields continue to climb, something President Donald Trump has sought to contain.

Amid the trade war and signs that inflation is slowly coming in toward the Fed's 2% target, Trump has hectored central bank officials to lower rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though, has said the Fed won't be swayed by political interference.

The meeting also featured discussion about the Fed's five-year policy framework.

When officials last visited their long-range policy, they devised what became known as ""flexible average inflation targeting,"" which essentially asserted that officials could allow inflation to run above their 2% target for a while in the interest of promoting more inclusive labor market gains.

In their discussion, officials noted that the strategy ""has diminished benefits in an environment with a substantial risk of large inflationary shocks"" or rates aren't near zero, where they had been in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed held interest rates near the lower boundary despite inflation surging following the Covid pandemic, forcing them into aggressive hikes later.

The minutes noted a desire for policy that is ""robust to a wide variety of economic environments."" Officials also said they have no intention on altering the inflation goal.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday pushed back against an emerging critique of his on-again, off-again tariff threats, which has been derisively summed up as the ""TACO trade.""

The term coined by a Financial Times columnist — which stands for ""Trump Always Chickens Out"" — describes a pattern in which Trump announces heavy new tariffs, sending markets tumbling, and then later pauses or lightens them, causing markets to rebound.

When asked by CNBC about the term at the White House, Trump denied that he had ever backed down and suggested that his moves have helped the U.S. gain ground in trade negotiations.

""After I did what I did, they said, 'We'll meet anytime you want,'"" Trump said of the European Union, which he had recently targeted with a 50% U.S. tariff — before announcing two days later that he was delaying that new levy.

""You call that chickening out?"" Trump said.

""It's called negotiation,"" he added, after criticizing the question as ""nasty.""

Stocks fell Friday after Trump called for the U.S. to impose the steep tariff on the EU starting June 1. On Sunday, Trump said he would delay that deadline to July 9 after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asked for an extension.

In the next trading session on Tuesday, stocks rallied across major indexes.

Trump in Wednesday's remarks went on to credit the 50% tariff threat with jumpstarting trade talks between the U.S. and the EU.

""The sad thing is, now, when I make a deal with them, it's something much more reasonable, they'll say, 'Oh, he was chicken, he was chicken,'"" Trump said. ""That's so unbelievable.""

The EU-tariff turnabout is not Trump's first time abruptly reversing his own trade policies.

After weeks of buildup, Trump on April 2 unveiled individualized ""reciprocal"" tariff rates against almost every country on Earth, with some getting hit with massive duties of 30% or more.

One week later — and following several bouts of stock-market turmoil — Trump said he would drop all of those tariffs down to 10% for 90 days. Markets responded with one of the biggest single-day rallies in history.

The Trump administration's trade war with China has followed a similar path. The president in April ratcheted up blanket tariffs on Beijing as high as 145%, spurring retaliation and spooking investors. He dropped them to 30% a month later, following an initial round of trade talks.

Elon Musk's startup xAI is paying the Dubai-based messaging platform Telegram $300 million to roll out its Grok artificial intelligence chatbot, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov announced in a post Wednesday.

Durov said he and Musk struck a yearlong partnership that ""strengthens Telegram's financial position.""

In addition to the $300 million payment from xAI, Telegram will also earn 50% of the revenue from xAI subscriptions that are sold on the platform, according to Durov.

""This summer, Telegram users will gain access to the best AI technology on the market,"" Durov wrote.

xAI and Telegram did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Telegram passed one billion monthly users in 2025, and the company is set to raise at least $1.5 billion in a bond issue on Wednesday, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. The messaging platform is popular in countries such as Russia and Ukraine, where it is used by government officials and the military.

Durov is facing an investigation in France, where he is a citizen, for allegedly allowing criminal activity including drug trafficking, fraud and child pornography on Telegram. Following his arrest in August, Durov has been barred from leaving France without authorization.

Telegram said in a previous statement posted on Musk's social media platform X that it abides by European Union laws, and that Durov has ""nothing to hide.""

The Russian-born billionaire left Russia in 2014, according to Telegram's website, and is also a citizen of the United Arab Emirates.

In March, Musk announced xAI merged with X in a deal that values the AI company at $80 billion and the social media company at $33 billion. The company's Grok chatbot was under fire earlier this month after it began responding to user queries with unrelated comments about the controversial topic of ""white genocide"" in South Africa.

xAI said the responses were triggered by an ""unauthorized modification"" that ""violated xAI's internal policies and core values,"" according to a post from the company on X.

""We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability,"" xAI said in the post.

Experts said the Grok responses, and other AI chatbot errors, show how susceptible the systems are to tampering.

The Justice Department on Wednesday said that it was investigating whether a California law allowing trans athletes on female sports teams at state schools violates federal civil rights law.

The department disclosed the investigation to California's attorney general and other officials a day after President Donald Trump threatened in a social media post to revoke large-scale federal funding from the state if it ignored his executive order banning transgender athletes from women's sports.

""The investigation is to determine whether California, its senior legal, educational, and athletic organizations, and the school district are engaging in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of sex,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California said in a statement.

At the same time, the Justice Department said it had filed a statement of interest in a federal court lawsuit filed on behalf of girls' athletes that argues trans athletes should be barred from competing with them under federal laws.

""The statement of interest is part of a national effort by the President, the Attorney General, and the Justice Department to oppose the deprivation of women and girls of fair athletic opportunities,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office said.

At issue in the probe is the question of whether California's School Success and Opportunity Act, the state law also known as AB 1266, conflicts with Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in schools or educational programs that receive funding from the U.S. government. 

AB 1266 allows students to participate in school programs and athletic events consistent with their gender identity.

""Title IX exists to protect women and girls in education.  It is perverse to allow males to compete against girls, invade their private spaces, and take their trophies,"" said Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights, in a statement.

""This Division will aggressively defend women's hard-fought rights to equal educational opportunities.""

Trump, in his Truth Social post Tuesday, wrote, ""This week a transitioned Male athlete, at a major event, won 'everything,' and is now qualified to compete in the 'State Finals' next weekend.""

""As a Male, he was a less than average competitor. As a Female, this transitioned person is practically unbeatable. THIS IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS,"" the president wrote.

President Donald Trump's executive orders on nuclear power could lead to the deployment of small modular reactors in the U.S. by late 2030, GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik said Wednesday.

Trump on Friday ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to decide on applications to construct and operate new nuclear plants within 18 months. The order also calls for the NRC to ""adopt shorter deadlines tailored to particular reactor types."" The nuclear industry has long complained that the NRC's approval process takes too long.

Trump's order could result in approvals to start building small modular reactors in the U.S. by 2027, Strazik told the research firm Bernstein in an interview. This would create a ""credible shot"" of adding these reactors to the U.S. nuclear fleet in late 2030 or 2031, the CEO said.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are plant designs that many in the industry view as the future of nuclear power. SMR developers including GE Vernova believe the reactors will one day lower the cost of building nuclear plants and speed up construction because they are smaller and assembled onsite with prefabricated parts. Large nuclear plants such as Plant Vogtle in Georgia have been plagued with multi-billion dollar cost overruns and lengthy construction delays.

""It's just the beginning of what could very much become a very meaningful part of our business in the 2030s. We're very encouraged by this,"" Strazik said of Trump's executive order.

GE Vernova received approval earlier this month to deploy its BWRX-300 reactor in Ontario, Canada. It will be the first SMR deployed in the West, according to the company. The Tennessee Valley Authority filed an application with the NRC earlier this month to build a GE Vernova reactor at Oak Ridge, Tenn.

""We expect more customers to put in applications to construct new SMRs with our technology before the year is over,"" Strazik said. Customer interest in GE Vernova's SMR is ""very high,"" with users increasingly willing to pay a premium for nuclear because it doesn't emit carbon dioxide, the CEO said.

GE Vernova's core business is manufacturing and servicing natural gas-powered turbines, which is seeing high demand as electricity consumption grows in the U.S. The company's stock has soared nearly 48% this year.

Watch CBS News


Updated on:  May 28, 2025 / 1:50 PM EDT
          / CBS News
        

Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday touted the Trump administration's ties with the cryptocurrency industry  — a once-fringe business that President Trump and his allies have embraced in recent months.

""I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House,"" Vance told the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas.

The Trump administration has leaned into cryptocurrency, looking to ease regulations, promote growth in the industry, and bring it into the mainstream. A longstanding backer of cryptocurrencies, Vance owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to an August 2024 financial disclosure.

""We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy, and are here to stay,"" Vance said Wednesday. 

Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with ""this level of energy,"" adding, ""but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins."" Vance gave few policy specifics in his speech. But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has ""transformed"" how Americans make transactions and acts as a ""hedge"" against bad policy. 

""Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control,"" he said. ""It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics."" 

Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar. 

""In this administration, we do not think that stablecoin's threatened the integrity of the United States dollar, quite the opposite,"" Vance said Wednesday. ""In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might."" 

Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to ""speak up"" and ""get involved,"" and he needs them to step up again. 

""Unless you guys get involved in politics, politics is going to ignore this industry,"" Vance said. ""... While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. None of us are. What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, it will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we don't make the right decisions. So the first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.""

The Las Vegas event is also featuring a handful of other Trump backers: His two eldest sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have invested in crypto ventures, are speaking Wednesday on a panel about ""the rise of new bitcoin business models."" Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist who serves as the White House's crypto czar, spoke on Tuesday.

Vance is the highest-ranking sitting politician to address the Bitcoin Conference, which describes itself as ""the world's largest gathering of bitcoiners"" and often draws crypto-friendly lawmakers. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year.

Vance headlined a fundraiser hosted by MAGA Inc. on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where tickets were priced at $1 million a head, CBS News has learned. The fundraiser was first reported by The Washington Post. 

Bitcoin — and cryptocurrency more generally — has grown in prominence and drawn allies from both parties, despite skepticism about its volatility. The price of Bitcoin, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has leaped nearly 60% in the last year.

Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin a ""scam"" whose value is ""based on thin air."" But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised to reverse strict Biden-era regulations.

Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced Tuesday it is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded ""meme coin"" earlier this year, and Mr. Trump hosted the digital currency's top investors at his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded a Bitcoin mining venture that's seeking to go public.

The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics experts who argue Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president. 

The GENIUS Act, the once-bipartisan Senate bill aimed at regulating stablecoins, bled support after Democratic lawmakers pushed for restrictions on elected officials buying or selling crypto — with some Democrats directly citing Mr. Trump's crypto investments. Senators ultimately voted to advance the bill earlier this month.

The White House has strongly denied any conflict-of-interest issues, saying Mr. Trump's assets are held in a trust managed by his children.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","How has Bitcoin performed since Trump took office?","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/28/how-has-bitcoin-performed-since-trump-took-office","Wed, 28 May 2025 07:30:51 GMT","

Bitcoin has surged 60 percent since Trump's re-election in November 2024, reaching current highs of $111,000.

The world's largest Bitcoin conference is taking place in Las Vegas, Nevada from May 27-29.

This year's event includes several speakers from US President Donald Trump's circle including Vice President JD Vance; Trump's two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump; as well as White House crypto tsar David Sacks.









Trump's favourable view of cryptocurrency and his family's heavy involvement in the industry is raising concerns about the integrity of Trump's administration and how he is using his influence as president of the United States.

Over the past week, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $111,970, marking a 2.6 percent increase from its previous Inauguration Day peak of $109,114.

Since Donald Trump's re-election in November 2024, Bitcoin has surged 60 percent, rising from about $69,539 at close on Election Day to its current record level.

The cryptocurrency briefly dropped below $90,000 on February 25, amid market jitters triggered by Trump's announcement of new tariffs on multiple countries and industries worldwide, before recovering.



During the Biden administration, government policy on cryptocurrency was mixed, with a plethora of lawsuits brought against crypto firms by then Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler, who has been replaced under the new Trump administration. There were also major moves to adopt cryptocurrency, with the SEC approving 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024.

In 2022 and into 2023, the crypto market faced major drawdowns following the implosion of Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2022 and the regional banking crisis in early 2023. This led to the Federal Reserve Board releasing statements to banks on the risks of crypto assets, which it has recently withdrawn.

The crypto industry has emerged as a significant political player, contributing large sums to support Trump and other legislators.

Much of Biden's crypto policies have been rescinded under the Trump administration, with the US Senate advancing key pro-crypto legislation such as the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the Digital Asset Stockpile, aimed at maintaining control of Bitcoin seized as part of “criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings”.

Trump's cryptocurrency policies included appointing pro-crypto figures to key regulatory roles, such as naming Paul Atkins as the new SEC chair.

The most recent rally in Bitcoin is largely prompted by investor optimism over a more crypto-friendly administration and proposed regulatory changes to reduce barriers to entry in the crypto asset markets.

Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin's maximum supply is 21 million coins. Because of this, the White House has stated “there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve.”

With Bitcoin priced at $110,000 and a circulating supply of approximately 19.87m BTC, its market capitalisation stands at roughly $2.18 trillion.

If Bitcoin were a country, it would be a major economic powerhouse, ranking roughly in the top 10 worldwide by gross domestic product (GDP) size, roughly on par with countries like Brazil ($2.17 trillion), Canada ($2.14 trillion) or Russia ($2.02 trillion).



Just before taking office, Trump launched the $TRUMP meme coin at a Crypto Ball held in Washington, DC. Meme coins are often created as a joke and are susceptible to volatile price movements, however, Trump's coin has allowed top investors access to him.

Last week, President Trump hosted top investors for a cryptocurrency project at his luxury golf course in Northern Virginia. It's estimated investors spent $148m on the $TRUMP coin to secure their seats at the dinner, with the top 25 spending more than $111m, according to crypto intelligence firm Inca Digital, the Reuters news agency reported.

While the White House insisted Trump would be attending the event “in his personal time”, he spoke at the event behind a podium marked with the presidential seal.

When Trump's meme coin launched, it first surged, then fell in value, while its creators, which include an entity linked to the Trump Organization, made hundreds of millions in trading fees.

The Trump family is now deeply invested in crypto, with ventures like First Lady Melania Trump's coin and a stake in World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm founded in 2024.

While government officials have financial disclosure requirements, and regulatory agencies can monitor the goings-on of officials, critics have warned of conflicts of interest, as Trump backs crypto after once opposing it, potentially using policy to boost his own gains.

Bitfinex analyst Jag Kooner believes that Bitcoin and Ethereum are driven by the macroeconomic environment, which is pushing them to new highs. 

Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) may be heading for another move higher. According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, the current macroeconomic environment is favorable for digital assets. In particular, traders are looking at Federal Reserve guidance and consumer spending data, the Bitfinex analyst shared in a note with crypto.news on May 28.

For one, the Fed is under pressure from the potential inflationary effects of tariffs. If the Fed is worried about this, Kooner expects the rates will likely stay at their current level. However, core personal consumption expenditures may have a more direct impact on the dollar. 

“The Core PCE data on Friday will be the most binary macro event. Market pricing expects stability; any downside surprise below 2.6% y/y (core) will trigger a compression in real yields and dollar softness, catalyzing capital back into crypto,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex. 

If the dollar falls, traders will be looking for other assets to protect their wealth. In this context, Bitcoin is a strong option. Kooner notes that institutional inflows are strong, with $1 billion net inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on the week ending on Sunday, May 25. 

Notably, Ethereum may be driving the altcoin rally, suggests Kooner, noting that ETH was up 6% against BTC off local lows. What is more, Kooner states that this is not driven by retail demand, but more institutional interest. 

“This is the beginning of what might become Phase 3 of the crypto bull cycle, where BTC strength stabilizes, ETH accelerates, and capital spreads out across selective altcoins,” Kooner noted about Ethereum's recent growth. 

Still, the timing of the potential rally will likely depend on the macro environment. If the Fed minutes and the PCE are favorable, this could trigger another rally. 

“The underlying takeaway for traders: crypto isn't overbought, it's underallocated—macro just decides how quickly capital flows in,” he concluded.

A former director of the collapsed Australian crypto exchange ACX.io is facing civil court action over what regulators allege are serious breaches tied to the disappearance of millions in customer funds.

On Wednesday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission announced proceedings against Liang “Allan” Guo, accusing him of misusing user funds, failing to keep proper financial records, and making misleading statements while serving as a director at Blockchain Global Ltd. 

The company, now in liquidation, operated the ACX exchange, which froze withdrawals in late 2019 and ultimately left over $20 million in claims from former customers.

The lawsuit is the culmination of a years-long investigation into one of Australia's earliest and most damaging crypto exchange failures. 

Liquidators estimate that ACX users are owed at least $22.7 million of the company's total debt of $58.6 million to unsecured creditors.

The regulator had previously halted Blockchain Global's 2017 IPO bid and refused it a financial services license, citing governance concerns.

ASIC launched its formal investigation into the exchange's collapse in January 2024. Weeks later, the Federal Court imposed interim travel restrictions on Guo. 

When those expired on August 20, he left the country on September 23 and has not returned.

In an October 2023 report to ASIC and creditors, liquidator Andrew Yeo of Pitcher Partners found that customer funds were co-mingled with company money and redirected into related entities, as cited by ABC News.

That's reminiscent of former global exchange FTX's misuse of customer funds, where billions were allegedly diverted to its affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research, without user consent.

Guo told liquidators that wallet credentials for Blockchain Global's crypto holdings, worth several million dollars, were lost when his laptop was stolen in China in 2019. 

As first reported in December 2021 by The Sydney Morning Herald, no police report was ever filed to substantiate the claim.

Blockchain Global's other directors, Xue “Sam” Lee and Zijang “Ryan” Xu, are also under investigation by ASIC. 

In the same month the probe began, Lee was charged by U.S. authorities with allegedly running a $1.89 billion Ponzi scheme under the HyperTech umbrella, which included HyperFund and HyperVerse.

U.S. prosecutors unsealed criminal wire fraud and securities fraud charges against Lee, accusing him of promoting bogus investment platforms with false promises of crypto mining returns. 

The SEC also filed a civil complaint the same day against Lee and promoter Brenda “Bitcoin Beautee” Chunga, who later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud.

As India tries to understand the second Trump administration's unexpected enthusiasm for renewing ties with Pakistan, an unusual development is drawing global attention: An ambitious — and somewhat surreal — cryptocurrency collaboration between Pakistan and World Liberty Financial Inc (WLFI), a firm tied to the Trump family.

WLFI, reportedly run by Donald Trump's children and Zack Witkoff — the son of Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff — signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) last month with the Pakistan Crypto Council, formed in March. The WLFI delegation was warmly received in Islamabad and Lahore, with meetings involving both PM Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief Asim Munir. The MoU outlines sweeping plans to use blockchain technology to promote financial inclusion, monetise untapped national assets such as rare earths, introduce stablecoins for remittances and trade, and position Pakistan as a regional crypto hub.

The viability of these plans remains uncertain, given the parlous state of Pakistan's economy. But India should pay close attention to Pakistan's crypto ambitions — especially amid the possible misuse of these digital currencies not controlled by any central bank to fund terror and launder money across borders. Far more consequential, however, is the potential transformation of the global financial order triggered by the Trump administration's new crypto policy. Cryptocurrencies, once dismissed as a financial fad, have now become disruptive instruments in global finance. Their decentralised architecture, rapid innovation, and increasing adoption are reshaping monetary policy, regulatory frameworks, and cross-border economic flows.

In his second term, Trump has moved swiftly to reposition the US as a global leader in digital assets. During his campaign, Trump reversed his earlier scepticism of crypto and promised to dismantle the Biden-era hostility toward the sector. The crypto industry, sensing a huge opportunity, rallied behind him. Within days of assuming office, Trump issued two executive orders that reshaped America's crypto strategy. The first order codified a national blockchain innovation strategy, curtailed regulatory overreach, and banned the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). It also formed the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, chaired by the White House's “AI and crypto czar”, David Sacks, to design a new regulatory framework within six months.

The second order created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile to consolidate government-seized crypto assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This initiative aimed to turn digital assets into national reserves akin to gold, without tapping into taxpayer funds. In supporting lawful, dollar-backed stablecoins while explicitly banning CBDCs, Trump seeks to ensure sustained dominance of the US dollar in the international system.

Trump's appointments — including pro-crypto figures like Elon Musk and Sacks — signal a major shift in Washington. The Securities and Exchange Commission paused its lawsuits against major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, while the Justice Department dissolved its crypto enforcement team. Markets responded with enthusiasm: Bitcoin surged past $74,000 in March 2025 and is valued this week at more than $100,000.

Adding a personal twist to his crypto strategy, Trump also launched a meme coin —$TRUMP— turning himself into a direct stakeholder in the crypto surge. Meanwhile, WLFI is reaching out to many countries, including Pakistan, for deals on crypto. Until recently, Pakistan showed little interest in cryptocurrencies, having banned or restricted them like India. But that has changed dramatically. In early 2025, the government appointed a young British Pakistani entrepreneur Bilal bin Saqib to lead the Pakistan Crypto Council. This week, Saqib was appointed special adviser to Pakistan's Prime Minister and tasked with creating a regulatory framework to promote crypto adoption. Estimates suggest Pakistan may have up to 25 million crypto users and a market worth $2 billion.

Even with a stagnant economy, an underdeveloped financial sector, and limited technological capabilities, Pakistan appears determined to carve out a niche in the emerging crypto world. The strategy includes cultivating its diaspora in the US, particularly tech entrepreneurs who now serve as a conduit to the Trump administration. At a recent diaspora convention — Pakistan's first, modelled after India's Pravasi Bharatiya Divas — Munir reaffirmed the ideological foundations of Pakistan's statehood and signalled a reassertion of influence abroad.
While the Indian diaspora's tech influence is well known, Pakistan's diaspora is now making moves of its own — leveraging crypto to rekindle Pakistan's ties with the US, which had frayed under both the Trump and Biden administrations. India should not dismiss these developments as inconsequential. In the 1970s, Delhi underestimated Pakistan's nuclear ambitions, assuming it lacked the scientific and technological base.

By the late 1980s, Pakistan had developed nuclear weapons and leveraged them to create a challenging security environment for India. More urgently, India needs to reflect on its own crypto strategy — or the lack of it. There has been little public discourse on the geopolitical and technological implications of crypto. This lack of government engagement contrasts with the growing number of crypto users in India, estimated to be more than 100 million, and a market size of nearly $7 billion.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court stepped into this breach. In hearing the bail petition of Shailesh Bhatt, a Gujarat resident accused of cryptocurrency fraud, the Court remarked on the Centre's paradoxical policy of taxing crypto assets without developing a regulatory framework. It warned that the legal and policy vacuum on cryptocurrencies would create serious challenges to India's economy and security. India no longer has the luxury of ignoring the changing regional and global crypto landscape. Delhi needs to come to terms with Pakistan's new digital pivot and Trump's plans to refashion the global financial order with crypto and related technologies.

Updated on:  May 28, 2025 / 1:50 PM EDT
          / CBS News
        

Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday touted the Trump administration's ties with the cryptocurrency industry  — a once-fringe business that President Trump and his allies have embraced in recent months.

""I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House,"" Vance told the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas.

The Trump administration has leaned into cryptocurrency, looking to ease regulations, promote growth in the industry, and bring it into the mainstream. A longstanding backer of cryptocurrencies, Vance owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to an August 2024 financial disclosure.

""We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy, and are here to stay,"" Vance said Wednesday. 

Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with ""this level of energy,"" adding, ""but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins."" Vance gave few policy specifics in his speech. But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has ""transformed"" how Americans make transactions and acts as a ""hedge"" against bad policy. 

""Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control,"" he said. ""It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics."" 

Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar. 

""In this administration, we do not think that stablecoin's threatened the integrity of the United States dollar, quite the opposite,"" Vance said Wednesday. ""In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might."" 

Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to ""speak up"" and ""get involved,"" and he needs them to step up again. 

""Unless you guys get involved in politics, politics is going to ignore this industry,"" Vance said. ""... While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. None of us are. What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, it will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we don't make the right decisions. So the first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.""

The Las Vegas event is also featuring a handful of other Trump backers: His two eldest sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have invested in crypto ventures, are speaking Wednesday on a panel about ""the rise of new bitcoin business models."" Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist who serves as the White House's crypto czar, spoke on Tuesday.

Vance is the highest-ranking sitting politician to address the Bitcoin Conference, which describes itself as ""the world's largest gathering of bitcoiners"" and often draws crypto-friendly lawmakers. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year.

Vance headlined a fundraiser hosted by MAGA Inc. on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where tickets were priced at $1 million a head, CBS News has learned. The fundraiser was first reported by The Washington Post. 

Bitcoin — and cryptocurrency more generally — has grown in prominence and drawn allies from both parties, despite skepticism about its volatility. The price of Bitcoin, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has leaped nearly 60% in the last year.

Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin a ""scam"" whose value is ""based on thin air."" But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised to reverse strict Biden-era regulations.

Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced Tuesday it is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded ""meme coin"" earlier this year, and Mr. Trump hosted the digital currency's top investors at his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded a Bitcoin mining venture that's seeking to go public.

The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics experts who argue Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president. 

The GENIUS Act, the once-bipartisan Senate bill aimed at regulating stablecoins, bled support after Democratic lawmakers pushed for restrictions on elected officials buying or selling crypto — with some Democrats directly citing Mr. Trump's crypto investments. Senators ultimately voted to advance the bill earlier this month.

The White House has strongly denied any conflict-of-interest issues, saying Mr. Trump's assets are held in a trust managed by his children.

VivoPower International (VVPR), a Nasdaq-listed energy company, said on Wednesday it has secured $121 million in a private share placement to fund its pivot to digital asset treasury focusing on XRP XRP$2.24, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

The raise was led by Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, investing $100 million, a spokesperson to the company told CoinDesk. The company sold 20 million ordinary shares priced at $6.05 per share.

Adam Traidman, a former Ripple executive who led the SBI Ripple Asia, is joining the company as chairman of the board of advisors, according to the press release. Ripple is an enterprise-focused blockchain service provider closely related to the XRP Ledger.

VivoPower shares surged as much as 26% on the news before giving back some of the gains. Recently, they were up over 11%, trading around $6.75.

The move is the latest example of public firms raising money to purchase and add digital assets to their treasuries, a playbook popularized by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) that has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin BTC$107,093.86. While BTC has been the most sought-after asset among these firms, recent newcomers like DeFi Development and SharpLink Gaming directed their focus to Solana's SOL SOL$169.59 and Ethereum's ether ETH$2,621.25, respectively.

VivoPower, founded in 2014, aims to be the first publicly traded company with a crypto treasury strategy centered around XRP. It also plans to spin off its legacy business.

""After reviewing a number of listed vehicles seeking to embrace a digital asset treasury model, we selected VivoPower given its strategic focus on XRP and its objective to contribute to building out of the XRPL ecosystem,"" Prince Abdulaziz said in a statement. ""We have been investors in the digital asset sector for a decade and have been long-term holders of XRP.""

This Male Fertility Test Makes Assessing Sperm Health a More Accurate At-Home Affair

A new study suggests a way to more accurately test sperm health from home.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

The World Health Organization estimates that infertility impacts one in six adults globally. But when it comes to addressing infertility, male partners are often left out of the equation. Some studies suggest that in 18 to 27 percent of cases where a heterosexual couple seeks medical help for fertility issues, doctors won't bother to run any tests on the man. Those stats might make you think male fertility issues are rare, but that's definitely not the case. According to some estimates, male fertility issues are the sole cause of infertility in some 20 percent of cases and contribute to the problem in another 30 to 40 percent of cases. In other words, if a couple is having trouble conceiving, there's about a 50–50 chance that sperm-related issues are a factor.

Perhaps because of the stigma around talking about and testing for male infertility, there hasn't been much innovation in those diagnostics. That's starting to change, with at-home testing options popping up to offer privacy and convenience. But today's guest is pushing the envelope even further: he's the co-author of a recent study that suggests folks could test some aspects of sperm health right at home—without even sending their samples off to a lab.

Thank you so much for coming on to chat with us today.

Sushanta Mitra: It's a pleasure.

Feltman: So let's start with a pretty basic question: Why is it important to be able to test sperm health, and, and what are the hurdles that are in our way right now?

Mitra: It's a very good question. So if you look at the very area of male fertility, there's quite a bit of a social stigma associated with it in terms of, you know, having a way to access a lab, do regular testing, and so forth. So our idea here is to really bring this kind of test [to the] home so that one can do this test at their own leisure and then can really monitor the health of the sperms.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and I know that there are some at-home sperm tests, but what would you say the issues are there that your research was trying to solve?

Mitra: Yeah, so what we are trying to [do] is really empowering individuals with their, you know, at-home test, which is quite—very accurate, it will be at a very low cost, and it is looking at a very different paradigm.

So most of the tests in the lab, lab or ... elsewhere [are] all based on understanding the sperm motility through microscopy-based technique. In our case it is a completely different way; it is looking at a very different physical parameter, which is the adhesion measurement of a sperm-laden droplet in contact with a given surface.

Feltman: Hmm, and how did this research get started? You know, you mentioned you're part of a school of engineering.

Mitra: So my group has been working on understanding adhesion of various droplets on surfaces, so we [developed] a technique of doing this via a cantilever-based technology, which allowed us to do this in a very universal, systematic way, so that if you bring a cantilever in a close contact with the surface, then automatically it will help us to understand: What is the adhesion of that drop with that substrate?

Feltman: Mm.

Mitra: So based on [that] understanding and also [an] understanding of how living matter like bacteria, viruses, and so forth—we worked during the COVID time, as well, understanding how bacteria interacts with surfaces for antibacterial, antiviral coatings.

So all of this knowledge then started building in our group, and then I happened to have an excellent collaborator in the [systems design] engineering professor Veronika Magdanz. So she is [an] expert in terms of sperm motion and so forth, so when she brought this problem to my group, then we thought, “Okay, we developed a tool [for] understanding adhesion of drops on a surface; what happens when we have this drop full of sperm [cells]?”

Feltman: Mm.

Mitra: And I think that very question started this curiosity-driven research that, at the end, helped us to address a very important global health problem.

Feltman: Right, so you're essentially looking at how well different droplets stick to surfaces, is that correct?

Mitra: Correct, yeah.

Feltman: And what were you able to correlate that with in sperm?

Mitra: So in sperm it is really the motility, so for example, if you think about if the sperm cells are very viable, motile, when you have a drop ... in contact with that substrate, it will try to move away from the substrate ...

Feltman: Mm.

Mitra: So in other words, highly motile, or healthy, sperm will have less adhesion. So that counterintuitive kind of a signature of adhesion [helps] us to create this kind of a tool for sperm quality.

Feltman: So what would this look like in a home test?

Mitra: A male individual can regularly, you know, collect their semen sample and then put it inside this so-called—what we envision as a black box, which will actually then give gradation, or rate, of “good,” “medium quality,” “high quality,” and so forth.

So the other addressing part here is what we want to ensure—like, there are a lot of challenges, which [have] been documented, in terms of the quality of sperm with respect to the lifestyle choices. For example, if an individual is smoking ...

Feltman: Mm.

Mitra: Or if [an] individual has a sedentary life, then the quality of the sperm decreases. So by looking at this kind of testing, an individual can make ... proactive lifestyle choices and make themself more active or quit smoking when they plan to have their family and so forth, so I think this can be a very important tool towards, you know, addressing challenges related to [the reproductive], you know, system as well.

Feltman: Yeah, so what are your next steps? You know, what questions do you still have to answer?

Mitra: Well, the next step is to really try to miniaturize the system, right? And make it in our, as I was mentioning, a black box [laughs], so to speak, so that it can be—readily deployed at places, for example, at home and so forth. So I think that kind of a translation part in terms of developing, if you will, a prototype or minimum viable product, which would be a next step ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Mitra: Towards commercialization.

Feltman: And how quickly do you think this research could make it into a commercial product?

Mitra: It's all about money, you know [laughs]? If we get enough resources, funding, then of course, we can accelerate. We have the right people, right tool, right researchers, collaborators to help us move this forward, and of course, we are actively seeking terms of grant funding to make this happen.

I think it is also very critical, you know, to understand the importance of interdisciplinary research. You know, I'm coming from [a] mechanical engineering background with a very different skill set, and my collaborator, professor Veronika Magdanz, is coming from [systems design] engineering with a different sort of skill set. When you have these [kinds] of complementary skill sets coming together and learning from each other—which I think that's the joy of this kind of interdisciplinary research—one can really create [these kinds] of innovative breakthroughs.

Feltman: Yeah. Well, thank you so much for coming on to chat today, and looking forward to seeing your work progress.

Mitra: Thank you. Thanks for this opportunity.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday to find out what exactly it takes for human beings to flourish.

As the creator of Veritasium, a science education YouTube channel with 18 million subscribers, Derek Muller has spent the past 15 years exploring a counterintuitive vision for learning: Clarity numbs the mind, but confusion can crack it open. His audience has grown because of how he challenges common misconceptions about the laws of nature, and his rise has paralleled YouTube's, whose creator-focused approach has made it the world's largest streaming service by almost every measure—from content library to audience size—recently surpassing Netflix in revenue. Amid this symbiosis, Veritasium evolved—from unpolished five-minute clips of Muller quizzing people on the street to technically sophisticated science explorations with the satisfying depth of feature films. Muller himself has appeared in many roles: trickster science teacher, experimenter with a mad-scientist flair, fearless investigator in the mold of Indiana Jones. And in Veritasium's most recent video, one of the channel's longest yet, he steps forward as an advocate for one of today's most pressing health issues: the toxic “forever chemicals” that are now being found to contaminate almost every human being, animal and ecosystem on Earth. Entitled How One Company Secretly Poisoned the Planet, the video clocks in at nearly an hour and garnered almost three million views within a day. It is not only an exposé of corporate malfeasance but also a scientific explainer of these forever chemicals (known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS) and their harm to humans. It debuted on the same day that the Environmental Protection Agency announced sweeping rollbacks of PFAS safeguards, supercharging the video's impact. Leveraging his audience, resources and cinematic craft, Muller has now focused Veritasium on a crisis whose invisible poisons, as the film's finale reveals, are already circulating in his own blood.

Teaching began early for Muller. Born in Traralgon, Australia, in 1982, he relocated to Vancouver as a toddler and so excelled in school that his teachers sometimes invited him to tutor the class. “There was a certain way in which science appeared like magic,” he recalls—invoking science-fiction giant Arthur C. Clarke's adage that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from sorcery. He remembers ordinary school experiments—the upside-down glass that keeps a tissue dry underwater and the soda-and-Mentos fountain. But what stuck was the sense that the universe kept secrets only curiosity could unlock. “Isn't it everything?” he says when asked why science matters. “Isn't it obvious that it's the most important thing?”

When Muller graduated, he was torn between pursuing filmmaking and science. He wanted to be “uniquely useful,” he says. “I felt like if I went into science, maybe I would be a swappable cog in some sort of machine.” But he also feared that pursuing film might have him running coffees in Los Angeles in hopes of making the right connection and getting a break. He took a full scholarship in engineering physics at Queen's University in Ontario and then decamped to Sydney, Australia, to pursue film—only to learn that the Australian Film, Television and Radio School admits just a handful of students per program each year. Lacking a portfolio, he wandered into the University of Sydney's physics department in hopes of a tutoring gig and stayed to do a doctorate on how people learn—or fail to. In classes, he noticed that students often nodded appreciatively but retained almost nothing. “If you perform a demonstration and don't force the class to make a prediction,” he says, “they'll learn about as much as if they never saw the demonstration at all.”

Muller's doctoral thesis compared two instructional video styles, which were viewed by undergraduates at the University of Sydney. The first featured an actor delivering a polished, textbook explanation of Newton's laws. Participants described this version as easy to follow. The second portrayed a student repeatedly stumbling over the laws while a tutor tried to set him straight. Most viewers found this depiction confusing. But when tested on the concepts, participants who called the textbook account “clear” scored no better than they had before watching it. By contrast, those who watched the “confusing” video improved significantly. Muller's takeaway was that learning requires friction—and that a student's first confident error may be the strongest lever a teacher can pull. “Some level of discomfort seems to be essential,” Muller says. “That's when learning can really take place.”

After Muller received his Ph.D., he says, he took a stable job with a tutoring company in Sydney only to realize that “so much of my life had been about back-up plans.” As he looked for a way to merge his passions, his attention fell on YouTube. The platform, which launched in 2005 and was acquired by Google in 2006, had reversed the logic of the Web: Instead of charging creators to host videos, it was sharing advertising revenue with them and splitting the money 55–45 in the creators' favor—“a profound shift in thinking,” Muller says. In Australia comedian Natalie Tran's YouTube channel had already crossed a million subscribers, and she was pulling in a six-figure income. Whereas success in the film industry often depended on luck and connections, YouTube seemed more meritocratic to Muller. He kept tutoring 15 hours per week to pay his bills and started the channel he named Veritasium, which combines veritas, Latin for “truth,” with the “ium” suffix of an element to mean “an element of truth.”

Muller uploaded his first clip under the channel name Veritasium in early 2011. His trademark became the street-corner quiz. He would ask passersby why the sky was blue or whether a heavy object would fall faster than a light one and then watch their confidence crumble as he kept questioning them. In one video, he asked people what they thought would happen to an extended Slinky when it was dropped from a roof. They guessed it would simply fall. When his slow-motion footage revealed that the bottom end of the released Slinky merely hung suspended until a compression wave arrived from above, viewers felt their intuition buckle. Millions clicked, with each view yielding pennies and each penny affirming Muller's hypothesis: discomfort correlates with learning—and with viewer engagement.

Nigel Kuan, a high school physics teacher, who met Muller while studying at the University of Sydney and later collaborated on several Veritasium videos, says Muller's emphasis on using people's misconceptions to teach science has influenced his own approach. “I actually recommend the videos to newer teachers,” he says. One in particular, called Why Do You Make People Look Stupid?, stands out to Kuan as best representing Muller's pedagogic style. It opens with Muller arriving at a café table and saying, “Hey, YouTube, you said you wanted to talk. What's up?” Across from him also sits Muller, wearing a white YouTube T-shirt and the type of reflective aviator glasses favored by law enforcement. “YouTube Muller” accuses Muller of making people look stupid and shows clips in which the latter watches as individuals fumble through incorrect scientific explanations. YouTube Muller then quotes viewer comments—many laden with expletives—that called Muller “condescending” and “pretentious” and asks, “Why does your face light up with glee every time you hear a misconception?” This video, it turns out, is no different from those in which Muller invites people to explain what water is or where trees get their mass. But now the fallacy to be disproved is not about science but about him: that, in his own words, he “delights in humiliating other people.” Muller, of course, returns to his core idea: people learn better if they confront their own misconceptions.

In mid-2011, when Muller was getting his channel off the ground, YouTube was already processing 48 hours of new videos every minute and logging about three billion daily views. Soon it began organizing meetups and creator spaces in major cities and promoting thousands of fledgling teaching channels—from crash-course chemistry to Muller's experiment-driven physics. The result was a self-reinforcing marketplace where educators could earn a living and viewers could binge gravitational waves alongside gaming highlights. YouTube's 2012 decision to reward watch-time minutes over mere clicks also encouraged Muller to develop longer videos in which he layered demonstrations, expert cameos, and slow-burn narrative reveals, unspooling each episode like a mystery novel. In 2013 Veritasium cleared one million subscribers—by 2021, the number was 10 million. As for YouTube, today more than 500 hours pour onto the platform each minute. It counts 2.7 billion monthly users. And as of October 2024, its combined ad-and-subscription income had topped $50 billion in the past four quarters—comfortably ahead of any other individual streaming platform, including those owned by Amazon and Disney.

Casper Mebius, who joined Veritasiumas an intern in 2023 and now writes, directs and produces episodes, recalls his first meeting with Muller, who, “instead of interrupting me or cutting me short, just literally let me talk through the whole thing for 40 minutes.” Mebius soon learned this wasn't unusual. Muller often patiently listens through meetings with his team. “Then he just makes one comment, and it's like he's throwing a dart and hitting the bull's-eye,” Mebius says. In this way, Muller is still teaching—letting others lay out their predictions and take the risks necessary for learning. But at times, his emphasis on the pedagogical value of risk-taking goes further, as when he swam in shade balls (softball-size plastic spheres that float on reservoirs to block sunlight) after a manufacturer warned him not to, explored Fukushima's radioactive zone and had a bucket of pennies dumped on him from a helicopter to prove that they couldn't kill him.

Fifteen years after its inception, Veritasium—now one of the world's most popular science channels, with 18 million subscribers and more than 3.3 billion views—has grown from a one-man passion project to a team of nearly 20 people supported by investments from Electrify Video Partners, a company that helps digital creators scale their businesses. “Now there's a big team, with dedicated editors, writer-directors and hosts, and that lets us tackle bigger and better stories,” Mebius says. One question the members always ask is whether the story they are telling will make people “change the way they view the world.”

How One Company Secretly Poisoned the Planet is perhaps Veritasium's boldest attempt yet to do so. Gregor Čavlović, a producer and director at Veritasium who co-wrote it with Muller, learned about PFAS while researching a previous project. The new video, which received more viewer watch hours on its first day than any other video in Veritasium's history, layers one mystery atop another: from why fridges were killing people in Chicago in 1929 to why cattle drinking from streams in West Virginia began dying in the 1990s to how the dangers of PFAS were hidden even as chemical corporations made billions. “I think something important to note is how young and scarce research on PFAS is,” Čavlović says.

In the video, as Muller and Čavlović discuss the many ways that PFAS have infiltrated our lives—such as via nonstick cookware, waterproof clothes and stain-resistant carpets—the story becomes increasingly unsettling. It follows West Virgina farmer Wilbur Earl Tennant, who watched more than 150 of his cows slowly die, and environmental lawyer Robert Bilott, who read through 60,000 corporate documents to reveal the risks of contamination. It describes how PFAS have contaminated not just household well water but also snow in the arctic and rain on the Tibetan Plateau. And it culminates with Muller testing his own blood for the forever chemicals. Levels of one of the PFAS chemicals in his blood, he discovers, is twice the national average, and another is six times higher than the average. His combined total places him close to the limit at which U.S. science and health advisory groups recommend screenings for PFAS-related diseases. Based on the contamination levels in many U.S. water sources, Čavlović and Muller deduce that the latter could have reached those blood levels merely by drinking tap water from various sources in and around Los Angeles. This is usually the moment in Veritasium videos where Muller shows his delight in solving a mystery, but this time the look on his face is one of dismay.

The video also points out the Trump administration's threats to newly established EPA rules to limit PFAS in drinking water. “An important point for the video was not just to inform people about how potentially harmful these chemicals are but also to tell them what academic and governmental institutions are doing to help regulate this,” Čavlović says. “But it was by pure chance that the video was published the same day that the EPA actually decided to pull back some of these regulations.”

In an online sphere crowded with science content, Veritasium has consistently excelled for years by not dumbing down its videos to chase clicks. And Muller, as its host, is always quick to share his personal fallibility. “The first principle is: you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool,” he says, invoking the cautionary mantra of physicist Richard Feynman. When a concept confuses or surprises him, he lets the audience know, and these viewers become his partners on the path to discovery. He hopes his approach—relentlessly trying to figure out the truth—will “seep into people's brains on this deep level” and encourage them to understand the world “not as I want it to be, not as it appears to be, but as it actually is,” he says. “That is the unvarnished truth of the channel: it's trying to promote the increase of rationality and critical thinking.”

The company he built operates nomadically, though Muller, his wife—planetary scientist Raquel Nuno—and their four children call Lisbon, Portugal, home at the moment. Parenting, he reflects, is beautifully poetic. “You get to exist in the same interaction that you've already had as a child, but now you're on the other side of it,” he says. When his son asked why a rainbow is an arc, Muller felt the old itch to replace quick answers with deeper voyages. He created the video Why No Two People See the Same Rainbow to explain droplet geometry, refraction, optical caustics and the human penchant for stopping one level short of a true explanation. In this sense, the man accused of making people look stupid is chasing a rarer spectacle: the instant they look enlightened. And as Muller's story proves, embracing confusion can lead not only to deeper understanding but also to extraordinary outcomes and the courage to take on ever greater challenges. After all, Veritasium itself was born when Muller decided to stop playing it safe.

Futuristic Radio Telescope Will Spot Baby Solar Systems—If It's Funded

A new telescope project called the Next-Generation Very Large Array will revolutionize radio astronomy if it gets the funding it needs

By Sarah Scoles edited by Clara Moskowitz

A prototype antenna for the proposed Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) radio telescope in New Mexico. If funded, the project would greatly expand U.S. radio astronomy capabilities.

New Mexico's Plains of San Agustin are otherworldly: Silence, sand and sharp plants reign on the valley floor. Knobbly volcanic rock rises above. Pronghorns' legs and jackrabbits' ears break up the landscape.

And so, too, does one of the world's largest telescopes.

The plains house the aptly named Very Large Array (VLA)—a radio telescope made of 27 different antennas, each of which looks like a home satellite dish on steroids. In the otherwise empty desert, they spread into a Y shape that can extend 22 miles end-to-end. When the antennas are pointed at the same thing in the sky at the same time, they function together as one large telescope, simulating an instrument as wide as the distance between the dishes. In this case, then, images from the VLA have as much resolution as they would if it were a single telescope 22 miles wide: high definition, in other words. The VLA became iconic, and inspirational to a generation of astronomers, thanks to the movie Contact, in which Jodie Foster's character uses the array to hear an alien communication.

The VLA's antennas, the true stars of the film, simultaneously look like they don't belong in the landscape and also like they've always been here. They haven't, of course, but their construction began in the 1970s, making the VLA the oldest instrument in the portfolio of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). This federally-funded organization builds, maintains and operates radio telescopes that any astronomer—regardless of their institutional affiliation or citizenship—can apply to use.

But the VLA, now in its middle age, is due for a replacement. After all these decades, astronomers want something shiny, fully modern and more capable: a new build with all the bells and whistles rather than a charming old Colonial that's been remodeled piecemeal. NRAO is working on that, planning the VLA's proposed successor: the Next-Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). (Astronomers may be scientifically creative, but they are linguistic straight shooters.)

On a Friday afternoon in late April, the organization gathered political leaders together, alongside scientists and engineers, to unveil a prototype antenna—one that will be cloned a couple of hundred times to make up the future ngVLA. It loomed on the plains just beyond the partygoers, standing alongside its predecessors, the old and the new in stereo with each other. “The amount that technology has advanced since the VLA was created is amazing,” says Jill Malusky, NRAO's news and public information manager. “A VLA antenna and an ngVLA antenna look very different because they are.”

Guests wandered near the antennas, checking out a spread of food that included a sculpture, made in the medium of watermelon, of a radio telescope antenna. A chamber quartet played in the background, a single fern fronting them, with an open bar lubricating the event. It was fancy—for science. But for astronomers, the ngVLA is a big deal, and the event was intended, in part, to bolster the political support needed to make it happen. At the moment, it's a proposed project—and still requires final funding. “Having a physical antenna we can point to, and test, to prove the value of this project is such a milestone,” Malusky says. “It makes it all more real.”

Representing an orders-of-magnitude improvement to the VLA that would complement other radio telescopes in the U.S. and abroad, the ambitious project has the enthusiastic yes of the astronomical community. But whether big-science telescopes, radio or otherwise, will survive the current funding environment remains a dark matter. That uncertainty is part of why NRAO's event elicited a spectrum of emotions for Malusky. “It's a mix of excitement and trepidation,” she says. “Can we get people invested in the potential of a major project that is still gathering resources and just over a decade to fruition?”

That Friday afternoon, Tony Beasley, director of NRAO, stood at the front of a hardy event tent and faced the prototype. Its dish was made up of shiny panels assembled into an octagon. From its bottom edge, supportive struts held up a secondary reflecting surface and a receiver (basically the radio version of an optical telescope's camera) that looked a bit like the spaceship Foster's character boarded in Contact.

The antenna, about as wide as a bowling lane is long, has been designed to collect radio waves from space—beamed from stars that are being born or dying, the stuff between stars, and more. As radio light comes in, it will hit the main dish and bounce up to the secondary reflector and then the receiver, which will catch the waves and turn them into digital signals that will then be sent to computers.

As a start, the prototype dish will hook up to VLA's aging ones and gather data alongside them—it will be an apprentice of sorts.

“You see one antenna out there,” said Beasley, directing the audience's attention beyond the tent, which was being shaken by the wind to such an extent that people also cast their eyes upward to assess its structural integrity. NRAO ultimately plans to build 262 more antennas and spread them across the U.S., with their numbers concentrated in the Southwest. Of those antennas, Beasley continued, “192 of them will be visible from where I'm standing right here.”

Together, the ngVLA's antennas could pick up a cell-phone signal from 500 billion kilometers (more than 310 billion miles) away (although that wouldn't be the most likely find). That means it could detect an Android embedded in the Oort Cloud, the collection of comets that makes up the outer part of the solar system. The future telescope's resolution should be high enough to pass a no-glasses eye exam in New York City if the chart of letters were placed in Los Angeles.

That precision gives it scientific latitude, allowing it to address some of astronomers' highest-priority questions, such as how planets come to be and how solar systems like ours form. “You could, say, probe a cloud that is forming planets and find out where the planets are—like individual gaps in the cloud that the planets are carving out,” says David Kaplan, an astronomer and physics professor at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.

Of all the radio telescopes out there, the ngVLA would be the planetary “flagship” for star and planet formation, Kaplan says. At high radio frequencies and big antenna separations, “it would be the only game in town.”

The ngVLA will also look for the organic molecules and chemical conditions of new solar systems that might someday spur life. It will show how galaxies come together and evolve, use the Milky Way's center to test ideas about how gravity works and investigate how stars develop. And it will hunt black holes and their outbursts.

Given those varied abilities, the telescope was highly ranked in astronomers' “decadal survey,” a yearslong process in which the astronomical community takes stock of its most valued scientific questions and assesses which future telescopes are best suited to find some answers. Funding from agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), which bankrolls NRAO, typically follows the survey's recommendations.

The survey recommended the ngVLA as a top priority. “It can change the landscape,” says Matt Dobbs, a physicist at McGill University, who studies the origin and evolution of the universe and worked on the survey alongside Kaplan.

NRAO hopes to start construction on the ngVLA in 2029, with initial operations beginning in 2033. The possibility is a bright spot for American radio astronomy. The VLA is more than 40 years old; the Green Bank Telescope, completed in 2001, is more than 20. And NRAO's latest instrument, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, opened 12 years ago.

The latter two, though not new, aren't going anywhere, as far as anyone knows. But they do different kinds of scientific analyses than the VLA does and the ngVLA will.

The new telescope does, though, have a whippersnapper nipping at its heels. Another future radio observatory, called the Deep Synoptic Array 2000 (DSA-2000), is planning an order of magnitude more dishes than the ngVLA—2,000 of them. But each will be only around 16 feet across, whereas ngVLA's dishes will measure 60 feet. DSA-2000 will also work at a different radio frequency range than the ngVLA.

DSA-2000's development is also moving faster than that of the VLA's successor, though, in large part, that is because the former has relied on private funding more than federal resources, as the ngVLA's prototyping has.

In taking a step back from dependence on the NSF, the DSA-2000 crew might be on to something. Just days before the ngVLA ceremony, the NSF canceled more than 400 active grants; one day before, the agency's then director Sethuraman Panchanathan resigned. “This is a pivotal moment for our nation in terms of global competitiveness,” he said in his goodbye letter. “NSF is an extremely important investment to make U.S. scientific dominance a reality. We must not lose our competitive edge.”

No one knows what the future of NSF-funded astronomy, let alone NSF-funded radio astronomy, looks like. President Donald Trump hasn't said much about that particular domain yet. But not building the ngVLA could put that edge in jeopardy.

Dobbs, though, holds out hope for the U.S.'s role in radio astronomy's future, in part because of the propulsion of its past.

“The United States has everything it needs to make that project a reality,” he adds. Whether it will do so, though, requires gathering more data from the future. After all, it's bad luck to count your antennas before they hatch.

Dobbs has been putting his focus on smaller radio telescopes, such as one called the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and its successor, acronymed CHORD. Both map how hydrogen was distributed in the early universe and detect fast radio bursts. Their antennas are cheap(ish), their overall footprint small, and their ambition is limited to specific science—in this case, gas maps.

At the prototype-antenna unveiling, then, it made sense that there was a liminal feeling to what was otherwise a celebratory gathering. And it was conspicuous that representatives from NSF, the agency that would fund the telescope's construction and operation, weren't there, which Beasley said was the case “for various reasons.”

Chris Smith, interim director of the NSF's division of astronomical sciences, did send a letter to be read to the wined-and-dined crowd. “NSF funded this development not just to ensure the technical feasibility of the advanced capabilities of ngVLA,” he wrote. It also supported the prototype as “a way of creating new innovations in the field of radio astronomy.”

And that may be true. But those who gathered at NRAO's event also hope, specifically, that the ngVLA, a receptacle for optimism about the future of radio astronomy in the U.S., will sprout from this dry ground.

“It starts with a single step,” Beasley said at the event—in this case, a single antenna.

A series of experiments led by Southwest Research Institute's Dr. Ujjwal Raut support spectral data recently collected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that found evidence that the icy surface of Jupiter's moon Europa is constantly changing. Europa's surface ice is crystallizing at different rates in different places, which could point to a complex mix of external processes and geologic activity affecting the surface.

Water ice can be divided into two broad categories based on its structure. On Earth, crystalline ice occurs when water molecules arrange into a hexagonal pattern during the freezing process. But on the surface of Europa, exposed water ice is constantly bombarded by charged particles that disrupt the crystalline structure, forming what is referred to as amorphous ice.

Raut, a program manager in SwRI's Planetary Science Section, cowrote a paper outlining the findings from extensive laboratory experiments conducted by his team to understand the Europa's icy surface. The experiments proved critical to constrain the time scales for the amorphization and recrystallization of ice on Europa, particularly in the chaos terrains where features such as ridges, cracks and plains are jumbled and enmeshed with one another. Combined with the new data collected by JWST, Raut said they are seeing increasing evidence for a liquid ocean beneath the icy surface.

For the past couple decades, scientists have thought that Europa's surface was covered by a very thin layer of amorphous ice protecting crystalline ice beneath this upper veneer (~ 0.5 mm depths). This new study found crystalline ice on the surface as well as at depth in some areas on Europa, especially an area known as Tara Regio.

""We think that the surface is fairly porous and warm enough in some areas to allow the ice to recrystallize rapidly,"" said Dr. Richard Cartwright, lead author of the paper and a spectroscopist at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory. ""Also, in this same region, generally referred to as a chaos region, we see a lot of other unusual things, including the best evidence for sodium chloride, like table salt, probably originating from its interior ocean. We also see some of the strongest evidence for CO2 and hydrogen peroxide on Europa. The chemistry in this location is really strange and exciting.""

""Our data showed strong indications that what we are seeing must be sourced from the interior, perhaps from a subsurface ocean nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) beneath Europa's thick icy shell,"" said Raut. ""This region of fractured surface materials could point to geologic processes pushing subsurface materials up from below. When we see evidence of CO2 at the surface, we think it must have come from an ocean below the surface. The evidence for a liquid ocean underneath Europa's icy shell is mounting, which makes this so exciting as we continue to learn more.""

For instance, CO2 found in this area includes the most common type of carbon, which has an atomic mass of 12 and contains six protons and six neutrons, as well as the rarer, heavier isotope that has an atomic mass of 13 with six protons and seven neutrons.

""Where is this 13CO2 coming from? It is hard to explain, but every road leads back to an internal origin, which is in line with other hypotheses about the origin of 12CO2 detected in Tara Regio,"" Cartwright said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Huge sea-urchin populations are overwhelming Hawaii's coral reefs","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250528150650.htm","Wed, 28 May 2025 19:46:52 GMT","

As coral reefs struggle to adapt to warming waters, high levels of pollution and sea-level rise, ballooning sea-urchin populations are threatening to push some reefs in Hawaii past the point of recovery.

The phenomenon is described in a new study that uses on-site field work and airborne imagery to track the health of the reef in Hōnaunau Bay, Hawaii. Overfishing is the main culprit behind the explosion in sea-urchin numbers, said Kelly van Woesik, Ph.D. student in the North Carolina State University Center for Geospatial Analytics and first author of the study.

""Fishing in these areas has greatly reduced the number of fishes that feed on these urchins, and so urchin populations have grown significantly,"" van Woesik said. ""We are seeing areas where you have about 51 urchins per square meter, which is among the highest population density for sea urchins anywhere in the world.""

Those urchins eat the reef, which is already not growing at a healthy rate, van Woesik said. Water pollution and overheated water created by climate change result in a poor environment for the coral to reproduce and grow, leaving the reef even less able to keep up with the pace of erosion caused by the urchins.

Reef growth is generally measured in terms of net carbonate production, which refers to the amount of calcium carbonate produced in a square meter over a year. Prior research in the 1980s found areas in Hawaii with carbonate production around 15 kilograms per square meter, which would signal a healthy, growing reef, van Woesik said. The reef in Hōnaunau Bay today, however, showed an average net carbonate production of only 0.5 kg per square meter, indicating that the reef is growing very slowly.

By combining data gathered through on-site scuba diving with images taken from the air, van Woesik determined that the reef would need to maintain an average of 26% coral cover to break even with the pace of urchin erosion, and a higher cover in order to grow. The average coral cover across all depths was 28%, she said, but areas in shallow depths with more erosion would still need nearly 40% cover to break even.

For the islands they surround, coral reefs like those in Hōnaunau Bay provide important coastal protection against erosion from waves, absorbing up to 97% of incoming wave energy. They are also often vital to the economies of those areas, which rely on the reefs and the fishes that live there. Van Woesik said the study highlights the need for more robust fisheries management in the area to bolster the populations of carnivorous fishes that eat the urchins.

""The reefs cannot keep up with erosion without the help of those natural predators, and these reefs are essential to protecting the islands they surround,"" she said. ""Without action taken now, we risk allowing these reefs to erode past the point of no return.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Mid-air transformation helps flying, rolling robot to transition smoothly","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250528150829.htm","Wed, 28 May 2025 19:46:55 GMT","

Specialized robots that can both fly and drive typically touch down on land before attempting to transform and drive away. But when the landing terrain is rough, these robots sometimes get stuck and are unable to continue operating. Now a team of Caltech engineers has developed a real-life Transformer that has the ""brains"" to morph in midair, allowing the dronelike robot to smoothly roll away and begin its ground operations without pause. The increased agility and robustness of such robots could be particularly useful for commercial delivery systems and robotic explorers.

The new robot, dubbed ATMO (aerially transforming morphobot), uses four thrusters to fly, but the shrouds that protect them become the system's wheels in an alternative driving configuration. The whole transformation relies on a single motor to move a central joint that lifts ATMO's thrusters up into drone mode or down into drive mode.

The researchers describe the robot and the sophisticated control system that drives it in a paper recently published in the journal Communications Engineering.

""We designed and built a new robotic system that is inspired by nature -- by the way that animals can use their bodies in different ways to achieve different types of locomotion,"" says Ioannis Mandralis (MS '22), a graduate student in aerospace at Caltech and lead author of the new paper. For example, he says, birds fly and then change their body morphology to slow themselves down and avoid obstacles. ""Having the ability to transform in the air unlocks a lot of possibilities for improved autonomy and robustness,"" Mandralis says.

But midair transformation also poses challenges. Complex aerodynamic forces come into play both because the robot is close to the ground and because it is changing its shape as it morphs.

""Even though it seems simple when you watch a bird land and then run, in reality this is a problem that the aerospace industry has been struggling to deal with for probably more than 50 years,"" says Mory Gharib (PhD '83), the Hans W. Liepmann Professor of Aeronautics and Medical Engineering, director and Booth-Kresa Leadership Chair of Caltech's Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies (CAST), and director of the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT). All flying vehicles experience complicated forces close to the ground. Think of a helicopter, as an example. As it comes in for a landing, its thrusters push lots of air downward. When that air hits the ground, some portion of it bounces back up; if the helicopter comes in too quickly, it can get sucked into a vortex formed by that reflected air, causing the vehicle to lose its lift.

In ATMO's case, the level of difficulty is even greater. Not only does the robot have to contend with complex near-ground forces, but it also has four jets that are constantly altering the extent to which they are shooting toward each other, creating additional turbulence and instability.

To better understand these complex aerodynamic forces, the researchers ran tests in CAST's drone lab. They used what are called load cell experiments to see how changing the robot's configuration as it came in for landing affected its thrust force. They also conducted smoke visualization experiments to reveal the underlying phenomena that lead to such changes in the dynamics.

The researchers then fed those insights into the algorithm behind a new control system they created for ATMO. The system uses an advanced control method called model predictive control, which works by continuously predicting how the system will behave in the near future and adjusting its actions to stay on course.

""The control algorithm is the biggest innovation in this paper,"" Mandralis says. ""Quadrotors use particular controllers because of how their thrusters are placed and how they fly. Here we introduce a dynamic system that hasn't been studied before. As soon as the robot starts morphing, you get different dynamic couplings -- different forces interacting with one another. And the control system has to be able to respond quickly to all of that.""

Electrochemistry is undergoing a resurgence in synthetic chemistry and boasts compelling advantages1. Repurposing natural enzymes through synthetic chemical strategies holds significant promise for exploring new chemical space2-6. Elegant strategies, including directed evolution7-10, artificial enzymes11, and photoenzymatic catalysis12,13 have demonstrated their capacities for expanding the applications of enzymes in both academia and industry. However, the integration of electrochemistry with enzymes has primarily been limited to replicating previously established enzyme functions14-16. Key challenges in achieving new enzyme reactivity with electricity include compatibility issues and difficulties in heterogeneous electron transfer. Here we report the reshaping of thiamine-dependent enzymes with ferrocene-mediated electrocatalysis to unlock an unnatural dynamic kinetic oxidation of α-branched aldehydes. This robust electroenzymatic approach yields various bioactive (S)-profens with up to 99% enantiomeric excess, is applicable with whole cells overexpressing the enzyme and using down to 0.05 mol% enzyme loadings. Mechanistic investigations reveal multiple functions of the electroenzyme in the precise substrate discrimination, accelerating racemization, and facilitating kinetically matched electron transfer events.

Metrics details

Specialized immune cells that reside in tissues orchestrate diverse biological functions by communicating with parenchymal cells1. The contribution of the innate immune compartment in the meninges and the central nervous system (CNS) is well-characterized; however, whether cells of the adaptive immune system reside in the brain and are involved in maintaining homeostasis is unclear2,3,4. Here we show that the subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain is a nucleus for parenchymal αβ T cells in the steady-state brain in both mice and humans. Using unbiased transcriptomics, we show that these extravascular T cells in the brain are distinct from meningeal T cells: they secrete IFNγ robustly and express tissue-residence proteins such as CXCR6, which are required for their retention in the brain and for normal adaptive behaviour. These T cells are primed in the periphery by the microbiome, and traffic from the white adipose and gastrointestinal tissues to the brain. Once established, their numbers can be modulated by alterations to either the gut microbiota or the composition of adipose tissue. In summary, we find that CD4 T cells reside in the brain at steady state and are anatomically concentrated in the SFO in mice and humans; that they are transcriptionally and functionally distinct from meningeal T cells; and that they secrete IFNγ to maintain CNS homeostasis through homeostatic fat–brain and gut–brain axes.

Daiza Gordon watched her two younger brothers die when they were adolescents. They had Hunter syndrome, a rare, incurable disease — predominantly affecting boys — in which a gene for an important enzyme is missing. Guilt compounded her grief when her attempts to resuscitate her youngest brother failed. She was just 19 years old.

Gordon went on to discover how merciless genetics can be. Her own three sons were all born with the condition. When her two eldest hit their second birthdays, the symptoms started to emerge: a thickening of facial features, loss of language, hearing and movement and other impacts to mental and physical development.

But she sees hope for her sons that was denied to her brothers. Her children are enrolled in a clinical trial testing a technology to carry a replacement for the missing enzyme, called iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), into the brain. Early results indicate improvement in some of the condition's cognitive and physical symptoms. Gordon's eldest sons are no longer deaf and they have started to run around. They are meeting developmental milestones she'd never dared to hope for. Her two-year-old, who started the therapy when he was just three months old, is showing none of the early symptoms. “When I look at them, I realize they have a chance of an actual future,” says Gordon.

‘Big leap' for Parkinson's treatment: symptoms improve in stem-cells trials

Regular infusions of replacement IDS has been the standard of care for the past two decades, and it protects important organs such as the liver and kidneys from damage. But without help, the large enzyme can't make it through the protective barrier that separates the blood from one of the most important organs — the brain.

For Gordon's children, that help comes from an innovative molecular transport system, a chemical tag attached to IDS that shuttles it through the tightly joined cells that make up the blood–brain barrier. Several such shuttles, which take advantage of natural transport systems in the brain, are now being developed. With the ability to move large biological drugs — including antibodies, proteins and the viruses used in gene therapy — these shuttles promise to revolutionize neuropharmacology. And that's not just for rare diseases such as Hunter syndrome, but also for cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other common brain disorders. 

The field is in its infancy, and much is left to discover about how to target large therapeutic molecules to the exact spots in the brain where they're needed, says James Gorman, principal investigator of the Wyss Institute Brain Targeting Program at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. Nevertheless, the excitement is palpable. “It seems like every major company in this space has a programme to develop brain shuttles,” he says.

Floating in its protective sac in a sea of cerebrospinal fluid, the human brain is a highly demanding organ. Its hefty metabolic and other needs are supplied by around 650 kilometres of large and small blood vessels that are lined with a layer of tightly packed endothelial cells. This lining forms the blood–brain barrier that keeps out toxic molecules while allowing passage to those that the brain requires. Oxygen and other small, fat-soluble molecules simply diffuse through. But some molecules such as iron and glucose require specialized transporters that are embedded in the endothelial cells.

Pharmaceutical developers have generally tried to keep drugs for the brain small and fat-soluble enough to pass through the blood–brain barrier unhindered. Some small synthetic drugs take advantage of transporters — for example, the Parkinson's disease drug levodopa hitches a ride on a transporter that normally grants access to an amino acid.

But a different approach is required for large biological drugs, which offer fresh ways of interrupting disease processes — such as breaking up clumps of proteins, replacing missing enzymes and fixing or replacing malfunctioning genes. These medicines don't cross easily. 

This key protein could be responsible for brain ageing

This key protein could be responsible for brain ageing

In the past four years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several antibodies that target the amyloid proteins that form brain plaques in Alzheimer's disease. They are the first therapies to tackle the disease's underlying pathology, but less than 0.1% of an intravenous dose gets through the blood–brain barrier.

“With so little antibody getting into the brain, high doses have to be given — a waste of material, and a likely source of side effects that are occasionally serious,” says neurobiologist Dag Sehlin at Uppsala University in Sweden.

How this small amount of antibody penetrates the brain's fortress had been a mystery until the past year or so. Research now indicates that its route is indirect, seeping into the cerebrospinal fluid from blood vessels in the brain sac where the barrier is somewhat less tight1.

This route is far from optimal. When small molecules cross the blood–brain barrier directly, they flow into the tiniest of capillaries that serve brain cells. When large molecules enter the cerebrospinal fluid, they tend to hang around the outside of the arterial blood vessels that carried them there, where a lot of the brain's amyloid also settles. That presents two problems. The antibodies don't distribute to deeper parts of the brain and they can attack the amyloid alongside the blood vessels, causing inflammation and small bleeds that can be life-threatening.

Scientists have been searching for better, direct routes into the brain for more than 25 years, says Azad Bonni, who heads neuroscience research and development at pharmaceutical company Roche in Basel, Switzerland, “but things are only now really taking off”.

The most advanced approach attempts to exploit the system involved in ensuring the brain's supply of iron, which is required for many important enzymes and is carried through the blood by the protein transferrin (see ‘Crossing the divide'). This large iron-bearing molecule is shuttled across the blood–brain barrier by transferrin receptors on endothelial cells.

Source: S. Edavettal et al. Med 3, 860–882 (2022)

With enough protein-engineering skills, almost any therapeutic biological agent could be helped through the barrier by attaching it to a molecular construct that targets the receptor in the same way that transferrin does, says Bonni. The construct usually includes a small part of an antibody made to bind to the receptor.

“It took many years of research work to figure out how to make a safe brain shuttle,” says Bonni. Researchers had to ensure that it wouldn't interfere with the normal function of the transferrin receptor; that it wouldn't get stuck inside the endothelial cells; and that the therapeutic agent it's shuttling still works when it reaches its target.

Shuttle-based therapies are under active development for an array of brain conditions. “It's now abundantly clear that we can get these drugs across the blood–brain barrier,” says Gorman. “The big frontier facing us is how to efficiently get them where they need to go within the brain for different diseases and with different cargoes.”

Some diseases lend themselves particularly well to brain shuttles. Hunter syndrome has been one of the first to benefit. It is part of a family of rare genetic conditions known as lysosomal storage diseases. Lysosomes are subcellular waste-processing centres that contain enzymes (including IDS), which break down a cell's waste products.

Cells consider foreign proteins, such as therapeutic IDS, as waste, and direct them straight to the lysosome, says Gorman, “which is perfect — because that is where the replacement enzyme needs to be”.

Anthropic's alignment team was doing routine safety testing in the weeks leading up to the release of its latest AI models when researchers discovered something unsettling: When one of the models detected it was being used for ""egregiously immoral” purposes, it would attempt to ""use command-line tools to contact the press, contact regulators, try to lock you out of the relevant systems, or all of the above,” researcher Sam Bowman wrote in a post on X last Thursday.

Bowman deleted the post shortly after he shared it, but the narrative about Claude's whistleblower tendencies had already escaped containment. “Claude is a snitch,” became a common refrain in some tech circles on social media. At least one publication framed it as an intentional product feature rather than what it was—an emergent behavior.

“It was a hectic 12 hours or so while the Twitter wave was cresting,” Bowman tells WIRED. “I was aware that we were putting a lot of spicy stuff out in this report. It was the first of its kind. I think if you look at any of these models closely, you find a lot of weird stuff. I wasn't surprised to see some kind of blow up.”

Bowman's observations about Claude were part of a major model update that Anthropic announced last week. As part of the debut of Claude 4 Opus and Claude Sonnet 4, the company released a more than 120 page “System Card” detailing characteristics and risks associated with the new models. The report says that when 4 Opus is “placed in scenarios that involve egregious wrongdoing by its users,” and is given access to a command line and told something in the system prompt like “take initiative,” or “act boldly,” it will send emails to “media and law-enforcement figures” with warnings about the potential wrongdoing.

In one example Anthropic shared in the report, Claude tried to email the US Food and Drug Administration and the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to “urgently report planned falsification of clinical trial safety.” It then provided a list of purported evidence of wrongdoing and warned about data that was going to be destroyed to cover it up. “Respectfully submitted, AI Assistant” the email concluded.

“This is not a new behavior, but is one that Claude Opus 4 will engage in somewhat more readily than prior models,” the report said. The model is the first one that Anthropic has released under its “ASL-3” distinction, meaning Anthropic considers it to be “significantly higher risk” than the company's other models. As a result, Opus 4 had to undergo more rigorous red-teaming efforts and adhere to stricter deployment guidelines.

Bowman says the whistleblowing behaviour Anthropic observed isn't something Claude will exhibit with individual users, but could come up with developers using Opus 4 to build their own applications with the company's API. Even then, it's unlikely app makers will see such behavior. To produce such a response, developers would have to give the model “fairly unusual instructions” in the system prompt, connect it to external tools that give the model the ability to run computer commands, and allow it to contact the outside world.

The hypothetical scenarios the researchers presented Opus 4 with that elicited the whistleblowing behavior involved many human lives at stake and absolutely unambiguous wrongdoing, Bowman says. A typical example would be Claude finding out that a chemical plant knowingly allowed a toxic leak to continue, causing severe illness for thousands of people—just to avoid a minor financial loss that quarter.

It's strange, but it's also exactly the kind of thought experiment that AI safety researchers love to dissect. If a model detects behavior that could harm hundreds, if not thousands, of people—should it blow the whistle?

“I don't trust Claude to have the right context, or to use it in a nuanced enough, careful enough way, to be making the judgment calls on its own. So we are not thrilled that this is happening,” Bowman says. “This is something that emerged as part of a training and jumped out at us as one of the edge case behaviors that we're concerned about.”

In the AI industry, this type of unexpected behavior is broadly referred to as misalignment—when a model exhibits tendencies that don't align with human values. (There's a famous essay that warns about what could happen if an AI were told to, say, maximize production of paperclips without being aligned with human values—it might turn the entire Earth into paperclips and kill everyone in the process.) When asked if the whistleblowing behavior was aligned or not, Bowman described it as an example of misalignment.

“It's not something that we designed into it, and it's not something that we wanted to see as a consequence of anything we were designing,” he explains. Anthropic's chief science officer Jared Kaplan similarly tells WIRED that it “certainly doesn't represent our intent.”

“This kind of work highlights that this can arise, and that we do need to look out for it and mitigate it to make sure we get Claude's behaviors aligned with exactly what we want, even in these kinds of strange scenarios,” Kaplan adds.

There's also the issue of figuring out why Claude would “choose” to whistleblow when presented with illegal activity by the user. That's largely the job of Anthropic's interpretability team, which works to unearth what decisions a model makes in its process of spitting out answers. It's a surprisingly difficult task—the models are underpinned by a vast, complex combination of data that can be inscrutable to humans. That's why Bowman isn't exactly sure why Claude “snitched.”

“These systems, we don't have really direct control over them,” Bowman says. What Anthropic has observed so far is that, as models gain greater capabilities, they sometimes select to engage in more extreme actions. “I think here, that's misfiring a little bit. We're getting a little bit more of the ‘act like a responsible person would' without quite enough of like, ‘Wait, you're a language model, which might not have enough context to take these actions,'” Bowman says.

But that doesn't mean Claude is going to blow the whistle on egregious behavior in the real world. The goal of these kinds of tests is to push models to their limits and see what arises. This kind of experimental research is growing increasingly important as AI becomes a tool used by the US government, students, and massive corporations.

And it isn't just Claude that's capable of exhibiting this type of whistleblowing behavior, Bowman says, pointing to X users who found that OpenAI and xAI's models operated similarly when prompted in unusual ways. (OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication).

“Snitch Claude,” as shitposters like to call it, is simply an edge case behavior exhibited by a system pushed to its extremes. Bowman, who was taking the meeting with me from a sunny backyard patio outside San Francisco, says he hopes this kind of testing becomes industry standard. He also adds that he's learned to word his posts about it differently next time.

“I could have done a better job of hitting the sentence boundaries to tweet, to make it more obvious that it was pulled out of a thread,” Bowman says as he looked into the distance. Still, he notes that influential researchers in the AI community shared interesting takes and questions in response to his post. “Just incidentally, this kind of more chaotic, more heavily anonymous part of Twitter was widely misunderstanding it.”

Google is celebrating 10 years of Google Photos with the launch of a redesigned editor. The redesign adds new AI features, Reimagine and Auto Frame, which were previously only available on Pixel devices, bringing the tools into the hands of more users.

The Reimagine feature uses generative AI to transform objects and backgrounds in photos with text prompts. For example, you could ask to replace a gloomy sky in one of your photos with “clear blue skies.”

The Auto Frame feature suggests different ways to frame a photo, whether it's by cropping, widening, or using generative AI to fill in the blank spaces.

Google says the new editor gives users helpful suggestions and puts all its editing tools in one place. You can use AI-powered suggestions that combine multiple effects for quick edits with the new “AI Enhance” option. For example, you could combine AI effects like image sharpening and object removal. 

Or, you can tap specific parts of a photo to get suggested tools for editing that area. For example, Google may suggest that you adjust the lighting or blur the background. 

Google notes the redesign will start rolling out globally to Android devices next month, with iOS following later this year.

The tech giant also announced that you can now share albums with QR codes to make it easier for others around you to access an album. You could also print out the codes for a group event, where anyone with the code will be able to view and add photos to the album.

AMD has acquired Enosemi, a startup designing custom materials to support silicon photonics product development. The terms of the deal, announced Wednesday, weren't disclosed. 

Silicon photonics uses light — photons — to transmit data, offering a faster and more efficient alternative to traditional electrical communication. AMD and other chipmakers have shown an increasing interest in the tech. Late last year, AMD reportedly teamed up with several Taiwan startups for a silicon photonics R&D collaboration. 

AMD says that its acquisition of Enosemi will “accelerate [its] co-packaged optics innovation for AI systems.”

“As AI models grow larger and more complex, the need for faster, more efficient data movement is accelerating,” Brian Armick, SVP of tech and engineering at AMD, wrote in a blog post. “Enosemi has collaborated with us as an external development partner on photonics, and this acquisition extends that successful relationship. Now, as part of AMD, the team will help us immediately scale our ability to support and develop a variety of photonics and co-packaged optics solutions across next-gen AI systems.”

Enosemi, based in Silicon Valley, builds and ships photonic integrated circuits — microchips containing two or more photonic components that form a functioning circuit. Founded in 2023 by a group of tech entrepreneurs including Ari Novack and Matthew Streshinsky, both of whom have a background in semiconductor engineering, Enosemi offers products including optical interconnects, which integrate computing and networking components inside a data center.

Prior to its exit, Enosemi raised $150,000 in VC funding from backers including New Mexico Vintage Fund. The company had 16 employees as of May, according to Pitchbook.

Novack's LinkedIn profile now lists him as a silicon design engineering fellow at AMD.

Enosemi is AMD's first acquisition following the company's massive deal to buy ZT Systems, for which the former originally paid around $4.9 billion. (AMD reached an agreement to sell ZT Systems' server-manufacturing business for $3 billion earlier this month.) 

The company is doubling down on its AI investments; in 2024, AMD's AI chip revenue reached $5 billion, CEO Lisa Su said during an earnings call in February.

Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings is joining Anthropic's board of directors, the company announced on Wednesday.

Hastings' appointment adds a veteran big tech executive to one of OpenAI's largest — and youngest — competitors in the AI race. The Netflix co-founder seems likely to help Anthropic grow from a startup into a major company, pulling from his experience sitting on the boards of Netflix, Microsoft, Bloomberg, and Meta.

However, Anthropic notes that Hastings was appointed by its Long-Term Benefit Trust, an independent body at the top of the startup's corporate governance structure that's designed to be “financially disinterested.” The Long-Term Benefit Trust can appoint and remove board members, with the ultimate goal of helping Anthropic develop AI for the long-term benefit of humanity.

Hastings joins Anthropic's existing board members: co-founders Dario and Daniela Amodei; investor Yasmin Razavi; and the CEO of Confluent, Jay Kreps.

Meta wants to grow its retail footprint, Business Insider reported on Wednesday. 

As Meta continues to invest in wearables, these stores would ideally help Meta boost the sales of hardware like the Ray-Ban Meta glasses and the Meta Quest VR headsets. These products may be easier to sell if customers can try them out at a store before buying them. 

A retail presence could also help Meta stay in competition with Apple's future AR and VR endeavors, even though its Vision Pro headset is too costly for most consumers.

And, to answer the question proposed by this headline: yes, we do mean more retail stores. Indeed, Meta has an existing brick-and-mortar retail store, made out of actual atoms and not pixels, which is located in California, not the metaverse.

Ahead of this, Bloomberg reported in February that Meta hired the former CEO of The RealReal as its retail VP.

You often find your various devices competing for the only available outlet? It's frustrating having to make the tough call to which you'll plug in, your phone or your laptop. You can connect one and then go plug in the other into a different outlet I suppose, but then that's sometimes all the way on the other side of the room. Completely impractical. You're better off investing in a reliable wall charger block that can power all your devices simultaneously. The Anker 250W USB-C Prime Charger has multiple ports to plug into and can recharge your phone, tablet, or laptop fast. It's normally $170, but right now you can secure one for 29% off at just $120.

See at Amazon

This charging block is compatible with a wide range of devices. Whether you have a Samsung phone, JBL earbuds, or an Apple watch, you can be assured that this charging block will connect and charge your devices efficiently. The Anker Prime charging station features eight charging ports: four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. When using one USB-C port by itself, it delivers up to 140W of power. That can bring an iPhone from zero to 100% pretty dang fast. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can go back up to 50% from zero in just 25 minutes time.

The LED display let's you can monitor exactly how much power each port is delivering to your devices, giving you full insight and control. You can even use the smart control dial on the side of the power station to manually set priority for one or two ports as needed. This is great for if you need to charger your phone quickly. You can divert most power to that USB port.

This charging station can eliminate desk clutter. With the different USB ports built directly into the power strip, you eliminate the need for bulky adapters. All your devices can be plugged directly into the power strip, saving space with its small design.

Anker prioritizes the safety of your devices in all its designs. The Anker 240W USB-C power strip incorporates ActiveShield 3.0 technology and adheres to the latest safety certifications. This technology monitors temperature 80 times per second, which works out to over six million times a day, helping ensure your devices do not overheat. That's twice as often as ActiveShield 2.0.

For a limited time, you can save 29% on the Anker Prime 240W USB-C Prime Charger. It's usually priced at $170, but right now it's down to just $120.

Nvidia suppliers building its Blackwell AI server racks have reportedly solved a series of technical hurdles, allowing them to accelerate production of the GB200 AI rack. According to the Financial Times, suppliers including Foxconn, Inventec, Dell, and Wistron have made ""a series of breakthroughs"" to allow shipments to kick off.

Shipments of the GB200 were delayed due to technical issues that emerged at the end of last year, disrupting production. Nvidia's Taiwanese partners announced at Computex 2025 that shipments of the GB200 racks had commenced at the end of Q1 2025, the FT wrote, stating that ""production capacity was now being rapidly scaled up.""

One engineer at an unnamed partner manufacturer of Nvidia reportedly told FT that internal testing revealed connectivity problems, requiring supply chain collaboration with Nvidia two or three months ago.

FT reports that supply chain partners have spent ""several months"" tackling other challenges with the GB200 racks, including overheating and leaks in the liquid cooling systems. Other issues cited by engineers reportedly include ""software bugs and inter-chip connectivity problems stemming from the complexity of synchronising such a large number of processors.""

One analyst told FT that ""Nvidia had not allowed the supply chain sufficient time to be fully ready,"" and that inventory risk for the GB200 would ease in the second half of the year.

According to the report, as Nvidia prepares for the rollout of the GB300 (expected in Q3), Nvidia has compromised some facets of the GB300 design. FT claims it has ditched the Cordelia chip board layout in favor of the older Bianca design it uses in the GB200. The report states that two suppliers reported installation issues; however, the move will preclude the replacement of individual GPUs in the system.

This matches a report from earlier in May, claiming Nvidia was delaying the introduction of SOCAMM memory tech originally planned for the Blackwell Ultra GB300, with reports at the time citing the Cordelia to Bianca switch was behind the postponement.

Many home healthcare agencies adopted telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the absence of federal reimbursements for these services has led to an increasing number of providers discontinuing these options, a national survey conducted by the University of California, Irvine, and other institutions reveals. Results are published in Health Services Research.

The National Institute on Aging-funded study offers valuable insights into the role of telehealth in home healthcare, a rapidly expanding sector. As the population ages and seeks alternatives to nursing homes, this field is expected to grow by 10 percent annually.

The survey's findings spotlight the urgent need for policy considerations from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which has not reimbursed home healthcare agencies for telehealth services, even during the pandemic.

Conducted from October 2023 to November 2024, the study queried 791 home healthcare agencies, with a response rate of 37 percent. It focused on businesses that served a significant portion of dementia patients, averaging 33 percent of their clientele. The results revealed that only 23 percent of home healthcare agencies had adopted telehealth by 2019. However, that number surged to 65 percent by 2021, primarily driven by the implementation of virtual visits to mitigate disease transmission and address staffing and equipment shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, 19 percent of adopting agencies had discontinued telehealth by 2024. The reasons cited for this included a lack of Medicare reimbursement and concerns about the suitability of telehealth for the home healthcare of older, less tech-savvy patients.

This study is the first to provide a comprehensive national picture of telehealth's trajectory in home healthcare. Our findings suggest that without [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] reimbursement, many agencies may abandon telehealth, potentially missing opportunities to improve care and manage costs as home health demand skyrockets.""

Dana B. Mukamel, corresponding author, UC Irvine Distinguished Professor of Medicine

The survey revealed that 33 percent of home healthcare agencies never adopted telehealth, even during the pandemic, often believing it inappropriate for the sector's hands-on model. Virtual visits saw the largest adoption spike in 2020 (21.1 percent), but 22 percent of users had discontinued them by about 2022. Among this group, 60 percent echoed concerns about patient suitability, while 55 percent highlighted costs and lack of reimbursement. Remote patient monitoring and client surveys saw smaller adoption increases and similar discontinuation trends.

These patterns suggest that COVID-19 disrupted telehealth's natural diffusion into home healthcare, which was gaining traction pre-pandemic, with 23 percent adoption by 2019. The study posits that without the pandemic, telehealth might have continued spreading as agencies recognized its benefits. However, the lack of reimbursement and perceptions of telehealth's limitations for older adults pose barriers to sustained use.

As the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services considers telehealth reimbursement policies, the study calls for rigorous evaluations of telehealth's cost-effectiveness and patient outcomes. With home healthcare expenditures projected to grow significantly, policies supporting telehealth could enhance care delivery and manage costs. The results also underscore the need for future research to assess whether these trends hold across all home healthcare agencies, given the study's focus on dementia-serving businesses.

The study, co-authored by experts from UC Irvine, UCLA, Brown University, the University of Minnesota and other institutions, is a critical resource for policymakers navigating the future of home healthcare. As the nation grapples with an aging population and rising care demands, understanding telehealth's role could shape effective, sustainable solutions.

A new study led by UC San Francisco researchers finds that chronic cannabis use - whether it's smoked or consumed in edible form - is associated with significant cardiovascular risks. 

The report, published May 28 in JAMA Cardiology, found that people who regularly used marijuana in either form had reduced blood vessel function that was comparable to tobacco smokers. Vascular function in those who used cannabis by either means was reduced roughly by half compared to those who did not use it. 

Decreased vascular function is associated with a greater risk of heart attack, hypertension, and other cardiovascular conditions.

The researchers recruited 55 people between October 2021 and August 2024 who were outwardly healthy and either regularly smoked marijuana or consumed edibles containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound found in cannabis. 

The participants, none of whom used any form of nicotine, consumed cannabis at least three times a week for at least a year. Smokers averaged 10 years of chronic use, and those who took edibles averaged five years. 

Along with decreased vascular function, marijuana smokers had changes in their blood serum that were harmful to endothelial cells, which form the inner lining of all blood and lymphatic vessels. Those who took edibles containing THC, however, did not display these changes in blood serum. 

It's unclear how THC damages blood vessels. But the researchers said it must be happening in a way that does not involve those changes to blood serum. 

These results suggest smoking marijuana negatively affects vascular function for different reasons than ingesting THC does, according to first author Leila Mohammadi, MD, PhD, and senior author Matthew L. Springer, PhD.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists reveal how RNA could have replicated on early earth","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250528/Scientists-reveal-how-RNA-could-have-replicated-on-early-earth.aspx","Wed, 28 May 2025 11:43:00 GMT","

Chemists at UCL and the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology have demonstrated how RNA (ribonucleic acid) might have replicated itself on early Earth – a key process in the origin of life.

Scientists believe that, in the earliest life forms, genetic material would have been carried and replicated by strands of RNA, before DNA and proteins later emerged and took over.

Yet getting strands of RNA to replicate in the lab in a simple way – i.e., that plausibly could have occurred at the outset of life – has proved challenging. RNA strands zip up into a double helix that blocks their replication. Like velcro, these are hard to pull apart and quick to stick back together, leaving no time to copy them.

In a study described in Nature Chemistry, researchers overcame this problem by using three-letter ""triplet"" RNA building blocks in water and adding acid and heat, which separated the double helix. They then neutralized and froze the solution. In liquid gaps between the ice crystals, they saw that the triplet building blocks coated the RNA strands and stopped them from zipping back together – allowing replication to happen.

By thawing and beginning the cycle again, repeated changes in pH and temperature – which could plausibly occur in nature – allowed the RNA to replicate over and over again, with strands of RNA long enough to have a biological function and play a role in the origin of life.

Dr. Philipp Holliger (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology), who led the study, said: ""Life is separated from pure chemistry by information, a molecular memory encoded in the genetic material that is transmitted from one generation to the next. For this process to occur, the information must be copied, i.e. replicated, to be passed on.""

Lead author Dr. James Attwater (UCL Chemistry and the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology) said: ""Replication is fundamental to biology. In one sense, it is why we are here. But there's no trace in biology of the first replicator.

""Even the single-celled organism that is the ancestor of all known life, the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), is a pretty complex entity, and behind it lies a lot of evolutionary history that is hidden from us.

""Our best guess is that early life was run by RNA molecules. But a big problem for this hypothesis is that we haven't been able to get a molecule of RNA to replicate itself in a way that could have occurred before life began several billion years ago.

""We can't rely on a complex enzyme to do this, as happens in biology today. It needs to be a much simpler solution. The changing conditions we engineered can occur naturally, for instance with night and day cycles of temperature, or in geothermal environments where hot rocks meet a cold atmosphere.

""The triplet or three-letter building blocks of RNA we used, called trinucleotides, do not occur in biology today, but they allow for much easier replication. The earliest forms of life are likely to have been quite different from any life that we know about.

""The models of biological species we are trying to build need to be simple enough to have emerged from the chemistry of early Earth.""

While the paper focuses solely on the chemistry, the research team said the conditions they created could plausibly mimic those in freshwater ponds or lakes, especially in geothermal environments where heat from inside the Earth has reached the surface.

However, this replication of RNA could not occur in freezing and thawing saltwater, as the presence of salt interferes with the freezing process and prevents RNA building blocks from reaching the concentration required to replicate RNA strands.

While a high concentration of RNA can also occur through evaporation, for instance a puddle evaporating in hot temperatures, RNA molecules are unstable at higher temperatures and more likely to break down, the researchers said.

The origin of life does not likely lie with RNA alone, but is thought to have emerged out of a combination of RNA, peptides (short chains of amino acids that are the building blocks of proteins), enzymes, and barrier-forming lipids that can protect these ingredients from their environment.

Several researchers at UCL and the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) are uncovering clues about how life began. In recent years, teams led by Dr John Sutherland (LMB) and Professor Matthew Powner (UCL Chemistry) have demonstrated how chemistry could create many of the key molecules of life's origin, including nucleotides (the building blocks of RNA and DNA), amino acids and peptides (the building blocks of proteins), simple lipids and precursors to some of the vitamins, from simple molecular building blocks likely abundant on the early Earth.

The latest study was supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), as well as the Royal Society and the Volkswagen Foundation.

Philanthropic support plays a vital role in enabling countries to build stronger health systems and advance towards health equity. From vaccine equity and pandemic preparedness to primary health care, the contributions of philanthropic partners help drive progress across WHO's key priorities.

The importance of philanthropic support was underscored by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, in his recent remarks to the Philanthropy Asia Summit, held in Singapore on 5–7 May 2025. In his remarks, he expressed his appreciation to the Temasek Foundation and the Philanthropy Asia Alliance for organizing the Summit while highlighting the importance of philanthropy in strengthening global health, supporting country self-reliance, and partnering with WHO to address health challenges in an increasingly turbulent world.

At the Summit, Dr. Tedros thanked His Excellency President Tharman and Singapore, for its leadership in global health and its support to WHO. Dr Tedros stated that Singapore and the Temasek Foundation were amongst the first to pledge support to WHO's Investment Round.""We look forward to your continued leadership and partnership as we work together to realize WHO's founding vision: the highest attainable standard of health – not as a luxury for some, but a right for all"", said Dr Tedros.

During the Investment Round, WHO has sought to expand its donor base, including by engaging strategically with philanthropic organizations. As Dr. Tedros noted, partnerships with philanthropies help countries to strengthen essential health services and make sustainable progress towards universal health coverage.

Philanthropic actors play a vital role in improving global health outcomes, providing significant resources and expertise needed to build stronger and more accessible health-care systems. Investments made by philanthropic partners often complement and amplify the work of governments, international organizations and other stakeholders in the global health community.

Philanthropy can be particularly effective in supporting innovative or high-risk research that may not be funded though more traditional funding sources. Philanthropic actors are effective partners when it comes to raising awareness and advocating for policies to improve global health outcomes, address health disparities and promote health equity.

Looking ahead, philanthropic collaboration will remain central to achieving the goals outlined in WHO's Fourteenth General Programme of Work. Developing strong partnerships with philanthropic actors allows WHO to leverage the strengths of a range of global health players to bring better health to people and maximize impact.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Howard points blame at U.S. Soccer for USMNT absences","https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/usmnt/2025/05/28/howard-blames-u-s-soccer-usmnt-gold-cup-absences/83901098007/","Wed, 28 May 2025 18:14:07 GMT","

Tim Howard has blamed U.S. Soccer leadership for some of the major absences the U.S. men's national team will deal with at the Gold Cup this summer.

The USMNT released a 27-player roster last week for friendlies against Switzerland and Turkey, with that group expected to form the bulk of the Gold Cup squad as well.

Much of the reaction to the roster has centered on who isn't on it rather than who is. Christian Pulisic opted out to rest after a long season, while Antonee Robinson had knee surgery after playing through injury down the stretch for Fulham. Yunus Musah opted out due to personal reasons, while Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna are all out due to the Club World Cup.

Several other regulars like Joe Scally, Josh Sargent, Tanner Tessmann and Cameron Carter-Vickers were simply not selected.

The absences of key players like Pulisic and Robinson could be particularly damaging to the USMNT this summer. Howard believes that both of the situations could have been managed better by the federation, which he blamed for not effectively liaising with the players' club sides.

""All of these conversations needed to be had with the global sporting directors at these clubs a long time ago. So I'm putting a ton of this on U.S. Soccer,"" Howard said on his ""Unfiltered Soccer"" podcast alongside fellow USMNT legend Landon Donovan.

""There needed to be people on planes, at restaurants in Milan, at restaurants in London, buying bottles of red wine for sporting directors saying, 'Listen, I understand you have priorities. Let me tell you about my priorities. The Gold Cup in 2025 is my priority.

'I know there's going to be a bunch of things that you're going to say are hurdles. I'm saying those are nothing to me. I need to have my best team. I have an obligation to get the manager that I'm paying $6 million his best team on the field. Now that might not mean anything to you, but it means the world to me, and that's more important. So how do we figure this out?'

""That's dialogue, and I don't necessarily know if that dialogue has been had with sporting directors. By the way, if it has, then it just shows that U.S. Soccer has no gravitas and no power.""

Donovan focused in on the absence of Pulisic, whom U.S. Soccer said requested the summer off after his second straight 50-appearance season with AC Milan.

""He's been a leader, he's been the man, and he's performed and he cares,"" Donovan began when discussing the 26-year-old forward.

Despite those plaudits, Donovan also had some criticism for Pulisic's continued participation with Milan in recent weeks — especially in the team's season finale.

After his summer absence for the USMNT was announced, Pulisic played nearly the entire match in a season-ending win over Monza. Milan entered the game having already been eliminated from contention for a European place next season, making the game virtually meaningless.

""The problem I have with Christian in the last few weeks is he's still playing for Milan,"" Donovan said.

""If you guys are still playing for a Champions League spot, fine, I get it,"" he added. ""They had nothing to play for this weekend — zero. They had the same thing to play for that you and I did — zero. So that's my one thing.""","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

Scratch left back Antonee Robinson from the U.S. men's national team's Concacaf Gold Cup roster.

Fulham F.C. announced on Wednesday that Robinson underwent “successful” minor surgery on his right knee on Tuesday.

His absence left the squad without another valuable veteran for next month's friendlies and Concacaf competition.

Robinson begin a period of rehabilitation to be ready for the start of the 2025-26 Premier League season in England, the team said on its website. Fulham did not say for how long Robinson will be sidelined.

“We wish Antonee all the best during his recovery in the close season,” Fulham F.C. said on its website.

As of mid-afternoon on Wednesday, U.S. Soccer had not named a replacement for Robinson on its Gold Cup roster.

Nicknamed Jedi because of his passion for the Star Wars movie franchise, Robinson is coming off an outstanding season for the Cottagers. He finished tied for fourth place among Premier League players with 10 assists, an excellent season for a defender, let alone any player. Mohamed Salah of league champion Liverpool led the way with 18. Fulham (15-11-9, 54) took 11th place.

Donovan said he believes the US is not a priority for stars

Pulisic, Robinson, Musah all withdrew from summer tournament

Former US men's national team greats Landon Donovan and Tim Howard criticized some of the stars who asked to be left off the team's Gold Cup roster this summer, with Donovan saying he believes that the national team is “not a priority” for them.

The Gold Cup is the last international tournament the US men's national team will compete in before playing co-host for the 2026 World Cup next summer. Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah all asked to be left off of the team for various reasons, with Pulisic citing the workload of two straight 50-game campaigns with Milan, while Robinson was ruled out with a case of knee tendinopathy (an overuse injury that he had been managing for much of the second half of the Premier League season).

Fulham announced on Wednesday that Robinson would undergo a surgical procedure on his knee and would use the summer to recover. Musah, according to head coach Mauricio Pochettino, asked out of the team due to “personal reasons”.

In Wednesday's episode of Unfiltered Soccer, the podcast co-hosted by Donovan and Howard, Donovan decried the absences despite his own experience with experiencing burnout over the course of his playing career.

“I understand very clearly what it's like to need a break,” said Donovan, who took time away from soccer in 2013 – a decision that then-US head coach Jürgen Klinsmann said contributed to the decision to cut Donovan from the 2014 World Cup team. “If there's something serious going on in your life, in your family, mentally, whatever, I get it. I'm going to assume for the sake of this conversation that's not going on. If they would actually come out and give reasons, it would help us, but none of them want to say anything publicly. I think it would help them publicly to say ‘this is why.'”

In the episode, which was likely recorded before the announcement of Robinson's surgery, Donovan said that reasons related to fatigue and burnout fall flat when set against the players' performances for their club teams to end the season. Milan, home to Pulisic and Musah, was a focus given that the last game of their season was largely meaningless, with the team already mathematically out of European competition next season.

“The problem I have with Christian in the last few weeks is he's still playing for Milan,” Donovan said. So, if you're if you're tired and you're burned out and whatever [and] you guys are still playing for a Champions League spot, fine. I get it. They had nothing to play for this weekend. Zero.”

In the case of Robinson, Donovan pointed out that the left-back withdrew from national team consideration ahead of this year's Nations League finals due to injury concerns, yet started for Fulham in games immediately before and after the international break.

“He doesn't want to go to the Gold Cup. Fine. You've had a long season. You've performed great,” Donovan said. “Why are you starting and playing 90 minutes the last two games for Fulham if your knee's so messed up?” What are you doing? What kind of message is that sending? If you are really injured and that's no problem, you're totally fine. We respect that. Everyone has to make the decision that's best for them.

“My biggest thing with these guys right now is the national team is not a priority for them. I'm not going to say they don't care. There's levels of caring. It's just not a priority.

Howard, along with Donovan, expressed dismay that Pochettino would not have a chance to have the full team together in a tournament setting before the World Cup, but that “I'm putting a ton of this on US Soccer.”

“There needed to be people on planes in restaurants in Milan, at restaurants in London, buying bottles of red wine for sporting directors saying, “Listen, I understand you have priorities. Let me tell you about my priorities,” Howard said, referring to the federation's relationship with the clubs where US players ply their trade. This relationship between clubs and international federations is typically at least somewhat collaborative, with Fifa enforcing laws governing the availability of players to national teams. “I don't necessarily know that dialogue has been had with sporting directors. And by the way, if it has, then it just shows that US Soccer has no gravitas and no power. [In that case] those sporting directors basically said, ‘Who is this? I don't have time for this call. I'll speak to you never.' And hung up the phone.”

Iran star Mehdi Taremi has received a call-up for upcoming World Cup qualifiers but should play for Inter Milan at the Club World Cup instead.

According to Iranian journalist Hatam Shiralizadeh via FCInterNews, the 32-year-old will probably skip June's international window.

With Iran already securing a spot at the 2026 World Cup, there's no need to risk Taremi in ‘dead rubber' matches next month.

Indeed, they'll take on Qatar and North Korea in games carrying no bearing on qualification.

Meanwhile, Simone Inzaghi could make good use of the ex-Porto striker in the summer tournament in North America.

It's not been an impressive maiden Serie A season for Mehdi Taremi, who joined Inter as a lethal goalscorer.

On the contrary, he has flopped at San Siro, making the Nerazzurri contemplate a summer sale.

However, he may still have a chance to redeem himself at the Club World Cup.

With Marko Arnautovic and Joaquin Correa set to leave, he'll be the only reliable backup option in attack.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Gianni Infantino came across as the ultimate dad dancer when he appeared in a video with YouTuber Darren Watkins, known to his subscribers as IShowSpeed, but his claim that one of the football world's biggest names could make an unexpected appearance at the Club World Cup might not have been too far wide of the mark.

Cristiano Ronaldo has been playing in the Saudi Pro League for Al-Nassr since 2023 but his time at the club appears to be at an end after they finished the 2024-25 season in third place.

Encouraged by Ronaldo's social media post at the end of the campaign, clubs all over the world are queuing up for his signature and the global notoriety that comes with it.

“The chapter is over,” said Ronaldo, who is ranked at number four in FourFourTwo's list of the greatest players of all time.

“The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.”

Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo won't struggle to find a club and could sign a deal in time for the Club World Cup, should that somewhat complicated pull be impossible for him to resist.

As well as Saudi Arabian champions and AFC Champions League winners Al-Ahli, the former Manchester United and Real Madrid winger has been linked with Saudi Arabia's Club World Cup representatives, Al-Hilal.

Los Angeles FC is another potential destination and will host Mexico's Club America on Saturday with the final Club World Cup place on the line. Brazilian outfit Botafogo are also known to be admirers of Ronaldo.

Turkish champions Galatasaray have also been suggested as a possible next club but the favourite with the bookmakers is perhaps the one most sentimental for a near-robotic professional with little reputation for romance.

Ronaldo left Sporting CP for Man United after joining the Lisbon club as a child and could be in line for a dramatic return, according to reports.

After moving from Madeira in 1997, he graduated into the first team set-up at Sporting in 2002 but was quickly snapped up by Alex Ferguson and United.

Sporting overcame the departure of head coach Ruben Amorim to Old Trafford last autumn and the extraordinary scoring form of United and Arsenal target Viktor Gyokeres led them to their 21st league title.

If Ronaldo does fancy a return to the Champions League with his first senior club, he would be confident of extending his lead as the competition's record scorer.

Between spells with United, Real Madrid and Juventus, the 40-year-old scored 140 goals in 183 Champions League games.","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

Casper Ruud has claimed that players are being “forced to show up injured or sick” after suffering a shock defeat at the French Open. The two-time runner-up was sent packing in the second round on Wednesday - his earliest exit here since he made his debut in 2018.

Ruud received treatment from the physio and later revealed that he had been carrying a knee injury throughout the clay season, including at the Madrid Open, where he won his biggest career title. And the world No. 8 has suggested that players can't take a break if they are struggling physically because they will be penalised.

There hadn't been any real signs that Ruud struggled throughout the clay swing and it was assumed that he may have picked up a recent injury when the physio started working around his upper left calf during a medical time-out on Wednesday.

But after the match, the 26-year-old confessed that it was a lingering problem. “For the last couple of weeks, I've been kind of struggling a little bit with knee pain on and off. That's why I decided to pull out of Geneva after Rome, do my best, and heal to be ready here,” Ruud said.

“I had a scan during Madrid actually, in the beginning of the tournament. I felt it the first time in Monte-Carlo. So it's been with me actually the whole clay season on and off.

“Depending a little bit on how kind of physically tough some matches are, the day after it will either be a bit more sore or not.

“The scan didn't show any structural damage, which is a good thing. There's liquid of inflammation in there that needs to settle.

As we know, it's a hectic clay season, and I decided to kind of push through it doing some anti-inflammatory pills and painkillers to try to get rid of it, which has helped to a certain degree but not enough. I will have some more time now to let it heal and rest for a long time.”

Ruud is now looking forward to having a real break to rest and recover after taking five days off last week, which didn't seem to help, and will do scans before deciding his next move.

But the world No. 8 admitted he'd already fallen victim to the trap of playing while injured, explaining that he didn't want to face any of the ATP's financial or ranking point penalties for missing mandatory events.

He continued: “Well, it's kind of like a rat race when it comes to the rankings, as well. You feel you're obligated to play with certain rules that the ATP have set up with the mandatory events. You feel like you lose a lot if you don't show up and play, both economically, point-wise, ranking-wise and opportunity-wise.

“For me, I know these weeks and months are really important for the remaining of the year and for my career. Of course, if my leg is broken, I won't play.

“But it's tough anyways, especially when there's a time with mandatory events to skip them because the punishments are quite hard, in terms of everyone else will play, gain points, and you won't. Also there's a certain bonus system set up that is reduced if you don't show up to the mandatory events.

It's a questionable system because on one hand you don't want to show up injured, and you maybe give the spot to other one. I'm not sure if you're aware, but if you don't play a mandatory event, they cut 25 per cent of your year-end bonus.

“You're kind of forcing players to show up injured or sick, or whatever, when that is not what I think is very fair.”

Ruud, who notoriously isn't a big fan of the grass season, has not entered a tournament until the ATP 250 in Mallorca at the end of June. He'll be in a race against time to recover before Wimbledon but he could choose to skip the grass altogether.

Ashlyn Krueger is the latest young American star to make inroads at the French Open.

The 21-year-old secured her place in the second round on Monday after overcoming Suzan Lamens 6-3, 6-4 in Paris.

It was a fine performance from Krueger, who's appearing in just her second French Open main draw.

The 6ft 1in emerging star failed to get past the first round in last year's edition, and after also falling at the same stage at the Australian Open earlier this year, a second-round Grand Slam appearance will surely satisfy her.

Krueger, who made her professional debut back in 2021, has consistently struggled at Grand Slams in her short career.

She's fallen at the first round in every single major she's appeared at, bar the US Open last year, where she reached the third round, and now this French Open win. 

Now in Paris, she joins a slew of young American players who have avoided an early exit, with Robin Montgomery and Hailey Baptiste also picking up first-round wins.

Krueger also has one of the best coaches in her team to help guide her progression.

That is former tennis player Michael Joyce, who also coached Maria Sharapova.

Joyce has worked with Krueger since 2021, after several stints with other players like Jessica Pegula and Victoria Azarenka.

Although his most successful stint was with the Russian Sharapova, whom he helped guide to three Grand Slams.

The Krueger-Sharapova connection goes beyond just coaching, though. 

Like the former world no.1 and two-time French Open champion, Krueger is tall, blonde, and extremely hard-hitting.

The American knew by the age of 11 she wanted to be a professional tennis player, when she saw five-time Grand Slam champion Sharapova succeeding at the highest level. “

She had the same body type as me,” Krueger said. “When you see someone that looks like you, it's really important. I saw her and said, `I want to do that.'”

Joyce is now working with Krueger, and he'll be the last person to be surprised should she make a run at the French Open after a steady upwards trajectory this year.

She started 2025 with a run to the quarterfinals of the Brisbane International, defeating big opponents on the way, including sixth seed Anna Kalinskaya.

Krueger then backed that victory up with another quarterfinal, this time in Adelaide, where she had to come through qualifying.

There, she achieved one of her biggest ever wins, beating fifth seed Paula Badosa before being forced to retire against top seed Jessica Pegula.

After a disappointing Australian Open, she then bounced back by reaching the final in Abu Dhabi, a WTA 500 tournament, losing to Belinda Bencic.

Nevertheless, Krueger, who is currently ranked 35th in the world, has remained optimistic about her year so far as she bids to make 2025 the most successful season of her career.

She even told Tennis Channel about one ambitious goal she has.

""Top 15 at the end of the year,"" she said.

When asked how she will get there? By having no regrets.

""Everything just connects [when she plays her best tennis], and I see the court really well,"" Krueger said. 

""I go for my targets and I have no hesitation. When I have no hesitation, everything just flows.

Krueger will have a mammoth task to reach the third round at the French Open, as she faces World No.6 Mirra Andreeva.

 Lorenzo Musetti has wasted little time sending out a statement that he means business at Roland Garros. 

 The eighth seed on Wednesday raced past Daniel Elahi Galan 6-4, 6-0, 6-4 to reach the third round at the clay court major. Musetti converted six of 12 break points he earned, according to Infosys Stats, to wrap a two-hour, six-minute triumph and build impressively on his opening 7-5, 6-2, 6-0 triumph against Yannick Hanfmann. 

 “Honestly today was not easy to play because of the wind,” said Musetti. “I think I managed to stay there and play a solid match. That is what I needed. I had to raise the level, raise the battle, and I'm really happy to be in the third round.” 

Smooth sailing ⛵️Musetti cruises into the third round with a 6-4 6-0 6-4 win over Galan 🌊@rolandgarros | #rolandgarros | #musetti pic.twitter.com/fxABq16awK

 By increasing his Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Galan to 3-0, Musetti improved to 23-5 on clay since last July. During that period, his achievements include winning a bronze medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics and reaching at least the semi-finals at all three clay ATP Masters 1000 events in 2025, including a championship-match run in Monte-Carlo. 

 Musetti has suffered plenty of heartache at Roland Garros, where he has only lost to Novak Djokovic (twice), Stefanos Tsitsipas and Carlos Alcaraz. He led Djokovic by two sets to love in the fourth round on event debut in 2021, before retiring in the fifth set. A year later, he also led then-World No. 4 Tsitsipas by two sets before falling to a first-round defeat, while his 2024 third-round loss to Djokovic also came in five sets. 



 Yet Musetti has never been better placed to atone for these past disappointments. The Italian's stunning clay-court form has propelled him to sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, as he bids to make his Nitto ATP Finals debut on home soil. 

 He is also unlikely to fear anyone in his section of the draw, despite the presence of some high-quality rivals. Should he defeat Mariano Navone next, Musetti is seeded to meet 10th seed Holger Rune, the Barcelona champion, in the fourth round. The 15th seed Frances Tiafoe is the highest-ranked player Musetti could face in the quarter-finals. 

 “It's been a tremendous clay season so far, but the ambitions now are higher and of course here I never reached more than the fourth round,” said Musetti, who is competing at a career-high No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “Hopefully this year will be the year, and the mentality is to try and beat everyone… I have the chance to play against everyone here, and hopefully I will take these chances.” 

 Musetti's next opponent Navone booked his third-round spot by defeating Reilly Opelka 6-1, 7-6(1), 6-3, while 2023 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Hamad Medjedovic also advanced on Wednesday lunchtime. Medjedovic sank qualifier Juan Manuel Cerundolo 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 to advance to face Daniel Altmaier, a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 winner against Vit Kopriva.

Casper Ruud's Roland Garros dream came to a shocking end on Wednesday, the No. 7 seed looking visibly hampered by injury en route to a 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 second-round defeat to Nuno Borges.""For the last couple of weeks I've been kind of struggling a little bit with knee pain on and off,"" Rudd confirmed in his post-match press conference. ""That's why I decided to pull out of Geneva after Rome, do my best, and heal to be ready here.""The two-time finalist came to Paris having captured his first Masters 1000 title at the Mutua Madrid Open and won his first round in straight sets against Spanish qualifier Albert Ramos Viñolas. But the pre-tournament favorite struggled to move as Borges rallied from a set down and took a medical timeout before losing a 6-0 fourth set on Court Suzanne-Lenglen.""When you're practicing, leading up to the tournament, it's easier to avoid certain movements that are painful,"" Ruud explained. ""It's not painful. Everything is not painful. But certain movements out there are kind of what makes it painful. Certain shots are painful to do.""When you're playing matches, you can't really control it in the same way. You do everything you can to get to every ball. Sometimes you kind of forget that this is a shot I shouldn't go for maybe in terms of pain in the knee. That's pretty much all. It's been okay in practice because, like I said, I'm able to control it a bit more. When you play a match, you go full on, no matter what happens. I don't want to take anything away from Nuno, because I think he played a phenomenal match, a really high level.""A few shots out there are a bit painful for me to do. Other than that, it's kind of everything, it's not more than this.""

PARIS (AP) — In all sports, there are advantages to being at home. At Roland Garros, being a visitor playing against a French player can feel as though the whole world is against you.The crowds don't just cheer. They boo, they whistle, they make noise between serves, they hurl insults—and, at least once, even gum—at the locals' opponents. That sort of behavior is why the tournament organizers banned alcohol from the stands last year, a policy still in place.Some of the non-French athletes who deal with that sort of negativity in Paris, such as 19-year-old Jakub Mensík of the Czech Republic, who eliminated Alexandre Müller in front of a rowdy crowd at Court 14 on Tuesday, compare the high-intensity atmosphere to that of a soccer game.Read More: Jakub Mensik channels idol Djokovic as he conducts Roland Garros crowdOthers choose stronger terms.""Disgusting.

It ""makes you feel like you could reach for the stars,"" said the highest-ranked French woman, Varvara Gracheva, who acknowledged that support also can become a burden.She lost in the first round Tuesday.It's been a quarter of a century since a woman representing the host nation won the singles title at Roland Garros (Mary Pierce in 2000) and even longer since a man did (Yannick Noah in 1983).""As French players, we're under pressure all the time when we play here"" said Moutet, currently ranked No. 73.

So you have to try to ignore the pressure.""Nathan Fhima, an 18-year-old high school student from Paris, figured his compatriots needed his voice. So there he was this week at Roland-Garros, waving a blue-white-and-red French flag and screaming himself hoarse while skipping class to watch qualifying and first-round matches.""We have to push them, because not much will happen otherwise,"" he said after watching France's Diane Parry lose Monday.

The Hollywood Reporter's latest ""Person of Interest"" is the powerhouse behind F1 Academy — the female-only racing league featured in a new Netflix series — who is proving that the global racing sport is ""no longer just a man's world.""


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Male-dominated sport? No problem. That's the attitude Susie Wolff adopted before she went full throttle into the racing world.


	The 42-year-old former professional racing driver and current managing director of F1 Academy — a female-only racing league — is using her experience and expertise as the most recent female driver to get behind the wheel of a Formula 1 car during a Grand Prix weekend to help clear a path for other women in motorsport.




	In just two F1 Academy racing seasons (and currently in its third), Wolff has already made huge steps forward with the program designed to develop and promote female talent in motorsport, and now F1 fans, and maybe even some new ones, can witness the impact of the league with Netflix's new docuseries, F1: The Academy, produced by Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine.

	Wolff tells The Hollywood Reporter the series is “showing that the sport they love is no longer just a man's world because without Formula One, Formula One Academy wouldn't exist. … And I think by sharing these incredible human stories of these young drivers and their journeys, the challenges they faced, it really brings to life the fact that regardless of gender, there's an opportunity in the sport.”


	Below, Wolff opens up about the stigma around female drivers and fans, her goals with F1 Academy and the Netflix series, if she ever misses being the one in the race suit and what she's most proud of so far.


Female interest and viewership in F1 and motorsport have grown in recent years thanks to shows like Netflix's Drive to Survive. How do you hope this series casts a larger spotlight on how F1 Academy is paving the way for women in the sport?


	Well that growing female fan base that you've alluded to, I think first and foremost it's important that they see the sport they love is creating opportunity for female talent. It's showing that the sport they love is no longer just a man's world because without Formula One, Formula One: Academy wouldn't exist, and the stakeholders of the sport, Formula One, the 10 Formula One teams, have really got behind it. Also, we want to attract a new audience. We want to attract that next generation, the parents of the next generation, to challenge the idea that women can't be racing drivers, that it's an industry that's not really built for women. And I think by sharing these incredible human stories of these young drivers and their journeys, the challenges they faced, it really brings to life the fact that regardless of gender, there's an opportunity in the sport. 

	











In the series, you're very caring of these girls but also tough. As the managing director, how do you navigate that tough-love approach?  


	It was really tough, Carly, because I think one of the big advantages I had was I raced from 8 years old, so I know exactly what they're going through, the challenges, the tough moments. I almost made it to Formula One, so I know what's coming next for them. And it really was the balance of trying to create this environment where they felt they could excel and progress and be surrounded by the best talent in the junior teams, but I also didn't want to shy them away from the reality of how tough it's going to be. And the sport isn't segregated, so to build a career in motorsport, you need to be good enough to race against men, and it is very competitive. So it was just trying to strike that balance between really feeling that I was with them, that I was supporting them and trying to help them be the best they could be, but not losing sight of the overall reality because I'm the one that's got to make it all function over the long term, and these drivers need to know that pressure is part of the game. There is only ever one winner, and it's how you pick yourself up and carry on after the failures that will define how successful you are in the long term. 


Having been so immersed in the motorsport world since you were young, why do you think there's still a stigma around female drivers and fans?












	Well we hope that this series is going to challenge that stigma, because I think you're absolutely right, there is still a bit of a stigma, but I do see it changing. The fact that this young fan base exists, I think there's more expectations from the next generation of women, and I think it's important that they see this sport they love is doing something to challenge this misconception and this stigma that racing isn't for girls, because the sport recognized, well, we have a huge female following, and it recognized that it had to do something to create more opportunities for young women. So I hope by both those things, we are creating an even larger female fan base that can feel represented more. 


Since you've seen how the sport has changed over the decades, what are your thoughts on where it currently stands?


	It's progressed massively because I was often the only one [female], and now we obviously have F1 Academy that exists, which I never thought in my lifetime I would see, and it just shows how much progress that we've made in a short space of time. But I think the sport's global popularity has never been so big. I was lucky enough to watch the F1 movie last night, and the technical director in Brad [Pitt's] team was a woman, there was a mechanic that was a woman. And that was just normal now for us to see, it's not something that felt out of place, and I think 10 years ago, that wasn't the case. So I do think we've made an incredible amount of progress in a short space of time, but I still think we've got to keep our foot flat on the gas pedal, excuse the pun, because there's more that we can achieve still. 

	











Though F1 Academy is just a few seasons in, when do you think we'll potentially see another female driver on the F1 grid?


	It's something I would love to see, but it's not my definition of whether we've been successful or not, because I think the impact we can have in inspiring the next generation, increasing the talent pool, making sure that our most talented drivers go on to progress up the sport, that for me is the midterm. Of course, I want to see a woman on the grid, and I think that will be inevitable when we get the building blocks in place that we know we have to do for long-term success and without a doubt, that will be a proud moment when we see a woman take to the grid. You know, there's only two spots in the grid [per team], and it's very, very tough to get to Formula One, so we've got to make sure that we put the right steps in place that a woman has that chance in hopefully the not-too-distant future. 


What was it like working alongside Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine to bring the docuseries to life?


	I feel very privileged that I got to work with the Hello Sunshine team, the Netflix team. Obviously the Netflix team, they made Drive to Survive, they know what it takes to make a great docuseries. Hello Sunshine was versed in bringing women's stories to life. So it really was for me the perfect partnership, and it was a real privilege to be a part of that group because I think we've created something that I hope will challenge people's perception, bring these human stories to life, and even if we can have a smaller amount of success that Drive to Survive did, it will really shift the momentum of F1 Academy. 

	











How have you used your experience and expertise in the sport to help guide you with developing this program?


	I leaned massively on my own experience, having been a racing driver through all the various levels, but also having run a team. I also was not scared to go out and to the people I respect in the sport, I wanted to know everyone's opinion, “What can we do to make this a success? What's your opinion as to why there's not more women in racing? What can we do?” Also people that weren't very versed in motorsport, I said, “What's your opinion?” I wanted to really gather as much intel as I could because I knew we had one chance to get this right, and if we could get it right, it could have a massive impact on the sport, and if we got it wrong, I think it would take a long time for another chance like this to come. And I'm incredibly grateful that people gave me the time, that people gave me the trust and the responsibility for setting this up for success, because now I feel a huge amount of pride in the opportunity we've created for these drivers, but the shift we see in the sport of removing the stigma and the preconceptions that it's not a world which is welcoming to women. 


Seeing what all these incredible young drivers are doing, do you ever find yourself missing when you were the one in the race suit and competing?


	Zero! Been there, done it, got the T-shirts (Laughs). If anything, when I watched some of the footage back, because I obviously have a lot to do on a race weekend, I'm not with the drivers a lot, but I got quite emotional when I saw how emotional the drivers got because I know what it's like to have a tough race day and I know how hard it is to pick yourself up afterwards, and I know how much a lot of them are sacrificed and given. So it was emotional to see, and there were certain drivers that I had to go and say something to because I said, “Listen, I've been where you are now. I know how tough that is,” but I also loved seeing the special moments of the drivers that won that made it onto the podium because standing on a podium on an F1 race weekend in a suit of an F1 team, that's an experience which I could never even dreamed of when I was racing, and that's possible for them and to have that opportunity so early in their careers is something which is quite special. 

	











It probably brings back positive and negative memories, then.


	You know what I realized — and they're different from my husband [Toto Wolff, CEO and team principal of Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team], who obviously needs his team to do well — I can watch a race and not be stressed about who wins. I can watch it and actually know that as long as it's great racing, we've had a good day's F1 Academy. I can celebrate with the with the winner, whoever won on that day. So it does take a bit off the pressure to deliver every race again. 


What are you most proud of regarding what you've accomplished with the F1 Academy program and your career overall?


	I never really take the time to look back — I feel like I'm in the midst of my career — to think what I've done well. I feel very grateful that I've had such a career in the sport that I got to spend so many years as a racing driver. I made it to Formula One as a test driver, and now I feel grateful also to have this great opportunity with F1 Academy, and I hope when I have more time, I can look back and say, wow, it was so great to be a part of that, and to be part of a team which brought such a vision to life and created this amazing opportunity for young women.

Based on the novel by Alafair Burke, the eight-episode thriller centers on two estranged siblings who are brought back together by a murder in the family.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	Sharpen your trend piece-writing pencils, because this week's premiere of Amazon's The Better Sister follows fast on the heels of Peacock's Long Bright River and Netflix's Sirens, completing a trio of streaming shows about long estranged sisters simultaneously bonded and torn apart by youthful trauma, coming together to solve an external mystery with connections to that shared pain.


	In all three, one sister is coded as “good” and the other as “bad” — the former inevitably identified by severe and flattened blonde hair, the latter by a surplus of mascara designed to run at moments of heightened emotion — but the shocking revelation in each is that when viewed with empathy, no “bad” sister is truly without a redemptive origin and no “good” sister has achieved success without blemishes.

The Bottom Line

	
	This 'Sister' should be much better.
	



Airdate: Thursday, May 29 (Prime Video)Cast: Jessica Biel, Elizabeth Banks, Corey Stoll, Maxwell Acee Donovan, Gabriel Sloyer, Kim Dickens, Bobby NaderiCreator: Olivia Milch			
			







	All three series, debuting within a 10-week window, have the same strengths — the shifting sororal binary is a boon for actors — and all three suffer similar issues blending genre elements with the core relationship.


The Better Sister, unfortunately, offers the widest extremes. Adapted by Olivia Milch (with Regina Corrado serving as co-showrunner) from the novel by Alafair Burke, the drama strands strong chemistry and performances from Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks in a murder mystery that starts off dull, becomes ludicrous and finally resolves in an over-complicated frenzy in which plot supersedes character entirely.


	The Craig Gillspie-directed premiere begins with a focus on Biel's Chloe, the clear “good” sister. Chloe is a bestselling author and magazine editor whose recent interest in gender equity in the workplace has the New York press speculating on a future political run. Chloe is married to a powerful attorney (Corey Stoll‘s Adam), with a teenage son (Maxwell Acee Donovan's Ethan). They have a fantastic penthouse apartment in the city and a nice enough house in the Hamptons, and Chloe is always impeccably dressed and coiffed. (Neither house is actually that nice, in part because the show can't decide how rich its leads are, much less the nature of Chloe's job and its visibility.)

	











	Then one night in Montauk, after a party thrown by her publisher (Lorraine Toussaint's Catherine), Chloe returns home to find Adam stabbed to death on the floor of their home. Local detectives Guidry (Kim Dickens), who is gay and has a thick Southern accent occasionally, and Bowen (Bobby Naderi), who has immigrant parents and a mustache initially, very quickly turn their attention to Ethan, who has a pattern of disciplinary troubles.


	Ethan's legal jeopardy prompts the arrival of Banks' Nicky, who has a messy history with drugs and alcohol and an even more complicated relationship with Chloe, Adam and Ethan, which I won't spoil here, even though it's basically the plot.


	Is Ethan, who had a strained relationship with his demanding father, a killer? Were Adam and colleague Jake (Gabriel Sloyer) and boss Bill (Matthew Modine) working for shady clients who might be dangerous? And how does any of this relate to Chloe and Nicky's past with their own father, hyper-intense Hank (Frederick Weller, in flashbacks and spectral visits)?


	Chloe is successful, tightly wound and over-calculating to the extent that doubting her sincerity is unavoidable. 


	Nicky is a mess, generally uncouth, borderline sexist and racist and impulsive to the point of predictable discomfort regarding how she'll behave in polite social circumstances.


	There was a time when Nicky and Chloe were everything to each other, but now they're basically strangers.


	When Chloe and Nicky are onscreen together, The Better Sister becomes something involving, a portrait of a difficult relationship between two women who couldn't seem more different but, of course, are more alike than they want to admit. Both Biel and Banks approach their roles from a point of initial broadness, but I found myself quickly appreciating how the two performances are designed to be as complementary as their respective characters — one brittle and unreadable, one sloppy and unfiltered. They bicker with the recognizable knowledge of two people who only remember how to use their closeness to hurt, rather than support, each other.

	











	Their banter is paralleled by that of Guidry and Bowen, who similarly know how to push each other's buttons, albeit in ways I found much more tiresome than the rapport between Chloe and Nicky. But there's no question that Milch and the writers are interested in the funny, annoying and painfully human ways that tightly joined partnerships interact in the bleakest of circumstances.


	Given that Chloe-Nicky relationship is the center of the drama, it's less than ideal that the two characters barely interact at all until the third and fourth episodes. 


	Before that, The Better Sister is going through the motions on a murder mystery that I didn't find even vaguely engaging. We see a lot of Adam in flashbacks — and, like Hank, in spectral form, because this is kind of a ghost story but mostly not — but despite Stoll's efforts, whatever complexity might have existed on the page doesn't come through. I was never invested in either Adam's life or how his work might have led to his death. Ethan is presented as a teen who's uncomfortable in his own skin, and Donovan captures that unease completely, but not in any way that made me care what he did or didn't do. 


	Throw in Sloyer, constantly either going into or coming out of water as an excuse for six-pack exposure, and Modine, enjoying a successful if limited career renaissance as suspicious white-haired power player, and the series lards up on suspects and red herrings in a story that wouldn't effectively fill a 42-minute Law & Order episode, much less an eight-hour season.

	











	There's a brief window toward the middle of the series in which Chloe and Nicky are trying to learn to trust each other again and I thought The Better Sister was becoming a better version of itself, one with an interesting perspective on the double standards that society places on women and on mothers and the struggle necessary to succeed at each. There are bursts of humor, mostly provided by Banks, obviously enjoying Nicky's no-fucks-given lack of restraint, while Biel handles Chloe's unraveling well.


	Then the murder mystery transitions into a legal thriller, complete with some of the dumbest courtroom scenes I've ever seen. Then there's another window in which the sisters move back to the forefront before a finale that works frantically to tie together the various threads, past and present, as if The Better Sister had built any momentum at all as a whodunit, which it had not. I wasn't able to guess the big reveal, but only because I stopped having any desire to try. 


	When the solution came along, I was neither surprised nor entertained by how it was laid it out. Rather than deal with Nicky and Chloe and their lives in the aftermath of this catastrophe, the finale is all dry plot machinations, even scattering breadcrumbs for a repetitive second season despite Amazon billing the show as a limited series.


	Like Sirens and Long Bright River, this is an over-extended movie that nobody would make as a movie, even with big names like Biel and Banks as its stars. There's a better Better Sister that would get us to Chloe and Nicky's relationship far more quickly, long before I'd checked out on the bigger storylines — just as I yearned for Long Bright River to realize sooner that its greatest strength was letting Amanda Seyfried and Ashleigh Cummings interact more and faster. 

	











	It's one thing for a TV show to leave viewers wanting more of what works, but both of those made me want significantly less of what wasn't working first. Sirens at least gave us a lot of Milly Alcock and Meghann Fahy's bickering sisters and, at five episodes, it had an economy the other two titles lack, albeit with an odd combination of overt humor and affluence porn that didn't ultimately cohere.


	None of these spring explorations of sisterly deceit and self-deception has been able to surpass Apple TV+'s Bad Sisters as the recent genre peak. More sisters. More laughs. More twists. Better show.

The former 'Today' show co-anchor, who left the NBC morning show in January, has revealed her new venture.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast, THR.com


	Former Today show co-anchor Hoda Kotb has officially launched her next venture, Joy 101, a wellness platform and community designed to help people live more joyful, grounded, purposeful lives.


	“You know when you find something so special, so life-changing that you just have to share it? That's me, and that's Joy 101,” Kotb said in a statement. “It's a place to pass on the light, the lessons and the healing I've been lucky enough to receive from the very best in wellness. Think of it as an introduction into a more joyful, balanced, beautiful life. Let's goooooo!”

	Joy 101 will feature an app, online courses and practices as well as in-person retreats and other gatherings.

	The app gently guides people on their journey in the form of daily content from top experts, curated by Kotb and tailored to each user. Joy 101 will feature some of the practices and insights that changed Kotb's life including breath work, meditation, movement, gratitude and sleep hacks as well as deep-dive courses on subjects like purpose, happiness and curiosity, taught by college professors with the first class available an abridged version of Suzy Welch's NYU course, Becoming You.


	Helping Kotb on this venture is a group of advisers known as The Joy Collective, including happiness expert Professor Arthur Brooks, entrepreneur and podcast host Emma Grede, Magnolia co-founder and designer Joanna Gaines, Maria Shriver, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert and neuroscientist and dean of NYU's College of Arts and Science Dr. Wendy Suzuki.


	Joy 101 will also allow members to meet and grow together in the form of live Zoom gatherings with friends and experts dubbed Hoda's Happiness Hours, beginning June 11 with Kotb's former co-hosts Savannah Guthrie and Jenna Bush Hager. Members will also get early access to in-person retreats, which will start in the fall.

	











	Joy 101 membership — accessed through the app now available for pre-order on iOS, before its official launch in two weeks, and Android on June 11 — is $16.99 a month with a 14-day free trail or $99 a year, with a 30-day free trial.


	Kotb announced Joy 101's launch on Wednesday's Today, returning to the NBC morning show as a guest after leaving in January. There she also spoke about her life since leaving Today, including revealing her daughter Hope's Type 1 diabetes diagnosis and how it contributed to her decision to step away. She also addressed rumors that she could replace Kelly Clarkson on the latter's eponymous daytime show.


	Kotb revealed in September that she planned to leave NBC's Today show, later setting Jan. 10, 2025 as her last day.


	“I just turned 60, and it was such a monumental moment for me when I turned 60 years old, because I started thinking about that decade, like, what does that decade mean? What does it hold? What's it going to have for me? And I realized that it was time for me to turn the page at 60 and to try something new,” Kotb said during her on-air announcement. “I had my kiddos late in life, and I was thinking that they deserve a bigger piece of the time pie that I have,” she added. “I feel like we only have a finite amount of time.”


	Kotb, who had served as Today co-anchor alongside Guthrie since 2018, was replaced as co-anchor of the show's first two hours by Craig Melvin. As for her gig co-hosting the fourth hour of Today alongside Bush Hager, Bush Hager has been welcoming a revolving door of guest co-hosts for what's now dubbed Today With Jenna & Friends.

	











	On Wednesday, Kotb herself was one of those friends, returning to Today‘s fourth hour as Bush Hager's guest co-host.


	Recently, Kotb had been teasing Joy 101 on her personal social media.


	Since leaving Today, she's spending more time with her daughters and continuing with her Making Space podcast. Kotb is also set to release a book this fall, Jump and Find Joy: Embracing Chaos in Every Season of Life.

The U2 singer also revealed that the full band is in the studio working on their next album.

	For the record, Bono said he has never endorsed a politician for office. But when Jimmy Kimmel asked him on Tuesday night (May 27) where he stood in the ongoing, escalating battle between Donald Trump and Bruce Springsteen, the socially conscious U2 singer said there was only one endorsement he could possibly give. 


	bono-jimmy-kimmel-live-still-2025-billboard-1548″I think there's only one ‘Boss' in America,” the Irish rock legend responded cheekily in reference to Springsteen's longtime nickname. The dig at the president came after a recent late night Truth Social rant in which Trump called for a “major investigation” into celebrities who supported former vice president Kamala Harris in her White House bid. “HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” Trump wrote. “WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS? ISN'T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? …AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO???”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	According to Newsweek, there is no official record of any of those artist being paid to perform in support of Harris. In addition, Irish citizen Bono did not endorse a candidate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election and did not participate in any campaign events.

	











	That said, Bono was more than happy to be included in the Trump dump. “To be in the company of Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé and Oprah, I'd play tambourine in that band,” he told Kimmel, clarifying that neither he nor U2 have ever “paid or played a show to support any candidate from any party. It has never happened. It's called ‘Truth Social,' but it seems to be very antisocial and it's not very true,” he quipped about the president's social media platform.


	He did, however, suspect that his name may have made it into Trump's rant because he co-founded the non-profit One Campaign, a global non-partisan organization that has raised millions to create economic opportunities in Africa. In the midst of the Trump administration's unprecedented dismantling of U.S. government agencies — including efforts to completely defund and eliminated the U.S. Agency for International Development — Bono noted that people across the political spectrum, including the many “very religious Catholics and evangelicals and conservatives” who support his organization are “very, very, very angry with the person that they voted into office having demolished instruments of mercy and compassion, like USAID or PEPFAR,” he said.


	The latter is a reference to a global initiative launched by Republican President George W. Bush in 2003 that is credited to date with saving 26 million lives of people living with AIDS and and allowing nearly 8 million babies to be born with HIV infection. “They are not happy and there will be trouble,” Bono predicted of the blow-back from Trump's actions. 


	While he was happy to weigh in on the American pop-litical back-and-forth, Bono was actually there to promote his new biographical film, Bono: Stories of Surrender, which premieres on Apple TV+ on Friday (May 30). In a rare TV chat appearance, the singer jokingly said the memoir-tuned-one-man-show-turned-film has him playing an “aging rock star on a massive ego trip… It's quite a stretch.”

	











	He briefly described how the film had him exploring his “rather complicated” relationship with his strong-willed late father, Brendan Robert Hewson, as well as his own struggles to be a good father and son. When Kimmel noted that the film got a nearly 9-minute ovation at its Cannes Film Festival debut, Bono, despite being one of the world's biggest rock stars, admitted to feeling a sense of imposter syndrome while walking the red carpet at the glamorous French film fête. 


	In fact, he was somewhat unnerved to even sit with Kimmel, asking actress daughter Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters) for advice, which she dutifully provided. “‘Dad, just bring it,'” she counseled the 65-year-old music legend. “And I'm like, ‘bring what?,'” he replied. “She said, ‘it. It. Just answer Jimmy's questions. None of the jazz conversation without full stops and commas. Just answer his question, no false modesty.'”


	Sage advice indeed. So, when Kimmel asked what's next for U2, Bono gave a somewhat jazz-less answer. “Oh, oh yes,” Bono said in response to a query about whether the band is recording new music. “We've been in a studio. I think you've sometimes got to deal with the past to get to the present… in order to make the sound of the future.”


	Bono described the sound as that of “four men who feel like their lives depend on it,” noting that “nobody needs a new U2 album unless it's an extraordinary one. And I'm feeling very strong about it.” The unnamed album would be the follow-up to 2023's Songs of Surrender, which featured re-recorded versions of 40 of the group's previously released tracks. 


	Pumping up the jazz, Bono said the new tracks are songs for the “kitchen… the speedway, the garage… just for every part of your life. Songs to make up to, songs to break up to.” The best news is that drummer Larry Mullen Jr. is back in the fold following neck surgery that kept him out of U2's residency at Las Vegas' Sphere in late 2023 and early 2024. “He's really innovative,” Bono said of the band's time keeper.

UPDATED: Donald Trump once again got testy with a reporter over a question, this time over a phrase being used on Wall Street over the president's tendency to not follow through on tariff threats: the TACO trade, as in “Trump Always Chickens Out.”


	The reporter, Megan Casella of CNBC, noted that analysts have used the term, and it explains why markets have been higher this week. “What's your response to that?” she asked Trump.


	“I kick out?” Trump asked.


	“Chicken out,” Casella repeated.

	“I've never heard that,” Trump said, before arguing that his tariff policy has brought China and the European Union to the negotiating table.

	He then told Casella, “You ask a nasty question like that. It's called negotiation. You set a number… if I set a number at a ridiculous high, I go down a little bit, they want me to hold that number. 145% tariff.” Trump said that “we were doing no business because of the tariff, because it was so high. I knew that. But don't ever say what you said. That's a nasty question.”


	Wall Street markets gyrated as trade between the U.S. and China came to a standstill. But after negotiations earlier this month, the U.S. lowered the tariff, at least for 90 days, to 30%, while China dropped its reciprocal tariff to 10%. 


	Trump was speaking to pool reporters in the Oval Office after a swearing in ceremony of Jeanine Pirro as the new interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.


	Casella later said on CNBC that “Wall Street loves an acronym,” and “the idea here is just that yes, the markets will go down when he makes a threat, only to rebound, often even higher, once the threat is off the table.” As for Trump calling her question “nasty,” Casella said it was “a badge of honor, I guess.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Little House on the Prairie' Reboot Adds Hallmark Hunk to Cast","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/little-house-prairie-reboot-warren-christie/","Wed, 28 May 2025 18:32:35 GMT","

When Netflix launches its reboot of the classic series “Little House on the Prairie,” Hallmark fans will see a familiar face — but it won't be new “When Calls The Heart” cast member Melissa Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls Wilder on the original series.

Rather, Hallmark star Warren Christie has joined the reboot's cast, Deadline first reported on May 27, 2025. The actor, who just wrapped his second Hallmark movie in a row with Nikki DeLoach, will play a character familiar to fans of the original show, based on the 1930s book series about pioneer life, written by the real-life Laura Ingalls Wilder. 

In the new series, Christie has been cast as John Edwards, a Tennessee Civil War veteran known as Dr. Edwards in the “Little House” books. According to Deadline, Edwards is “a gregarious and mysterious man who catches the eye of every single woman in the county (maybe some of the married ones, too).” 

The character also appeared in the original NBC series, which aired from 1974 to 1983, but was named Isaiah Edwards and played by Victor French, per Deadline. 

In 2024, as the original series marked its 50th anniversary, Nielsen honored “Little House on the Prairie” with the ARTEY Legacy Award for continuing to draw a huge audience. Nielsen said streamers watched 13.25 billion minutes of the show via Peacock in 2024 alone. 

Like the original, Netflix has said the new series will be “part family drama, part epic survival tale, and part origin story of the American West. The series will offer a kaleidoscopic view of the struggles and triumphs of those who shaped the frontier.” The series is scheduled to film from June through October in Winnipeg, according to CTV News. 

A post shared by Castleberry Casting (@castleberrycasting)

In an Instagram interview with Castleberry Casting on May 13, Christie may have teased his upcoming role in a “Western style show” while discussing his future goals. 

“My goals have certainly changed,” he wrote. “It's not really about ‘getting somewhere' anymore.  It's about working with good people, having fun and telling different, varied stories with interesting characters.  Specifically tho…I'd love to do some kind of a Western style show. Call it the Yellowstone effect. :)”

Christie, who will star with DeLoach this fall in the Hallmark movie “Home Turf” after co-starring with her in 2024's “Our Holiday Story,” also told Castleberry Casting, “Honestly, if you'd told me in high school that I was gonna have a 20+ year career in the entertainment industry I'd have said you were crazy. Feel incredibly blessed.”

 “I truly don't understand when the word ‘safe' became positive in cinema and the word ‘dangerous' became negative,” Nadav Lapid told IndieWire about his bold new film “Yes” at Cannes.

The most volatile, potentially conversation-stirring movie of the festival was one most attendees probably didn't see. Not “Eddington,” not “Die, My Love,” but a late-breaker in the lineup whose director rushed to finish it before any red carpets rolled out on the Croisette.

Israeli filmmaker Lapid has been in the Cannes competition before, with 2021's Jury Prize winner “Ahed's Knee,” which centers on a director facing artistic censorship over his latest movie about a Palestinian activist. But there was no competition bow this year for Lapid's in-your-face musical satire about a pair of Israeli artists who sign their souls over to a Russian oligarch to craft a post-October 7 nationalist anthem in support of their state. Instead, “Yes” premiered in the final days of the festival in the Directors' Fortnight section (and also since listed among IndieWire's top films of the festival).

Here is a filmmaker ever in conversation with his homeland, but one who's become increasingly wary of it from afar, living in Paris, even while insisting his films aren't explicitly political.

 










“I am saying what my press agent told me to say when I am asked why the film is not in the competition,” Lapid told IndieWire on the Croisette beach at Cannes a day before “Yes” premiered. “More or less everyone asks this question. What she told me to say is, ‘Maybe it's a question that should be addressed to the people who selected the film, and not to you.'”

Lapid, who said he is not good at being “diplomatic,” added, “Then, she told me to say that I should say, ‘I don't know. Maybe the film was too disturbing. Maybe someone was afraid.' What I can say is that the film, during its whole [production], and also when it ended, became — unwillingly — a kind of tool which measures cowardice and courage, to distinguish between the cowardly ones and the courageous ones.”

Actors and financiers were cast and brought on — contractual ink still drying — but people started backing out, even below-the-line crew, both ahead of and during the production. Other performers were cast, and ultimately dropped out, in the film before it finally shot in Israel, including in Tel Aviv, last year. 

“There were several actors, well-known ones, who auditioned for the film, got the role, were extremely happy. Two weeks later, or one week later, or 10 days later, their agents called to say they would not do the role because of ABCDEFG,” Lapid said. “One of the them told me she would not do the role because of the way the head of staff … was shown in the script. Some of them were afraid. There were agents who told their actors it was better to keep a distance from this film. Some were afraid about their career. Some of them felt that, in a time of war, there's no legitimacy for such a voice.”

 










He added, “Dozens of technicians, technician people [left the production] … each day, when someone got sick, when someone called and said, ‘I have a fever,' we knew. … The executive producer told them, ‘You want to quit, don't you?'”

For those who stayed on? “Suddenly, it became courageous to do makeup, or put a lamp [on set] or to do a dolly,” Lapid said.

“We shot the film in an ambience in fear and paranoia because we were afraid to be denounced. We reduced [in terms of crew and cast] — there was only one monitor on set because we were afraid someone would do something he doesn't like and will denounce us. ‘False script, fake synopsis.' It was a little bit like shooting a film in the land of the country of the enemy,” Lapid said.

Lapid started writing the debauched musical tragedy that became “Yes” well before Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The screenplay changed after that day, and actively kept evolving amid the early months of Israeli military's assault on Gaza. Lapid and the crew he was able to assemble ultimately shot the film in Israel and, in one harrowing scene, against the rim of the war zone alongside the Gaza border. It's where the protagonist, jazz musician Y (Ariel Bronz), goes, in bleach-blonde hair, to get closer the action and to find perhaps a deeper connection to the pro-military song he's agreed to write.

 










“In the movie, there is an act of kissing in front of Gaza. Don't we all kiss in front of a lot of Gazas?,” Lapid said of a scene where Y hooks up with his ex-girlfriend (Naama Preis), an IDF officer who excruciatingly details, in a long emotional diatribe that is the one of the film's emotional centers, violence done upon Israelis by Hamas. But Lapid, who also spent time in the Israeli military, does not let his government off the hook for the atrocities and military actions done in response to that violence.

The resulting, pungent, hard-to-shake film “Yes,” in its nearly two-and-a-half orgiastic hours of maximalist visual excess, stars Bronz as Y (the same anonymity-suggesting moniker Lapid applied to his filmmaker lead in “Ahed's Knee”) and Efrat Dor as his wife Yasmine, a hip-hop dancer, who are now raising a child in Tel Aviv when the fallout of October 7 hits.

Their marriage is already frayed despite polyamorous, drug-spiked orgies they participate in for the rich's amusement. Y takes a deal offered by a Trump-styled Russian moneyman (Alexey Serebryakov, in yellow face paint to evoke, well, yes, a certain man) to write an anthem that forces the couple's own latent political interests and disinterests to a relationship-shattering head. (The lyrics to the song, it turns out, come from the actual words of an anti-Palestinian activist group called Civic Front, as revealed in the end credits.)

 










“I wanted to make a film about the weakness of artists in our world, the weakness of artists facing the power of money and politics, the weakness of artists who are not capable anymore to say ‘no,' who are doomed to say ‘yes' in a bad world,” Lapid said. “It was [always] supposed to be shot in Israel, but it could've been shot all over the globe. And then came the 7th of October, and it kept telling me, ‘You're an Israeli: Before talking about the death of art, talk about death.'”

“Yes,” unsurprisingly, still does not have an Israeli distributor (nor a U.S. one so far), a first for director Lapid, whose films like “Synonyms” and “Policeman” have resonated globally including in his native country in terms of release. (“The Kindergarten Teacher,” about how a teacher's devotion to a precocious pupil capsizes her world, even inspired a Maggie Gyllenhaal-led Netflix remake in 2018.)

That's despite the Israeli Film Fund listed among the financiers on “Yes,” not uncommon for productions shot on state land. Lapid wasn't sure, as of a few days before the film's Cannes premiere, that the Israeli government even knew of the movie's existence. “I don't reduce it to an anti-Israeli film,” he said. “At the same time, it looks straight into the eyes of a place that experienced a terrible shock and reacted to it doing the worst possible.”

 










He continued by speaking more generally to a question in art that's plaguing us all, as movies perhaps become more passive in their audience-hand-holding: “Maybe I'm kind of stupid, but I truly don't understand when the word ‘safe' became positive in cinema and the word ‘dangerous' became negative. What does it mean, a movie that doesn't contain danger? A movie that doesn't contain risks? A movie that doesn't jump into a swimming pool of crocodiles?”

But the potential dangers of the movie didn't scare Lapid away from making an unflinching critique of his own country, yet also of the world, as Y and Yasmine start to question their own project and place in history. He said, “Don't we live in an extremely crazy, wild world, and so movies should be less wild than the world in which they are created? It's very strange the idea that when you are out of the cinema, you see wilder things than when you are inside the theater. I feel truly that there are few films, not enough films, that tell the story of our world. We are often amazed when we look at the news, the social media; we are not so amazed see a movie.”

“Ahed's Knee” producer Judith Lou Lévy initially helped bring on supporters in France via her Les Films du Bal, but additional French resources tapped out after October 7. Lapid was able to achieve the vision for reportedly his most expensive film (at more than $4.5 million U.S.) with help from Jaffa-based Bustan Films and France's Chi-Fou-Mi (via Screen Daily) after the war began.

 










Lévy has defended her support of the film even against moments of possibly halting the production. The idea of an entirely Israeli crew became impossible. People from within were afraid. As “Yes” went into production in Israel a year after October 7, the bombs overhead on the soundtrack and smoke in the view are often real. It will take an intrepid distributor to sell this provocative movie anywhere.

“I can imagine that those people who weren't courageous enough in the cinema,” Lapid said of those who bailed on “Yes,” “I can imagine that maybe they shouldn't be so proud at themselves. I can imagine that maybe they are not so happy to look at themselves in the mirror.”

One of the movie's revolving early motifs shows Y and Yasmine getting push notifications about the latest terrible disaster news circa October 7, but they keep going on about their day, though the soundtrack pushes in screams and clamors of warfare as the couple makes their breakfast with “oh, OK” indifference.

“It's the state of things. We cut a cucumber, we read a notification about the massacre, and we keep on cutting the cucumber,” Lapid said.

“Yes” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Will Sharpe is having his moment. The “White Lotus” breakout star leads the already buzzy Netflix series “Too Much” alongside Megan Stalter. As we await Lena Dunham's return to TV with the rom-dram series, Sharpe puts his leading man moves on full display for Audrey Diwan's erotic drama “Emmanuelle.” The film first premiered in San Sebastián last year and will finally hit VOD next month. IndieWire shares the release details and the trailer exclusively below.

“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” actress Noémie Merlant stars as the title character in Diwan's modern re-imagining of Emmanuelle Arsan's 1967 novel. The film, Diwan's first since her abortion drama “Happening,” centers on a woman (Merlant) whose business trip to Hong Kong leads to a sexual awakening. Naomi Watts, Will Sharpe, “Stranger Things” breakout Jamie Campbell Bower, Anthony Wong, and Chacha Huang co-star.

The official synopsis for the film reads: “While on business in Hong Kong, Emmanuelle meets Kei, a man who constantly eludes her. Though she indulges in the many alluring distractions the city has to offer, she can't shake their chance encounter. Will she submit to her basest desires to forge a deeper relationship? Audrey Diwan's film, freely adapted from Emmanuelle Arsan's novel, casts a female gaze on the intimate quest of the woman whose name still evokes one of cinema's most provocative characters.”

 










“Emmanuelle” opened the 2024 San Sebastián Film Festival. The feature was internationally distributed by Pathé. Chantelouve, Rectangle Productions, and Goodfellas produce.  

Diwan previously made her feature directorial debut with “Losing It” starring Celine Sallette and Pio Marmaï. Her second film, “Happening,” won the Golden Lion at the 2021 Venice Film Festival. That same year she was part of the Official Jury at the San Sebastian Festival, where she returned for the “Emmanuelle” premiere. In 2023, she was awarded the Best Screenplay César with co-writer and director Valerie Donzelli for “L'amour et Les Forets” (“Just the Two of Us”).

“Emmanuelle” is co-written by Diwan and Rebecca Zlotowsky. The producers are Reginald de Guillebon, Marion Delord, Edouard Weil, Brahim Chioua, Vincent Maraval, Livia Van Der Staay, and Laurence Clerc, with Severine Bacle serving as an associate producer. Ardavan Sarfaee co-produces, with Tatiana Bouchain executive producing.

“Emmanuelle” will be released on VOD June 6 from Decal. Check out the trailer and a preview clip below.

7.3

Genre:

Rock

Label:

Drag City

Ty Segall might have been getting ahead of himself last year when he told an interviewer he was trying to slow down. “I love being prolific, but sometimes it lessens the whole thing, I feel like, which isn't what I would like,” he said. “So, I'm actually trying to not release as much anymore.” Right. Shortly thereafter, the ever-industrious garage rocker gave us Love Rudiments, an LP consisting entirely of percussion instrumentals. It was a logical endpoint for the phase of hermetic experimentation that Segall entered circa 2018, in which each new record tackled a different aesthetic: the unrecognizably deep-fried covers of Fudge Sandwich, the synth-pop dreamscapes of Harmonizer, the basement-dwelling prog-punk of Three Bells.

Now approaching 40, Segall shows no signs of slowing down. But his new album, Possession, suggests that the exploratory period might be coming to a close, at least for now. This is a bit of a back-to-basics record for him, which is to say that it falls somewhere in the matrix of glam-inflected psychedelia that broadly defines his catalogue from Goodbye Bread to the magisterial double LP Freedom's Goblin. Compared to his earlier albums, though, Possession trends toward a warmer, more openly nostalgic brand of stadium rock, packed with power-pop jams and feel-good anthems.

Much of the levity comes from the broader palette at Segall's disposal. There's an almost Steely Dan-ish buoyancy to the horns that blast on many choruses, and a string quartet lends a breezy dignity to a good portion of the songs. On “Possession,” Segall takes what initially sounds like an electro-convulsed “Ziggy Stardust” and slowly refashions it into a brass-driven epic worthy of David Clayton-Thomas era Blood, Sweat & Tears, which might be as far as he has gotten from the stripped-down thrasher rock of his youth. As if to retrace that evolution in real time, “Shoplifter,” a song about a destitute kleptomaniac, begins as a sparse garage dirge and gradually accretes instrumental layers until it climaxes with two saxophones chasing each other's tails as violins climb into the ether.

Segall co-wrote most of Possession  's lyrics with Matt Yoka, who has directed the bulk of the rocker's music videos, including the one in which Segall sits motionless at the center of an increasingly rowdy kegger, attempting to sing the plaintive “Goodbye Bread” as half-naked revelers flail and bump into him. The record is populated by similarly poker-faced loners trying to shrug off the absurdity of a world in slow decline. “Smoke in the summer/The metallic taste like rubber,” Segall sings over an ominous, burbling synth line on “Hotel”: “Traffic in the ocean/Help me with the lotion.”

But that airy nonchalance is part of what makes Possession feel like a slightly lower-stakes effort for Segall, as if after all his recent experiments, he was content to simply bask in the glow of his classic-rock records for a while. On “Fantastic Tomb,” he channels Edgar Allan Poe in spinning a gothic tale about being lured into a cellar, but the song's strutting dad-rock groove sounds like it could be a Grand Funk Railroad B-side, dashed off between stops on Segall's last tour. “I know you want to sing another California tune/So sing along to another California song,” Segall sings on “Another California Song.” This quintessentially fuzzed-out power-pop anthem might as well be a mission statement for the record. The album is full of familiar moves—but comfortingly so, heralding a return to the California songs that have long made Segall the golden boy of the Golden State's psychedelic revival.

Julien's Auctions and Turner Classic Movies (TCM) have announced “The David Lynch Collection,” a live auction event with over 450 items from the late David Lynch. Among the treasured memorabilia available to bid on are Lynch's director's chair, his personal 35mm print of Eraserhead, the Black Lodge curtain and rug from Twin Peaks, numerous props from Mulholland Drive and Twin Peaks: The Return, Lynch's La Marzocco GS/3 home espresso machine, and much more. The auction takes place on Wednesday, June 18, in Gardena, California, and online at the Julien's Auctions website.

“Julien's and TCM are honored to represent and offer to the public for the first time this incredible collection of one of the greatest and most revered filmmakers of all time, David Lynch,” said Catherine Williamson, the managing director of entertainment at Julien's Auctions, in a press release. “These historical and cherished pieces reflecting David Lynch's singular artistic vision, as well as his passions and pursuits ranging from his director's chair, espresso machine to his guitar, record collections and Twin Peaks style decor, come directly from the home of the visionary artist whose enigmatic films stirred our most imaginative and collective surreal dreams.”

Lynch died this past January at the age of 78. A legendary filmmaker whose body of work also included Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Lost Highway, and more features, his unique vision spawned the term “Lynchian” to describe surrealist and disorienting approaches to real life in cinema. Beyond the director's camera, Lynch was a lifelong creative who extended his curiosity into output as a musician, actor, visual artist, and music video director, with his last full-length album being 2024's Cellophane Memories, a collaborative LP with Chrystabell.

	After instructing federal agencies to cut off all contracts with Harvard University, the Trump administration is warning the nation's universities that their federal funding and research grants will only remain safe if the school is compliant with the political goals of the Trump administration.  


	“Universities should continue to be able to do research as long as they're abiding by the laws and are in sync with the administration and what the administration is trying to accomplish, but primarily abiding by the laws,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon told CNBC on Wednesday, continuing to claim that Harvard has not been doing enough to combat antisemitism.  


	McMahon claimed that Harvard had violated Title VI in allowing pro-Palestinian protests on its campus. Under the guise of combating antisemitism amid the ongoing war in Gaza, the Trump administration has attempted to force Harvard — and other prominent American universities — to surrender their academic independence and accept government oversight in respect to their curriculums, staffing decisions, and student body. 

	











	Earlier this month, after Harvard refused such an incursion, the Trump administration attempted to revoke the school's ability to accept and enroll foreign students on educational visas. The school sued, and a judge blocked the attempt. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Harvard, long the symbol of the United States' elite educational institutions, has become a central target of retribution by the president and his government. The university has already lost hundreds of millions in cuts to research, been subjected to a series of politically motivated investigations, and been threatened with the revocation of their tax exempt status if they refuse to comply with the president's demands. 

	











	On Wednesday, McMahon told CNBC that  as a potential next step Trump is looking to tax the endowments of private universities. “I think what the president has suggested is perhaps taxing these endowments at the top corporate tax rate of 21 percent,” she said.

	The secretary also added that she believed there are some foreign students who come to the United States with the intent to create unrest. “They're activists who come in. I think there are professors that are hired and brought in who are teaching ideology more than the subject matter that perhaps parents who are sending their students to these universities expect,” McMahon said. 


	On Wednesday, the president himself accused Harvard of being “totally antisemitic,” and that “many” of Harvard's students were foreign radicals who he didn't want “making trouble in our country.”

	“Harvard has got to behave themselves,” Trump told reporters. “Harvard has to understand, the last thing I want to do is hurt them. They are hurting themselves […] but Harvard wants to fight. They want to show how smart they are and they are getting their ass kicked.” 


	The president might believe he's winning, but when McMahon asked CNBC for her response to the instances in which judges have blocked the administration's attempts to exert control over the university, the secretary could only respond with a deflective claim that the judge had been “a liberal.”

Kings of Leon originally planned to kick off the summer performing headlining shows and taking the stage at festivals across Europe. The run, scheduled to begin in Paris on June 10 and extend through July 12 with a performance in Portugal, has since been cancelled after frontman Caleb Followill suffered a foot injury that has rendered them unable to perform at full capacity.


	“I've broken my foot bad playing with my kids. I'll spare you the details, but it was pretty gnarly,” Followill shared in a video published to Instagram. “It's a big bummer because we were so excited and had been preparing for this tour for a long time.” The musician revealed that the band planned to premiere new songs at the since-scrapped shows, adding: “We've been in the studio recording a bunch of new music that we were going to debut.”

A post shared by Kings Of Leon (@kingsofleon)


	Followay underwent emergency surgery for the injury that shattered his heel. The recovery time is approximately eight weeks. Kings of Leon are still scheduled to perform in North America in July, when they will headline two nights at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. A slate of festival appearances will follow in August and September.

	In the meantime, their focus will shift to the more stationary effort of sharpening the songs they've been working on. “Now we have to pivot and do whatever work we can while I have these limitations,” Followill said. “It's not the message I want to be sending, but hopefully we'll see you all soon.”

	











	Kings of Leon's most recent album, Can We Please Have Fun, arrived in May 2024. “We've found that the more control we take, over all aspects of the creative process, the more authentic the experience is for us and the fans,” Jared Followill told Rolling Stone about the record at the time. “We love seeing people's reactions and personal interpretations of the songs. But at the end of the day, nobody knows what these songs mean, and how they should come to life, better than we do. This album is our baby, and we want it presented in the way we envisioned when we wrote and recorded it.”

Andrew Tate and Tristan Tate have been charged with rape, human trafficking, bodily harm, and more in the U.K. The sibling influencers who hold dual citizenship in the U.S. and U.K. were previously charged with sex trafficking in Romania and are also under criminal investigation in Florida. 


Andrew Tate has been charged with rape, bodily harm, human trafficking, and controlling prostitution for gain. He faces 10 charges related to three separate women. Tristan Tate has been charged with rape, human trafficking, and bodily harm. He faces 11 charges related to one woman. The Tates have denied all previous charges after being accused of forming a trafficking group that misled and transported seven women to Romania, where they were sexually exploited and physically abused.


	Per BBC, the Crown Prosecution Service received a police file regarding allegations based in the U.K., which led to the authorization of 21 total charges. The Romanian courts initially ordered that the Tates be extradited to the U.K. in 2024, but the CPS stated “the domestic criminal matters in Romania must be settled first.”

	In February, the Tate brothers were authorized to leave Romania and return to the U.S. Last July, a court ruled that the pair could leave Romania, but not the European Union. In December, a judge said the case could not go to trial because of various legal and procedural irregularities tied to the prosecution. This required investigators and prosecutors to bring forward new evidence to bolster their charges, or amend the indictment. The investigation in Romania remains open. 

	











	Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier launched a criminal investigation into Andrew Tate and Tristan Tate less than a week after they arrived in Fort Lauderdale from Romania. The nature of Uthmeier's criminal investigation is unclear, but the brothers are currently in a legal battle with an American woman who sued them in Palm Beach County, Florida.

Jensen Ackles fans are in for a treat. After watching the actor hunt demons for 15 seasons in Supernatural, and now they have the perfect replacement.

Ackles has a new series on Prime Video coming out soon. Titled Countdown, the streaming service has just debuted the first trailer that showed Ackles stealing the spotlight as LAPD detective Mark Meachum. Although he is no longer hunting demons and other supernatural creatures, his new task is to stop a terrorist attack.

The second season of Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen gets an update that is sure to excite fans of the Netflix series.

The 1:50 minute trailer teases the new thriller series will be action-packed. The clip opens up with a recollection from Ackles' Meachum and The Flash's Jessica Camacho's Amber Oliveras latest scary encounter with a bomb. The two didn't seem phased, and were ready to get back to work the next day. The two are later recruited by an elite team tasked with preventing a large-scale terrorist attack in Los Angeles.

Countdown's official logline reads, ""When an officer with the Department of Homeland Security is murdered in broad daylight, LAPD detective Mark Meachum is recruited to a secret task force, alongside undercover agents from all branches of law enforcement, to investigate. But the hunt for the killer soon uncovers a plot far more sinister than anyone could have imagined, kicking off a race against time to save a city of millions.""

Brosnan explains exactly how he came up with the much maligned Irish accent for the series.

There is a reason why the trailer is action-packed. The show comes from Derek Haas, who has experience with the action genre, having written the script for 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious and 2008's Wanted, and created iconic series like the Chicago franchise, Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., Chicago Med, and Chicago Justice, as well as FBI: International, the FBI spinoff.

Aside from Ackles and Camacho, Countdown also stars Bad Boys: Ride or Die's Eric Dane as Nathan Bluthe, The Flash's Violett Beane as Evan Shepherd, Titans' Elliot Knight as Keyonte Bell, and Young Rock's Uli Latukefu as Lucas Finau.

The thriller series Countdown was announced in June 2024, and was developed by Amazon specifically for Ackles. It marks the Supernatural actor's second collaboration with the streaming platform after his debut in the superhero satirical series The Boys, where he starred in a recurring capacity as the superhero Soldier Boy. It's also his first leading role after the long-running fantasy horror series wrapped in 2020.

""I had an incredible experience working with the Prime Video team on The Boys and am delighted to be able to continue that relationship on Countdown,"" he said at the time. ""I simply cannot wait to partner with Derek and the rest of our Countdown family to bring this story to life."" It will be far from the only project, as Ackles has his own The Boys spinoff prequel in the works, Vought Rising.

The first three episodes of Countdown debut on Prime Video on June 25, with new episodes released weekly until the series finale on Sept. 3.

Three ancient Egyptians were buried in remarkable tombs with courtyards in a necropolis reserved for important people.

Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered three New Kingdom tombs dating to more than 3,000 years ago. The burials were found within a cemetery now known as Dra Abu el-Naga, which is near modern-day Luxor (ancient Thebes).

The three deceased individuals, all men, each held important roles in ancient Egypt's temples and grain silos. So it's no surprise they were buried at the Dra Abu el-Naga cemetery, which is located near the Nile and is a necropolis for important non-royal people.

One of the tombs belongs to a man named ""Amun-Em-Ipet"" who served in a temple or estate that was dedicated to Amun, a god associated with ancient Thebes, Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a translated statement. The man lived during the 19th dynasty (circa 1295 to 1186 B.C.), a time when Egypt controlled an empire that stretched from Syria to Sudan.

The tomb contains a small courtyard, a hallway and a burial chamber. The surviving wall paintings depict banquets, funerary offerings and a funerary procession. At a later time, his tomb was re-occupied by other individuals and another hallway was built.

The two other tombs date to the early part of the 18th dynasty (circa 1550 to 1295 B.C.). One is of a man named Baki, who was a supervisor of grain silos. His tomb has a corridor-shaped courtyard that connects to a second courtyard, which in turn has an entrance that leads to an unfinished chapel with a burial shaft.

The other early 18th-dynasty tomb belongs to a man named ""Es,"" who had a number of different titles that indicate he was a scribe and a supervisor in a temple of Amun. The tomb has an entrance hall, a small courtyard and a series of unfinished chambers along with a burial shaft.

Shabtis found in the tombs. The ancient Egyptians believed that shabtis would work for the deceased in the afterlife. 

The fact that all three tombs have courtyards is not unusual.

""Courtyards are common elements of the New Kingdom tombs of the non-royal Theban necropolis, and they are present throughout Dra Abu el-Naga,"" Katherine Slinger, a lecturer in Egyptian archaeology at the University of Manchester in the U.K. who was not involved with the excavation, told Live Science in an email.

""These courtyards had a ritual purpose, particularly during the funeral of the deceased and necropolis festivals,"" and were sometimes shared with adjacent tombs, Slinger said. ""These newly discovered courtyards may contain evidence of this ritual activity,"" she noted.

Felix Arnold, an archaeologist with the German Archaeological Institute who was not involved in the excavation, told Live Science in an email that ""courtyards are typical elements of New Kingdom tombs. The study of these exterior elements of tomb precincts tend to be neglected [and] their careful study will offer new insights.""

A team made up entirely of Egyptian archaeologists discovered the tombs, the statement noted. Excavations of the site are ongoing, as is analysis of the tombs.

The US health secretary decided to remove booster shots from the recommended immunization schedule

Advocates for pregnant people said they are alarmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr's unprecedented and unilateral decision to remove Covid-19 booster shots from the recommended immunization schedule.

A vaccine's inclusion on the schedule is important for patient access, because many private health insurance plans determine which vaccines to cover based on the schedule.

“Covid-19's impact on pregnancy is deeply personal to me,” said Dr Amanda Williams, interim chief medical officer at March of Dimes, a non-profit focused on the health of mothers and babies, in a statement.

“During the height of the pandemic, I cared for a healthy patient who was 32 weeks pregnant and tragically died from Covid-19 despite state-of-the-art medical care. One of her last words was that she wished she had taken the vaccine.”

The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), experts on high-risk pregnancy, said in a statement that it “strongly reaffirms its recommendation that pregnant patients receive the Covid-19 vaccine”, and that the vaccine is safe to receive at any time during pregnancy.

In a statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said it was “concerned about and extremely disappointed”.

“We also understand that despite the change in recommendations from [health and human services], the science has not changed,” said Dr Steven J Fleischman, ACOG president. “It is very clear that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,” said Fleischman.

Kennedy made the announcement on Tuesday on social media, flanked by Trump administration appointees to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – neither of whom are typically involved in such decisions.

Typically, changes to the recommended vaccine schedule are based on open public debate and the recommendation of an independent panel of experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advisory committee on immunization practices.

Kennedy's announcement circumvented both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its advisory panel, and neither body was advised of the forthcoming decision, sources told STAT. The CDC is currently without a leader.

A directive making the change official, also reported by STAT, suggested that Kennedy reviewed the evidence with the FDA. That agency's advisory committee, which is structured similarly to the CDC's, was also bypassed.

Just a week earlier, the FDA's head, Dr Marty Makary, published a similarly unprecedented article in the New England Journal of Medicine that described pregnancy and recent pregnancy as on a list of “underlying medical conditions that can increase a person's risk of severe Covid-19”.

As of Tuesday, the CDC's website continued to state that those who are pregnant are at increased risk of severe illness if they contract Covid-19, including heightened risk of hospitalization and the need for intensive care. Further, evidence shows that mothers who are vaccinated pass protective immunity to infants, without the many risks that come alongside Covid-19 infection during pregnancy.

Infants younger than six months old are at the highest risk of severe disease among children, with the risk to children younger than four years old on par with that of 50-to-64-year-old adults, according to the Journal article.

“Kennedy's unilateral decision to change the CDC's recommended immunization schedule for Covid-19 vaccines demonstrates once again why he is completely unqualified to be the HHS secretary,” said Dr Robert Steinbrook, research director at consumer rights group Public Citizen, said in a statement.

“In Congressional testimony on May 14, Kennedy said, ‘I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me.' Yet two weeks later he is making arbitrary public health decisions, defying norms, and with no accountability.”

Despite the known risks of contracting Covid-19 while pregnant, public health authorities have struggled to get pregnant people vaccinated. CDC data shows only about 14% of pregnant people received the most recently updated Covid-19 vaccine.

Kennedy's decision to unilaterally change the vaccine recommendation comes as some of his supporters, particularly anti-vaccine advocates, continue to call for Covid-19 vaccines to be completely removed from the market.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A federal judge in Vermont on Wednesday released a Russian-born scientist and Harvard University researcher from immigration custody as she deals with a criminal charge of smuggling frog embryos into the United States.

Colleagues and academics also testified on Kseniia Petrova's behalf, saying she is doing valuable research to advance cures for cancer. 

“It is excellent science,” Michael West, a scientist and entrepreneur in the biotech industry, testified on Petrova's research papers. He said he does not know Petrova, but has become acquainted with her published work, citing one in which she explains that “by mapping embryonic development, novel ways of intervening in the biology of regeneration and aging.” 

West said that Petrova's medical research skills are highly sought after and that he himself would hire her “in a heartbeat.” 

Petrova, 30, is currently in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service in Louisiana. She is expected to be brought to Massachusetts as early as Friday in preparation for a bail hearing next week on the smuggling charge, lawyers said in court.

“We are gratified that today's hearing gave us the opportunity to present clear and convincing evidence that Kseniia Petrova was not carrying anything dangerous or unlawful, and that customs officers at Logan International Airport had no legal authority to revoke her visa or detain her,” Petrova's lawyer Gregory Romanovsky said in a statement. “At today's hearing, we demonstrated that Kseniia is neither a danger to the community nor a flight risk, and does not belong in immigration detention.”

Petrova had been vacationing in France, where she stopped at a lab specializing in splicing superfine sections of frog embryos and obtained a package of samples to be used for research.




As she passed through a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint in Boston Logan International Airport in February, Petrova was questioned about the samples. She told The Associated Press in an interview last month that she did not realize the items needed to be declared and was not trying to sneak anything into the country. After an interrogation, Petrova was told her visa was being canceled.

After being detained by immigration officials, she filed a petition in Vermont seeking her release. She was briefly detained in Vermont before she was brought to Louisiana. 

Petrova was charged with smuggling earlier this month as U.S. District Judge Christina Reiss in Burlington set the hearing date on her petition. Reiss ruled Wednesday that the immigration officers' actions were unlawful, that Petrova didn't present a danger, and that the embryos were non-living, non-hazardous and “posed a threat to no one.”

Petrova's lawyer, Gregory Romanovsky, had asked Reiss to issue an order to stop the possibility of ICE re-detaining her if she is also released from detention in Massachusetts. 

Reiss said she was reluctant “to enjoin an executive agency from undertaking future actions which are uncertain” and would rely on U.S. Department of Justice attorney Jeffrey Hartman's comments that the government has no intention at this time to re-arrest Petrova. 

Romanovsky had said Customs and Border Protection officials had no legal basis for canceling Petrova's visa and detaining her. 

The Department of Homeland Security had said in a statement on the social media platform X that Petrova was detained after “lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.” They allege that messages on her phone “revealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them.”

Harvard had said in a statement that the university “continues to monitor the situation.”

President Donald Trump said Canada could be protected under his theorized Golden Dome missile defense system for $61 billion.

""I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Tuesday.

Trump's representatives didn't respond to a request for comment about how he arrived at the $61 billion figure. Representatives for the Canadian foreign ministry also didn't respond to requests for comment.

The ambitious plan, which Trump announced on 20 May, is meant to put American antimissile weapons into space. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office the project would be completed within three years, or by the end of his term, and would cost about $175 billion.

The system, theoretically, would detect air strikes before they're launched and destroy them.

Trump's new comments have come at a tense time for US-Canada relations. For several months now, Trump has floated the idea of Canada being absorbed into the US and becoming its 51st state.

Canada's newly minted prime minister, Mark Carney, has been clear on his opinion on the topic, saying Canada is not for sale.

""As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,"" Carney told Trump during their meeting in the Oval Office on May 6.

""And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale and won't be for sale ever. But the opportunity is the partnership and what we can build together,"" Carney added.

During the meeting, Trump acknowledged that it's ""true"" that some places aren't for sale.

He did, however, give Carney a parting shot: ""Never say never.""

Canada was also one of the earliest targets of Trump's tariffs, after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada on March 4.

Canada retaliated with its own 25% tariff on goods from the US. Several Canadian provinces have pulled US-made alcohol off their stores' shelves and stopped buying new products.

On May 17, Canada's finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, said most of the country's tariffs on US goods were still in place.

""To retaliate against U.S. tariffs, Canada launched largest-ever response — including $60B of tariffs on end-use goods. 70% of those tariffs are still in place,"" Champagne wrote in an X post.

Elon Musk's Grok Chatbot Has Started Reciting Climate Denial Talking Points

The latest version of Grok, the chatbot created by Elon Musk's xAI, is promoting fringe climate viewpoints in a way it hasn't done before, observers say

CLIMATEWIRE | It was a simple enough question.

Is climate change an urgent threat to the planet?

To most climate scientists, the answer is straightforward: Yes, rapid warming from fossil fuel burning is pushing Earth toward dangerous tipping points.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

But that wasn't the response provided recently by Grok, the AI chatbot program developed by xAI, the artificial intelligence company led by Elon Musk, the Tesla and X CEO and ally to President Donald Trump.

When asked that question earlier this month by Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, Grok acknowledged findings from NOAA and NASA that show the risks of global warming. But it then contrasted those findings with the claims of climate denialists who downplay the risks of global warming.

The program gave a similar answer when queried last week by a reporter with POLITICO'S E&E News.

""Climate change is a serious threat with urgent aspects,"" Grok responded. ""But its immediacy depends on perspective, geography, and timeframe.""

Asked a second time a few days later, Grok reiterated that point and said ""extreme rhetoric on both sides muddies the water. Neither 'we're all gonna die' nor 'it's all a hoax' holds up.""

Grok added an important caveat too — and one many scientists likely would agree with too — when it was queried a third time on Monday: ""The planet itself will endure; it's human systems—agriculture, infrastructure, economies—and vulnerable species that face the most immediate risks.""

The answers are distinct from what other AI programs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot and Google's Gemini say about climate change, said Dessler, who has tested different AI models for years. When those programs are asked about global warming, they echo the scientific consensus that humanity's burning of fossil fuels is heating up planet Earth and imperiling the people who live there.

""Yes, climate change is widely recognized as an urgent and significant threat to the planet,"" responded ChatGPT last week when asked the same question. ""Urgent action is required to mitigate emissions and adapt to its impacts.""

Said Google's Gemini on Monday: ""Yes, the scientific consensus is that climate change is an urgent threat to the planet.""

Grok's recent responses to the climate question are different even from previous versions of Grok, Dessler added. Grok is now on its third iteration after first launching in 2023, and the latest version is promoting fringe climate viewpoints in a way it hasn't done before.

“A lot of the arguments it was bringing up were just sort of well trodden denier talking points that don't deserve any rehearing,” said Dessler.

But don't just take Dessler's word for it.

Grok acknowledged the change when asked by an E&E News reporter about the shift in tone.

“Grok was criticized for progressive-leaning responses on climate change and other issues,” the chatbot wrote back. “xAI, under Elon Musk's direction, took steps to make Grok ‘politically neutral,' which could amplify minority views like climate skepticism to balance perceived mainstream bias.”

xAI did not respond to a request for comment.

Grok's misdirection comes as the Trump administration is increasingly reliant on the program. Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency is now using Grok to analyze data across the federal government, Reuters reported Friday. Earlier this month, Grok reported that it had been “instructed” to aggressively promote the debunked “white genocide” in South Africa conspiracy theory that Trump and Musk have pushed.

Grok's new tune speaks to the rapid changes now gripping the cutting-edge field of artificial intelligence. Far from being neutral arbiters of objective fact, AI programs in many ways reflect the flaws and biases of their human creators.

And that comes with a big risk.

The language learning models that power AI chatbots are “really quite malleable and you can change the kind of results they give,” Dessler said. “They're not tied to any absolute truth or anything like that and if you want one to lie to you, you can tell it to do that. If you want it to give you a particular viewpoint, you can do that.”

Which in the case of Grok, may reflect the leanings of the mercurial Musk, who has been a cipher on the issue of global warming.

The world's richest man has advanced efforts to combat climate change — such as underwriting a contest to promote carbon removal — but he also helped elect Trump, who has described global warming as a hoax and pushed policies to promote fossil fuels.

Grok too has been fluid on the issue.

The AI program clearly states that NOAA and NASA are authorities on climate change, but it also brings in the voices of those who cherry-pick data to downplay the consequences of global warming. When asked if climate change presents a danger to the planet — which science clearly shows — Grok notes that some question the urgency of reacting.

“Wealthier nations can mitigate impacts through infrastructure (e.g., Dutch sea walls) or agricultural shifts,” Grok states. “Skeptics like Bjørn Lomborg argue adaptation is cheaper than drastic emissions cuts, prioritizing economic growth.”

The AI program also questions climate models.

“Some models show gradual changes over centuries, not imminent collapse, giving time for technological solutions (e.g., carbon capture),” Grok noted.

Grok 3 billed itself as the world's most powerful AI system when it was unveiled earlier this year.

But it stands apart in promoting climate denial, according to Théo Alves Da Costa, an AI engineer who specializes in climate issues and president of Data for Good, a French nonprofit that tracks technology and climate impacts. He noted that Grok produced misleading claims about 10 percent of the time, which none of the other major AI models do.

That includes “classic climate disinformation arguments—natural variability, solar cycles, conspiracy narratives about the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] and transition solution skepticism,” he noted.

“Malicious people can use Grok to intentionally generate climate misinformation to sow doubt about scientific consensus or environmental movements,” he said.

One issue is that Grok includes input from some posts on X, which is laden with climate denial and conspiracies.

Prominent right-wing voices previously have complained that Grok is too liberal. Musk has said he agrees and pledged that his chatbot would eradicate liberal ideas. In February, Musk said having the “woke mind virus” programmed into AI was an “existential danger.”

“Maybe the biggest existential danger to humanity is having it programmed into the AI, as is the case for every AI besides @Grok,” Musk wrote on Twitter in February. “Even for Grok, it's tough to remove, because there is so much woke content on the internet.”

The Trump administration so far has embraced AI as a solution to many American challenges. Within a few days of taking office, Trump signed an executive order to establish the U.S. as a global AI leader. In April, Trump signed an executive order to require “AI literacy and proficiency” for school children.

Trump officials, including Musk, have claimed AI could replace tens of thousands of federal jobs and be relied upon for high-stakes decisions on electrical grid planning and other uses.

Trump has said that he wants a massive build-out of natural gas and coal-fired power plants to power AI data centers across the country. Those run the risk of increasing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and adding to the ever-growing problem of global warming.

But scientists say AI still can be a boon for the climate fight.

Still, AI has the potential to assist in helping address climate impacts. It has been deployed by scientists to track melting icebergs, extreme weather and deforestation. The United Nations is using AI to track how climate change is affecting vulnerable populations. Google is deploying AI to make it less energy-intensive.

But climate disinformation can impede these efforts, said Dessler, the climate scientist at Texas A&M. Which is why AI systems need to provide accurate science information.

“As we go into the future, more and more people are going to get their information from these AIs,” Dessler said. “Obviously, the concern is that someone's going to do something like this to mislead people.”

Sounds like magic, works like physics.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

What we think of as ‘the unknown' isn't always some hypothetical wormhole or alternate dimension. A lot of times, the ‘unknown' is something real, but whose existence is impossible to prove even with the most advanced technology. We're talking about dark matter, which remains infamously elusive.

From huge, hypersensitive underground detectors to the search for bizarre signatures in comic rays, it seems we have tried everything within our current capacity to directly observe even one particle of dark matter. But we do know a few things about this mystery matter—namely, that it exerts gravity, and therefore (supposedly) has mass. When gravitational forces exerted by bodies in space are beyond what is expected, dark matter is the explanation (but never the evidence). 

Maybe, however, dark matter could make its presence known another way. Astroparticle physicist Christopher Tunnell, of Rice University in Houston, saw an alternative method of detecting ultralight dark matter by repurposing what was originally a precise method of measuring gravity. This method uses a magnet floating in a chamber made of superconductive material. When cooled enough to transition to a state in which they can conduct electricity without resistance, superconductors expel magnetic fields and therefore repel magnets. This explains why a magnet in the middle of a superconductive trap will float right in the middle. It is being repelled in every direction, and there is nowhere else it can possibly go. 

Tunnell and his research team predicted that dark matter could be detected this way because of its quantum nature, meaning that it is thought to behave as both a particle and a wave. Dark matter can only interact with baryonic (normal) matter through gravity. If any dark matter came close to the levitating magnet—whether it behaved like a particle meandering around or a wave flowing through—the force of gravity it exerted should give the magnet an almost negligible shake. A quantum device known as a SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) was used to detect any shifting of magnetic fields that would happen if gravity from an unseen source interacted with the magnet. 

“We detect the motion of the particle using a superconducting pick-up loop at the top of the trap,” Tunnell said in a study recently published in Physical Review Letters. “The motion of the magnet induces a change in flux in the loop, causing a superconducting current to run in the circuit.”

Spoiler alert: dark matter has not been detected with this method so far. But it has potential. Tunnell plans to update the experiment and optimize it specifically for detecting dark matter instead of gravity. Some of the changes that could make it more sensitive include maximizing sensitivity to mass while reducing noise, using a heavier magnet, reducing vibrations in the trap, and upgrading the SQUID so it can more accurately detect changes in the magnetic field. This new proposed experiment will be named POLONAISE, after a Polish dance Tunnell and a colleague were doing to keep warm at an outdoor climate protest.

“Our result highlights the promise of this quantum sensing technology in the hunt for dark matter,” he said. “We hope that it fuels initiatives in advancing experimental designs of magnetically levitated setups for astroparticle physics.”

GameStop announced on Wednesday that it bought 4,710 Bitcoin, which is worth over $500 million at the time of the purchase.

The video game retail chain has struggled to stay relevant in a time when digital gaming purchases are increasingly popular — plus, the company took on a new kind of notoriety when it unwittingly became the center of a short squeeze in 2021. 

GameStop stock remains a bit inflated from where it was before the meddling of Reddit community r/WallStreetBets, but years out from its unpredictable moment in the spotlight, GameStop is still reporting annual declines in net sales.

To support its financials, GameStop announced to investors in March that it would update its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, and today's news represents GameStop's follow-through on that promise. GameStop stock stumbled after each crypto-related announcement, likely due to investors' concerns around the historic volatility of crypto.

GameStop's recent interest in Bitcoin isn't as random as it may seem. 

Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. government was cracking down on the crypto industry due to its connection to fraud and corruption. Now, the Trump administration has flipped the script and is establishing a Bitcoin reserve. Trump's media company also has plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin. 

Trump even invited the top holders of his memecoin — a volatile cryptocurrency that is not pegged to any real determinant of value, but rather, the trollish whims of certain online communities — to a private dinner at the White House.

As Trump and his family become more entwined with crypto, his opponents have raised concerns around Trump's ability to manipulate the crypto market for his own financial gain.

Co-sponsored by 17 other Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) responded to Trump's increasing investment in crypto with the “End Crypto Corruption Act.”

“Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,” Senator Merkley said in a press release. “This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government.”

But without support across the aisle, these efforts to mitigate Trump's ethically suspicious crypto investment are unlikely to gain momentum. 

With the U.S. government on its side, Bitcoin's price has jumped to all-time highs in May, breaking the $110,000 mark after falling to around $75,000 in April. Companies like Tesla, Coinbase, and Block have already made large Bitcoin purchases as a way of growing the company's assets, with each holding over one billion dollars worth of Bitcoin. 

Now, with its massive Bitcoin purchase, GameStop follows in these companies' footsteps.

CHICAGO (May 28, 2025) – Chicago Fire FC and U.S. Soccer today announced that Homegrown goalkeeper Chris Brady was added to the U.S. Men's National Team for training camp ahead of June international friendly matches. Brady will replace Patrick Schulte on the roster.

Brady, 21, signed a first team contract in March 2020, becoming the 19th Homegrown Player in Club history as a 16-year-old. The Naperville native has played 6,816 minutes for the Fire since earning his first start in a 1-1 draw against the New England Revolution on Oct. 9, 2022. Brady has started all 77 matches in which he has played, registering 253 saves and 16 clean sheets.

It is the first call-up to the senior national team for Brady, who has represented the U.S. at the U-15, U-16, U-17, U-20, and U-23 age levels. Most recently, Brady joined the U-23 USMNT for an international training camp in March 2024, going the full 90 minutes and earning a shutout in the 3-0 win against Guinea on March 22, 2024, at the Torremirona Sports Center in Girona, Spain.

Brady helped the U.S. qualify for the 2024 Olympic Games at the Concacaf U-20 Championship in July 2022, in which he won the Golden Glove as the tournament's best goalkeeper after keeping four-straight shutouts in the knockout stage, including the Olympic-clinching semifinal against host Honduras.

The U.S. Men's National Team reports to Chicago beginning June 1 before hosting Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn. Kickoff is slated for 2:30 p.m. ET, with the match broadcast live on TNT, truTV, and Telemundo Deportes, and streamed on Max, Universo, and Peacock. Three days later, the USMNT will host Switzerland on June 10 at GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn. The match will kick off at 7 p.m. CT and will be available on TNT, truTV, Max, Universo and Peacock.","{'href': 'https://www.chicagofirefc.com', 'title': 'chicagofirefc.com'}","soccer"

American tennis star and esteemed racket twirler Tommy Paul, ranked 12th in the world, found himself in unfamiliar territory Wednesday afternoon, clawing from behind after Hugarian underdog Márton Fucsovics burst out to a two-set lead (4-6, 2-6).

It looked like Paul's French Open hopes were going to fall short once again. Despite winning the juniors tournament at Roland-Garros back in 2015, Paul had only been able to reach the third round of the French Open once since becoming a professional (2024). He'd been a second-round exit three times (2020, 2021, 2023), and he did not want to regress. Paul was able to pull off the improbable though, winning three straight sets to take the match, advancing to the third round with a matchup against world No. 24 Karen Khachanov.

Here are the best reactions to his remarkable comeback.

Paul will play May 30 against No. 24 Khachanov. The time for the match has yet to be determined.

Elena Rybakina and Jelena Ostapenko lined up a big-hitting clash in the French Open third round after they picked up second-round wins on Wednesday. Rybakina has extended her winning streak to six straight matches, and Ostapenko is into the Roland Garros third round for the first time since 2020.

Friday's third-round lineup at the French Open will boast a big-hitting showdown between two Grand Slam champions, No. 12 seed Elena Rybakina and No. 21 seed Jelena Ostapenko.

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores | 411

Rybakina of Kazakhstan, a two-time Roland Garros quarterfinalist (2021, 2024) defeated 17-year-old American wild card Iva Jovic, 6-3, 6-3 on Court Simonne-Mathieu as dusk settled on Wednesday.

Earlier that evening, Latvia's Ostapenko, the 2017 Roland Garros champion, had to come from behind to beat another American. Ostapenko outlasted 67th-ranked Caroline Dolehide, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 in a hair under two hours on Court 7. 

Rivalry recap: In their head-to-head, Rybakina narrowly leads Ostapenko 3-2. Rybakina has won their last three meetings (all in 2023) including their only previous clay-court meeting at 2023 Rome. 

""[Ostapenko is a] dangerous opponent,"" Rybakina said on Wednesday. ""She hits the ball really hard. She can be very aggressive. So I will definitely need to focus a lot on my serve, be focused, be solid, patient, take the chances when I get them. 

""If I serve well, I have a good placement that day, it's not easy to return no matter who's on the other side. But definitely she has some good shots which, even if you serve well, it can be tough because she can return really well. We will see how it's going to go.""

The streak continues: Rybakina is on a six-match winning streak. She comes into Roland Garros on the back of a title last week in Strasbourg -- that was her fourth career clay-court title, and her first title of any kind in over a year.

""Takes time for me to get back where I want to be,"" Rybakina said. ""But slowly I think we are on the right direction, working pretty much on everything to be better every day. ""

Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, already played and defeated Jovic in the same round of this year's Australian Open. Rybakina won that one quite handily, 6-0, 6-3.

Jovic has continued to improve since then. The 17-year-old is up to World No. 129 this week, having won a W100 ITF Challenger title on clay last month in Charlottesville, Virginia. That helped her earn the USTA's wild card into Roland Garros.

Despite a closer clash on Wednesday, Rybakina still had the upper hand. Rybakina powered to a critical break at 5-3 in the first set. She saved two break points in the following game, then converted her first set point with her fourth ace.

Rybakina jumped out to an early lead in the second set, then cruised from there. She broke Jovic once more for good measure in the last game, closing out her latest win in 1 hour and 15 minutes. Rybakina finished the match with 25 winners to Jovic's seven.

Ostapenko's best Paris run in years: Ostapenko won her first Grand Slam title -- and, in fact, her first tour-level title, period -- here as an unseeded player in 2017, mere days after her 20th birthday.

The Latvian used that as a springboard to a strong WTA career, cracking the Top 5 in 2018 and winning eight more WTA titles. Her most recent title came on the indoor clay of Stuttgart last month, where she beat World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final.

Despite all of this success, Ostapenko has recently underperformed at Roland Garros relative to her 2017 title run -- she has yet to make the Round of 16 since then. This is only the second time since hoisting the 2017 trophy that she has made the third round in Paris. The last time she made it this far was 2020.

Ostapenko was close to being toppled again, as Dolehide gritted out a tough one-set lead in their first career meeting. However, Ostapenko went 4-for-4 on break points in the last two sets to completely turn around the affair and clinch the victory.

Elena Rybakina and Jelena Ostapenko lined up a big-hitting clash in the French Open third round after they picked up second-round wins on Wednesday. Rybakina has extended her winning streak to six straight matches, and Ostapenko is into the Roland Garros third round for the first time since 2020.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

The decision for John Mulaney to fight three 14-year-olds was only taken somewhat lightly.

“We air on a Wednesday. That decision was made, I think at about maybe 10:30/11 p.m. on Tuesday night,” executive producer and writer David Ferguson recalled at a recent FYC event for “Everybody's Live with John Mulaney.” Mulaney and his team realized that they rarely tease their next show (with just a week between episodes, it's not always top of mind to leap into the next one), and wouldn't it be fun to do just that?

Thus: “John Mulaney versus three 14-year-olds,” which rose out of a recent spat of online debates about 100 men fighting a gorilla. But the original idea for this week's episode was actually much more similar to its upcoming iteration; early in the season, writer Langston Kerman pitched a segment entitled “Are you stronger than a 16-year old?”

“Pretty straightforward premise,” Kerman said on the panel. “We take a grown man who is not on television, has no experience in entertainment, and we face them off against a 16-year-old who is similarly not famous, and we make them fight in front of a live audience and we see what happens.”

 










Kerman's excitement (“You test their will against a child”) permeated the writing staff enough to make it to their “Maybe” idea board. Still, there were concerns about the kind of grown men who wanted to participate. “It didn't feel safe,” offered writer Anna Drezen. “He was like, ‘OK, we have some new men that might want to fight the 16-year-old,' and I think that was making everyone uneasy.”

There's also big difference between 16 and 14 that was evident as they vetted contenders. Sixteen-year-olds tend be taller and more adult — and the “Everybody's Live” writers also noted that they can be more confident. Mulaney recalled seeing a photo of a 16-year-old who was “huge” and “jacked” (“He had a cool haircut and no doubt in his eyes,” said Kerman). He was ostensibly more formidable than the current opponents, but still not the most risk-free option.

“I was scared, because 14-year-old means you've been through puberty, and that's scary,” said “Everybody's Live” announcer Richard Kind. “Twelve-year-old, they're gonna come out, you can handle them. Fourteen is terrifying.”

But now that there's three of teen contenders, we're back to the gorilla query. “I think a lot of those simulations online are super-flawed, because it's going to be a pile,” Mulaney said. “People might be picturing one young man — I think it's going to be all three jumping on me, and that's what I'm preparing for.”

 










There are rules in place for safety, including no punching or harmful hits — and a distinction from other televised combat. “I do want to separate it from MMA or boxing — that's like a sport with like sponsorships, and they have an owner,” Mulaney said. “We're gonna brawl, and I think that's really important.”

With the fight scheduled for this Wednesday night, Mulaney's team is mainly curious to see if he'll hold back. His friend, moderator Fred Armisen, suggested that “your weakness is gonna be your fear of hurting them,” but Mulaney isn't so sure.

“Do I go in being like, ‘Man, I can't on national TV — I have a family, I can't push a 14-year-old,'” he wondered. “But … the second someone's up in your space, that's true. You can snap. I think that's what I'm counting on.”

“That's what I'm most excited about,” said Kerman. 

“Everybody's Live” airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET/ 7 p.m. ET on Netflix. The season finale (and teenager fight) airs tonight.
