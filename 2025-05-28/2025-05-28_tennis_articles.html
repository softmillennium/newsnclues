                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American tennis star and esteemed racket twirler Tommy Paul, ranked 12th in the world, found himself in unfamiliar territory Wednesday afternoon, clawing from behind after Hugarian underdog Márton Fucsovics burst out to a two-set lead (4-6, 2-6). It looked like Paul's French Open hopes were going to fall short once again. Despite winning the juniors tournament at Roland-Garros back in 2015, Paul had only been able to reach the third round of the French Open once since becoming a professional (2024). He'd been a second-round exit three times (2020, 2021, 2023), and he did not want to regress. Paul was able to pull off the improbable though, winning three straight sets to take the match, advancing to the third round with a matchup against world No. 24 Karen Khachanov. Here are the best reactions to his remarkable comeback. Paul will play May 30 against No. The time for the match has yet to be determined.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elena Rybakina and Jelena Ostapenko lined up a big-hitting clash in the French Open third round after they picked up second-round wins on Wednesday. Rybakina has extended her winning streak to six straight matches, and Ostapenko is into the Roland Garros third round for the first time since 2020. Friday's third-round lineup at the French Open will boast a big-hitting showdown between two Grand Slam champions, No. Rybakina of Kazakhstan, a two-time Roland Garros quarterfinalist (2021, 2024) defeated 17-year-old American wild card Iva Jovic, 6-3, 6-3 on Court Simonne-Mathieu as dusk settled on Wednesday. Ostapenko outlasted 67th-ranked Caroline Dolehide, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 in a hair under two hours on Court 7. Rivalry recap: In their head-to-head, Rybakina narrowly leads Ostapenko 3-2. "[Ostapenko is a] dangerous opponent," Rybakina said on Wednesday. So I will definitely need to focus a lot on my serve, be focused, be solid, patient, take the chances when I get them. "If I serve well, I have a good placement that day, it's not easy to return no matter who's on the other side. But definitely she has some good shots which, even if you serve well, it can be tough because she can return really well. She comes into Roland Garros on the back of a title last week in Strasbourg -- that was her fourth career clay-court title, and her first title of any kind in over a year. 129 this week, having won a W100 ITF Challenger title on clay last month in Charlottesville, Virginia. That helped her earn the USTA's wild card into Roland Garros. Despite a closer clash on Wednesday, Rybakina still had the upper hand. Rybakina powered to a critical break at 5-3 in the first set. Rybakina jumped out to an early lead in the second set, then cruised from there. She broke Jovic once more for good measure in the last game, closing out her latest win in 1 hour and 15 minutes. Rybakina finished the match with 25 winners to Jovic's seven. Ostapenko's best Paris run in years: Ostapenko won her first Grand Slam title -- and, in fact, her first tour-level title, period -- here as an unseeded player in 2017, mere days after her 20th birthday. The Latvian used that as a springboard to a strong WTA career, cracking the Top 5 in 2018 and winning eight more WTA titles. Her most recent title came on the indoor clay of Stuttgart last month, where she beat World No. Despite all of this success, Ostapenko has recently underperformed at Roland Garros relative to her 2017 title run -- she has yet to make the Round of 16 since then. The last time she made it this far was 2020. Ostapenko was close to being toppled again, as Dolehide gritted out a tough one-set lead in their first career meeting. Elena Rybakina and Jelena Ostapenko lined up a big-hitting clash in the French Open third round after they picked up second-round wins on Wednesday. Rybakina has extended her winning streak to six straight matches, and Ostapenko is into the Roland Garros third round for the first time since 2020.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lorenzo Musetti has wasted little time sending out a statement that he means business at Roland Garros. Musetti converted six of 12 break points he earned, according to Infosys Stats, to wrap a two-hour, six-minute triumph and build impressively on his opening 7-5, 6-2, 6-0 triumph against Yannick Hanfmann. “Honestly today was not easy to play because of the wind,” said Musetti. During that period, his achievements include winning a bronze medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics and reaching at least the semi-finals at all three clay ATP Masters 1000 events in 2025, including a championship-match run in Monte-Carlo. Musetti has suffered plenty of heartache at Roland Garros, where he has only lost to Novak Djokovic (twice), Stefanos Tsitsipas and Carlos Alcaraz. A year later, he also led then-World No. 4 Tsitsipas by two sets before falling to a first-round defeat, while his 2024 third-round loss to Djokovic also came in five sets. Yet Musetti has never been better placed to atone for these past disappointments. He is also unlikely to fear anyone in his section of the draw, despite the presence of some high-quality rivals. Should he defeat Mariano Navone next, Musetti is seeded to meet 10th seed Holger Rune, the Barcelona champion, in the fourth round. “It's been a tremendous clay season so far, but the ambitions now are higher and of course here I never reached more than the fourth round,” said Musetti, who is competing at a career-high No. “Hopefully this year will be the year, and the mentality is to try and beat everyone… I have the chance to play against everyone here, and hopefully I will take these chances.” Musetti's next opponent Navone booked his third-round spot by defeating Reilly Opelka 6-1, 7-6(1), 6-3, while 2023 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Hamad Medjedovic also advanced on Wednesday lunchtime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain's Emma Raducanu beaten by four-time French Open winner Iga Swiatek at Roland-Garros; Follow scores and reports from Roland-Garros on Sky Sports' digital platforms; You can watch the ATP and WTA on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app Emma Raducanu has been knocked out of the French Open at the second-round stage as defending champion and four-time winner Iga Swiatek proved too powerful in a 6-1 6-2 victory in Paris. Despite a promising and competitive start to proceedings, the first set raced away from Raducanu when Swiatek turned up her power game to register two breaks and a 5-1 lead, serving the set out for a comprehensive success in the end. Swiatek broke Raducanu early into the second set, but the Brit missed the chance to hit straight back by failing to take three break-point chances after a couple of Swaitek double faults. Instead, Swiatek registered a nervy hold after the longest game in the match, and kicked on from there to break Raducanu once more and serve out the match. Speaking courtside after her victory - which extends Swiatek's winning run at the French Open to 23 matches in a row, having lifted the trophy in 2022, 2023 and 2024, she said: Some time off before helped me a little bit and I'm just ready to fight for it and compete." Italian fourth seed Jasmine Paolini is also through to the third round after a 6-3 6-3 win over Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic, as is China's Qinwen Zheng after a 6-2 6-3 win over Colombian Emiliana Arango. Ukraine's Elina Svitolina is also through after beating Hungary's Anna Bondar 7-6 (7-4) 7-5. Top seed Aryna Sabalenka faces Switzerland's Jil Teichmann later on Wednesday for her second-round clash. In the first set, I had really high confidence. "He didn't miss at all so it was a little difficult to deal with his game in the second set but I'm really happy I stayed strong and refreshed myself. "In the third set, I started to play better and better which helped me have a really good last two sets... I want to make sure people are happy watching my match as well. Elsewhere, Italy's Lorenzo Musetti progressed after a straight sets 6-4 6-0 6-4 win over Colombian Daniel Elahi Galan, Norway's seventh seed Casper Ruud was beaten by Portugal's Nuno Borges 2-6 6-4 6-1 6-0.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Raducanu won just three games as defending champion Swiatek raced to a 6-1 6-2 victory in the second-round clash Emma Raducanu is out of the French Open after suffering another heavy defeat to the four-time Roland Garros champion Iga Swiatek, who improved her record against the former US Open winner to 5-0. It led to another rout, with Swiatek overcoming an aggressive start from Raducanu to show her class and reel off a 6-1 6-2 win. Meanwhile, defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz is though after beating Hungary's Fabian Marozsan in four sets but two-time finalist Casper Ruud is out after the injured Norwegian was shocked by Portugal's Nuno Borges. Elsewhere in the women's singles World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka headlines proceedings on Court Suzanne Lenglen when she faces Switzerland's Jil Teichmann. Follow all the latest updates, scores, results and analysis from Roland Garros below: Emma Raducanu has admitted she felt “exposed” by Iga Swiatek during her 6-1 6-2 defeat to the four-time French Open champion. “It was the first time playing a match on that court,” she said. You do feel like it is a big court. I think that did emphasise me feeling a bit of uncomfortable. But it's a good experience for if I ever play on that court again. Damir Dzumhur, of Bosnia and Herzegovina, takes out France's big-serving 30th seed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard The World No 69 wins 7-6 6-3 4-6 6-4 and will play Carlos Alcaraz next. Matteo Gigante, the world No 167 who started the week in qualifying, is a set away from beating former French Open finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas. The Italian left-hander is causing Tsitsipas all sorts of problems, despite never winning a French Open match before this week. After Marta Kostyuk was knocked out, it will be either Jaqueline Cristian or Sara Bejlek (who defeated to Ukrainian) in the third round. I think having some time off before helped me a bit. Speaking on TNT Sports, Tim Henman says that while Emma Raducanu will take the positives from her clay-court season, today's 6-1 6-2 defeat to Iga Swiatek will leave her feeling “pretty raw”. “She's out on Chatrier playing the best clay-court player of her generation and it was a one-sided contest. There were glimmers of opportunity but Swiatek demonstrated her ball-striking capabilities. It's a tough day at the office for Emma but I'm sure she will bounce back quickly.” In her on-court interview, the interviewer starts by asking Iga Swiatek: “Although it was not an easy match to play Emma, how did you manage to make it look easy?” Iga Swiatek takes the second match point with a backhand winner! She made a decent start, with some close games early on, but once Swiatek started pulling away Raducanu could not respond. Swiatek holds up her hands as she puts away a sliced backhand volley, that takes a little clip off the top of the net. Raducanu said she couldn't push the ball back but it must be so demoralising to face Swiatek when she's on this form. Swiatek goes big on the forehand return and Raducanu can only get her racket on it as the Pole breaks. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

Six US Open wild card entries on the line; event to be held at USTA National Campus June 16-18

Press release written and distributed by the USTA

ORLANDO, Fla., May 28, 2025 – The United States Tennis Association (USTA) today announced the participants that will be competing in the US Open Wild Card Playoffs, set to be held at the USTA National Campus, June 16-18.

The new event featuring the top American collegiate players, which was announced earlier this month, will more than double the average number of American collegiate players that earn US Open wild cards this year, with six guaranteed US Open wild card entries up for grabs. The winners of the singles and doubles competitions will earn US Open main draw singles and doubles wild cards, respectively, while the men's and women's singles finalists will earn US Open qualifying wild cards.

The men's singles field is headlined by Columbia's Michael Zheng, who won the NCAA men's singles title last November, and Michigan State's Ozan Baris, who lost to Zheng in the NCAA men's singles final. The women's singles field will feature Auburn's DJ Bennett, who was the NCAA women's singles runner-up in November. All three players automatically qualified for the event based upon their NCAA performance, while the remainder of the field is made up of players selected by a committee of USTA staff, college coaches and an ITA representative.

The full fields are below (bolded players automatically qualified):

Men's SinglesOzan Baris (Michigan State)Stefan Dostanic (Wake Forest)Aidan Kim (Ohio State)Michael Zheng (Columbia)

Women's SinglesDJ Bennett (Auburn)Valerie Glozman (Stanford)Amelia Honer (UCSB)Mary Stoiana (Texas A&M)

Women's DoublesDJ Bennett/Ava Hrastar (Auburn)Reese Brantmeier/Alanis Hamilton (North Carolina)Kaitlyn Carnicella/Sarah Hamner/ (South Carolina)Olivia Center/Kate Fakih (UCLA)

Arizona's Colton Smith was originally included in the field for men's singles but he declined the invitation.

The singles semifinals will be played on Monday followed by the doubles semifinals on Tuesday and all finals will be contested on Wednesday. The event is free and matches will begin each day at 5 p.m. in order to maximize in-person attendance, while all matches will also be streamed on the USTA National Campus website.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Casper Ruud has claimed that players are being “forced to show up injured or sick” after suffering a shock defeat at the French Open. The two-time runner-up was sent packing in the second round on Wednesday - his earliest exit here since he made his debut in 2018. Ruud received treatment from the physio and later revealed that he had been carrying a knee injury throughout the clay season, including at the Madrid Open, where he won his biggest career title. There hadn't been any real signs that Ruud struggled throughout the clay swing and it was assumed that he may have picked up a recent injury when the physio started working around his upper left calf during a medical time-out on Wednesday. “For the last couple of weeks, I've been kind of struggling a little bit with knee pain on and off. That's why I decided to pull out of Geneva after Rome, do my best, and heal to be ready here,” Ruud said. So it's been with me actually the whole clay season on and off. “Depending a little bit on how kind of physically tough some matches are, the day after it will either be a bit more sore or not. “The scan didn't show any structural damage, which is a good thing. Ruud is now looking forward to having a real break to rest and recover after taking five days off last week, which didn't seem to help, and will do scans before deciding his next move. 8 admitted he'd already fallen victim to the trap of playing while injured, explaining that he didn't want to face any of the ATP's financial or ranking point penalties for missing mandatory events. You feel you're obligated to play with certain rules that the ATP have set up with the mandatory events. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Of course, if my leg is broken, I won't play. “But it's tough anyways, especially when there's a time with mandatory events to skip them because the punishments are quite hard, in terms of everyone else will play, gain points, and you won't. Also there's a certain bonus system set up that is reduced if you don't show up to the mandatory events. It's a questionable system because on one hand you don't want to show up injured, and you maybe give the spot to other one. I'm not sure if you're aware, but if you don't play a mandatory event, they cut 25 per cent of your year-end bonus. “You're kind of forcing players to show up injured or sick, or whatever, when that is not what I think is very fair.” He'll be in a race against time to recover before Wimbledon but he could choose to skip the grass altogether.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner is vying for his maiden French Open title and fourth Grand Slam overall at the 2025 edition of the major. Sinner is playing just his second tournament since defending his Australian Open title in January as he was unable to compete for three months due to a suspension for failed doping tests. At his comeback event earlier this month, Sinner won five matches to progress to the final at the Italian Open — where he was beaten by Carlos Alcaraz. Sinner won his only clay-court title to date at the 2022 Croatia Open. Tim Henman predicts who will win Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner Grand Slam battle John McEnroe offers intriguing take as he answers Carlos Alcaraz question While Sinner has been lauded for his complete game and mental toughness, his physical staying power in long matches is the one area where questions remain. Speaking on Prime Video Sport France, Bartoli claimed Sinner's durability could be a factor in his French Open hopes as she asserted his rivals must push him to a certain time mark in matches. “We all remember a match he played here against Rafael Nadal [in 2020]. He pushed him around for a set and a half and we said to ourselves: ‘Wow, who is this new Italian who hits the ball very flat, who doesn't really have a clay-court game?' Beyond that, he starts to get stuck physically, but we have to take him beyond 4:30 of play.” Can anyone stop Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner at the French Open? Jannik Sinner paid an emotional tribute to Rafael Nadal after his opening match at Roland Garros. Tim Henman believes there will be a clear winner in the Grand Slam count in the battle between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. 11 ATP players have picked the women's singles winner at Roland Garros.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has admitted she "still feels bad" about pulling out of her mixed doubles pairing with Andy Murray at Wimbledon last year and suggested she is unsure whether he has fully forgiven her. Murray did not participate in the men's singles event at SW19 last year due to a back injury, instead choosing to only take part in the men's doubles and mixed doubles events. However, Raducanu pulled out of the match due to "some stiffness in her right wrist" and, in doing so, ended Murray's Wimbledon career as he was not permitted to find a replacement partner due the draw already being made. At the time, Murray was said to be "disappointed" by the decision, while his mother Judy branded it "astonishing" in a social media remark that she later clarified was intended to be sarcastic. Raducanu later said she had sent the former men's world number one a "long message" to apologise and avoid any "bad blood" with him, adding that "causing trouble" was "definitely the last thing I want". However, the incident has been brought up nearly a year on at the French Open as she was quizzed on who will coach her heading into this year's Wimbledon campaign. The 22-year-old is looking for her seventh full-time coach in her short career but has said that she will keep former player-turned- commentator Mark Petchey on in a part-time role for Wimbledon. Asked if she would consider working with Murray, who ended his coaching partnership with Novak Djokovic earlier this month, Raducanu ruled out approaching him and instead made another plea for his forgiveness. “I'm looking forward to seeing him around and having a conversation. "I think he would give great advice, he's been in a similar situation and would probably understand a lot of things that I'm also going through. But as to anything more, I don't know, that's very far out of thought.” Raducanu will come up against defending champion Iga Swiatek in the second round of the French Open on Wednesday, having defeated China's Wang Xinyu in her opening match. The British No.2 is currently getting acupuncture after suffering a back spasm in Strasbourg last week, while she required medical attention during her victory over Wang.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a fine performance from Krueger, who's appearing in just her second French Open main draw. Krueger, who made her professional debut back in 2021, has consistently struggled at Grand Slams in her short career. She's fallen at the first round in every single major she's appeared at, bar the US Open last year, where she reached the third round, and now this French Open win. Now in Paris, she joins a slew of young American players who have avoided an early exit, with Robin Montgomery and Hailey Baptiste also picking up first-round wins. That is former tennis player Michael Joyce, who also coached Maria Sharapova. Joyce has worked with Krueger since 2021, after several stints with other players like Jessica Pegula and Victoria Azarenka. Although his most successful stint was with the Russian Sharapova, whom he helped guide to three Grand Slams. The Krueger-Sharapova connection goes beyond just coaching, though. The American knew by the age of 11 she wanted to be a professional tennis player, when she saw five-time Grand Slam champion Sharapova succeeding at the highest level. She had the same body type as me,” Krueger said. Joyce is now working with Krueger, and he'll be the last person to be surprised should she make a run at the French Open after a steady upwards trajectory this year. Krueger then backed that victory up with another quarterfinal, this time in Adelaide, where she had to come through qualifying. There, she achieved one of her biggest ever wins, beating fifth seed Paula Badosa before being forced to retire against top seed Jessica Pegula. After a disappointing Australian Open, she then bounced back by reaching the final in Abu Dhabi, a WTA 500 tournament, losing to Belinda Bencic. Nevertheless, Krueger, who is currently ranked 35th in the world, has remained optimistic about her year so far as she bids to make 2025 the most successful season of her career. When asked how she will get there? "Everything just connects [when she plays her best tennis], and I see the court really well," Krueger said. When I have no hesitation, everything just flows. Krueger will have a mammoth task to reach the third round at the French Open, as she faces World No.6 Mirra Andreeva.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The extension of several Masters tier tournaments has made an already demanding tour even more difficult to navigate, Australian tennis player Jordan Thompson says. The Sydneysider has only had seven days off in 2025 as schedule changes mean players have less time to rest and spend time with family.

Traditionally 1000 events were condensed into a week of top-level competition with the top players competing. And such is the competition for rankings points and prizemoney, players are pushing themselves through injury to maintain their grip. "Unfortunately with the ATP schedule and how shit it is, we can't afford to take breaks because you let other people just have an opportunity to pass you on the rankings and get more prize money and you just feel like you're missing out on an opportunity," he said. The last few years I've been away, after every Aussie Open (and) I've come back at probably the start of December because I've got to wait until Davis Cup (is over). Watch all the action from Roland Garros 2025 live & on-demand on Stan Sport, with two courts in 4K UHD. "I know there are opportunities to go home throughout the year, but it is so far to get back to Australia and I don't see the benefit of going there for less than 10 days, because by the time you acclimatise there, on an island in the middle of nowhere that is a completely different time zone, you've just got to come back and compete again. So I just don't see how that's beneficial for any tennis player." Thompson was knocked out of Roland-Garros this week. He added: "I haven't spoken to a player who likes the two week events. I mean, you are there for an eternity. "It feels like a couple of times I've made the doubles final and I've been in the same city for over 17 days, and we're at one tournament. Why is one tournament taking that long to finish? I mean, why do we need a day off for playing? "It should just be like the Paris Masters (which is a) one week event. Why do we need to turn that into a two week event? It's just a waste of time in my opinion and I know a lot of other players feel the same." For a player like Thompson, who also has to juggle Davis Cup duties as well, it leaves little time for anything but tennis. I've got some worse words for our off-season. I just feel like there is no time to rest or have a holiday."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Australian, whose Roland Garros ended on Tuesday when he and Jason Kubler were defeated in the men's doubles, has struggled with a range of injuries this year after squeezing only seven days off to recuperate after enjoying a career-best season in 2024. He said the challenges of staying inside the top 100, which is considered the range in ranking where players make a decent living, meant professionals were placing extra stress on their bodies in order to retain their place on the premier tour. By extending tournaments including the Madrid Masters and Italian Open to a fortnight, players are forced to wait at tournaments for longer and this has eaten into the time Aussies have to sneak home for a brief break to see family and friends. “Unfortunately with the ATP schedule and how sh*t it is, we can't afford to take breaks because you let other people just have an opportunity to pass you on the rankings and get more prize money and you just feel like you're missing out on an opportunity,” he said. The last few years I've been away ... after every Aussie Open (and) I've come back at probably the start of December because I've got to wait until Davis Cup (is over). “I know there are opportunities to go home throughout the year, but it is so far to get back to Australia and I don't see the benefit of going there for less than 10 days, because by the time you acclimatise there, on an island in the middle of nowhere that is a completely different time zone, you've just got to come back and compete again. So I just don't see how that's beneficial for any tennis player.” The Novak Djokovic-founded PTPA recently issued a law suit against the tours, among other affiliated parties, on several bases. Top 10-ranked players also met with representatives of all grand slam bodies including Tennis Australia in Paris last week to discuss issues including prize money percentages per event revenue. And there is frustration among the playing group that the Masters events have been extended, squeezing out smaller tournaments, to allow organisers to further their commercial interests. Thompson, who claimed a maiden ATP Tour singles title last year and partnered the now-suspended Max Purcell to a US Open doubles title and a spot in the elite ATP Tour Finals, said he did not know a player who enjoyed the extended time frame at select Masters events. “I haven't spoken to a player who likes the two week events. I mean, you are there for an eternity,” he said. “It feels like a couple of times I've made the doubles final and I've been in the same city for over 17 days, and we're at one tournament. Why is one tournament taking that long to finish? I mean, why do we need a day off for playing? “It should just be like the Paris Masters (which is a) one week event.
