                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>VivoPower International (VVPR), a Nasdaq-listed energy company, said on Wednesday it has secured $121 million in a private share placement to fund its pivot to digital asset treasury focusing on XRP XRP$2.24, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The company sold 20 million ordinary shares priced at $6.05 per share. Ripple is an enterprise-focused blockchain service provider closely related to the XRP Ledger. The move is the latest example of public firms raising money to purchase and add digital assets to their treasuries, a playbook popularized by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) that has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin BTC$107,093.86. While BTC has been the most sought-after asset among these firms, recent newcomers like DeFi Development and SharpLink Gaming directed their focus to Solana's SOL SOL$169.59 and Ethereum's ether ETH$2,621.25, respectively. VivoPower, founded in 2014, aims to be the first publicly traded company with a crypto treasury strategy centered around XRP. "After reviewing a number of listed vehicles seeking to embrace a digital asset treasury model, we selected VivoPower given its strategic focus on XRP and its objective to contribute to building out of the XRPL ecosystem," Prince Abdulaziz said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday touted the Trump administration's ties with the cryptocurrency industry  — a once-fringe business that President Trump and his allies have embraced in recent months. "I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House," Vance told the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas. Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with "this level of energy," adding, "but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins." But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has "transformed" how Americans make transactions and acts as a "hedge" against bad policy. "Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control," he said. "It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics." Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar. "In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might." Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to "speak up" and "get involved," and he needs them to step up again. While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. The Las Vegas event is also featuring a handful of other Trump backers: His two eldest sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have invested in crypto ventures, are speaking Wednesday on a panel about "the rise of new bitcoin business models." Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist who serves as the White House's crypto czar, spoke on Tuesday. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year. Vance headlined a fundraiser hosted by MAGA Inc. on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where tickets were priced at $1 million a head, CBS News has learned. Bitcoin — and cryptocurrency more generally — has grown in prominence and drawn allies from both parties, despite skepticism about its volatility. But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised to reverse strict Biden-era regulations. Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced Tuesday it is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin. Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded "meme coin" earlier this year, and Mr. Trump hosted the digital currency's top investors at his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded a Bitcoin mining venture that's seeking to go public. The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics experts who argue Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president. The GENIUS Act, the once-bipartisan Senate bill aimed at regulating stablecoins, bled support after Democratic lawmakers pushed for restrictions on elected officials buying or selling crypto — with some Democrats directly citing Mr. Trump's crypto investments. Senators ultimately voted to advance the bill earlier this month. The White House has strongly denied any conflict-of-interest issues, saying Mr. Trump's assets are held in a trust managed by his children.

Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) may be heading for another move higher. According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, the current macroeconomic environment is favorable for digital assets. However, core personal consumption expenditures may have a more direct impact on the dollar. Market pricing expects stability; any downside surprise below 2.6% y/y (core) will trigger a compression in real yields and dollar softness, catalyzing capital back into crypto,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex. If the dollar falls, traders will be looking for other assets to protect their wealth. Notably, Ethereum may be driving the altcoin rally, suggests Kooner, noting that ETH was up 6% against BTC off local lows. “This is the beginning of what might become Phase 3 of the crypto bull cycle, where BTC strength stabilizes, ETH accelerates, and capital spreads out across selective altcoins,” Kooner noted about Ethereum's recent growth. “The underlying takeaway for traders: crypto isn't overbought, it's underallocated—macro just decides how quickly capital flows in,” he concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Sees Opportunity as Sweden and Norway Ditch Cashless Aspirations The countries pulled back recently after discovering that centralized payment systems collapse when physical infrastructures fail. "Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile," Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote on X, responding to a Guardian report that both countries now require citizens to maintain cash reserves. Sweden had reduced cash usage to just 1% of transactions while Norway's Vipps app dominated commerce, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exposed critical vulnerabilities when infrastructure attacks could paralyze entire payment networks. Buterin echoed the sentiment, saying: "Cash turns out necessary as a backup." Looking at his own garden, Buterin posed a measured observation on the case of Sweden and Norway. Responding to Decrypt's inquiries on Buterin's statements, Sam MacPherson, CEO of decentralized finance protocol development firm Phoenix Labs, disagrees with the Ethereum co-founder's assessment. Without electricity or internet, Ethereum wouldn't work on its own. Zero-knowledge proofs, meanwhile, could theoretically enable offline payments, as Buterin noted in responses, though those remain experimental. "We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware," Buterin said. Another opportunity could be opened with stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar. "Stablecoins are an exact solution to this scenario," Anthony Anzalone, founder of walletless blockchain platform XION, told Decrypt. Stablecoins have "exploded in usage and adoption" because they aren't "reliant on one centralized party," he explained. @rohangrey has done a lot of deep thought in this direction. We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders. Yet, stablecoins face their own questions about resilience, especially in terms of privacy. In the face of crisis scenarios such as those that Sweden and Norway now face, Ethereum could show its resilience by not strictly requiring users to have access "to electricity, secure operating systems, and unhackable Web3 wallets," Bickle added, pointing out flaws in how Ethereum could remain practical in such cases. "We must travel a long way down an, as yet undeclared, roadmap before Ethereum will be resilient enough to replace cash transactions," Bickle said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katana launched its private mainnet with support from GSR and Polygon Labs, aiming to solve liquidity fragmentation in DeFi. The Katana Foundation, a nonprofit focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) development, is launching its private mainnet, aiming to unlock greater crypto asset productivity via deeper liquidity and higher yields for users. The new blockchain will enable users to earn higher yields and explore DeFi in a “unique, optimized yield environment” that unlocks latent value through an ecosystem that makes every digital asset “work harder,” according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph. Related: Here's how abstraction minimizes fragmentation in DeFi, making it more fluid To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana's liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers. Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem. “This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs' Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding: Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana's core applications,” said Boiron. Polygon Labs' CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Under a five-year agreement with land record blockchain firm Balcony, the well-to-do county across the Hudson River from New York city will migrate 370,000 property deeds — representing about $240 billion worth of real estate — onto an immutable, searchable blockchain ledger, according to a press release. The system, powered by Avalanche, will serve nearly a million residents across 70 municipalities. Most recently, the Dubai Land Department debuted a real estate tokenization platform built on the XRP Ledger XRP$2.26 network as part of its strategy to bring 7% of all real estate transactions, worth roughly $16 billion, to blockchain rails. Balcony, which has already introduced similar systems in several counties across New Jersey, claims that its blockchain-based platform can cut deed processing time by 90% while addressing risks like fraud and record discrepancies. It can boost municipal revenue, too: the platform detected almost $1 million in lost municipal revenue in Orange, NJ, previously hidden due to incomplete or outdated property records, the company said. "Blockchain is continuing to solve complex, real-world problems," said Luigi D'Onorio DeMeo, chief strategy officer of ecosystem development organization Ava Labs. "[Avalanche's] infrastructure is built to handle large amounts of data quickly and securely, which is exactly what's needed to modernize how property records are managed and transform how public institutions operate."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Proposed business combination will create a public company engaged in Crypto Mining, Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), and High-Performance Computing (“HPC”) Data Hosting Markets Includes an Earnout if BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure achieves or exceeds EBITDA of $25 million for 2026 SCOTTSDALE, AZ, May  28, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Signing Day Sports, Inc. (“Signing Day Sports” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: SGN), the developer of the Signing Day Sports app and platform to aid high school athletes in the recruitment process, today announced the signing of a definitive business combination agreement (“Business Combination Agreement” or “BCA”) to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interest of One Blockchain LLC (“One Blockchain”) (the operating affiliate company of BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure) (One Blockchain and BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure collectively, “blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure” or “blockchAIn DI”) which will operate a crypto mining, AI and HPC data hosting company with plans for 200MW in total power capacity from facilities in South Carolina and Texas. The transaction will be effected through a holding company structure, whereby Signing Day Sports and One Blockchain will become subsidiaries of BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, Inc. (“PubCo”). Signing Day Sports will not be required to make any cash payment to One Blockchain or its securityholders in connection with the transaction. Amid increasing sustainability standards and renewed emphasis on domestic infrastructure, blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure is positioned to pursue opportunities across a wide range of compute-intensive applications. blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure's current operations include a 40 MW crypto mining hosting facility in South Carolina with expansion capability to 50 MW for third-party crypto miners in South Carolina, subject to utility approval. blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure anticipates transitioning to internally owning and mining crypto currency at their South Carolina facility in late 2025 or early 2026, to facilitate revenue and earnings growth. blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure is also in the process of commissioning a new 150MW crypto mining, AI and HPC data hosting facility in Texas with favorable economics with 34.5kV of interconnectivity to the grid for activation in late 2026. The Texas facility can be modularly built providing flexibility for crypto mining and/or AI and HPC data hosting activities. It is currently anticipated that the first 100MW will be initially focused on internally owned crypto mining operations and the remaining 50MW of capacity used for AI and HPC data hosting. This capital efficient and flexible modular business model will provide blockchAIn DI with optionality to pursue different revenue mixes as the crypto mining, AI and HPC markets continue to develop. Signing Day Sports views the proposed transaction as a compelling opportunity to enhance its platform by combining with a technology-driven business with strong fundamentals and scalable infrastructure. Danny Nelson, Chief Executive Officer of Signing Day Sports, stated, “This transaction marks an exciting new chapter for Signing Day Sports, which we are confident has potential to bring substantial value to the stakeholders of both parties. blockchAIn DI's scalable, cash-flowing bitcoin mining and AI data center platform positions the combined company to capitalize on the fast-growing HPC hosting market. With a 40 MW mining site in South Carolina with 10 MW expansion capacity and the significant upside potential resulting from the planned commissioning of a new facility in Texas, blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure is strategically positioned to meet the growing HPC workload demands, and we could not be more thrilled to deliver this unique growth opportunity to our shareholders.” Jerry Tang, Chief Executive Officer of One Blockchain, added, “We are excited about the proposed transaction between blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure and Signing Day Sports, and the significant potential for value creation for both parties. Supported by our cash flow generation, we are positioned to become a leader in providing and operating sustainable, blockchain computing infrastructure and progress our significant growth goals forward. In the near term, blockchAIn Digital Infrastructure will look to bring bitcoin mining in-house, expand our South Carolina facility to 50MW, and build out our proposed 150MW facility in Texas to support the large demand for hosting services driven by various AI and mining applications. The business combination will be effectuated through a holding company structure, whereby Signing Day Sports and One Blockchain will become subsidiaries of PubCo through merger transactions. Under the BCA, the consideration to be paid at closing to the securityholders of One Blockchain will be comprised of PubCo common shares with a value of approximately $215.0 million, subject to an exchange ratio and other certain adjustments, at an implied diluted value per share for PubCo of $5.12 (including adjustment as applicable for exchange listing purposes). The BCA also includes an earnout, in which additional PubCo shares equaling 11.628% of the total number of shares of PubCo issued to One Blockchain's securityholders at closing will be issued to such former One Blockchain securityholders (the “Earnout Shares”). The Earnout Shares will be issued if PubCo achieves or exceeds net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of $25 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026. The BCA also contains certain termination rights for both Signing Day Sports and One Blockchain. Signing Day Sports also received a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction. A more complete description of the terms of and conditions of the proposed transaction and related matters will be included in a current report on Form 8-K to be filed by Signing Day Sports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

It is known that the Trump Media and Technology Group's majority owner, President Donald Trump, has pushed for the United States' adoption of Bitcoin, offering a boost to the crypto industry earlier this year. In the latest press release by the Trump Media and Technology Group, the company has confirmed that it is raising $2.5 billion for its future endeavors of buying cryptocurrency for its assets. According to Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, this move is a "big step forward" towards the company's plans to acquire "crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles."

Anchorage Digital and Crypto.com would be in charge of holding the Bitcoin for Trump Media. Back when Donald Trump was campaigning, he tapped into the crypto market for massive support as he expressed that he plans to lobby for wider adoption and regulation in the country. When he won, crypto prices surged exponentially, with Bitcoin achieving a $100,000 valuation, which it lost along the way. While crypto's significant growth did not hold steadily, there have been several surges that brought back life and power to its valuation, and this is because of the previous promises of President Trump slowly unfolding. During the past months, Trump made significant moves for the cryptocurrency industry, including pardoning Silk Road's creator, easing down on regulatory scrutiny for companies, and incorporating digital tokens among programs and services. That being said, Trump's World Liberty Financial (WLF) also launched a meme coin called $TRUMP for people to invest in and trade.
