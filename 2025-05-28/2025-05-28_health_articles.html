                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many home healthcare agencies adopted telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the absence of federal reimbursements for these services has led to an increasing number of providers discontinuing these options, a national survey conducted by the University of California, Irvine, and other institutions reveals. The National Institute on Aging-funded study offers valuable insights into the role of telehealth in home healthcare, a rapidly expanding sector. As the population ages and seeks alternatives to nursing homes, this field is expected to grow by 10 percent annually. Conducted from October 2023 to November 2024, the study queried 791 home healthcare agencies, with a response rate of 37 percent. The results revealed that only 23 percent of home healthcare agencies had adopted telehealth by 2019. However, that number surged to 65 percent by 2021, primarily driven by the implementation of virtual visits to mitigate disease transmission and address staffing and equipment shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, 19 percent of adopting agencies had discontinued telehealth by 2024. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive national picture of telehealth's trajectory in home healthcare. Our findings suggest that without [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] reimbursement, many agencies may abandon telehealth, potentially missing opportunities to improve care and manage costs as home health demand skyrockets." Dana B. Mukamel, corresponding author, UC Irvine Distinguished Professor of Medicine Virtual visits saw the largest adoption spike in 2020 (21.1 percent), but 22 percent of users had discontinued them by about 2022. These patterns suggest that COVID-19 disrupted telehealth's natural diffusion into home healthcare, which was gaining traction pre-pandemic, with 23 percent adoption by 2019. However, the lack of reimbursement and perceptions of telehealth's limitations for older adults pose barriers to sustained use. As the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services considers telehealth reimbursement policies, the study calls for rigorous evaluations of telehealth's cost-effectiveness and patient outcomes. With home healthcare expenditures projected to grow significantly, policies supporting telehealth could enhance care delivery and manage costs. The study, co-authored by experts from UC Irvine, UCLA, Brown University, the University of Minnesota and other institutions, is a critical resource for policymakers navigating the future of home healthcare. As the nation grapples with an aging population and rising care demands, understanding telehealth's role could shape effective, sustainable solutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From vaccine equity and pandemic preparedness to primary health care, the contributions of philanthropic partners help drive progress across WHO's key priorities. The importance of philanthropic support was underscored by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, in his recent remarks to the Philanthropy Asia Summit, held in Singapore on 5–7 May 2025. In his remarks, he expressed his appreciation to the Temasek Foundation and the Philanthropy Asia Alliance for organizing the Summit while highlighting the importance of philanthropy in strengthening global health, supporting country self-reliance, and partnering with WHO to address health challenges in an increasingly turbulent world. At the Summit, Dr. Tedros thanked His Excellency President Tharman and Singapore, for its leadership in global health and its support to WHO. "We look forward to your continued leadership and partnership as we work together to realize WHO's founding vision: the highest attainable standard of health – not as a luxury for some, but a right for all", said Dr Tedros. During the Investment Round, WHO has sought to expand its donor base, including by engaging strategically with philanthropic organizations. As Dr. Tedros noted, partnerships with philanthropies help countries to strengthen essential health services and make sustainable progress towards universal health coverage. Philanthropic actors play a vital role in improving global health outcomes, providing significant resources and expertise needed to build stronger and more accessible health-care systems. Investments made by philanthropic partners often complement and amplify the work of governments, international organizations and other stakeholders in the global health community. Philanthropy can be particularly effective in supporting innovative or high-risk research that may not be funded though more traditional funding sources. Looking ahead, philanthropic collaboration will remain central to achieving the goals outlined in WHO's Fourteenth General Programme of Work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at UZH have now shown for the first time that intestinal bacteria and their metabolites contribute directly to vascular aging. Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death worldwide. Even if known traditional risk factors such as diabetes or high blood pressure are treated, the disease worsens in half of all cases, especially in older patients. Researchers at UZH have now shown for the first time that intestinal bacteria and their metabolites can accelerate the ageing of blood vessels and trigger cardiovascular disease. The human body consists of around 30 to 100 trillion bacteria that reside in our organs. Ninety percent of these bacteria live in the intestine, processing the food we eat into metabolic products, which in turn affect our bodies. "Half of these substances have not yet been recognized," says Soheil Saeedi. Using data from more than 7,000 healthy individuals aged between 18 and 95 as well as a mouse model of chronological aging, the researchers found that the breakdown product of the amino acid phenylalanine - phenylacetic acid - accumulates with age. In several series of experiments, Saeedi's team was able to prove that phenylacetic acid leads to senescence of endothelial cells, in which the cells that line the inside of blood vessels do not proliferate, secrete inflammatory molecules, and exhibit aging phenotype. As a result, the vessels stiffen up and their function is impaired. By conducting a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the microbiome of mice and humans, the researchers were able to identify the bacterium Clostridium sp.ASF356, which can process phenylalanine into phenylacetic acid. When the researchers colonized young mice with this bacterium, they subsequently showed increased phenylacetic acid levels and signs of vascular aging. "We were thus able to show that the intestinal bacteria are responsible for the increased levels," explains Saeedi. Short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, which are produced by fermentation of dietary fibers and polysaccharides in the intestine, act as natural rejuvenating agents. The research group used in-vitro experiments to show that adding sodium acetate can restore the function of aged vascular endothelial cells. When analyzing intestinal bacteria, they found that the number of bacteria that produce such rejuvenating agents decreases with age. The pharmacologist and his team are now investigating which diet has a positive influence on the complex interaction between bacteria and humans. In contrast, intake of food and drinks that are rich in phenylalanine, e.g. red meat, dairy products and certain artificial sweeteners, should be limited to slow down vascular aging. Initial attempts to curb the formation of phenylacetic acid with the help of genetically modified bacteria have been promising. Gut microbiota-dependent increase in phenylacetic acid induces endothelial cell senescence during aging.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, underscoring the critical need for early detection to improve survival rates and reduce treatment invasiveness. This review synthesizes advancements in imaging technologies that enhance early diagnosis, focusing on their clinical applications, limitations, and future potential. Breast cancer accounts for 25% of cancer cases in women, with survival rates significantly higher in developed nations due to advanced screening programs. Traditional methods like clinical exams and mammography have been cornerstone tools, yet emerging technologies now complement these approaches, particularly for high-risk populations and dense breast tissue. Mammography remains the gold standard for screening, detecting 75% of cancers before palpability. Transitioning from analog to digital systems has improved sensitivity, reduced radiation doses by 30–50%, and enabled advanced processing techniques. Tomosynthesis (3D mammography): Reduces tissue overlap artifacts, increasing cancer detection by 30–40% and lowering recall rates. Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM): Combines iodine contrast with mammography to highlight tumor vascularization, offering MRI-like accuracy for invasive lobular carcinomas and occult lesions. Breast ultrasound excels in differentiating solid masses from cysts and is indispensable for dense breasts. Automated 3D ultrasound: Enhances reproducibility and detects mammographically occult cancers. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS): Uses microbubbles to assess vascular patterns, aiding in lesion characterization and reducing unnecessary biopsies. MRI boasts 94% sensitivity, particularly for high-risk patients (e.g., BRCA carriers) and dense breasts. It excels in preoperative staging, monitoring neoadjuvant therapy response, and evaluating implants. Limitations include high cost, gadolinium use, and false positives. Recent 3-Tesla systems improve spatial resolution, while abbreviated protocols reduce scan time without compromising accuracy. Thermography: Measures heat patterns via infrared or liquid crystal plates. Dynamic Angiothermography (DATG) identifies angiogenesis-linked thermal changes but lacks size assessment and requires validation. Molecular breast imaging (MBI): Utilizes radioactive tracers for dense breasts, showing promise in detecting small tumors, though limited by availability and cost. High risk: Annual MRI + mammography from age 30, particularly for BRCA carriers. Mammography: High screening utility but limited sensitivity in dense tissue. Noninvasive biomarkers: Liquid biopsies combined with imaging for precision screening. Hybrid techniques: PET-MRI and optoacoustic imaging for comprehensive assessment. Early detection through advanced imaging significantly improves breast cancer outcomes. While mammography remains foundational, integrating ultrasound, MRI, and emerging technologies tailors screening to individual risk. Future innovations must prioritize affordability, reduced radiation, and personalized protocols to bridge global disparities in breast cancer care. Regular screenings and multidisciplinary collaboration remain pivotal in combating this disease.

People who have experienced overlapping asthma exacerbation, persistent asthma, or asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) face elevated CVD morbidity and mortality risks. These risks are exacerbated in cases of type 2 asthma, a common phenotype of severe asthma leading to accelerated CVD progression. However, type 2 inflammation also exhibits protective effects against CVDs. This review explores the dual role of type 2 inflammation in CVDs, emphasizing its detrimental effects (e.g., exacerbating atherosclerosis) and protective mechanisms (e.g., release of atheroprotective cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13). Furthermore, it examines the therapeutic potential of anti-asthma medications targeting type 2 inflammation to mitigate CVD progression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, global interest in antiviral therapies has increased significantly. Recently, with the growing attention to peptide-based drugs such as Wegovy, demand for effective peptide therapeutics derived from natural substances is rapidly rising. In particular, peptide metabolites-which are generated when natural proteins break down in the body-are emerging as promising candidates for multifunctional drug development. A research team from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST, President Oh Sang-Rok), led by Dr. Hyung-Seop Han from the Biomaterials Research Center, Dr. Dae-Geun Song from the Center for Natural Product Systems Biology, and Dr. Oh-Seung Kwon from the Doping Control Center, announced that they have developed a therapeutic substance with both antiviral and tissue regenerative properties, based on a peptide derived from natural sources. The team revealed that a peptide metabolite (Ac-Tβ1-17), produced from the breakdown of a natural protein (thymosin β4) present in the human body, functions as a bioactive molecule capable of both antiviral activity and tissue regeneration. In experiments using human vascular cells, it also activated key processes essential for recovery, including cell growth, wound healing, blood vessel formation, and removal of reactive oxygen species. Scaffolds serve as structural platforms for cell growth or tissue repair and play an important role in regenerative medicine. This peptide scaffold was found to be highly effective in promoting tissue recovery, supporting strong cell adhesion, growth, and blood vessel formation. This study confirms that a single peptide can perform both antiviral and regenerative functions, and is expected to overcome limitations of existing protein-based therapies. The research team plans to continue research on the practical application of Ac-Tβ1-17 in customized therapeutics and regenerative biomaterials. This study demonstrates that protein metabolites can be used not only as new drugs but also as biomaterials for tissue regeneration, confirming their potential for expansion into various biomedical applications." Dr. Song said, "We will continue research using natural bioactive materials to pursue practical applications in antivirals, functional biomaterials, and beyond." Dr. Kwon added, "The metabolite of thymosin β4 has been identified as a drug candidate through collaborative research, and we expect it to be widely applicable in this field moving forward."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A single measles virus lineage is now spreading locally in Milan, primarily among unvaccinated adults, challenging high regional vaccination rates and sparking fears of the disease becoming endemic again. Rapid communication: From multiple measles genotype D8 introductions in 2024 to sustained B3 local transmission in and around Milan, northern Italy, January to April 2025. Despite high vaccination coverage, Milan is experiencing a resurgence of measles, raising concerns about a potential return to sustained transmission. Moreover, 27 of the 32 confirmed measles cases in Milan and its surrounding areas in 2025 were traced back to a single virus lineage. In a recent study published in the journal Eurosurveillance, Italian researchers investigated how a single lineage of measles virus established itself in Milan and increased the risk of possible re-establishment of endemic transmission. Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can be prevented through vaccination. These outbreaks involved multiple strains of the virus, primarily genotype D8, but did not result in continuous local transmission at that time. Genotype B3, which has caused significant outbreaks in other regions, appears to be spreading locally within Italy. Although vaccination coverage in Lombardy, the region encompassing Milan, is notably high (96.06% for the first dose and 93.63% for the second, according to the study), pockets of susceptible individuals remain, especially among young adults who were not immunized in childhood. Scientists are trying to understand how a single genotype could lead to persistent transmission, and whether this indicates a more profound vulnerability in public health defenses. Between January and April 2025, researchers in northern Italy examined suspected measles cases reported across Milan and its surrounding areas. A total of 42 suspected cases were investigated. Local public health authorities collected demographic and clinical data using standardized forms and classified cases based on World Health Organization (WHO) definitions. Laboratory testing was conducted on throat swabs and urine samples using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to confirm measles virus infections. This region is known for its genetic variability and is useful for identifying the virus genotype. All sequences were submitted to international surveillance databases such as GenBank and the WHO's MeaNS2 platform. They looked for epidemiological connections between patients, including family ties, travel history, hospital exposure, and attendance at mass gatherings. These methods enabled researchers to confirm the spread of a unique B3 lineage across different provinces. This signified a marked shift from the previous year, when most measles cases were sporadic and travel-related, involving multiple virus strains without prolonged local spread. The outbreak began with an imported case in early February. Within just two weeks, cases of locally acquired B3 measles began appearing, with no known connection to the initial traveler, suggesting ongoing community transmission. By April, the B3 lineage was responsible for multiple small outbreaks across three provinces, with the most common viral strain appearing in more than 20 cases. Notably, only a handful of the cases were linked to international travel. The most affected individuals were adults, with a median age of 36.5 years. Twelve patients required hospitalization, and two developed severe pneumonia. The virus also spread in hospitals and workplaces, underlining gaps in immunity among adults, including healthcare workers. Furthermore, the genetic sequencing revealed that the B3 strain in Milan was nearly identical to a strain circulating in Morocco, where a large outbreak was ongoing. This strongly suggested the possibility that a single imported case introduced the virus into a susceptible population in Milan and its surrounding areas, where it spread unchecked among unvaccinated adults. Moreover, there was a high possibility of missed cases or undetected travel histories, which could obscure the full transmission chain. Overall, the study highlighted the emergence of a single measles virus lineage that has rapidly spread through Milan and its surrounding areas, primarily among unvaccinated adults. The researchers suggested that health authorities must close immunity gaps, especially in adults, and strengthen surveillance systems to detect and contain future outbreaks before they escalate quickly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Background and goal: While remote or electronic visits (eVisits) can increase access to health care for certain groups of patients, their use can increase staff workload and patient demand. This study explored the views of staff and patients in primary care to inform the development of artificial intelligence (AI) features for eVisits. Researchers asked interviewees about their views on the potential uses of AI during eVisits, risks, benefits, and challenges to its adoption into clinical practice. Patients worried that AI might diagnose or prescribe without input from their physician, and staff questioned safety. Perceived risks included depersonalized care, data‑privacy fears, and the possibility that patients would have to enter symptoms perfectly for AI triage to work safely. Seven specific opportunities for AI during eVisits were identified and generally welcomed if they complemented (not replaced) clinician judgment: Workflow routing – AI could direct each request to the appropriate team member quickly. Prioritization – Urgent requests could be flagged so clinicians see them first. Follow-up questions – AI could automatically request photos, questionnaires, or clarification after a submission. Writing assistance – AI could suggest editable response templates for common concerns like mental health. Self-help information – Trusted educational links could be sent to patients without clinician effort. Face-to-face booking – AI could automatically schedule in-person visits when a physical exam is needed. Why it matters: The results of this study may serve as guidance for developing and testing AI tools in primary care settings. Moschogianis, S., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Study approach: In this qualitative study, researchers conducted semi structured interviews with 20 patients in Japan aged 65 years or older who were receiving 5 or more oral medications. Negative valuation of medication: patients noted pill burden, possible harm and past success in stopping drugs. Proactive decision making preference: a few patients wanted an active role and even started deprescribing talks. Openness based on trust in the prescriber: many said they would cut back if a trusted clinician suggested it. Positive perspective on medication: satisfaction with current drugs or high expectations kept regimens unchanged. Caution driven by fear of change or comfort with the status quo: worry about symptom return discouraged stopping pills. The researchers also developed a new typology with five types of patients: indifferent, satisfied and risk-averse, compliant, fearful but passive, and proactive. Why it matters: The findings from this study show that patients vary in their readiness to cut back on medications and underscore the importance of tailoring deprescribing discussions to each patient. le, K., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A novel bird flu genotype is driving a surge in outbreaks across wild birds, poultry, and even a human in British Columbia, raising urgent questions about how this virus is evolving and what it means for future pandemic preparedness. Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is an emerging global pathogen that primarily affects birds but can occasionally spill over into humans. In the fall of 2021, a B strain of the HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b was transmitted to wild and domestic birds in Canada. Birds in eastern Canada brought it via the East Atlantic Flyway. The virus subsequently spread across North America, with infected fowl detected in British Columbia in April 2022. Various viruses were isolated from different hosts, most of which arose from gene reassortment within the 2.3.4.4b clade. The fourth wave was primarily associated with a novel D.1.1,3, which descended from the clade introduced in February 2022. Both genotypes now infect numerous wild birds in the province. The virus has spilled over into domestic fowl multiple times. With each wave, infection rates among wild birds and poultry continued to increase. As noted in the dispatch published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, these waves were also characterized by the emergence of new genotypes and ongoing shifts in viral dominance. Data were collected as part of the British Columbia Wildlife Avian Influenza Surveillance Program. Researchers collected oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from dead wild birds. A conserved gene common to all H5N1 genotypes was analyzed, along with whole-genome sequencing. Fewer than three cases were identified in other wild birds, such as American pigeons, bald eagles, barred owls, great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, and peregrine falcons. Conditions in the Fraser Valley provide an optimal habitat for migrating waterfowl to spend the winter and support large-scale poultry farming. This suggests a recent introduction of HPAI from East Asia. After November 8, 2024, an adolescent from Fraser Valley was diagnosed with D1.1 bird flu. Between October 21 and November 30, 2024, 60 HPAI infections in poultry were reported, with 59 cases attributed to the D1.1 strain. This genotype has also been isolated from some parts of the United States south of British Columbia. Phylogenetically, the D1.1 strain is most closely related to strains from wild birds. It comprises four segments, each derived from both Eurasian and North American versions. The neuraminidase [NA] segment was identified for the first time in this clade in British Columbia. However, they have fewer substitution mutations than expected over this period. This observation may indicate that the D1.1 genotype, or its ancestors, persisted in an environmental reservoir, such as frozen wetlands, over the summer of 2024 before being reintroduced into migratory birds in the fall. Alternatively, the virus may be particularly well adapted to certain wild bird populations, resulting in minimal evolutionary pressure and low genetic divergence. These samples all came from a single outbreak. The mutation was not detected in wild birds. The possible functional impact of the Am4N1 neuraminidase segment on host-virus interactions is a subject for further investigation, as the study notes that certain NA lineages might increase viral shedding in wild birds. Given the rapid rise in poultry outbreaks caused by HPAI, increased environmental detections of the virus (such as from wetland sediment) in fall 2024 compared to fall 2023 may indicate that a larger number of birds were infected with D1.1, that D1.1 leads to greater viral shedding, or both. D1.1 appears to be an emerging genotype resulting from the reassortment of genes present in both Eurasian and North American lineages of the bird flu virus. It has been detected in wild birds, poultry, and one human to date. The study also highlights that the reduced genetic divergence observed in D1.1, compared with similar viruses detected a year earlier, has implications for how molecular clock models are applied to track the evolution of HPAI viruses. This finding underscores the importance of ongoing genomic surveillance, including environmental monitoring, in enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms and risks associated with emerging avian influenza genotypes.​​​​​​​ Dr. Liji Thomas is an OB-GYN, who graduated from the Government Medical College, University of Calicut, Kerala, in 2001.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Approximately one in three pediatric mental health Emergency Department (ED) visits resulting in admission or transfer exceeded 12 hours, and over one in eight exceeded 24 hours, according to estimates based on nationally representative data from 2018 to 2022. Seven in 10 of all kids staying in the ED over 12 hours were there for suicidal thoughts or attempt, and over half for aggressive behaviors. Our study underscores significant issues with access to mental health care for children and adolescents, who often face prolonged ED stays because a psychiatric bed is not available. Most of these kids seek emergency care at adult hospitals, which often have more limited pediatric resources compared to children's hospitals and might not be prepared to provide the necessary supports." Jennifer Hoffmann, MD, MS, Lead Author, Behavioral Health Medical Director, Emergency Medicine at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine The study sample was representative of all pediatric ED visits for mental health concerns in the U.S., with only 1 percent occurring at children's hospitals. Dr. Hoffmann pointed out that given this situation, continued funding is essential for the Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC), a federal program that provides training to non-pediatric hospitals across the country in the efficient and effective care for youth in the ED. Dr. Hoffmann and colleagues evaluated records that represented 5.9 million mental health ED visits by children 5-17 years old in a four-year period. An estimated 1.4 million of these visits resulted in admission or transfer. The study found that youth with public insurance were more likely to remain in the ED for more than 12 hours waiting for a psychiatric bed, which highlights inequities in accessing mental health services. "Differences in reimbursement rates for psychiatric services, which are often lower with public relative to private insurance, may contribute to inequities in care access," said Dr. Hoffmann. In addition to the needed improvements in Medicaid reimbursement rates for pediatric mental health care and sustained funding for EMSC, Dr. Hoffmann suggested several potential solutions to increase mental health care access for youth. She also mentioned the emerging psychiatric urgent care clinics, as well as free-standing psychiatric EDs, which might help respond to the growing demand for these services in children and adolescents.
