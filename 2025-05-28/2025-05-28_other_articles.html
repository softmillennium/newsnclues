Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered three New Kingdom tombs dating to more than 3,000 years ago. The burials were found within a cemetery now known as Dra Abu el-Naga, which is near modern-day Luxor (ancient Thebes). The three deceased individuals, all men, each held important roles in ancient Egypt's temples and grain silos. So it's no surprise they were buried at the Dra Abu el-Naga cemetery, which is located near the Nile and is a necropolis for important non-royal people. One of the tombs belongs to a man named "Amun-Em-Ipet" who served in a temple or estate that was dedicated to Amun, a god associated with ancient Thebes, Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a translated statement. ), a time when Egypt controlled an empire that stretched from Syria to Sudan. His tomb has a corridor-shaped courtyard that connects to a second courtyard, which in turn has an entrance that leads to an unfinished chapel with a burial shaft.

The fact that all three tombs have courtyards is not unusual. "Courtyards are common elements of the New Kingdom tombs of the non-royal Theban necropolis, and they are present throughout Dra Abu el-Naga," Katherine Slinger, a lecturer in Egyptian archaeology at the University of Manchester in the U.K. who was not involved with the excavation, told Live Science in an email. —Excavations at Queen Hatshepsut's mortuary temple reveal elaborate burials, decorated blocks and ancient tools —2,100-year-old temple from ancient Egypt discovered hidden in cliff face "These courtyards had a ritual purpose, particularly during the funeral of the deceased and necropolis festivals," and were sometimes shared with adjacent tombs, Slinger said. "These newly discovered courtyards may contain evidence of this ritual activity," she noted. Felix Arnold, an archaeologist with the German Archaeological Institute who was not involved in the excavation, told Live Science in an email that "courtyards are typical elements of New Kingdom tombs. The study of these exterior elements of tomb precincts tend to be neglected [and] their careful study will offer new insights."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jensen Ackles fans are in for a treat. After watching the actor hunt demons for 15 seasons in Supernatural, and now they have the perfect replacement. Ackles has a new series on Prime Video coming out soon. Although he is no longer hunting demons and other supernatural creatures, his new task is to stop a terrorist attack. The clip opens up with a recollection from Ackles' Meachum and The Flash's Jessica Camacho's Amber Oliveras latest scary encounter with a bomb. The two didn't seem phased, and were ready to get back to work the next day. The two are later recruited by an elite team tasked with preventing a large-scale terrorist attack in Los Angeles. Countdown's official logline reads, "When an officer with the Department of Homeland Security is murdered in broad daylight, LAPD detective Mark Meachum is recruited to a secret task force, alongside undercover agents from all branches of law enforcement, to investigate. But the hunt for the killer soon uncovers a plot far more sinister than anyone could have imagined, kicking off a race against time to save a city of millions." Brosnan explains exactly how he came up with the much maligned Irish accent for the series. The show comes from Derek Haas, who has experience with the action genre, having written the script for 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious and 2008's Wanted, and created iconic series like the Chicago franchise, Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., Chicago Med, and Chicago Justice, as well as FBI: International, the FBI spinoff. Aside from Ackles and Camacho, Countdown also stars Bad Boys: Ride or Die's Eric Dane as Nathan Bluthe, The Flash's Violett Beane as Evan Shepherd, Titans' Elliot Knight as Keyonte Bell, and Young Rock's Uli Latukefu as Lucas Finau. It's also his first leading role after the long-running fantasy horror series wrapped in 2020. "I had an incredible experience working with the Prime Video team on The Boys and am delighted to be able to continue that relationship on Countdown," he said at the time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ASKAP J1832-0911, which is periodically throwing out pulses of radio waves and X-rays, could be a brand-new cosmic object. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Detected by Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and NASA's Chandra X-ray observatory, the strange repeating signals are currently unexplained — and unravelling this cosmic mystery could reveal new physics, according to the researchers who discovered it. "This object is unlike anything we have seen before," lead study author Andy Wang, an astronomer at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, said in a statement. "However, even those theories do not fully explain what we are observing," Wang added. ASKAP J1832-0911 is a long-period transient (LPT), a class of rare and extreme astrophysical events that sweep out beams of radio waves like cosmic lighthouses. First discovered in 2022, thus far ten LPTs have been catalogued by astronomers. Related: 'Cosmic cannonballs' exploding out of dead star could explain mysterious flicker in the night sky Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Unlike traditional pulsars, which are produced by neutron stars and spit out radio signals every few seconds or milliseconds, LPTs emit pulses at intervals of minutes or hours apart — a period previously thought to be impossible. Chandra's observations confirmed ASKAP J1832-0911's presence, while also making the first-ever detection of an LPT in X-rays. —Immensely powerful 'magnetar' is emitting wobbly radio signals in our galaxy — and scientists can't explain them —Strange radio bursts that outshine entire galaxies may come from colliding neutron stars —Faint radio signal from ancient star cluster could be rare 'missing link' black hole "The ASKAP radio telescope has a wide field view of the night sky, while Chandra observes only a fraction of it. The astronomers believe that the detection of an LPT emitting radio waves and X-rays simultaneously could offer them a valuable clue as to what's producing them, as any theory that explains the object must now account for both types of emission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most fast food chains have a cookie-cutter look to their franchises, which is why it's super exciting when you find one that stands out from the crowd. While the golden arches are largely indistinguishable from restaurant to restaurant, there are indeed several interesting McDonald's locations around the world that you may or may not be familiar with. Case in point, Roswell, New Mexico, is home to a very special and regionally appropriate UFO-shaped McDonald's, a tourist attraction perfect for extraterrestrial enthusiasts and Mickey D's fanatics alike. Built in 2005 near an alleged UFO crash site, the cosmic-themed restaurant features a silver saucer-shaped structure where patrons can dine. When visiting Roswell, you can't miss the overload of extraterrestrial-themed attractions. In case you're unaware of the UFO-related history behind this town, in 1947, a rancher just outside Roswell found strange debris, including metallic sticks and foil reflectors, in his sheep pasture. While the United States Air Force and government has long passed it off as a fallen weather balloon, many people still doubt this claim, believing they were covering up evidence of an alien spaceship.

Heading to the West Coast, Barstow, California, features a McDonald's resembling a train station, complete with train cars that have been transformed into dining areas. On the opposite coast, enjoy a lobster roll at the Freeport, Maine, Mansion McDonald's, a colonial home built by William Gore in 1850 and converted into a Mickey D's in 1984. The late 18th-century farmhouse features a grand staircase and veranda that was transformed into an elegant dining area. Indeed, McDonald's has converted quite a few historical buildings into fast food eateries. For instance, Penang, Malaysia is home to the Birch House McDonald's, a colonial mansion that was once the headquarters of a 19th-century tin smelting company. In Melbourne, Australia, you'll find McDonald's Clifton Hill, a beautiful Art Deco style building that once operated as the United Kingdom Hotel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The research found that cognitive tendencies such as jumping to conclusions, emotional reasoning, and anomalous perception were significantly associated with both general and specific conspiracy beliefs. Conspiracy theories are widely held beliefs that certain powerful groups secretly conspire to achieve harmful goals. These theories are not supported by strong evidence, yet they persist across cultures and political contexts. Although conspiracy beliefs are not considered clinical delusions, both involve believing things that lack evidentiary support and often resist counterevidence. By focusing on cognitive biases commonly associated with psychosis, the researchers hoped to clarify whether these patterns help explain why some people are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. “My colleague and I came across research showing that teaching people to recognize logical fallacies and cognitive biases can decrease people's belief in conspiracy theories. The researchers conducted two studies using online surveys distributed through social media platforms such as Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram. Participants also completed the Generic Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (GCBS), which measures a person's general tendency to endorse conspiracy theories across domains like government, health, and extraterrestrials. This time, the researchers used a custom questionnaire that asked participants to rate their agreement with 14 specific contemporary conspiracy beliefs. These included theories related to global elites, immigration policy, and public health. In both studies, participants answered questions from the CBQp assessing seven types of cognitive biases: anomalous perception (perceiving stimuli that are not present), catastrophizing (expecting the worst), dichotomous thinking (seeing things in black-and-white terms), emotional reasoning (relying on feelings over logic), intentionalizing (assuming others' actions are intentional and malicious), jumping to conclusions (making snap judgments without sufficient evidence), and interpreting ambiguous events as threatening. The strongest relationship was with jumping to conclusions, which had a correlation coefficient of 0.67. Anomalous perception also showed a strong relationship (r = 0.54), followed by moderate correlations with intentionalizing, interpreting ambiguous events as threatening, and emotional reasoning. Catastrophizing and dichotomous thinking did not show statistically significant correlations in this sample. This suggests that the same cognitive biases may underlie both general beliefs in conspiracies and more context-specific conspiracy theories tied to current events. “I was not sure how this study would turn out,” Frost told PsyPost. “We kept seeing research showing that belief in conspiracy theories, like QAnon, tends to occur for emotional reasons. It offers justification and scapegoating that, at least in the short run, addresses emotional issues. Our research shows that some cognitive biases, like jumping to conclusions and intentionality, are strongly correlated with conspiratorial thinking. The results contribute to a growing body of research showing that conspiracy thinking is not simply a matter of ignorance or personality but may stem from underlying cognitive patterns. While belief in conspiracies is not itself a sign of mental illness, the study found that biases commonly observed in people with subclinical delusional ideation—such as interpreting random or ambiguous information as meaningful or hostile—are also present among conspiracy believers. They perceive things that others don't, like ghosts or spirits. They suspect intention where there is no evidence for it. They might substitute emotional reactions for reason when making important decisions. These are the risk factors that make some people more susceptible to believing in conspiracy theories.” “Before social media and the internet, we had to mix with people that might not share our same views. Even though only 4% of people tend to believe in this theory, encountering others who have a similar belief can embolden a cognitive bias that might not have manifested had the person been in more mixed company.” Both relied on self-reported data and non-random online samples, which may not be fully representative of the general population. Longitudinal or experimental research would be needed to explore questions of causality. “We don't know if cognitive biases make certain people more susceptible to conspiracy theory belief or if going down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories results in greater susceptibility towards cognitive biases,” Frost noted. While not diagnostic of mental illness, these biases reflect systematic ways of processing information that can leave people more vulnerable to unverified and often harmful beliefs. Critical thinking or at least recognition of illogical arguments could help prevent people from believing in disinformation. A democratic society relies on basic logic and critical thinking. Our educational system needs to teach this at an early age, along with media literacy.” The study, “Cognitive Biases Associated With Specific and Generalized Beliefs in Conspiracy Theory,” was authored by Peter J. Frost, Alyssa Simard, Lauren Iraci, Serena Stack, Carolyn Gould-Faulkner, Abby Alexakos, Manny Fernandez, and Shubham Oza. A new study suggests life feels like it speeds up during periods of personal growth and satisfaction. Rather than routine making time seem short, researchers found that fulfilled, nostalgic memories are more likely to make the past feel like a blur. A study using brain scans shows that flashes of insight reorganize neural patterns in the visual cortex and engage memory and emotion regions, helping embed the solution more deeply in long-term memory. A new study reveals that creative metaphor generation involves shifting patterns of brain activity, with alpha oscillations playing a key role at different stages of the process, offering fresh insight into the neural dynamics behind verbal creativity. Instead, multiple areas work together, with high-frequency activity encoding risk, reward probability, and the final choice itself. A study combining brain scans and gameplay data reveals that players with more efficient visual attention and stronger white matter connections excel at StarCraft II. The results highlight how neural traits shape success in cognitively demanding video games. A new neuroimaging study reveals that listening to emotionally charged music during memory recall can change how we remember events. A new study suggests that unusual experiences like déjà vu or premonitions are not only common but linked to a distinct psychological trait called subconscious connectedness. Researchers found that people high in this trait reported significantly more anomalous experiences.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists in Colombia are currently studying a mysterious sphere, dubbed the Buga Sphere, believed by some to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sphere's unusual characteristics have sparked global attention and fueled speculation about its origins.Researcher Jose Luis Velasquez, who inspected the object, noted that it shows no welds or joints, features that would typically indicate human manufacturing. I've never seen a piece like this," Velazquez said, according to People magazine. He added that the sphere appears to have mysterious symbols carved on its surface. These observations have led some to conclude that the object could be a UFO. "It looks so human made to me," she told Fox News. She urged thorough vetting before declaring anomalies in mysterious discoveries. "Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project," she suggested, referring to the international research initiative founded by Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, which aims to rigorously study potential extraterrestrial artifacts.Mossbridge framed the mysterious object as part of a bigger picture in which humanity must confront its own limitations. She explained that prior grandiose beliefs in total mastery blind society when "something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world. "They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters, and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things," Mossbridge told Fox News.

A November 2022 report from the Pentagon documented numerous instances where balloons, birds, and satellites were mistakenly identified as UAPs. Similarly, a NASA report in 2023 concluded that most UAPs are likely attributable to balloons, aircraft, or sunlight reflections, rather than evidence of extraterrestrial life.Officials at the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022 to track UAPs, have stated there is no evidence suggesting that any cases they examined have extraterrestrial origins. Federal efforts to investigate UAPs have prioritized potential risks to national security and air safety rather than delving into theories about their origins. "Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them," she said.Mossbridge believes that such mysteries can have a unifying effect on humanity. "When people start focusing on something that's bigger than us, it really powerfully changes behavior for the better," she said according to Newsweek. "It's a real trick of just noticing how human psychology works and allowing ourselves to know everything. The safest thing we can do is try to discover what's true."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Barron did not apply to Harvard, and any assertion that he, or that anyone on his behalf, applied is completely false," a spokesperson for Melania, 55, tells PEOPLE. PEOPLE reached out to Harvard University admissions, but did not immediately hear back. Barron, 19, is currently a student at New York University. Anything deemed vital will be transferred to other vendors, the New York Times reports. Last week, the Trump administration attempted to stop international students from attending Harvard. In April, a researcher at Harvard said that their research monkeys were at risk of being euthanized amid the slashed federal funding. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a stop-work order to researchers that month. Sarah Fortune, the lead scientist on a tuberculosis study being conducted at Harvard, told The Boston Globe in April, “It's such a heavy responsibility to work with them and to just be asked to kill them halfway through the study..." While Harvard has fought the Trump administration in court, fellow Ivy League institution Columbia University agreed to the administration's demands in March, allowing new government oversight for their Middle East studies department and more. The Trump administration asserts that these demands to higher education institutions are aimed at curbing anti-semitism and discrimination against female athletes, but critics of such policies have accused them of actually being anti-Palestinian and anti-transgender athletes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to THR, Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. are reuniting for Psychic Sam, a new comic book about a man who can predict murders before they happen. The project launched on Kickstarter today (as of this writing, they've nearly reached their goal), but there's already talk of a movie. But every time he ignores it, someone innocent dies. Speaking of movies, producer Ivan Atkinson (The Gentlemen) is onboard to develop Psychic Sam as a feature. It's UNBELIEVABLY exciting and a chance to work with some old friends again (wait 'til you see WHO). Millar said the project came about after he received offers from Marvel to do a big crossover series and from DC to do a Superman project. While he pondered what to do, he got a call from Romita Jr. “Johnny and I did Wolverine together early in my career and loved working together so much that we created Kick-Ass to work on a few years later,” he said. “Kick-Ass spawned movies, t-shirts, Halloween costumes and even Pez dispensers and we've always talked about working together again, but never found the right project. At the same time, Guy Ritchie's brilliant producer Ivan Atkinson and I had been talking about doing a movie together and just looking for the right vehicle. Ivan has produced some of my favourite movies and TV shows in recent years from The Gentlemen to Wrath of Man to Paramount's recent MobLand. He then decided to use the time he'd put aside for the potential Marvel and/or DC projects to develop something new.
