                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A leadership shakeup at what was once Europe's most valuable company is likely to be cemented Friday as Novo Nordisk's controlling shareholder tightens it's grip on the weight-loss drugmaker, even as minority shareholders express discontent. Novo has found itself in an increasingly chaotic situation as of late, with shares plunging and investor confidence waning, as its role as the leading player in the highly lucrative weight-loss space is being called into question. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), one of the larger minority shareholders, said earlier this week it would abstain from voting at Friday's EGM, indicating discontent. Other shareholders, such as California State Teachers' Retirement System, have also said they'll vote against the proposal. Lund will be replaced by company veteran Lars Rebien Sørensen, already chair of the Foundation board. The 71-year-old also served as Novo Nordisk CEO between 2000 and 2016. The foundation also proposed Cees de Jong to become vice chair and Mikael Dolsten, Britt Meelby Jensen and Stephan Engels to become members. "It's usually precipitated by some awful crisis, which is throwing them off a cliff, but probably also a period when they were blind to what was going on underneath them. In other words, they were surprised by a sudden change, and it usually takes that to overthrow an existing power group in a company, especially if they've been in power for a long time," Pettigrew added. Novo is broadly viewed as having fallen behind U.S. peer Eli Lilly which has rapidly taken market share from Novo, as its rival drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound have shown more pronounced weight loss at the highest dose. "It's a matter of urgency and scope," Sørensen said in October about the proposed changes to the board, however also saying the foundation is "fully aligned" behind Novo's current strategy under new CEO Mike Doustdar. Another rationale for the board cull is that a new configuration would bring in more people with direct experience from a U.S. consumer perspective to help navigate the challenging market. It comes amid increasing competition both from Eli Lilly and so-called compounding pharmacies that make cheaper copycat version of the drugs, and a shift towards direct-to-consumer sales. Like for many pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. is Novo's largest market. "On balance, it might seem the new board actually possesses less rather than more commercial, large pharma expertise," Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis said. Last week, the company reported third-quarter results that missed estimates, and lowered the upper range of its full-year guidance citing slower growth expectations for Ozempic and Wegovy. It's but one of many dramatic happenings taking place at the Danish pharma giant lately. "There have been so many moves this year that show Novo as a conflicted company," noted Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. "With such a new direct-to-patient market emerging as a critical piece of future obesity drug sales growth, and compounders remaining a real competitor in the market, it's not hard to imagine that the boards and management might not have the same vision for how Novo should respond," she added. Over the weekend, Novo pulled out from a dramatic bidding war against U.S. giant Pfizer over an experimental weight-loss drug by clinical-stage biotech Metsera, stepping away from a deal analysts have described as unusual. The board changes come just months after Novo appointed Doustdar as chief executive, booting former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, in part blaming him for the current trajectory of the company and its shares. Doustdar has since announced a reorganisation, including laying off over 10% of employees globally. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British government bond yields rose sharply on Friday following reports Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is no longer planning to raise income tax rates in the Autumn Budget later this month. The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt rose around 12 basis points in early trade, before paring gains to trade at 4.498%. Yields and prices move inversely to one another. The moves came as investors reacted to a report from the Financial Times of an income tax U-turn. The Treasury was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday morning. The FTSE 100 index shed over 1% at 8:54 a.m. in London (3:54 a.m. ET), with Lloyds, Natwest, and Barclays banks occupying the bottom of the index, each losing more than 2.8%. Reeves had spent the past week apparently laying the groundwork for a manifesto-breaking rise in income tax, which split Labour party lawmakers and led to further turmoil in the already embattled party, whose leader Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismal approval ratings. A proposed 2p national income increase was to be offset by a 2p reduction in national insurance. There are now expectations, however, that the £30 billion ($39.5 billion) hole in the government's budget will be filled by a patchwork of smaller rises. It could be a "fiscal reckoning" as a patchwork approach will put pressure on the gilt market, Wren Sterling's investment chief Rory McPherson told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday. "Within the U.K., if we have more of the smaller taxes being targeted as part of the programme from Rachel Reeves, I think that's going to put more pressure on the government, more pressure on them to go back to the bond markets and ask for more money, which in turn puts more pressure up on yields," McPherson said. Volatility this year has left long-term borrowing costs hovering at their highest level since the late 1990s, with U.K. debt having the heftiest price tag in the G7. McPherson said that the Bank of England will still be able to make an interest rate cut after the budget, if it wants to. Other investors appear to have curbed their optimism, with bets on cuts shedding six basis points compared with Thursday, according to data compiled by LSEG.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today That marks a sharp reversal for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which shed 1.65% to settle at 47,457.22, a day after it closed above 48,000 for the first time. Tech behemoths such as Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle slumped, with the last losing more than one-third in value since it rocketed 36% in September. Investors, it seems, are growing worried over the high valuations of tech names, as well as the gigantic amount of capital expenditure they are committing to — with some, like Oracle, having to take on debt to fulfil those obligations. Uncertainty over an interest rate cut in December is also putting a downer on Wall Street. It's a coin toss as to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy then, according to the CME FedWatch tool. After all, flying blind makes it hard to see where you'll land. As of now, that applies both to the Fed and investors trying to navigate the still-hazy ambitions of tech companies. All major U.S. indexes fell Thursday stateside dragged down by heavyweight technology names. South Korea's Kospi sank more than 3% and investors sold off SoftBank stock for the third straight day. A December rate cut doesn't seem so certain. A lack of economic data because of the government shutdown — now ended — is complicating the Fed's decision. Fed official Susan Collins on Wednesday said holding rates will "likely be appropriate." Air India losses to weigh on Singapore Airlines. Singapore's national carrier reported Thursday that its second-quarter earnings plunged 82%. Analysts think profits might remain muted because of persistent losses at Air India, in which SIA has a 25.1% stake. [PRO] Be wary of stocks with zero revenue. The year-to-date rally in stocks means some could be trading at elevated prices. CNBC Pro found a few names with market caps of at least $1 billion — but haven't generated revenue over the last 12 months. "The proliferation of generative AI has been transformative for us," DBS CEO Tan Su Shan told CNBC on the sidelines of Singapore Fintech Week. She adding that the company was experiencing a "snowballing effect" of benefits thanks to machine learning. Tan expects AI adoption to bring DBS an overall revenue bump of more than 1 billion Singapore dollars (about $768 million) this year, compared to SG$750 million in 2024. That assessment is based on about 370 AI use cases powered by over 1,500 models throughout its business. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Transportation Security Administration officers "who served with exemplary service" during the 43-day government shutdown will receive $10,000 bonus checks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced on Thursday. She was seen onstage in Houston giving out bumper $10,000 bonuses to TSA agents. Before giving out the checks to around a dozen staff standing behind her, Noem lauded TSA officers who'd worked without pay for "outstanding patriotism and service." It is unclear how many TSA agents will get this bonus. DHS said in a press release on Thursday that it is paying for these bonuses using carryover funds from fiscal year 2025. Noem's move comes after President Donald Trump recommended on Monday that air traffic controllers who did not call in sick during the shutdown should receive a $10,000 bonus. "For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Monday, adding that those who continued working are "GREAT PATRIOTS." Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Tuesday that air traffic controllers could be penalized if they stopped working before missing a paycheck. Pressed on when flight schedules might return to normal, Duffy said Tuesday that delays would likely continue even after the shutdown ended, citing ongoing shortages of air traffic controllers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European stocks were lower on Friday as worries about an artificial intelligence bubble and the global economy shake investor confidence. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 0.8% lower an hour into the session, with all major bourses in negative territory. China's economic slowdown ramped up in October, with data showing fixed asset investment – which includes the country's closely watched real estate sector – contracted in the first 10 months of the year. Retail sales softened, meanwhile, and industrial output growth also slowed. Investors are also reeling from big losses on Wall Street on Thursday, as concerns about AI valuations and the U.S. interest rate trajectory mounted. Big Tech stocks were hit particularly hard, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shedding 2.3% by the closing bell. Comments from Federal Reserve officials in recent weeks have prompted money markets to reconsider the likelihood of a December rate cut from the central bank. By Friday morning, markets were pricing in a 52.1% chance of the Fed cutting by 25 basis points at its next meeting. Back in Europe, yields on U.K. government bonds — known as gilts — spiked on Friday, amid reports that the Labour government was U-turning on an income tax raid that had been planned as part of the looming Autumn Budget. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, meaning a spike in yields represents a sell off of the assets. ET), the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt had risen by 7 basis points to 4.5%, climbing down from an earlier spike that saw yields rise by as much as 13 basis points at the longer end of the maturity curve. Corporate earnings also continue to hold the spotlight in Europe, with German insurer Allianz among the companies reporting on Friday. Allianz said it had achieved record results in the first nine months of the year, bolstered by double-digit growth in operating profit in the third quarter. Operating profit for the three months to September jumped 12.6% to 4.4 billion euros ($5.1 billion), largely driven by the firm's Property-Casualty division. The company said it expects to achieve an operating profit of at least 17 billion euros this year, which sits in the upper end of its full-year guidance range. Allianz shares were last seen trading around 1% higher. Across the Atlantic, U.S. stock futures were little changed on Friday morning following Wall Street's Thursday sell off. Overnight in Asia, stocks fell as investors monitored Wall Street moves and reacted to the Chinese data. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump is once again on the warpath against a major global media company, having threatened the BBC with a $1 billion lawsuit this week. The British public broadcaster found itself in hot water after airing a documentary in which Trump's Jan. 6 speech in 2021 was edited to make it look like he was explicitly encouraging his supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol. As concerns over the documentary came to light, the BBC went into crisis mode, with both its director general and head of news resigning. The BBC on Thursday apologized to Trump and agreed not to show the documentary again on any of its platforms. It reportedly rejected the U.S. president's call for compensation, however. Trump told Fox News this week that he has an "obligation" to sue the BBC. Here's what's going on and why it matters: in which it showed Trump addressing supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. In the Panorama program, Trump was shown saying, "We're going to walk down to the Capitol ... and I'll be there with you. The edit combined two separate parts of his speech, although this was not flagged to viewers, making it look like he had explicitly instructed his supporters to riot in a single statement. That was not the case as Trump had said, "We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women," and only much later (in fact, around 54 minutes later) he said, "and I'll be there with you. Nonetheless, questions have been asked as to why it was reviewed and approved for broadcasting. Director General Tim Davie and Head of News Deborah Turness resigned. But that has not stopped the scandal snowballing with questions centering on the BBC's editorial standards amid allegations of institutional bias. On Tuesday, the BBC issued a statement in which it said, "we accept our edit created the impression we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from two different points in the speech." "Consequently, this gave the impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action. The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement," it said, adding that "there was no intention to mislead." Trump's legal team wrote to the BBC, demanding that it immediately retract what it said were "false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements" about the president in the documentary. The letter, which was published in full by Sky News, said the airing of the program had "caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm." It warned that Trump would sue for $1 billion in damages unless the corporation issued a "full and fair retraction," apologized and compensated the president "for the harm caused." The letter, signed by Trump's lawyer Alejandro Brito, said the BBC has until 5 p.m. EST on Friday Nov. 14 to comply with the president's demands, otherwise, "he will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights ... including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages." When asked if he would go ahead with the lawsuit, Trump said, "Well, I think I have an obligation to do it, because you can't get people, you can't allow people to do that." The BBC on Thursday issued a statement on its Corrections and Clarifications page, saying it had reviewed the Panorama documentary following criticism over how Trump's Jan. 6, 2021 speech was edited. "We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action," the BBC said. "The BBC would like to apologise to President Trump for that error of judgement," it added. A BBC spokesperson has said that while the corporation "sincerely regrets" the manner in which the documentary clip was edited, they "strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim." BBC News has reported that, "if Trump sues in Florida, he would also need to establish the BBC Panorama documentary was available there." There appears to be no evidence so far to suggest it has been shown in the U.S. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also commented on the furore on Wednesday, telling lawmakers he believed in a "strong and independent BBC." It's not the first time Trump has pursued legal action against big media organisations, with lawsuits launched against the Wall Street Journal, CNN, CBS, ABC and New York Times in recent years, with some cases settled and others dismissed. — CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LISBON, Portugal — Top tech executives told CNBC they're concerned about a bubble forming in the artificial intelligence sector, underscoring growing unease within the industry over soaring valuation. In recent weeks, markets have been reckoning with the notion that too much capital is pouring into the AI boom, clouding the outlook on revenue and actual profit and putting high valuations into question. Up to now, warnings around overstretched valuations have mostly come from investors and leaders in the world of finance. Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick have warned of potential corrections as valuations of some major tech firms reached historic highs. The concerns have been crystallized by famed 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry, who this week accused major AI infrastructure and cloud providers, or 'hyperscalers' of understating depreciation expenses on chips. Burry warned that profits at the likes of Oracle and Meta may be vastly overstated. He recently disclosed put options that bet against Nvidia and Palantir. However, CEOs of companies who are themselves developing AI, expressed their concerns this week during interviews with CNBC at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon. "I think the evaluations are pretty exaggerated here and there, and I think there is signs of a bubble on the horizon," Jarek Kutylowski, CEO of German AI firm DeepL, told CNBC on Tuesday. The sentiment was echoed by Picsart CEO Hovhannes Avoyan. "We see lots of AI companies raising ... tremendous valuations ... without any revenue," Avoyan told CNBC on Tuesday, adding that it is a "concern." The market values smaller startups with "just some noise and vibe revenue," he said, referring to companies being backed even though they have minimal sales. Vibe revenue is a play on "vibe coding," a term that refers to using AI to code without needing deep technical expertise. Lyft CEO David Risher said there are reasons to be optimistic given the potential impact of AI but acknowledged the risks. "Let's be clear, we are absolutely in a financial bubble. "The data centers and all the model creation, all of that is going to have a long, long life, because it's transformational. The tech CEOs also addressed their outlook on AI demand for 2026 from businesses, as investors look for any clues as to what this will look like. I think everybody understands that AI can do magical things to businesses, and... we can all operate on another level when it comes to efficiency," Kutylowski said. DeepL's core product is an AI translation tool but it recently launched a more general purpose "agent" designed to be able to carry out tasks on behalf of employees. Francois Chadwick, the chief financial officer of Cohere, a company that is also focused on enterprise AI, told CNBC on Tuesday that "demand is definitely there." Despite the concerns over overstretched valuations and huge capex spend, the investment into artificial intelligence doesn't appear to be slowing down. A report from venture capital group Accel released this week showed that the buildout of new AI data center capacity is forecast to reach 117 gigawatts by 2030 which translates into about $4 trillion worth of capital expenditure over the next 5 years. Already this year, there have been a slew of deals worth billions announced by the likes of Nvidia and OpenAI as they look to develop data center capacity around the world in a bid to keep up with demand. Philippe Botteri, a partner at Accel, said that three major factors will drive that revenue — more powerful AI models that require capacity to be trained, the use of new AI services and the "agentic revolution in the enterprise." "Agentic" is often a term used to describe a type of AI tool that can automatically carry out tasks on behalf of users. But not everyone believes that the large amount of spending is necessary. Ben Harburg, managing partner at Novo Capital says the figures being discussed by large tech firms for future investment may be overblown. "We hear these crazy headline numbers about how much energy is going to be needed, how many chips are going to be needed, although, again, I think that there is probably more of a bubble brewing there than on kind of the front end, the actual product front," Harburg told CNBC on Tuesday. "I think we're starting to realize that there's been probably over exuberance around data centers. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SINGAPORE - Amid fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, much has been made of recent reports suggesting that AI has yet to generate returns for companies investing billions into adopting the tech. But that's not what the chief executive of Southeast Asia's largest bank is seeing — she says her firm is already reaping the rewards of its AI initiatives, and it's only just the beginning. And it will get even better," DBS CEO Tan Su Shan told CNBC  on the sidelines of Singapore Fintech Week, when asked about the promise of AI adoption. DBS has been working to implement artificial intelligence across its bank for over a decade, which helped prepare its internal data analytics for recent waves of generative and agentic AI. Agentic AI is a type of artificial intelligence that relies on data to proactively make independent decisions, plan and execute tasks autonomously, with minimal human oversight. Tan expects AI adoption to bring DBS an overall revenue bump of more than 1 billion Singapore dollars (about $768 million) this year, compared to SG$750 million in 2024. That assessment is based on about 370 AI use cases powered by over 1,500 models throughout its business. "The proliferation of generative AI has been transformative for us," Tan said, adding that the company was experiencing a "snowballing effect" of benefits thanks to machine learning. A major area in which DBS has applied AI is in its financial services to institutional clients, with AI used to collect and leverage data for clients in order to better contextualize and personalize offerings. According to Tan, this has resulted in "faster and more resilient" teams. The CEO believes that these uses of AI have contributed to a recent uptick in the bank's deposit growth as compared to competitors'. The company also recently launched a newly enhanced AI-powered assistant for corporate clients known as "DBS Joy," which assists clients with unique corporate banking queries around the clock. Despite Tan's strong convictions about AI, recent evidence suggests that many companies are struggling to turn their AI investments into tangible profits. MIT released a report in July that found 95% of 300 publicly disclosed AI initiatives, encompassing generative AI investments of $30–$40 billion, had failed to achieve real returns. While DBS doesn't differentiate spending in generative AI from other in-house investments, other major banks have recently offered this comparison. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated in an interview with Bloomberg TV last month that the bank is already breaking even on its approximately $2 billion of annual investments in AI adoption. The ultimate goal, according to Tan, is for its generative AI to develop into a trusted financial advisor for clients, including retail users who are expected to interact with personalized AI agents through the DBS banking app. The bank already has over 100 AI algorithms that analyze users' data to provide them with personalized "nudges," such as alerts on incoming shortfalls, product recommendations, and other insights. While DBS may already be reaping rewards from its AI adoption, Tan acknowledged that it will require continued investments, not only in capital, but in the time needed to reskill employees. The company has launched several AI reskilling initiatives across departments this year and has even deployed a generative AI-powered coaching tool to support these efforts. This will help the company automate mundane work and refocus its staff on building and maintaining human-to-human relationships with customers, rather than reducing headcount, Tan said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China's slowdown worsened in October, dragged by soft consumer demand and a deepening property downturn, with the long holiday period further denting factory activity. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.8% drop. On a single-month basis, fixed-asset investment fell 11.4% from a year earlier, the weakest reading since early 2020 when the first Covid lockdowns hit, according to Goldman Sachs' estimates. Within that segment, property investment continued to decline, shrinking 14.7% in the year through October, compared with a 13.9% contraction in the first nine months. China's manufacturing activity contracted more than expected in October, falling to the lowest level in six months, as a weeklong holiday that ran from Oct. 1 to Oct. 8 shuttered most factories across the country. Retail sales climbed 2.9% in October from a year earlier. While beating the 2.8% growth forecast in a Reuters poll, the consumption gauge fell for a fifth straight month to its lowest level this year, according to LSEG data. The survey-based urban unemployment rate ticked down to 5.1% last month from 5.2% in September. The sharp drop in fixed-asset investment was largely dragged down by lackluster investment in the property sector and infrastructure, according to Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. Manufacturing investment has seen "modest and uneven growth," with state-owned enterprises increasing spending on infrastructure, such as electricity, heat and gas supply, while foreign investment contracted sharply, Yuhan Zhang, principal economist of the Conference Board's China Center, said in a note. "We will continue to see policy-directed investment in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and industrial upgrading," he added. In a sign of persistently weak demand in the beleaguered housing sector, separate official data released on Friday showed China's new home prices dipped 0.5% in October from the previous month, the steepest month-on-month decline since October last year. Home prices fell 2.2% in October on an annual basis. Consumer prices rose 0.2% from a year earlier in October, the strongest inflation reading since January this year and the first positive growth since June, according to LSEG data. The core CPI, which strips out food and energy, rose 1.2% from a year earlier, the highest since February 2024, according to data provider Wind Information. China's exports in October unexpectedly contracted for the first time in nearly two years as tensions with Washington over trade escalated before a deal was reached at the month's end. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed last month to trim their tit-for-tat tariffs and suspend a raft of restrictive measures for one year. Economists widely expect the  as businesses' front-loading activity tapers off, and global demand may not fully offset a deepening decline in U.S.-bound shipments, putting Beijing under greater pressure to stimulate domestic demand. "I don't expect stimulus to happen in the rest of this year," said Zhang, noting the economy appears to remain on track to achieve its 5% growth target, although fiscal policy may turn more supportive at the start of next year.
