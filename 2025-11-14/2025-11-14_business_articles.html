                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's views have sparked fears that there will be an exodus of companies and capital from the city. But two of the city's top commercial real estate executives say it's simply not true, based on leasing activity and new building investments being made, with no pullback in plans ever since it became clear Mamdani would win, and through the democratic socialist's official election. "New York City is back," said Scott Rechler, CEO of RXR, at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Thursday. "We're seeing a record level of leasing in office buildings. "We will hit over 40 million square feet in commercial office leases signed at the end of this year," said Bill Rudin, co-executive chairman of Rudin Management. "We haven't seen any diminishment in meetings with brokerage firms," he said of activity since Mamdani's election. No one is calling the moving trucks. Companies are expanding and taking space," Rudin said. One good example: hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin of Citadel Securities, who is known for being outspoken with his conservative political views. Rudin, along with Steve Ross, Vornado Realty and Griffin, is breaking ground on a two-million square foot new office building at 350 Park Avenue. "Ken is committed and will have more employees at 350 Park than in Miami," Rudin said. RXR just signed a 300,000-square-foot lease with a law firm moving in 2029, and Rechler noted that the firm came back last week after the election and said they need to expand by another 200,000 square feet. Rechler noted his firm already has an anchor tenant for a 2.8-million-square-foot project that will replace a Hyatt hotel in the 2031-2032 timeframe. "People believe in New York," he said. RXR has $7 billion in project financing and "you don't get that if people don't believe in the future of New York," he added, though he said it may require "a little bit of a longer lens." But even right now, he said, in the wake of Mamdani's election, the correct word to use with tenants in the high quality office space market is "urgency" to sign deals, with reports he is hearing of companies signing leases that would normally take them a year to agree to within 21 days. ... enormous pipeline on the office side I've never seen my whole career, never seen it as strong as it is right now in tenant demand," Rechler said. "As of today and yesterday, the information we are getting in real time is that tenants are still in the market and looking for good high quality space," Rudin said. One reason for the bullish outlook on New York's real estate market is the need to attract and retain young professional talent. "The people they want to be working in the companies are here in New York City," Rudin said. "People want to be here," he said. Their view of the mayor — both real estate executives have met with him — isn't without reservations. "Mamdani is not necessarily consistent with the capital of capitalism," Rechler said. We have a guy who is caricature, not a character, but a caricature," he said, and that could set Mamdani up to easily be defined as a socialist with no experience and just riding on social media savvy, he added. They hear 'rent freeze,' just hear that word ... and maybe there is a pullback there," Rechler said, citing the fact that the mayor has power to appoint officials to a board overseeing those policies. That perception is leading some institutional investors with whom RXR was talking about large investments in New York City to "pull back and say they want to see how it plays out," Rechler said. He added the tone of these conversations implies that there could be a "chill in capital flows" among these investors. "I've been in the Middle East and Europe and the first thing people want to talk about is Mamdani," he said. They also noted that when Michael Bloomberg was mayor, New York had a $60 billion budget. Now it is a budget of $116 billion, which leads them to believe Mamdani may become more realistic in his management approach than his campaign platform would suggest. "When he first started running, there was no private sector in housing. He has moved off of that," Rudin said. Rudin said the issues the Mayor-elect has raised, such as housing affordability and availability, are legitimate issues, "and we will try to work with him," he said. "What's driving Mamdani's success is the same thing that drove Trump's success," Rudin said, citing a disenfranchised segment of the economy, particularly among younger people, who feel they will not have the same economic opportunities as prior generations. "Now, the Mayor-elect gave them a simple answer, which frankly is not really executable," he said. But Rudin noted since Mamdani's earlier campaigning, he has pulled back from a policy of having government wholly dictate housing, and has expressed willingness to work with the private sector, and he added, it is now "incumbent on us to show him the pathway of how to create the housing we need." "I talked to him before the election," Rudin said. "My sense is a very smart young man willing to listen and hear feedback on the issues." The housing affordability crisis will not be a simple one to fix. Rudin noted that the administration of Mayor Eric Adams set up Mamdani for success by changing zoning laws across boroughs within the last year, but the real estate executives both said wage, labor union, sustainable development policies, and changes in tax provisions that make it less attractive financially to put up buildings over 100 units are all issues that stand in the way. The real estate executives cited tax incentives created due to Covid which are allowing for the conversion of older office buildings into residential properties as another area where they can collaborate on affordable housing construction, with those incentives tied to buildings retaining 25% of units for affordable rents rather market rates. "And I had breakfast with her yesterday and she said income taxes won't be raised under her watch." He added there will be political pressure on Governor Kathy Hochul given her own election needs. "We have a governor's race in a year and she has to serve as that firewall, and if she doesn't, she will not be governor in a year," Rechler said. "The gubernatorial election will be about Mamdani." For now, Rechler said what is maybe most telling about his interactions with Mamdani are a comparison to with how former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio interacted with business leaders when his star was rising. "I met with [Mamdani] for an hour alone and he came in prepared and he was pivoting from campaign to governing mentality and said all the right things," Rechler recalled of a meeting in September when it was clear to him the election outcome was certain. It was a meeting of 12 business leaders, he said, and the former mayor, "he looked around the table of business people and said 'none of you elected me and I'm not here to serve you.' And we lived with that for eight years. This guy at least starts with 'I know I need business people to work with to be successful."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday said that he is asking the Department of Justice to investigate relationships between notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and others. Trump's statement comes as he faces renewed pressure over his own past friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges. In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that "Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax ... to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures. "This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats," Trump wrote "Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.' Trump's post comes two days after he hosted business leaders, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, at a White House dinner. A spokesman for JPMorgan, in a statement to CNBC on Friday, said, "The government had damning information about [Epstein's] crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks." "We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts," said the spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler. "We ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges." Epstein had been a longtime customer of JPMorgan, and also had been friends with former JPMorgan executive Jes Staley. CNBC has requested comment from Clinton, Summers, Hoffman, as well as from the White House and the DOJ, about Trump's post. Emails released by the House Oversight Committee this week show Epstein and others talking about Trump. In a 2018 email thread about Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty charges related to hush money payments on behalf of Trump, Epstein wrote, "I know how dirty donald is." In another thread that same year, Epstein wrote of Trump: "its wild. because I am the one able to take him down." Trump also faces a looming vote by the full House of Representatives on a petition demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein that the DOJ refuses to make public despite prior promises to do so by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials. Trump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long abuse of underage girls and young women. The email does not explain what Epstein meant by that In another email, written in April 2011, Epstein told his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell: "I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump." Epstein, in the same thread, said that a person whose name was redacted in the email but whom lawmakers identified as a victim of his "spent hours at my house with" Trump. "He has never once been mentioned," Epstein added. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence has become one of the biggest investment stories in the market, helping drive a surge of assets into thematic exchange-traded funds that let retail investors bet on major technology trends. It's a simple yet important point for investors to keep in mind as tech stocks look more vulnerable, and are leading the market lower in recent days. "The top performer is up over 150% year to date ... there's several negative 10%," he said. Investors are drawn to thematic ETFs covering trends from AI to quantum computing, clean energy and defense technology, but they often overlook the risks, including how volatile the portfolios can be. Because thematic ETFs focus on specific sectors or technologies rather than just tracking broad indexes, they can deliver strong gains when a theme is in favor, but momentum may fade. Within the disruptive technology category alone, which includes artificial intelligence, flows have been enormous this year. "AI disruptive tech has seen almost $20 billion in flows year to date," Akins said. Roughly $15 billion of that, he said, has "AI" in the ETF name. Its top holdings are Advanced Micro Devices, Alphabet, Samsung, Tesla and Alibaba. Another example from Global X is the Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), which has around $3 billion in assets under management. Its top holdings are Nvidia, ABB, Fanuc, Intuitive Surgical and Keyence. Thematic ETFs do require more research than traditional funds. Case in point: among the 18 ETFs that ETF Action classifies as AI-focused, Akins said there is a performance spread of 60% this year. "Every time you see a new ETF come to market, it introduces significant tracking error from just investing in the market," he said. Through the first nine months of 2025, close to 800 ETFs were launched, besting a record for ETF launches set just last year, according to Reuters. ETFs constructed around the themes of cloud computing and next-generation connectivity, for example, have seen billions of dollars in outflows over the past few years as the companies that were top holdings matured and became part of broad-based stock market indexes already held by investors. He stressed that is not a statement about whether cloud computing or connectivity are good or bad investment themes right now, but simply that there is a "lifecycle" to a theme which can lead to less attention and less flows as the theme matures. But Akins added that the timeline for each trend's momentum is hard to pin down. "That's part of the story with this space ... there's definitely the idea I'm going to invest in this because I believe it's going to play out over the next three to seven years." Despite the recent jitters in the stock market and tech stocks specifically, it is important to note that the Nasdaq is less than 5% off an all-time record level and has gained close to 250% since its Covid low point. Akins said thematic investing is worthwhile for investors who understand what they are buying and can tolerate short-term volatility. Seizing moments of opportunity in the market can also be key with thematic strategies. Significant gains in a short period of time may lead investors to consider taking some profits.

Once-high-flying software companies are now trading at deep discounts as investors worry about how generative AI could upend SaaS business models. According to RBC, software M&A activity has surged 78% this year, with private-equity deal volume more than doubling as sponsors hunt for bargains. While noting they have no knowledge of any such deals, the analysts listed potential targets, all of which have solid customer bases and cash flow but limited AI narratives. Private-equity buyers, less constrained by quarterly earnings pressure, could move quickly to take these companies private, reset expectations, and rebuild them for an AI-first world. While regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for mega-cap tech acquirers, financial sponsors are freer to strike. RBC expects deal momentum to accelerate as sentiment stabilizes and valuations remain depressed. For investors, the AI scare that crushed software stocks might soon become the catalyst for a new consolidation boom, one driven not by hype, but by hard-nosed value hunting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan Chase has secured deals ensuring it will get paid by the fintech firms responsible for nearly all the data requests made by third-party apps connected to customer bank accounts, CNBC has learned. The bank has signed updated contracts with the fintech middlemen that make up more than 95% of the data pulls on its systems, including Plaid, Yodlee, Morningstar and Akoya, according to JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri. "We've come to agreements that will make the open banking ecosystem safer and more sustainable and allow customers to continue reliably and securely accessing their favorite financial products," Pusateri said in a statement. For years, middlemen like Plaid paid nothing to tap bank systems when a customer wanted to use a fintech app like Robinhood to draw funds or check balances. That dynamic appeared to be enshrined in law in late 2024, when the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized what is known as the "open-banking rule" requiring banks to share customer data with other financial firms at no cost. But banks sued to prevent the CFPB rule from taking hold and seemed to gain the upper hand in May after the Trump administration asked a federal court to vacate the rule. Soon after, JPMorgan — the largest U.S. bank by assets, deposits and branches — reportedly told the middlemen that it would start charging what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to its customer data. In response, fintech, crypto and venture capital executives argued that the bank was engaging in "anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior" that would hurt innovation and consumers' ability to use popular apps. After weeks of negotiations between JPMorgan and the middlemen, the bank agreed to lower pricing than it originally proposed, and the fintech middlemen won concessions regarding the servicing of data requests, according to people with knowledge of the talks. Fintech firms preferred the certainty of locking in data-sharing rates because it is unclear whether the current CFPB, which is in the process of revising the open-banking rule, will favor banks or fintech companies, according to a venture capital investor who asked for anonymity to discuss his portfolio companies. "JPMorgan tends to be a trendsetter. Shearer, who worked at the CFPB under former director Rohit Chopra, said he's worried that the development would create a barrier of entry to nascent startups and ultimately result in higher costs for consumers. Proponents of the 2024 CFPB rule said it gave consumers control over their financial data and encouraged competition and innovation. Banks including JPMorgan said it exposed them to fraud and unfairly saddled them with the rising costs of maintaining systems increasingly tapped by the middlemen and their clients. When Plaid's deal with JPMorgan was announced in September, the companies issued a dual press release emphasizing the continuity it provided for customers. But the industry group that Plaid is a part of has harshly criticized the development, signaling that while JPMorgan has won a decisive battle, the ongoing skirmish may yet play out in courts and in the public. "These agreements are not the free market at work, but rather big banks using their market position to capitalize on regulatory uncertainty," Lee said. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's administration said on Friday it was formally withdrawing a plan by his predecessor to require airlines to pay passengers cash compensation when U.S. flight disruptions are caused by carriers. In December 2024, the U.S. Transportation Department under then-President Joe Biden sought public comment on writing rules to require airlines to pay $200 to $300 for domestic delays of at least three hours and up to $775 for longer delays. In September, USDOT first disclosed it planned to withdraw the proposal. On Friday, USDOT said the rules would result in "unnecessary regulatory burdens" in explaining why it would not go forward. Last month, a group of 18 Democratic senators urged the Trump administration not to drop the compensation plan. "This is a common-sense proposal: when an airline's mistake imposes unanticipated costs on families, the airline should try to remedy the situation by providing accommodations to consumers and helping cover their costs," said the letter signed by Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal, Maria Cantwell, Ed Markey and others. Airlines in the U.S. must refund passengers for canceled flights, but are not required to compensate customers for delays. The European Union, Canada, Brazil and Britain all have airline delay compensation rules. No large U.S. airline currently guarantees cash compensation for significant flight disruption. USDOT said Friday in abandoning the compensation plan that it would "allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines." USDOT also announced in September it was considering rescinding Biden regulations requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose service fees alongside airfares. It also plans to reduce regulatory burdens on airlines and ticket agents by writing new rules detailing the definition of a flight cancellation that entitles consumers to ticket refunds, as well as revisiting rules on ticket pricing and advertising.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lianna Frausto, who worked as a sales coordinator for Sonder in San Antonio, said she woke up Sunday morning to a whirlwind of confusion. After the news broke that Marriott had terminated its licensing agreement with Sonder, a short-term apartment rental company, she spent the day reaching out to other employees and trying to figure out what it would mean for their jobs. "Nobody told us that we were fired until the next day," she said. Business Insider spoke to four Sonder employees who described how they coped as they dealt with spotty communication and upset guests, all while confronting an uncertain future. "My employees looked to me for answers, and I didn't know what was going on because I hadn't been told anything," a manager at a Sonder hotel in New York, who learned of the situation from a crying guest, said. As Business Insider has reported, the breakup between the company and Marriott also caused mayhem for guests who were told they needed to leave by 9 a.m. on Monday and that existing reservations would not be honored. Sonder managed 140 Marriott-licensed properties and about 7,700 apartments as of September, according to Marriott's latest earnings report. On Monday, Sonder announced it was filing for bankruptcy protection and ceasing operations. Davidson stepped down earlier this year after Sonder completed its integration with Marriott. "We all felt good about the positive momentum we were seeing in June when I left," he said, "and so to then see that the business has now run into a brick wall, it's just shocking to me." Neither Sonder nor Marriott responded to a request for comment. The New York manager said everything at work was normal on Sunday morning until the guest appeared at 11:30 a.m. and said she'd received a phone notification from Marriott that the company was no longer affiliated with Sonder and that her reservation had been canceled. As of Sunday night, staff had not been officially told they were being let go, the manager said. Logan Ford, a manager of a group sales team at Sonder, said the confusion continued Monday with mixed messages about whether that would be his last day or if he might be asked to stay until Thursday to help close things out with clients. "Monday, I sat there and waited to hear anything from the senior leadership team, but it was just dead air. A Sonder employee who worked in customer support said employees who believed they were all going to be laid off started saying their goodbyes on Slack. Confirmation came in the form of a termination notice email on Monday shortly before 5 p.m. It said they would be paid through November 10 and that their healthcare would remain in place until the end of the month. Employees were told to return their laptops, phones, and other company property. Ethan Werchniak, a guest at a Sonder hotel in Montreal, told Business Insider that he learned he had to vacate the property on Monday morning because an employee knocked on his door to say his reservation had been canceled. "So I don't tear him a new one." Were you laid off due to the termination of Marriott-Sonder's licensing agreement?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brett Johnson spent over a decade breaking into systems, stealing identities, and selling stolen credit cards on the dark web. He stole millions of dollars, often making over $100,000 a month through tax-return identity theft. He told Business Insider's Carter Thallon in a recent interview that the crime world he helped invent is mutating into something harder to see — and almost impossible to stop. Cybercrime is becoming increasingly organized, and that's a problem, he said. Here are the three rising cyber threats that alarm him most. Johnson said deepfakes that convincingly mimic real people will become central to online fraud. Criminals already use them to forge voice messages and fake live video calls. Soon, this technology will make it impossible to trust what we see or hear online, Johnson said. However, deepfakes enable criminals to essentially bypass the effort of gaining trust by posing as an already trustworthy person, accelerating the process of victimizing you. One finance clerk, last year, for example, was conned into approving overseas transfers amounting to more than $25 million, Shubham Agarwal reported for BI. The clerk had been instructed to do so during a video call that turned out to be full of deepfakes recreations of his real coworkers, including the organization's chief financial officer. That threat is compounded by the speed of AI tools, which can mimic speech patterns, create realistic faces, and write messages tailored to a target's personality. Gone are the days when fraudsters acted alone, Johnson said. Some of these operations specialize in "pig butchering," long-term relationship scams that drain victims' savings. That's exactly what happened to Ahmet Tozal, who recently told BI's Matthew Loh of a relationship he built with a supposed woman online. Over several weeks, the woman convinced him to invest over a year's worth of his wages into a cryptocurrency that didn't exist. These scam farms are structured businesses, with workers rotating shifts and supervisors overseeing them. "Back then, you did see criminals working together, networking in a co-op type fashion. The same automation fueling deepfakes is driving identity fraud to a new level. It's especially concerning because "synthetic fraud is almost invisible because that person doesn't really exist," he said, adding that "it's 80% of all new account fraud. Once a fake identity establishes credit, it can be used to open bank accounts, apply for loans, or facilitate money laundering. If synthetic IDs continue to rise, it could make fraud detection exponentially harder. "A criminal now doesn't have to understand any aspect of the crime. They can immediately buy tutorials, take live instruction classes, buy anything that they need online, and immediately start being successful and profitable at crime," Johnson said. Johnson told BI's Manseen Logan earlier this year, six ways to lower your risk of hacking:</p>

Remember when Reels was dismissed as Meta's attempt to clone TikTok? Well, now the five-year-old app is on track to generate $50 billion a year. It's turned into a huge win for Meta, and it has become one of the biggest "creator economy" businesses in the world. But that number also makes something else clear: The creator economy's biggest winners aren't creators. Everyone else —Meta, TikTok, Snap — offers a different deal, which goes like this: Give us your stuff, for free. Maybe we'll give a small subset of you some kind of bonus from a "creator program" or something like that. But for the most part, we'll make money selling ads against your stuff on our platform — and you'll have to find another way to make money. This is not news to people in and around the creator economy (again: you could just say "media business"). But Meta's boast about its success — made by Mark Zuckerberg last month, during his Q3 earnings call — puts it in sharp relief. But a $50 billion business built on other people's content that you get more or less for free? Even better for Meta and its peers: There's no sense that any of this is going to change. Every so often, someone will tell me about their plan to make it happen: They'll convince a bunch of content creators to take their stuff off the non-sharing platforms unless they get a better deal. And Meta and its peers have a pretty good argument for why that doesn't happen, though they generally don't say this out loud (I've asked Meta for comment). It's that their massive platforms offer creators the promise of exposure, which they can parlay into businesses they can build on their own. Sure, maybe Meta isn't going to give you a meaningful cut of the money it makes selling ads against your videos. The world's biggest video site kicked off the creator economy way back in 2007, when it launched its "partner program," which still exists today. That one gives (most) big YouTube video-makers 55% of any ad dollars attached to their videos. And while YouTube creators have spent years complaining about that split, it's still the best deal in town. Why haven't other platforms tried to do the same thing? Sometimes they'll mention that it's difficult to figure out how to share revenue for videos you swipe past in a vertical feed. But the real answer is that they've found they don't have to — why pay for something you can get for free? Even YouTube, the one platform that built real economics for creators, is backing away a bit. Shorts — its TikTok clone — gives creators a smaller cut, and ties payouts to a shared pool of ad money, not their actual videos.</p>

Nvidia is navigating some growing pains as its enterprise software sales team onboards massive clients in highly regulated industries. At the same time, internal emails sent this summer by senior sales employees in its Worldwide Field Operations — which works with customers to deploy its technology — reveal it's contending with some hurdles as it tries to tell clients a "comprehensive software story" and sell those products alongside its highly sought-after AI hardware. The emails refer to sales of Nvidia AI Enterprise (NVAIE) and other software products, including Run:ai, which helps companies manage GPUs; Omniverse, a platform for simulating 3D worlds; and vGPU, which enables multiple workers to share GPUs. It was launched in 2021 and designed to run with Nvidia's AI chips and CUDA, a Nvidia software package that allows the chips to handle a wide range of computing tasks. NVAIE's customer list includes Nasdaq, the IRS, and AT&T. These internal discussions focus on the sale of those Nvidia business software products — not CUDA. Nvidia specializes in designing GPUs and other AI hardware, which is the company's main business, and it doesn't break out revenues for business software in earnings reports. While software is a smaller part of its business, it helps the company generate recurring revenue for a wider range of AI products across both hardware and software and deepen customer dependence. One internal email, sent in July, features a sales chart for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 in North and Latin America that shows stand-alone software is projected to hit 110% of sales targets. Software sold alongside hardware was expected to reach only 39% of its goal. The July email states Nvidia's sales partners and account managers need to develop a "comprehensive software story" around NVAIE and other software products. An email in August detailed the need for additional education — both internally and when negotiating with clients. "Biggest pain point will be educating [a prospective client's] procurement and legal teams on what our AI Enterprise software is/isn't," the August email reads. Data security and indemnity obligations, which are Nvidia's legal responsibility in the event that a client is sued, were other sticking points in negotiations, according to the August email. Other concerns included requesting higher damages caps — the maximum amount that Nvidia would have to pay if something goes wrong — than Nvidia is comfortable with. Nvidia is far from alone in contending with uneven AI adoption, as some companies view the white-hot technology as too early to deploy widely, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report.</p>

Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies — which lower the cost of marketplace coverage for middle- and low-income households — are set to expire December 31. And, without a healthcare spending agreement from Congress, it's likely they won't be renewed. With open enrollment underway for those plans, Americans could be facing a new round of insurance sticker shock. They also didn't reverse President Donald Trump's changes to Medicaid, another goal for Democrats. Low- and middle-income households will feel the brunt of losing enhanced ACA subsidies. This is partially because the enhanced subsidies were available to middle-income Americans up to 400% of the poverty line — which is $128,600 for a family of four — making marketplace plans more affordable. Without these credits in place, people on ACA plans could see their out-of-pocket premium costs increase by an average of over 75%, a KFF analysis shows. Some enrollees would see their financial relief shrink and others would be disqualified entirely, depending on their income, with some premiums increasing by over $1,000 annually. On top of the direct loss of the enhanced subsidies, many insurers are likely to increase premiums to offset a projected decline in enrollment among healthier Americans. Last year, nearly 20 million Americans received these enhanced ACA subsidies. Medicaid recipients could also see an increase in their healthcare costs. In the legislation, the president called for new Medicaid qualifications that would require non-exempt Americans to work 80 hours a month to qualify for insurance. Hospitals in rural areas and low-income Americans are likely to be highly impacted. As of mid-2025, about 83 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rising violence in Mali has forced Ivory Coast to implement an emergency border lockdown. Ivory Coast has strengthened security along its northern border following an unexpected surge in refugees fleeing violence in neighbouring Mali. According to a statement issued on Thursday, Ivory Coast's National Security Council (NSC) linked the sudden influx to “attacks against civilians by armed terrorist groups in several areas of southern Mali.” The council said it has moved swiftly to ensure that those arriving are properly documented, noting that “The National Security Council has instructed its Executive Secretary to take all necessary steps to register these asylum seekers.” The refugee influx arrives at a pivotal moment for Côte d'Ivoire, which recently held its presidential election on 25 October 2025 and continues to garner international recognition for its sound economic management. The country has been widely lauded for maintaining macroeconomic stability and a predictable policy environment that reduces investor risk, strengthening its position as one of West Africa's most attractive investment destinations. In 2024, Côte d'Ivoire ranked third in Africa for foreign direct investment, drawing $3.80 billion, a remarkable 53 percent year-on-year increase compared to the previous year. This momentum has carried into 2025, highlighted by the commissioning of a 3-million-metric-tonne Dangote Cement plant in Attingué. Formed in 2017 through the merger of several jihadist factions, JNIM has steadily expanded its operations beyond Mali into Burkina Faso, Niger, Ghana, Benin, Togo, and Ivory Coast. In October, the group carried out its first confirmed attack in Nigeria, killing a soldier and seizing ammunition and cash. The insurgent group has also sought to pressure Mali's military authorities by blocking key transport routes from Senegal and Ivory Coast, creating fuel shortages and causing severe economic strain in Bamako. Ivory Coast, which already hosts about 90,000 refugees from Burkina Faso, now faces additional demands with the arrival of Malian nationals.
