                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>– It's been almost seven months since Gio Reyna was last with the U.S. men's national team. What are the attacking midfielder's teammates saying about how he has looked? "I feel like he's more in-tune and more focused on the field than I've seen in the past, which is a great thing," defender Tim Ream told the throng of reporters at the USMNT's training session on a brisk fall Friday outside of Philadelphia. It's now two years removed from his standout performance in the 2024 Concacaf Nations League final, when his second-half goal sealed the Americans' third consecutive title in that event. "I'm looking forward to playing with Gio," U.S. striker Folarin Balogun said, who scored his first international goal on an assist by Reyna in the 2023 Nations League final win over Canada. … As he has shown in training already, [Reyna can] make a good impact and help us in both games." Reyna's inclusion on Pochettino's November roster last week raised eyebrows, given that the silky attacking midfielder has yet to start a game for Borussia Mönchengladbach since signing with the German Bundesliga club in August. Still, Ream has noticed a difference in Reyna this week. "Whether it was injury or other things that were going on, I think his focus is so much greater now," Ream noted. Ream didn't elaborate on the "other things" he was alluding to. But it hasn't gone unnoticed that Pochettino named both Reyna and Sebastian Berhalter, son of former USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter, to this current squad. The elder Berhalter and Reyna's parents, former U.S. national teamers Claudio and Danielle, were embroiled in a well-documented public spat following the 2022 World Cup. Not surprisingly, Ream was asked if the presence of both players had been an "issue" behind the scenes. "I actually completely forgot about it until like, the third or fourth day of camp," Ream said. "And I was like, oh, wait a minute. But no, it's not really been discussed amongst the team. "We've all kind of moved on from it, and they have as well. Everybody's trying to be a part of a home World Cup … it's good to see that their focus is here and now. And hopefully both of those guys can impress over the next couple months." Right-back Sergiño Dest said Reyna has looked sharp on the practice fields through the first four sessions this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tuchel explained before Thursday's qualifying win over Serbia that he would not play squad members out of position for the sake of getting all of his strongest players onto the pitch at once. Competition for places is particularly high among the forwards in the England squad, with Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden named as substitutes at Wembley, and with Cole Palmer and Anthony Gordon missing through injury. “For the last eight-ten minutes there is no one sat there thinking, ‘I should be on the field, I should be on the field, why am I not there?' “I experienced this once in the amazing run with Chelsea and it was non-stop, everyone was pushing and fighting from the bench even if they were not picked and they were ready. Even if they are disappointed, which is absolutely normal.” Tuchel added the role of substitutes would be particularly important given next summer's World Cup takes place in the United States, Mexico and Canada, with extreme conditions expected. “They will never be happy, they don't have to be happy, no one is used to sitting on the bench, this is the nature of a strong national team,” he added. “You see already I normally pick only 21 of 23 (players in a squad) because I just hate this talk I had to give yesterday to Alex Scott, the message, ‘you are not in the squad'. I don't like it, I have stomach pain and even to see players on the bench, they will never like it but I strongly believe they will accept it. Once we go to a tournament — what is your role? I think in a ten day camp it is easy. But once we go to a tournament, I think clarity in the role is very important.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>⚽ Friday's World Cup qualifiers, 7.45pm GMT kick-offs ⚽ Live scores | Tables | Read Football Daily | Mail Luke 7 min: Kaminski darts down the Poland left and shoots low, but straight at Verbruggen. “One element of qualification that doesn't seem to have got much attention yet is the (in my humble one) lunacy of the Nations League route to a playoff,” emails Tom. “Sweden have had about as bad a qualifying campaign as you could imagine, yet throughout they've been all but guaranteed a playoff spot. I get that Uefa wants to make its new(ish) tournament attractive, but undermining their World Cup qualification groups seems an odd way of going about that. Matty Cash is in space on the right, and crosses for Nicola Zalewski, who is six yards out with only the keeper to beat. The bouncing ball gets a bit big on him, and he shins a clumsy effort over the bar and wide. I'll be keeping an eye on goals elsewhere too. I make no apology for also posting Zielinski's recent work of art: Here's that Micky van de Ven belter from the other week: I can't see the name Micky van de Ven without thinking of Peep Show and “Men with Ven”. Poland's recent record in major tournaments is woeful. Malta's earlier win in Finland meant that Poland's playoff place is secure. Surely, though, Poland are too far behind on goal difference to win the group, even if they win tonight? As readers of today's earlier blog will know, he scored a belting side-footed volley for Inter the other week. Which countries have qualified, and how did they do it? This article by Andy Martin does exactly what it says on the tin: Substitutes: Pongracic, Caleta-Car, Sutalo, Moro, Orsic, Vlasic, Jakic, Fruk, Ivanovic, Matanovic, Ivusic, Pandur. Faroe Islands: Lamhauge, Faero, Gunnar Vatnhamar, Andrias Edmundsson, Rene Shaki Joensen, Turi, Andreasen, Davidsen, Frederiksberg, Hanus Sorensen, Meinhard Olsen.

Substitutes: Hazard, Southwood, Lewis, Devlin, Marshall, Donley, Smyth, Reid, Kelly, McDonnell, Magennis, Brown. The head coach will prepare a heat-proof gameplan for the finals next summer when temperatures at many of the venues in the United States, Mexico and Canada are expected to be stifling and a major part will involve how best to use his substitutes. Poland (4-4-1-1): Grabara; Kedziora, Ziolkowski, Kiwior, Cash; Szymanski, Zielinski, Skoras, Zalewski; Kaminski; Lewandowski. Substitutes: Kochalski, Szczesniak, Rozga, Swiderski, Kapustka, Grosicki, Wszolek, Buksa, Kozlowski, Bereszynski, Dragowski. Substitutes: Flekken, Valente, Quinten Timber, Lang, Reijnders, Schouten, Roefs, Van Hecke, Emegha, Simons, Ake, De Ligt. “The Maltese are celebrating, as they should, while the Finns look shell-shocked,” writes Kári Tulinius, watching events unfold in Helsinki. “I'd say the post-match commentary on Finnish TV was funereal, but it was more like a group of people discussing whether they should stage an intervention. Things can always get worse, that's my motto. Finland have just lost 1-0 at home to Malta, which is a turn-up for the books in Group G. Jake Grech's goal on 81min won it for the visitors. Luxembourg: Moris, Jans, Korac, Carlson, Bohnert, Olivier Thill, Martins Pereira, Olesen, Barreiro, Sinani, Dardari. Substitutes: Djabi Embalo, Curci, Avdusinovic, Muratovic, Pereira Cardoso, Veiga, Selimovic, Dzogovic, Sebastien Thill, Martins, Fox, Moreira.

Substitutes: Popovic, Petkovic, Milic, Simun, Rubezic, Vesovic, Brnovic, Perovic, Djukanovic, Kostic, Loncar, Camaj. Can the Netherlands do it on a cold night in Warsaw? On Monday Poland are away in Malta while the Netherlands host Lithuania. Gibraltar v Montenegro is also a football match, whether it counts as top, I will leave others to decide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poland must topple the Netherlands at home on Friday to stand any shot of tying down an automatic qualifying spot ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The gloves are off in Warsaw on Friday as Poland fight for their World Cup future at home to the Netherlands, with the leading pair in UEFA qualifying Group G set to square off. The Eagles currently trail the Dutch by three points in second place and need a home win this weekend to stand a realistic shot of securing first place and automatic qualification for the tournament. De Oranje, on the other hand, know that even a draw would be enough to effectively guarantee them top spot, with the gulf in goal difference currently looking too vast for Poland to overcome in the next two games. However, Poland is also fighting for a spot in the play-offs, with third-place Finland breathing down its neck and just three points behind. Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman has almost a fully fit squad at his disposal aside from the absence of Liverpool right-back Jeremie Frimpong. Poland, meanwhile, is missing a few potential starters in Jan Bednarek, Krzysztof Piatek, and Lukasz Skorupski. Live stream Poland vs. Netherlands on Fubo PPV with Fubo: Start your subscription now!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United States defender Auston Trusty walks on the sidelines prior to a friendly soccer match against the New Zealand, Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2024, in Cincinnati. CHESTER, Pa. — Auston Trusty's first experiences with Mark McKenzie and Brenden Aaronson were as teens in a cramped youth soccer dressing room. Now 27, the defender is together with his long-time friends on the U.S. national team, all trying to earn spots on next year's World Cup roster. “When we think about it, we kind of laugh and say, like, that's crazy,” Trusty related ahead of Saturday's friendly against Paraguay. “It's pretty cool to know that we've all kind of been in the same journey together.” Trusty's interest in soccer was sparked by watching his older sister Onnie, a defender who earned a letter for Florida State in 2006.

Credit: AP/Matthias Schrader While Aaronson and McKenzie debuted for the U.S. against Costa Rica in 2020, and Trusty played his first international in the CONCACAF Nations League at Grenada on March 24, 2023, Freese debuted against Turkey this past June and supplanted Matt Turner as the starter. Since Trusty's debut, his three national team appearances were all as a substitute, against Canada in June 2023, Mexico in October 2024 and Jamaica during coach Mauricio Pochettino's first camp last November. With Chris Richards and injured Celtic teammate Cameron Carter-Vickers absent, Trusty is one of only three central defenders in camp, joined by McKenzie and Tim Ream. Pochettino has been experimenting this fall with a three center-back formation, increasing the chance Trusty will see significant minutes during the games against No. “He has a better — much better — kind of understanding of the different kind of positions, the different tactical shapes and, really, he's just gained a lot more experience and as a center back that's the biggest thing.” Defender Auston Trusty poses before a United States men's national team soccer training session, Friday, Nov. 14, 2025, at Chester, Pa. Credit: AP/Ronald Blum During his year away from the national team, Trusty had been watching its games online despite the late-night and early morning starts. He was a second-half substitute in Celtic's first three games, then felt pain in his right foot during a Champions League qualifier against Kazakhstan's Kairat Almaty on Aug. 20. Trusty was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis and didn't play again until Oct. 29. So at the bottom of your foot it doesn't have that much circulation and blood flow." Trusty returned six days after Carter-Vickers injured an Achilles against Sturm Graz in the Europa League and two days after Martin O'Neill replaced Brendan Rodgers as manager. “I know they're watching every single game,” he said of the Pochettino's staff. Trusty assisted on Callum McGregor's go-ahead goal in extra time of a Scottish League Cup semifinal against Rangers and was selected man of the match in a Scottish Premier League game against Kilmarnock on Sunday. “We are a little bit short in that area.” Trusty is left-footed and was paired with the right-footed Carter-Vickers at Celtic. “Luckily for the team I can play on right side comfortably,” Trusty said. So, yeah, I've been able to step in and get some positive results.” Privacy Policy | Terms of service | Subscription terms | Your ad choices | Cookie Settings | California Privacy Rights | About Us | Contact Newsday | Reprints & permissions | Advertise with Newsday | Help</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Chelsea star Oscar is reportedly considering retirement after being hospitalised with a heart issue. The 34-year-old is said to have fallen ill during a bicycle test at current side São Paulo and since then, he has been diagnosed with vasovagal syncope, where the blood pressure drops too low, causing people to faint. Now, reports suggest the Brazilian is weighing up whether or not to end his career. After spending eight years playing in China, Oscar rejoined São Paulo on a deal until 2027 at the end of last year. The Brazilian team said on Thursday: "Midfielder Oscar remains hospitalized at Einstein Hospital Israelita, where he was admitted on Tuesday afternoon after presenting an intercurrence with cardiological changes during exams carried out at SuperCT. Following the incident, Oscar - who started his career at São Paulo way back in 2008 - posted in an Instagram story: "Everything will be alright, God willing." While he is seemingly staying upbeat, Brazilian publication Globo states that Oscar - who moved to Shanghai in 2017 in a £60 million ($79m) move that reportedly pocketed him around £400,000 a week - is mulling over whether or not to retire from football. They add that it may be more likely he hangs up his boots, rather than continuing. The report states: "According to a specialist heard by Globo, the problem is not life-threatening and can be solved with medication or simple surgical intervention, where a ganglion is cauterized to avoid getting out of control. For now, Oscar still has no discharge forecast. The biggest tendency is for him to leave professional football." According to the NHS, vasovagal syncope is common, can affect anyone, and is often a temporary problem affecting the body's control system (autonomic nervous system). If you get warning symptoms, sufferers should lie down and squeezing firmly on a ball may be helpful. Football fans will be eagerly awaiting to hear from Oscar, who played 203 times for Chelsea and scored 38 goals between 2012-17 before joining Shanghai Port, again and whether or not he will continue his playing career. After making more than 500 appearances in club football, playing 48 times for Brazil, and winning trophies in England, China, and his home country, he may decide that for the good of his health, it is time to move on to something different. However, the Brazilian may still have another chapter to write in his footballing journey.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has issued a stark warning that the global appeal of football is being jeopardised by an increasing imbalance favouring international fixtures. His comments come amid growing concerns over the impact of expanded international competitions on domestic leagues. Further anxieties surround the expanded summertime Club World Cup, with leagues fearing economic and player welfare repercussions, particularly given discussions of increasing its size from 32 to 48 teams and holding it biennially. He stated: "(This meeting) is the best attended we've ever had and it's no surprise it comes at a time when the balance between national and international football is under threat from the unprecedented expansion of international competitions." Masters continued, stressing the need for caution: "We cannot take football's global popularity, its fans and its players for granted by fracturing this balance through an overloaded international calendar. All our members are united in their belief that to restore this balance domestic leagues must be protected." He added that "dialogue with FIFA is now crucial and it is in the best interests of football to involve the leagues in any future decisions about the international calendar." This sentiment is echoed by European Leagues and FIFPRO, the world players' union, who have lodged a legal complaint with the European Commission against FIFA. They allege FIFA is abusing its dominant position under EU competition law, acting as both regulator and competition organiser, thereby causing economic and sporting harm to domestic leagues and compromising player welfare. FIFA, however, maintains it is within its rights to organise competitions like the Club World Cup within the existing international calendar.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With just a few weeks to go before he's out of office, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has a big ask of his colleagues on the City Commission: approve up to $7.5 million in city services to support FIFA-sanctioned events when the World Cup games come to town next year. The city's proposal to donate services from police, fire-rescue, sanitation and more follows a request from the local World Cup host committee, which is independent of FIFA, according to the legislation. While the World Cup games are taking place in Miami Gardens — a separate municipality — Suarez said he's expecting a flurry of related events to happen in the city of Miami. That includes FIFA Fan Festival, taking place in downtown's Bayfront Park, which Suarez said will draw “over 1 million attendees.” “Beyond FanFest, we anticipate several FIFA sanctioned activations within city limits, all of which will generate significant economic and cultural value,” Suarez said. “Put simply: this investment ensures Miami shows the world who we are, while maximizing the economic return for our residents and businesses.” READ MORE: Amid budget squeeze, a Miami-Dade commissioner wants to cancel World Cup subsidy Griffin was on the roster at a major business conference Suarez organized last week. Speaking onstage, Griffin said: “If [Suarez] asks me to jump, the only answer is how high.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino was also a featured speaker at the event.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dynamic pricing sparks outrage as parking rivals premium event costs across venues Dubai: World Cup ticket holders should brace for an unexpected expense at next year's tournament: parking. Prices on FIFA's official website have soared as high as $175 per car, stunning fans across the United States، a country where driving to major events is the norm and public transit options are limited. The U.S. is one of three World Cup hosts, alongside Canada and Mexico. Parking at the July 11 quarterfinal in Kansas City will cost $125, and again $75for group-stage fixtures. Major host cities, including Mexico City, which will open the tournament, and New York-New Jersey, which will host the final, have not yet made any parking available. Many US host cities lack the public-transport infrastructure common in Europe and other footballing regions. All 11 American stadiums set to host matches are NFL venues surrounded by vast parking lots, yet during the World Cup, much of that space will fall inside security perimeters or be repurposed for hospitality zones, making parking more scarce and more valuable. FIFA received more than 1.5 million ticket applicationswithin 24 hours of launching its presale draw in September. Now, with parking prices rivaling premium event experiences, fans are left wondering: At the 2026 World Cup, how expensive will it be just to show up?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team take on Paraguay in the first of two November friendlies as 2026 FIFA World Cup preparation ramps up. After a positive October camp with results against Ecuador and Australia, manager Mauricio Pochettino is without numerous stars. Players like Christian Pulisic, Malik Tillman, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie and Chris Richards were not selected for the two November friendlies. For every player absent, however, there's fringe players looking to further make their cases for a roster spot next year. Particularly in midfield given Pochettino has yet to settle on a favored pivot. Here's how the USMNT's XI could look like against Paraguay. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC (US Only). GK: Matt Freese—The New York City FC goalkeeper looks set to be the starting goalkeeper for 2026 barring an unforeseen drop in form. CB: Mark McKenzie—McKenzie made one substitute appearance back in October, but should start with Chris Richards absent. The 38-year-old has been a consistent name in Pochettino XIs. RWB: Alex Freeman—The MLS Young Player of the Year has been a standout performer, flying up and down the right flank. CM: Tanner Tessmann—Pochettino has favored Tessmann in a box-to-box midfield role since taking over. The 24-year-old is in line for another opportunity given Tyler Adams had to withdraw from camp. CM: Cristian Roldan—Roldan is fully focused on earning a 2026 World Cup roster spot after the Seattle Sounders were eliminated from the MLS Cup playoffs. The Columbus Crew product is more effective as a wingback looking to get forward. With Tim Weah and Malik Tillman both absent, the Borussia Mönchengladbach player gets a big opportunity to endear himself to Pochettino. ST: Folarin Balogun—Balogun recently scored his first career Champions League goal and was one of the best USMNT players last camp. LW: Diego Luna—Another MLS product, Luna has been a fan-favorite in multiple camps this year. He should see notable playing time against Paraguay and Uruguay on the left.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portugal were trailing 2-0 when Ronaldo clashed with Dara O'Shea, hitting his elbow into the defender's back. The incident was Ronaldo's first red card for Portugal in his 226th appearance. Earlier this week, Ronaldo announced next year's World Cup would be his final major tournament, but now he is likely to miss the start of it. The red card he received automatically carries a one-match suspension, ruling him out of Sunday's crucial qualifier against Armenia. But violent conduct almost always carries an extended suspension and the extra games would only be served in competitive fixtures. If Portugal get the win they need against Armenia to qualify directly, their next competitive match would be their opening group game at the World Cup. Technically, Fifa could opt not to extend Ronaldo's ban at all, meaning he would not be at risk of missing the start of the tournament. However, Fifa disciplinary code states that a red card for "assault, including elbowing, punching, kicking, biting, spitting or hitting an opponent" should carry a three-match suspension. That would see Ronaldo miss Portugal's first two World Cup group games or both play-off matches. For instance, at the 2023 Women's World Cup, England forward Lauren James was given two matches for stamping on the back of Nigeria's Michelle Alozie. So, Ronaldo should be banned for three games, but he might only receive a two-match suspension. This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.

The goals were standout moments of quality on a rain-soaked night in which already-qualified England struggled to hit the high levels they've reached in recent internationals. But Thomas Tuchel's side were markedly improved after he intervened midway through the first half after a lacklustre and sloppy start to the game from his team. England had been 3-0 up by half-time in their past three internationals - including a 5-0 thrashing of Serbia in Belgrade - but were alarmingly slow out of the blocks here until an impromptu Tuchel team talk shook things up when Jordan Pickford went down calling for treatment on 23 minutes. With Harry Kane dropping deeper to turn playmaker and Declan Rice more advanced, Saka and Marcus Rashford suddenly began to threaten. As well as Saka's volley, there were more good chances before half-time, with Kane heading wide and Rogers glancing off target after Rashford and Rice were unable to capitalise on a counter. There were let-offs in the second half, though, with Dusan Vlahovic flicking wide and then clipping the roof of the net as Serbia - increasingly desperate - searched for an equaliser to save their World Cup hopes. This result, though, coupled with Albania also winning in Andorra, ends their chances of a top-two finish in Group K. They are still yet to concede in this campaign, with Pickford's England record run of international clean sheets stretching to 10 matches. But at the other end of the pitch there is intrigue into how Tuchel will utilise all his attacking options. There were just a handful of Serbia supporters in the away section at Wembley. Bellingham and Foden - benched with Tuchel favouring Morgan Rogers at No 10 - finally entered the fray after an hour. Foden, as a false nine, nodded a headed chance wide but made his mark late on, chipping a wonderful pass for an Eze shot to be tipped onto the bar before assisting his team-mate for England's second. 2026 World Cup dates, venues and expanded format There were a couple of exciting combinations with Reece James but ultimately the Real Madrid man became frustrated. If anything, this was another night in which Rogers once again showed why he is liked by Tuchel despite competition at No 10 from high-profile team-mates. It is a battle which will run right up until the World Cup. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player "We wanted to have quality and impact and new energy from the bench which we got. A special compliment to Jordan and the back four today. There was some intense output we had to give to get the clean sheet and win the game. Maybe throughout the match we lacked a little bit of precision with the last pass, otherwise we could have created more and scored earlier to be a bit more calm. "England don't play with a striker. Harry Kane played like a deep midfielder. Phil Foden came on as a false nine. Lots of people called for a Danny Welbeck to support Kane, but do England even need that out-and-out No 9? England were dire in the first 25 minutes. So many clever incisive balls from England's defensive midfielder. That No 6 role is his to lose, with Adam Wharton only given five minutes to impress. Ezri Konsa looked good, with a couple of last-ditch challenges. Who out of him, John Stones and Marc Guehi fill the two spots? The Man City left-back did not look out of place on England debut - he lasted the 90 minutes. Is that spot his to lose too? "And Bellingham is still not at it. "So happy to be back in the squad. I thought I did well, created a few chances and unlucky not to put a couple away. Overall, I have to be happy with the impact." On his role as striker: "I'll play wherever the manager puts me. "There are quality players all over the pitch. I know there is pressure on me to perform at Man City and I just have to keep my head down and earn my place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino's team is on a three-match unbeaten run, finally showing some promise and building some momentum ahead of the World Cup. However, they will be challenged by Paraguay, which is also preparing for next summer. Following a concerning loss to South Korea in September, the U.S. has turned things around. Saturday's opponent, Paraguay, is coming off a successful World Cup qualification campaign. They were also victorious in a 1-0 win over Paraguay during the 2016 Copa América despite playing most of the second half with 10 players. Our final roster of the year is here! While it seems like Pochettino is starting to put the pieces together for next year's World Cup, this will not be the USMNT at full strength. Injuries and circumstances at club level will leave the U.S. without the likes of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Tyler Adams, Malik Tillman, Chris Richards, Tim Weah, and Weston McKennie for the November window. All seven are potential starts, leaving some uncertainty as to how the USMNT will lineup against Paraguay. Matt Freese (GK) - Miles Robinson, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream - Sergiño Dest, Aidan Morris, Tanner Tessmann, Max Arfsten - Brenden Aaronson, Folarin Balgoun, Gio Reyna Roberto Fernandez (GK) - Juan Caceres, Gustavo Gomez, Omar Alderete, Junior Alonso - Damian Bobadilla, Andres Cubas - Hugo Cuenca, Diego Gomez, Miguel Almiron - Antonio Sanabria Paraguay should be a good test for the U.S., especially since Pochettino's side is missing several key figures. The South American side has just two losses in its last 14 matches, although one of those came in a friendly against South Korea last month. That stretch also includes victories over Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay in World Cup qualifying matches, so Paraguay can compete against high-level teams. They have a veteran backline that's helped them to keep seven clean sheets in their last 14 matches. Only four times in those 14 matches has their opponent scored multiple goals. On the other hand, both Japan and South Korea scored two goals against them in friendlies last month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Which is to say, there's not much interaction at all. “I feel like in-season, he kinda lets you deal with your club and lets you focus on your coach and stuff there,” USMNT defender Alex Freeman told The Post this week. I think he lets you be at your club. That is not to imply that Pochettino isn't building the necessary relationships with his players or doing the legwork in between international windows amid the run-up to next summer's World Cup that will be the most important event for American soccer perhaps ever. When Freeman showed up at camp for the Gold Cup over the summer, Pochettino took him aside for a 20-minute conversation that included extensive feedback on his game. Just having him as a coach, you can tell he's very passionate about the sport and he wants the best out of all of us.” Pochettino has admitted he didn't know Cristian Roldan before making the midfielder a late call-up two months ago. But when Roldan arrived for his first camp under the Argentine, Pochettino established a relationship immediately, nevertheless. I think that those things correlate to success. And I felt like he did a great job of just bringing me in and making it seem seamless.” That was crucial for Roldan's successful re-entry into the national team fold. “So just bringing that same energy back is really important. Definitely trust is the first word I'd put to it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The former president of Spain's national football federation has had eggs thrown at him during a book launch. Rubiales made international headlines after he kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso at the conclusion of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final in Sydney. Rubiales was charged with sexual assault and was convicted by Spain's High Court in February this year. A Foreign Correspondent investigation has detailed the decades of sexism and misogyny leading up to the infamous World Cup kiss. Luis Rubiales resigned as president of the RFEF (Royal Spanish Football Federation) after he kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso, who was collecting her winner's medal following Spain's 1-0 win over England in the final at Sydney's Stadium Australia. The 48-year-old has written a book called Matar a Rubiales (Kill Rubiales), which he says, according to ESPN, is "for those who want to know the reality". During a book launch event on Thursday (local time) in Madrid, someone from the audience threw eggs at Rubiales. "I didn't know what he had in his hands," Rubiales told Radio Marca. Rubiales was fined 10,800 euros ($19,200) following his conviction in February, but was acquitted on a charge of coercion. A Spanish court rejected Rubiales's appeal of his conviction in June.
