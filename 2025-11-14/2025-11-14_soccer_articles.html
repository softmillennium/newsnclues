                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England moved within touching distance of unprecedented World Cup qualifying history after a composed 2-0 victory over Serbia at Wembley maintained their flawless defensive record. With Thomas Tuchel's side yet to concede in the campaign, a clean sheet against Albania would make them the first European nation ever to complete an eight-game qualifying cycle without letting in a single goal. England cruised to another victory as they defeated Serbia 2-0 at Wembley on Thursday, stretching their perfect record in the 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign. The match followed a familiar pattern in this qualifying cycle, with England asserting dominance early and forcing Serbia to defend deep for long spells. Harry Kane's movement, Saka's incisiveness and Declan Rice's control ensured Serbia were rarely able to build sustained attacks, while England's defence remained largely untroubled aside from isolated counterattacks. England's clean sheet was also significant, extending their run to seven games without conceding, already a rare feat in UEFA World Cup qualifying. Should the Three Lions avoid conceding in their final qualifier against Albania, they would become the first European nation ever to complete an eight-game World Cup qualifying campaign without letting in a goal. It would surpass even the great England side of 1990, which finished a six-game campaign without conceding. Stones, Konsa and Rice have all played crucial roles in sustaining England's impeccable defensive record. This campaign has also highlighted Tuchel's insistence on competition for places, with no player guaranteed a starting role regardless of club form or reputation. Tuchel has repeatedly stressed that his focus is on building collective unity, and England's ability to rotate without losing fluidity underscores how deeply the squad has bought into his approach. Top spot in the group is already secured and Albania are locked into second place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India supporters cheer their team during a game against Qatar (Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The men's World Cup is bigger than ever. Last month, Cape Verde — whose 525,000 inhabitants make it the second-smallest country by population ever to qualify — joined Jordan and Uzbekistan as first-time participants. Editor's note: Population figures are taken from Worldometer at date of publication. None of the three nations have participated in a World Cup finals. In 1950, India qualified by default, but opted not to take part after reported disagreements over team selection, and insufficient practice time. That was the fourth edition of the World Cup and came just three years after India and Pakistan (from which Bangladesh gained independence in 1971) gained independence and were partitioned into separate states. India have not come close to qualifying for a World Cup since. India's best football moment came in 1964, when they were runners-up to Israel (then a member of the Asian Football Confederation) in a four-team edition of the Asian Cup. Pakistan have never qualified for any major tournament, while Bangladesh lost all four of their matches in their sole appearance at the Asian Cup in 1980. Cricket is the national sport due to its colonial legacy from British rule and is a major strand of national identity. The prevalence of cricket, in part, helps explain the lack of infrastructure and funding for football — which may not hold national sport status but remains extremely popular, as evidenced by the passionate local support for Argentina and Brazil at major tournaments. Pakistan, meanwhile, remains the world's largest country without a national football league. Unlike the Indian subcontinent, China's continued struggles in men's football are complex. They have featured just once at the World Cup, in the 2002 edition held in neighbouring Japan and South Korea, losing all three matches without scoring a goal. Huge corporations such as Suning (retail) and Evergrande (real estate) were urged to bankroll the Chinese Super League (CSL). In return, they would gain greater global exposure for their brands and, significantly, presidential approval. A series of big-money transfers followed, but the project proved unsustainable. Tight financial regulations were introduced, with non-Chinese player signings heavily taxed. President Xi, who assumed the position in 2013, stated his aims for China to qualify for a World Cup, host a World Cup and, ultimately, win a World Cup. The sport became compulsory in schools for children aged six and above. President Xi's ambitions have not yet been realised. China have, however, been regulars at the Women's World Cup. Since hosting its inaugural edition in 1991, they have reached eight of its nine tournaments and lost the final on penalties to the USWNT in 1999. Football is Indonesia's No 1 sport, but their only World Cup appearance came in 1938 when they were still known by their colonial name as Dutch East Indies. The world's fourth most populous nation has struggled to produce top-level footballers due to an absence of infrastructure, but they have recently begun leaning on the nation's diaspora, predominantly based in the Netherlands, to improve their fortunes. Utilising their diaspora has improved Indonesia's results; reaching the knockout stage of the Asian Cup in 2023 and the fourth round of World Cup 2026 qualifying, before losing by one-goal margins to Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Nine months of that campaign was overseen by former Netherlands international Patrick Kluivert, who has subsequently left his position. Indonesia have not yet reached the World Cup as an independent nation, but not doing so is now regarded as below par. Russia's national and domestic teams have been suspended from FIFA and UEFA competitions since the country's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Moscow clubs CSKA, Spartak and Lokomotiv, along with Zenit Saint Petersburg, had featured prominently in European club competitions prior to the ban. In April this year, FIFA president Gianni Infantino spoke of his hope that Russia can be introduced back into the football fold “soon”. Any return, however, is dependent on the ongoing situation in Ukraine. In September 2023, UEFA announced plans to allow Russian under-17 teams to compete in its competitions, but the proposals were later withdrawn. Africa's second most populous nation, behind Nigeria, Ethiopia were an early powerhouse in the continent's football scene. As one of the few independent African states in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, Ethiopia were a key player in early editions of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON); a tournament they won in 1962 with two more top-four places following that decade. However, they have not progressed beyond the competition's group stage since and have only qualified for two of the past 22 tournaments. No Ethiopian club side has progressed as far into continental competition since. They finished fifth in their six-team qualification group for the 2026 World Cup with nine points from 10 matches. The Philippines' most popular sports are basketball and boxing, inherited from American rule. As a result, football has not enjoyed the same funding as in other Asian nations and the Philippines have struggled to develop top-level players. The Philippines are currently ranked 141st by FIFA and they were eliminated in the second round of 2026 World Cup qualifying, picking up just one point from six matches. They did qualify for their first Women's World Cup in 2023, defeating co-hosts New Zealand 1-0. Vietnam was impacted by conflict for much of the latter half of the 20th century, which unsurprisingly limited its potential for sporting success. It was not until the 1990s that a professional structure could be put in place. Despite limited resources compared to continental rivals, Vietnamese teams have provided AFC Champions League Two semi-finalists in 2009 and 2019. The AFC Champions League Elite has, inevitably, provided a tougher challenge, with Vietnam rarely having a representative beyond the group stages. Vietnamese football has economic limitations compared to Asian rivals, yet the population's passion for the sport is well-established. A 2022 survey by Nielsen found that 75 per cent of Vietnam were football fans, a higher percentage than any other Asian nation. Ranked 111th by FIFA, there is clearly potential to break into the top 100 and be in contention for future World Cup appearances. They were eliminated in the second round of Asian qualifying for 2026, with two wins from six group games proving insufficient to advance. Colin Millar  is a Staff Writer for The Athletic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Report as England end Serbia's top-two chances in Group K of World Cup qualifying and maintain their perfect record in the group through Bukayo Saka and Eberechi Eze goals; Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden second-half subs after Morgan Rogers favoured at No 10 Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player England maintained their perfect World Cup qualifying record with a 2-0 win over Serbia thanks to a fine Bukayo Saka volley and excellent Eberechi Eze finish, as Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden had mixed performances off the bench at Wembley. The goals were standout moments of quality on a rain-soaked night in which already-qualified England struggled to hit the high levels they've reached in recent internationals. But Thomas Tuchel's side were markedly improved after he intervened midway through the first half after a lacklustre and sloppy start to the game from his team. England had been 3-0 up by half-time in their past three internationals - including a 5-0 thrashing of Serbia in Belgrade - but were alarmingly slow out of the blocks here until an impromptu Tuchel team talk shook things up when Jordan Pickford went down calling for treatment on 23 minutes. With Harry Kane dropping deeper to turn playmaker and Declan Rice more advanced, Saka and Marcus Rashford suddenly began to threaten. As well as Saka's volley, there were more good chances before half-time, with Kane heading wide and Rogers glancing off target after Rashford and Rice were unable to capitalise on a counter. There were let-offs in the second half, though, with Dusan Vlahovic flicking wide and then clipping the roof of the net as Serbia - increasingly desperate - searched for an equaliser to save their World Cup hopes. This result, though, coupled with Albania also winning in Andorra, ends their chances of a top-two finish in Group K. They are still yet to concede in this campaign, with Pickford's England record run of international clean sheets stretching to 10 matches. But at the other end of the pitch there is intrigue into how Tuchel will utilise all his attacking options. There were just a handful of Serbia supporters in the away section at Wembley. Bellingham and Foden - benched with Tuchel favouring Morgan Rogers at No 10 - finally entered the fray after an hour. Foden, as a false nine, nodded a headed chance wide but made his mark late on, chipping a wonderful pass for an Eze shot to be tipped onto the bar before assisting his team-mate for England's second. 2026 World Cup dates, venues and expanded format There were a couple of exciting combinations with Reece James but ultimately the Real Madrid man became frustrated. If anything, this was another night in which Rogers once again showed why he is liked by Tuchel despite competition at No 10 from high-profile team-mates. It is a battle which will run right up until the World Cup. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player "We wanted to have quality and impact and new energy from the bench which we got. A special compliment to Jordan and the back four today. There was some intense output we had to give to get the clean sheet and win the game. Maybe throughout the match we lacked a little bit of precision with the last pass, otherwise we could have created more and scored earlier to be a bit more calm. "England don't play with a striker. Harry Kane played like a deep midfielder. Phil Foden came on as a false nine. Lots of people called for a Danny Welbeck to support Kane, but do England even need that out-and-out No 9? England were dire in the first 25 minutes. So many clever incisive balls from England's defensive midfielder. Ezri Konsa looked good, with a couple of last-ditch challenges. Who out of him, John Stones and Marc Guehi fill the two spots? The Man City left-back did not look out of place on England debut - he lasted the 90 minutes. Is that spot his to lose too? "And Bellingham is still not at it. "So happy to be back in the squad. I thought I did well, created a few chances and unlucky not to put a couple away. Overall, I have to be happy with the impact." On his role as striker: "I'll play wherever the manager puts me. I can play multiple positions and I was happy to come on as a false nine. "There are quality players all over the pitch. I know there is pressure on me to perform at Man City and I just have to keep my head down and earn my place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Northern Ireland take the field against Slovakia on Friday evening, for many of Michael O'Neill's young squad it will feel like the most consequential international of their careers to date. With their efforts to reach the World Cup in North America next summer reaching a critical juncture, there is a sense that the 90 minutes in Kosice could be defining in Group A where Northern Ireland are three points behind both Germany and Slovakia with two games remaining. However, needing at least a point to carry their hopes of a top-two finish into their final group game at home to Luxembourg on Monday, there is the curious scenario where Northern Ireland's players could leave the field beaten, only to discover that events elsewhere have ensured them a qualifying play-off spot regardless. As a winner of their Nations League group, only a highly unlikely set of results would mean Northern Ireland would miss out on the play-off games in March. "We haven't paid any attention to that," he said. "This is the here and now, we have to deal with that situation which is obviously getting as many points as we can from the final two games. Belief that Northern Ireland could seal second place ahead of Slovakia surged after they were comfortably the superior team when the sides met in Belfast last month, winning 2-0 with a performance that record goalscorer David Healy said was perhaps their best ever under O'Neill. Slovakia were missing influential pair Stanislav Lobotka and David Hancko for the game at Windsor Park, with both expected to be back in Francesco Calzona's starting line-up at the Kosice Football Arena this time around. Northern Ireland, however, will be without three-quarters of the midfield that so impressed in the reverse fixture, with Shea Charles and Ali McCann injured while Ethan Galbraith is suspended. How the manager fills such considerable holes in his line-up has been the key talking point since his squad was confirmed last week. "He's an excellent player and he plays at the top level with Napoli, but we look at Slovakia as a team, we don't look at them as one player or two players," he said. "It won't change the way Slovakia try and play. We have to deal with that as a team, it's not one individual player. If O'Neill is complimentary of Lobotka, such sentiments have not been reciprocated this week with the 30-year-old quoted as saying Northern Ireland lacked creativity were "annoying". In response to what was a not dissimilar critique of his side to the one aired by Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann earlier in the campaign, O'Neill quipped that his wife is quick to call him annoying too, but in fact feels there are similarities between his side and Slovakia in terms of style and approach. "We take that as a compliment and it won't upset us," he said of Lobotka's remark.

Saturday's opponent, Paraguay, is coming off a successful World Cup qualification campaign. They were also victorious in a 1-0 win over Paraguay during the 2016 Copa América despite playing most of the second half with 10 players. Our final roster of the year is here! While it seems like Pochettino is starting to put the pieces together for next year's World Cup, this will not be the USMNT at full strength. Injuries and circumstances at club level will leave the U.S. without the likes of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Tyler Adams, Malik Tillman, Chris Richards, Tim Weah, and Weston McKennie for the November window. All seven are potential starts, leaving some uncertainty as to how the USMNT will lineup against Paraguay. Matt Freese (GK) - Miles Robinson, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream - Sergiño Dest, Aidan Morris, Tanner Tessmann, Max Arfsten - Brenden Aaronson, Folarin Balgoun, Gio Reyna Roberto Fernandez (GK) - Juan Caceres, Gustavo Gomez, Omar Alderete, Junior Alonso - Damian Bobadilla, Andres Cubas - Hugo Cuenca, Diego Gomez, Miguel Almiron - Antonio Sanabria Paraguay should be a good test for the U.S., especially since Pochettino's side is missing several key figures. The South American side has just two losses in its last 14 matches, although one of those came in a friendly against South Korea last month. That stretch also includes victories over Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay in World Cup qualifying matches, so Paraguay can compete against high-level teams. They have a veteran backline that's helped them to keep seven clean sheets in their last 14 matches. Only four times in those 14 matches has their opponent scored multiple goals. On the other hand, both Japan and South Korea scored two goals against them in friendlies last month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KDH News covers government, military, education, crime, sports, political and other news in the Killeen-Fort Hood area. FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Women's World Cup champions and Olympic gold medalists Tobin Heath and Heather O'Reilly were elected Thursday to the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame along with men's players Tony Sanneh and Chris Wondolowski. Referee Kari Seitz also was elected along with Kevin Crow, known primarily for his time in indoor soccer. They will be inducted on May 1 at the hall in Frisco, Texas. O'Reilly, 40, was a forward and winger who scored 47 goals in 231 international appearances, helping the U.S. win the 2015 World Cup and Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Wondolowski, 42, is Major League Soccer's career scoring leader with 171 regular-season goals and two in the playoffs, playing for San Jose (2005, 2009-21) and Houston (2006-09). O'Reilly, Heath and Wondolowski were picked from the player ballot. The top two are elected if they each receive at least 50% and a third is elected if receiving at least 75%. O'Reilly got 47 of 48 votes for 97.9%, followed by Heath (45, 93.8%), Wondolowski (37, 77.1%), Keith Johnson (33, 68.8%), Samantha Mewis (32, 66.7%), Dwayne DeRosario (29, 60.4%), Amy Rodriguez (28, 58.3%), Kyle Beckerman (27, 56.3%), Robbie Keane (20, 41.7%), Oguchi Onyewu (19, 39.6%), Jermaine Jones (17, 35.4%), Maurice Edu (16, 33.3%), Diego Valeri (13, 27.1%), Michael Archer (12, 25%), Stephanie Lopez Cox (12, 25%), Chad Marshall (11, 22.9%), Mike Lawson (10, 20.8%), Carlos Ruiz (7, 14.6%), Matt Besler (6, 12.5%) and Geoff Cameron (5, 10.4%). Sanneh and Crow were chosen from the veteran ballot, in which the top vote-getter is elected if receiving at least 50% and a second if receiving at least 75%. Sanneh was on 21 of 24 ballots (87.55%) and was followed by Crow (19, 79.2%), Tatu (17, 70.8%), Tiffany Roberts (16, 66.7%), David Beckham (11, 45.8%), Clint Mathis (10, 41.7%), Lorrie Fair (6, 25%), Chico Borja (5, 20.8%), Aly Wagner (5, 20.8%) and Francis Farberoff (1, 4.2%). She became the U.S. Soccer Federation's vice president of referees in 2024. Seitz was on the builder ballot, which this year included only referees. The top voter-getter is picked if receiving at least 50%. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Which is to say, there's not much interaction at all. “I feel like in-season, he kinda lets you deal with your club and lets you focus on your coach and stuff there,” USMNT defender Alex Freeman told The Post this week. I think he lets you be at your club. That is not to imply that Pochettino isn't building the necessary relationships with his players or doing the legwork in between international windows amid the run-up to next summer's World Cup that will be the most important event for American soccer perhaps ever. When Freeman showed up at camp for the Gold Cup over the summer, Pochettino took him aside for a 20-minute conversation that included extensive feedback on his game. Just having him as a coach, you can tell he's very passionate about the sport and he wants the best out of all of us.” Pochettino has admitted he didn't know Cristian Roldan before making the midfielder a late call-up two months ago. But when Roldan arrived for his first camp under the Argentine, Pochettino established a relationship immediately, nevertheless. I think that those things correlate to success. And I felt like he did a great job of just bringing me in and making it seem seamless.” That was crucial for Roldan's successful re-entry into the national team fold. “So just bringing that same energy back is really important. Definitely trust is the first word I'd put to it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The former president of Spain's national football federation has had eggs thrown at him during a book launch. Rubiales made international headlines after he kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso at the conclusion of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final in Sydney. Rubiales was charged with sexual assault and was convicted by Spain's High Court in February this year. A Foreign Correspondent investigation has detailed the decades of sexism and misogyny leading up to the infamous World Cup kiss. Luis Rubiales resigned as president of the RFEF (Royal Spanish Football Federation) after he kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso, who was collecting her winner's medal following Spain's 1-0 win over England in the final at Sydney's Stadium Australia. The 48-year-old has written a book called Matar a Rubiales (Kill Rubiales), which he says, according to ESPN, is "for those who want to know the reality". During a book launch event on Thursday (local time) in Madrid, someone from the audience threw eggs at Rubiales. "I didn't know what he had in his hands," Rubiales told Radio Marca. Rubiales was fined 10,800 euros ($19,200) following his conviction in February, but was acquitted on a charge of coercion. A Spanish court rejected Rubiales's appeal of his conviction in June.

Three former players who performed domestically and internationally for U.S. national teams, have been elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame, the organization revealed on its website on Thursday. The trio was U.S. women's national team standouts Heather O'Reilly and Tobin Heath and Major League Soccer all-time scoring leader Chris Wondolowski. All three were voted in on the Players' Ballot. She performed three Women's World Cups, lifting the trophy in 2015 and 2019. A forward who retired as the leading goal scorer in Major League Soccer history, Wondolowski played 17 seasons in the league between 2005-21. They will be inducted into the NSHOF in Frisco, Texas on May 1, 2026. There likely will be more inductees soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The alleged deal to use the Kennedy Center complex comes as ticket sales are reportedly declining after Trump's takeover Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. FIFA will reportedly use large parts of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., displacing previously scheduled performers, even as the showpiece arts complex is reportedly struggling with sharply declining ticket sales following President Donald Trump's takeover of the institution earlier this year. The soccer governing body will occupy multiple facilities for nearly three weeks that normally rent for tens of thousands of dollars per day in the lead-up to the December 5 World Cup draw there, The Washington Post reports, citing an August venue use agreement and Kennedy Center employees. In the eight months since Trump cleaned house at the Kennedy Center and installed himself as chair of its board ticket sales have reportedly plummeted nearly 50 percent. Using the venue for the World Cup draw caps off months of FIFA president Gianni Infantino building goodwill with President Trump. The FIFA boss has also joined the many dignitaries who've publicly supported Trump's long-running bid to win a Nobel Peace Prize, writing in October that Trump “definitely deserves” the award for his efforts toward a peace deal in Gaza. “On the 5th of December, you will see,” he told reporters. FIFA also opened an office in New York City's Trump Tower this year. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>
