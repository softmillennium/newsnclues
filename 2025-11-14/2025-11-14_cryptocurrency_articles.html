                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Central bank finalizes stablecoin regulations while three major banks complete first wholesale CBDC transactions MAS has finalized features for its stablecoin regulatory regime and will prepare draft legislation, Chia said Wednesday. The framework prioritizes "sound reserve backing and redemption reliability" to ensure value stability, addressing concerns about unregulated stablecoins that have experienced recurring de-pegging events. The regulator launched the BLOOM (Borderless, Liquid, Open, Online, Multi-currency) initiative in October 2025, to support industry experimentation with tokenized bank liabilities and regulated stablecoins for settlement, inviting financial institutions and clearing operators to conduct trials. Chia also added that MAS will publish a Guide on Tokenisation of Capital Markets Products this week, providing regulatory clarity through case studies, while acknowledging that despite commercial launches of tokenized bonds and money market funds, "asset-backed tokens have not yet achieved escape velocity." The central bank emphasized a "co-opetition" model where market participants cooperate on standards while competing for liquidity, working through initiatives like Project Guardian to develop global tokenization frameworks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is now approaching a Bitcoin death cross, a technical event where the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA. Historically, this pattern has often appeared near market bottoms. This raises a critical question: Is this the actual bottom, or merely one step in a more extended capitulation phase? Several analysts have been watching the approaching Bitcoin death cross. According to analyst Colin, the upcoming Bitcoin death cross is expected around mid-November, which means it is only 1–2 days away. Before it happens, Colin expects BTC to decline further, with altcoins potentially dropping even more. “The projected Bitcoin ‘Death Cross' (50 day crossing below 200 day SMA) is a timing element for when the bottom might be in.” Colin commented. Multiple observations also support the idea that BTC typically forms a bottom around such events, although timing may vary. Between 2018 and April 2025, Bitcoin has experienced at least eight death cross events. Each time, BTC formed a local bottom within 5–9 days and rallied at least 45% from the lows. If we consider the recent dip below $100,000 as a local bottom, projections suggest BTC could rise to at least $145,000 afterward. Supporting this view, analyst Ash Crypto noted that in the last three death crosses, Bitcoin bottomed within a week before rallying strongly to new all-time highs. However, some analysts present a more cautious scenario. If the death cross occurs in mid-November with BTC hovering around $100,000, this model suggests a potential retracement toward the $70,000 region. If the Bitcoin death cross aligns with a final capitulation flush, history suggests a sharp rebound in the weeks that follow. Conversely, if macro conditions worsen, the death cross could instead signal a deeper correction, consistent with the historical average drawdown of roughly 30% within a year. Traders should consider factors like trading volume, RSI/MACD divergences, on-chain activity, and stablecoin liquidity. Still, short-term traders should manage risk carefully: set appropriate stop-loss levels and wait for recovery confirmation, such as a daily close above the SMA50 with rising volume, before allocating heavily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you think of financial innovation, Singapore is never far away. The country, which already made an impression by hosting the global TOKEN2019 event, continues to move forward at a rapid pace. Public securities settled in central bank digital currency (CBDC). A transition that could well reshuffle the deck in state finance. At the Singapore FinTech Festival 2025, Chia Der Jiun, director of the MAS, unveiled a pilot operation: issuance of tokenized MAS Bills, reserved for primary dealers, and settled in digital Singapore dollar. Especially when you hear the MAS head state: Are asset-backed tokens clearly out of the lab? Bonds have been issued natively and settled on-chain. The MAS does not stop there: the banks DBS, OCBC and UOB have already conducted interbank lending operations using CBDC. These initiatives confirm an assumed ambition: to impose public finance in the crypto ecosystem with safe, traceable, and agile digital tools. A role-play where states are no longer just regulators but also builders of monetary networks. In his speech, Chia Der Jiun mentions a major risk: that of a fragmented ecosystem, made of incompatible networks, tokens not recognized from one platform to another. They must agree on common standards for asset-backed tokens, even while seeking to grow. A bond or fund token must be understood and accepted on another network than the original one. A hybrid model that could set an example far beyond Asia. The digital Singapore dollar, stablecoins, and tokenized bank liabilities are tested to serve as bases for dematerialized exchanges. And bank liabilities bring private sector flexibility, provided they are interoperable. Singapore only confirms a trend underway for several years. By crossing this new threshold, it helps shape the contours of programmable, fluid finance but under close supervision. A complex score, where each note played already resonates well beyond its borders. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our "Read to Earn" program!

Brutal selloff breaks psychological $2.30 floor, erasing recent gains as distribution overwhelms historic XRPC debut.

The session confirmed a full technical breakdown with clear structural damage:

Support/Resistance:• $2.29–$2.30 becomes primary support after breach of psychological floor• Former support at $2.36, $2.40, and $2.47 now act as stacked resistance• Invalidation for bulls requires a decisive reclaim of $2.36

Volume Profile:• Total session volume 157.9M (+46%) confirms institutional-grade distribution• Breakdown sequence showed 254% hourly volume spike, typical of liquidation-driven moves• No meaningful recovery volume appeared during post-crash consolidation

Chart Structure:• Descending triangle support failed decisively, killing prior reversal setup• New lower range forming between $2.29–$2.33• Breakdown aligns with medium-term downtrend in broader crypto indexes

Momentum Indicators:• Oversold signals emerging intraday, but no confirmation of trend reversal• Breakdown occurred below key EMAs; 50D/200D cross continues to slope bearishly

XRP now sits at a pivotal inflection point:

• Holding $2.29 is essential — failure exposes a fast move into the $2.00–$2.20 demand zone• Any recovery must first reclaim $2.36 before bulls regain technical control• ETF inflows will act as the next volatility catalyst; early XRPC volume during market open will indicate whether institutions treat the listing as an accumulation opportunity or liquidity event• On-chain flows around the 110.5M XRP whale transfers remain a wildcard — exchange inflows would confirm additional downside risk• Sentiment remains fragile across majors; beta-sensitive assets like XRP will respond disproportionately to broader market weakness

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest executed significant trades, notably involving Circle Internet Group Inc (NYSE:CRCL), Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc (NYSE:BMNR), Bullish (NYSE:BLSH), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT). These trades reflect Ark's strategic positioning in the market, with particular focus on the tech and crypto sectors. Despite this dip, analysts at Bernstein remain optimistic about Circle's potential, citing its strong third-quarter performance and a $230 price target. Bernstein flagged intensifying competition from "frenemies" like Stripe and PayPal, who are building their own stablecoin ecosystems. Still, analysts said USDC's (CRYPTO: USDC) liquidity edge continues to outpace rivals, and Circle's Arc blockchain and Payments Network rollout bolster its long-term positioning. Ark Invest increased its holdings in Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc through ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW by purchasing 242,347 shares. BitMine said it expanded its Ethereum holdings to 2.9% of total ETH supply, adding more than 110,000 ETH last week as it pushed toward its long-term 5% accumulation goal. The company now holds over 3.5 million ETH, along with 192 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and $398 million in cash reserves. Chairman Tom Lee said growing institutional interest and Ethereum's role in tokenization continue to strengthen the firm's conviction. Bullish, backed by Peter Thiel, has been a focus for Ark, with previous million-dollar buys. Ark Invest reduced its AMD position by 87,051 shares through ARKK. Ark's sale was valued at about $21.6 million. AMD's ambitious target of $20 EPS by 2030 drew mixed reactions from analysts. Some argued the stock already prices in these aggressive assumptions, while others warned the forecast depends heavily on steep growth, margin expansion and sustained hyperscaler spending. Ark Invest sold Reddit shares through ARKF and ARKW. The sale of 39,854 shares was valued at $7.5 million. Reddit recently beat expectations with third-quarter earnings of 80 cents per share and $585 million in revenue. Daily active users rose 19% to 116 million, while ad revenue surged 74%. Margins and cash flow also improved sharply, with adjusted EBITDA climbing to $236 million. Here is how the stock compares with other semiconductor plays.

There currently are at least 32 crypto kiosks, according to St. Paul police, where users can deposit cash and see it converted into a digital alternative. Alarmed by fraud cases that have cost victims millions of dollars nationally, the St. Paul City Council is poised to ban virtual currency kiosks that have proliferated citywide. The ATM-like kiosks are placed in high-traffic areas such as convenience stores and allow users to make cash deposits, which are then converted into Bitcoin or other digital currencies and transferred into an account or virtual wallet. Digital currency is money that exists only in an electronic form and can be exchanged online. An ordinance before the city council calls for prohibiting any person from operating a virtual currency kiosk within city limits. It would not affect online virtual transactions conducted by businesses and residents. Michael Carter, an enforcement audit director with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, told the council Wednesday that there have been 51 law enforcement reports statewide involving $700,000 lost to various kiosk scams. “Criminals are becoming more sophisticated in their approach which authorities struggle to keep up.” However, Ethan McClelland, the director of government relations for Bitcoin Depot – a leading Bitcoin machine operator – called the proposed ordinance an overreaction. “We share the council's goal of protecting consumers from fraud,” McClelland said. “However, placing a reactionary ban on the industry that is already licensed and regulated by the state, which serves a legitimate purpose for St. Paul residents, is unnecessary and will deprive many customers their only way of participating in the digital economy.” Law enforcement investigators have called crypto scams especially dangerous because there is no centralized authority to flag suspicious behavior, and they are often untraceable. In 2023, Americans reported losing $5.6 billion in cryptocurrency scams, according to the FBI, which found that the frauds were more likely to target older people. Often, residents unfamiliar with cryptocurrency are warned by fraudsters that they owe the Internal Revenue Service or another federal agency back payments, and they're pressured to use a kiosk to deposit cash to a serial number within a matter of hours, or they'll be prosecuted, they're told. The Minnesota Legislature implemented a degree of cryptocurrency fraud protection in 2024. “These kiosks serve as a very specific flashpoint for which criminal activity defrauds citizens and no amount of disclosure or tapping of a screen or a receipt can be as effective as  simply removing them from operation,” Greenfield said. Scammers impersonated Xfinity technicians and told him abnormally high activity on his desktop had led them to find evidence of money laundering and other illegal acts. “The first thing they want you to do is to get you in a state of confusion,” he told the council.​ Crypto scams have become lucrative crimes in recent years. ​In June, an Eagan couple was almost scammed out of $125,000. The couple was able to avoid losing all of their money when Gabby Conklin, an office assistant in the city attorney's office who had stopped at a convenience store for gas, intervened, Noecker said. “The elderly couple were literally one press of a button away from losing their life savings irreversibly, but through Gabby's work that was averted,” Noecker said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. Blockchain technology is gaining mainstream traction in the U.S., with clearer regulations emerging as a key driver of adoption. To explore what that means for financial infrastructure, I sat down with Jeremy Fox-Geen, CFO of Circle Internet Group, a leading stablecoin issuer. “We are at the beginning of what can only be described as a global megatrend—the building of the internet financial system,” Fox-Geen told me. That system, he explained, encompasses blockchains, digital assets, and the applications built upon them—technologies that promise “massive benefits to businesses and consumers all around the world,” he said. While blockchain is already transforming parts of the economy, he emphasized that we are still in the early stages of its impact. Fox-Geen described Circle as a market-neutral infrastructure company: a platform that sits within the internet financial system's foundation—spanning blockchain, digital-asset, and application layers. “We're a platform that other companies choose to build upon,” he said. Stablecoins, such as Circle's USD Coin (USDC), are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to and backed by the U.S. dollar or equivalent assets. Key use cases for stablecoins include trading, settlement, dollarization, and cross-border payments. Circle's platform supports these use cases, aiming to reduce friction and cost in global financial transactions, Fox-Geen said. Circle made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5, marking the largest two-day post-IPO surge since 1980, Fortune reported. On Wednesday, the company reported its Q3 results: combined revenue and reserve income grew 66% year-over-year to $740 million, while net income rose 202% to $214 million. USDC circulation reached $73.7 billion, up 108% from a year earlier, and on-chain transaction volume jumped 580% to $9.6 trillion—evidence of its expanding real-world utility, Fox-Geen explained. JPMorgan has upgraded Circle's stock to “overweight” from “underweight” and increased its price target to $100 from $94, which helped rebound Circle shares in pre-market trading on Thursday. “We're seeing use cases grow fastest where costs, frictions, and business needs are highest,” Fox-Geen added. Circle is now building the fourth generation of blockchains, he said, as well as Arc, a native Layer-1 blockchain optimized to bring economic activity to the internet. To illustrate his thoughts on blockchain's promise, Fox-Geen posed this question: “Why can't you send money to anyone in the world—instantly and for free—just like sending a photo or text message? “You don't have to be a pioneer,” he said. Adam Schneider was appointed CFO of Millennium Systems International, the maker of Meevo, a salon, spa, and med spa software platform. Madhav Srinivasan was appointed CFO of Frost Brown Todd (FBT). Before joining FBT, Srinivasan served as CFO at a leading Am Law 50 firm, where he directed its global finance operations. Earlier in his career, he held senior financial and operational leadership roles at several international law firms and major corporations. The 2025 Fortune World's Best Workplaces list, released this morning in collaboration with research partner Great Place to Work, is based on more than 9 million survey responses representing the experiences of over 25 million workers around the globe.

"Record U.S. government shutdown is over—but Wall Street only has 10 weeks to relax before the next one could begin" is a Fortune report by Eleanor Pringle. An optimist might assume the funding deal will avert a similar crisis—perhaps until the next administration, or for a couple of years at least? "Last night, President Donald Trump signed a funding bill to end the 43-day impasse on Capitol Hill. In it were funding provisions for departments including SNAP food aid, the Department of Agriculture, Congress, and veterans affairs through September next year. Unfortunately, the vast majority of federal departments only had their budgets approved until January 30." "AI and automation are already reshaping the future of work, but our collective choices will determine whether the disruption leads to decline or renewal. Deeper partnerships across government, academia, and industry will build a talent pipeline that is more innovative than ever before." —Vimal Kapur, chairman and CEO of Honeywell, writes in a Fortune opinion piece.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Threshold has introduced upgrades to its tBTC bridge, which it claims will better position the $500 billion worth of Bitcoin held by institutions and whales to access DeFi opportunities. Crypto infrastructure platform Threshold has rolled out a major upgrade for its tBTC bridge, aimed at enticing institutions to put their billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to work in decentralized finance protocols. Threshold's latest upgrade now enables institutions to mint tBTC directly to supported chains in a single Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, without secondary approvals and without gas fees, while redemptions back to the Bitcoin network are equally as straightforward, Threshold said in a statement. Threshold's head of marketing, Rizza Carla Ramos, went into more depth in an interview with Cointelegraph at the Web Summit in Lisbon this week, explaining that the feature improvements could incentivize more Bitcoin-holding institutions to put their BTC to work in DeFi instead of just letting it sit there and waiting for it to appreciate: Every tBTC minted is verifiably backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, with no middlemen or custodian risk, by implementing a threshold rule where at least 51 out of 100 Bitcoin node operators must sign the transaction for it to be valid. It could empower more than $500 billion in institutional and whale-held Bitcoin to move into Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Sui and other blockchains to chase DeFi opportunities. Threshold has seen over $4.2 billion in cumulative volume cross its tBTC bridge since it launched five years ago. It competes with Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and renBTC (RENBTC), which have seen far more trading volume than Threshold but operate on a more centralized model to move Bitcoin across other blockchains. Threshold also argued that tBTC would make the decentralized finance space more robust, as Bitcoin would deepen liquidity in decentralized exchange pools and lending protocols while enabling more sustainable yields.
