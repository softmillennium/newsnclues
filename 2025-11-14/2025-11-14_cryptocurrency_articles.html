                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bitcoin faithful are turning to one of their most vocal evangelists for a sign amid an intensifying market rout. We're talking about Michael Saylor, chief of Strategy (MSTR), the enterprise software company known for stockpiling bitcoin. As X users started to fret, Saylor posted an image of himself on a life raft as a burning ship sank behind him. The sell-off in risk assets this week—a bleed that the end of the U.S. government shutdown couldn't stem—has put a dent in the price of bitcoin and the narrative that it could be a useful hedge against stocks or a safe haven like gold. Bitcoin sank below $95,000 on Friday morning to levels not seen since early May. Some crypto-linked stocks diverged, with MicroStrategy declining about 4%, while Coinbase Global (COIN), and Robinhood (HOOD) were up at least 1%. Bitcoin is sometimes considered a hedge against stocks, characterized as a portfolio diversification tool. Lately, it's been falling with the broader market as sentiment has soured. Saylor, who in recent months had forecast that bitcoin would climb to $150,000 by the end of the year, said Strategy was "buying quite a lot" lately in a Friday interview with CNBC. He also stopped short of providing a price target, though he said bitcoin over the long-term would "outperform" both gold and the S&P 500. "Obviously it's hard to make a forecast for the end of the year right now given what's happened over the past few weeks," he said. The cryptocurrency has erased almost all of its 2025 gains, lagging gold's 50%-plus climb and the broad market's 14% year-to-date rise. ETF investors appear to be in selling mode: Spot bitcoin funds including iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin (FBTC) collectively showed nearly $867 million in outflows yesterday, according to Farside Investors. Meanwhile, crypto watchers have become less sanguine about the market rout as investors rushed to sell. Vitaliy Shtyrkin, chief product officer at Estonia-headquartered platform B2BinPay, said sentiment weakened after bitcoin fell through a key technical support zone of $100,000 to $102,000. Dean Chen, an analyst at derivatives trading platform Bitunix, likened the latest decline as more than "a simple technical correction." Though Strategy might be buying at these levels—and just a few days ago, some experts sounded bullish as bitcoin seemed to bounce—others are sitting out. "We're in this awkward in-between zone. I don't want to be buying," All Star Charts' senior crypto analyst Louis Sykes said during an X live-stream discussing what to do about crypto now. "Just go play some golf." "Bitcoin ETF Flow (US$m)." What to do about crypto right now?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Probes conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation "continue to expose the North Korean government's relentless campaign to evade U.S. sanctions and generate millions of dollars to fund its authoritarian regime and weapons programs,” said Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky of the FBI's counterintelligence division, in a statement. The authorities have also been steadily seizing crypto assets from bad actors around the world, marking another $15 million in Tether's USDT from North Korean sources on Friday. Earlier this week, the DOJ and other federal agencies also announced a Scam Center Strike Force to target the centers of so-called pig-butchering scams, typically clustered in Southeast Asia and run by Chinese criminal organizations. Victims will be compensated from seized money, according to the DOJ. What's not yet clear is how much of these seized crypto funds will end up in the reserves President Donald Trump has sought to establish as a long-term investment for the U.S. government. However, officials working on those reserves have suggested congressional action may be required to formally institute the plan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy's co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor denied rumors that Strategy is selling its Bitcoin on X, after describing the firm's hunger for BTC as insatiable—no matter how far its price faults—in a Friday interview on CNBC. Meanwhile, onlookers speculated that Strategy could be selling its Bitcoin, citing on-chain movements identified by crypto intelligence platform Arkham Analytics. The movements could signal that Strategy is now using Coinbase as a custodian, Arkham added. (Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt's parent company, Dastan.) Strategy has always maintained that it would never willingly sell Bitcoin, TD Cowen Analyst Lance Vitanza told Decrypt. Theoretically, Strategy could need to sell Bitcoin to satisfy the maturity of its debt, but the company doesn't have convertible bonds maturing until 2028, Vitanza noted. Strategy Buys Bitcoin With Proceeds From Preferred Shares as Key Premium Evaporates Strategy's stock price has dropped 32% over the past month as Bitcoin has shed a majority of this year's gains, with MSTR shares trading around $204, according to Yahoo Finance. Saylor said he's “fairly comfortable” with Bitcoin at its current price level, describing the asset's recent dip as something that formed a base for it to rally from. In response to a question from CNBC's Joe Kernen, Saylor said the company is “always buying,” but there have been several periods where Strategy didn't announce a purchase, aligning with the end of each fiscal quarter. In addition to common stock, Strategy has issued a blend of products to fund its Bitcoin purchases, including convertible bonds and preferred shares that feature dividend payments. As of Friday, the company had raised $8.2 billion through convertible bonds, according to its website. Since dividend payments on Strategy's preferred shares are declared by the board, Saylor added that there “is no credit default situation” for the products currently worth $7.6 billion. Echoing Saylor's outlook on preferred shares, TD Cowen's Vitanza said “the company is not legally required to make any dividend payments,” but acknowledged that skipping or deferring payments “would obviously impact their ability to issue more preferred shares.” What's more, Strategy has a dividend burden of around $735 million per year, and Vitanza said he would be “be very surprised if this were to become a legitimate issue.” Saylor's remarks come as the company's go-to funding mechanism has lost its effectiveness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data Point Decoding the headlines with facts, figures, and numbers The sharp rise in gold prices and the potential impact of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on central bank balance sheets are among emerging areas in central bank accounting and disclosures which would gain prominence in coming days said Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor Shishir Chandra Murmu. Stating that the recent sharp rise in gold prices has garnered a lot of attention and discussions globally with respect to its impact on the central bank balance sheets, Mr Murmu said this development needed wider discussion. However, gold revaluation practices vary across countries and the impact of high movement in gold prices on central bank balance sheets and income needs wider discussion,” he said. To keep gold prices in perspective, in the last 20 years, gold rates have gone up at CAGR of 12.5%. In the last 5-6 years, it has more than tripled, according to industry officials. Mr. Murmu said the issue of potential impact of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on central bank balance sheets had also been attracting lot of international research and discussions. “Some research papers have tried to explore how the design choices for CBDCs adopted by central banks may shape people's behaviour with respect to adoption of CBDC and potential substitution of banknotes and/or bank deposits with CBDC,” he emphasised. “It is also being discussed and debated globally whether and how this may impact central bank balance sheet structures and the need for liquidity operations,” the Deputy Governor pointed out. He said these emerging aspects would require ongoing engagement and collaboration in future as central banks learn from their respective experiences. “We should work closely in these areas and share our experiences and research with each other, which will help all of us in making better decisions,” he told the audience. “Over time, within this legal framework, these policies have evolved to keep up with changing needs and practices. The has a strong and resilient balance sheet, with adequate level of risk provisioning,” he said. “Over the years, RBI has consistently worked to align its accounting practices with global best practices, while staying true to core principles of prudence and conservatism,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decentralized finance heavyweight Uniswap introduced Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCA), a new protocol aiming to facilitate token offerings through its infrastructure. According to a Thursday announcement, Uniswap's CCA “helps teams bootstrap liquidity on Uniswap v4 and find the market price for new and low-liquidity tokens.” The company said this was just “the first of several tools” it is building to help projects launch and deepen token liquidity on the platform. Privacy-focused Aztec Network opened its community-only AZTEC token sale on Thursday, with a public phase scheduled for Dec. 2. Uniswap and Aztec did not respond to requests for comment. Uniswap said in the press release that “liquidity formation often happens behind closed doors,” leading to “information gaps, privileges a few players,” and sometimes “thin and unstable” markets. With CCA, the two partners hope to implement an onchain native market creation with transparent pricing, bidding and settlement, as well as gradual price discovery and automatic liquidity seeding to Uniswap's decentralized exchange (DEX). “No gatekeepers or offchain deals,” Uniswap said. They can also support running in tranches, verification tools such as ZK Passport (a privacy-enhanced, zero-knowledge proof-based Know Your Customer implementation), or entirely custom modules. Bids cannot be withdrawn while in range, but there is no limit on the number of bids. Uniswap explained that as more bids divide the fixed per-block supply, clearing prices can either stay the same or increase. Early bidders are expected to get the better deals “since a larger portion of their bid can fill in earlier, cheaper blocks.” The decentralized finance (DeFi) company announced that the CCA smart contract is now live and available to anyone. In the coming months, Uniswap also expects to release additional modules for the new token sale system. Copyright © 2025 FactSet Research Systems Inc.Copyright © 2025, American Bankers Association.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Online magazine about cryptocurrencies, NFTs, DeFi, GameFi and other blockchain technologies Bitcoin breaking under 98000 reminded the market how quickly confidence can disappear. This market environment puts a spotlight on the best crypto presale category, where teams are building technology rather than depending on hype alone. The combination of raised capital, live milestones, and an active ecosystem has positioned it among top crypto presale discussions and many crypto presale projects competing for visibility. Bitcoin dropped below $97000 in the last 12 hours, hitting its lowest point since early May. This decline was unexpected because broader macro signals had turned positive. The United States government officially reopened and financial support measures resurfaced, yet selling pressure accelerated. Just days ago Bitcoin traded above 107000 after President Donald Trump confirmed tariff checks of at least 2000 for eligible Americans. The announcement sparked a wave of optimism and confidence across digital markets. The reversal shows that price levels can break without warning, even during strong macro recovery news. Many traders shifted focus toward the best crypto presale opportunities as volatility intensified. Nexchain is building a fully AI powered blockchain ecosystem created to deliver real transaction intelligence and advanced security across web3. It evaluates transaction type, value, associated tags, and sender reputation to identify security risk in real time. Nexchain is now in Stage 29 of its crypto presale and has raised 11.72 million. Many followers rank it among the top crypto presale options and watch it on the crypto presale list of leading cryptocurrency presales for 2025. The Nexchain AI framework introduces an advanced speed infrastructure designed for decentralized blockchains. This design enables seamless deployment of next generation smart contracts and interoperability across multiple blockchain ecosystems. The model includes daily rewards that distribute ten percent of all network gas fees back to NEX holders. This approach commits to transparent value distribution without forcing complex staking requirements. It strengthens interest among best presale crypto followers who seek functional designs inside real blockchain project environments. AAVE, ENA, RENDER, SUI, PEPE, and LINK each dropped more than 12 percent. Despite political stability returning in the United States, market sentiment remains strongly risk off. Many traders exited short term volatility and moved toward presale crypto options with early access structures. Increased attention shifted to Nexchain as investors look beyond unstable markets for new crypto presale opportunities from high utility blockchain projects. Cryptocurrency presales with active development now appear more attractive than speculative momentum assets. Those watching cryptocurrency presales and seeking balanced risk strategies continue to monitor how strong fundamentals influence future adoption.

This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen back under $100,000, dimming expectations of a year-end push to new all-time highs. Now, Bitcoin Hyper is more than halfway to its next milestone at $28 million, which could be reached over the weekend – or even sooner – given the current pace of funding. Coming into Friday, BTC has now slipped to $99,600 at the time of writing. The disappointing price action has investors questioning whether this downturn is simply a temporary rotation, with capital first flowing back into equities before returning to higher-beta assets like crypto. Still, it raises the broader question of whether BTC has enough momentum to reach the bullish price targets frequently floated by analysts, such as $200,000 or even $250,000. That uncertainty is underscored by analyst MMCrypto, who flagged the $99,329 zone as critical support in an X post, noting that it “must hold.” A decisive break below this level, as MMCryto's chart indicates, could open the door to much lower prices. Yet, against this backdrop, Bitcoin Hyper presents a sharp contrast because it is seeing accelerating inflows when BTC struggles – including a massive whale allocation, as mentioned earlier, into the presale. So whether this whale is “buying when others are fearful” or simply recognizing Bitcoin Hyper's potential to both support BTC's next major move and deliver outsized returns for its own native token, HYPER, the timing is notable – and investors are carefully watching. The reason why there's an increase in early investor participation in Bitcoin Hyper comes down to its architecture that gives BTC another avenue to derive demand from: utility. Inside the ecosystem, developers can spin up applications using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), meaning those apps inherit Solana's speed and low-cost execution while every transaction still settles safely on Bitcoin's rock-solid base layer. In other words, users get the best of both worlds. This setup works through a canonical bridge that ties everything back to Bitcoin. BTC gets locked down on the base layer, then re-minted inside the Bitcoin Hyper environment as a wrapped asset that can move around freely. So in this model, BTC isn't just sitting pretty as a store of value – it's finally being put to work. And if developers continue rolling out applications that rely on BTC for everyday activity, it could open the floodgates to a new wave of demand, which not only cushions BTC from further decline but could help push it toward the ambitious targets many bulls are calling for. While investors are betting that Bitcoin Hyper can unlock higher value for BTC itself, their immediate exposure in the presale comes through the HYPER token. In Bitcoin Hyper's design, BTC serves as the medium of exchange across applications, but another currency must handle gas fees and network payments. Early investors are bullish because if the ecosystem captures even 0.5% of Bitcoin's supply – roughly $9.5 billion at current prices – that value would be transacting across applications that require HYPER every single time a user interacts with the network. That's why many early backers see it as the closest thing to a second chance at early-stage Bitcoin-style returns. Even trusted crypto news site Cryptonews predicts HYPER could go 100x post-presale. Getting HYPER tokens is currently only possible through the ongoing presale. Bitcoin Hyper recommends Best Wallet – one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets – where HYPER is listed under its Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live.

The framework prioritizes "sound reserve backing and redemption reliability" to ensure value stability, addressing concerns about unregulated stablecoins that have experienced recurring de-pegging events. The regulator launched the BLOOM (Borderless, Liquid, Open, Online, Multi-currency) initiative in October 2025, to support industry experimentation with tokenized bank liabilities and regulated stablecoins for settlement, inviting financial institutions and clearing operators to conduct trials. Chia also added that MAS will publish a Guide on Tokenisation of Capital Markets Products this week, providing regulatory clarity through case studies, while acknowledging that despite commercial launches of tokenized bonds and money market funds, "asset-backed tokens have not yet achieved escape velocity." The central bank emphasized a "co-opetition" model where market participants cooperate on standards while competing for liquidity, working through initiatives like Project Guardian to develop global tokenization frameworks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you think of financial innovation, Singapore is never far away. The country, which already made an impression by hosting the global TOKEN2019 event, continues to move forward at a rapid pace. Public securities settled in central bank digital currency (CBDC). A transition that could well reshuffle the deck in state finance. At the Singapore FinTech Festival 2025, Chia Der Jiun, director of the MAS, unveiled a pilot operation: issuance of tokenized MAS Bills, reserved for primary dealers, and settled in digital Singapore dollar. Especially when you hear the MAS head state: Are asset-backed tokens clearly out of the lab? Bonds have been issued natively and settled on-chain. The MAS does not stop there: the banks DBS, OCBC and UOB have already conducted interbank lending operations using CBDC. These initiatives confirm an assumed ambition: to impose public finance in the crypto ecosystem with safe, traceable, and agile digital tools. A role-play where states are no longer just regulators but also builders of monetary networks. In his speech, Chia Der Jiun mentions a major risk: that of a fragmented ecosystem, made of incompatible networks, tokens not recognized from one platform to another. They must agree on common standards for asset-backed tokens, even while seeking to grow. A bond or fund token must be understood and accepted on another network than the original one. A hybrid model that could set an example far beyond Asia. The digital Singapore dollar, stablecoins, and tokenized bank liabilities are tested to serve as bases for dematerialized exchanges. And bank liabilities bring private sector flexibility, provided they are interoperable. Singapore only confirms a trend underway for several years. By crossing this new threshold, it helps shape the contours of programmable, fluid finance but under close supervision. A complex score, where each note played already resonates well beyond its borders. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our "Read to Earn" program!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SINGAPORE, Nov. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Citi and Swift today announced a landmark trial that proves the feasibility of settling payments between fiat and digital currencies, in a Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) workflow. The trial demonstrates a powerful hybrid model for interoperability between traditional financial systems and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) networks. "These trials with Swift represent a significant leap forward in understanding and developing infrastructure required to support digital currency transactions," said Ayesa Latif, Head of FX Products. "Our collaboration has demonstrated how existing financial systems can be enhanced with blockchain technology to unlock new levels of speed, transparency, and risk reduction in cross-currency settlements." This collaboration with Citi proves that we can leverage the reach of our existing network while introducing advanced capabilities required to orchestrate fiat-digital currency PvP." For stablecoins, Citi GPS has projected that total issuance market could reach USD1.9 trillion by 2030, driven by expanding use cases and increasing regulatory clarity. While stablecoin transaction volume is approaching USD1 trillion a month according to the report, they predominantly serve as an intermediary. Consequently, recipients of stablecoins – which are primarily US dollar denominated – often choose to exchange them for local fiat currency. Unlike fiat currencies that are typically held within accounts at correspondent banks, digital currencies are held by user wallets on various blockchains and generally do not allow for reversible transactions. While FX messaging standards, such as MT30X, have been designed to identify digital assets and confirm FX deals on them, they are not meant to instruct synchronized settlement between fiat and digital currencies. The initiative between Citi and Swift aims to address this issue. How it Works:  Novel PvP ApproachCiti and Swift designed a holistic messaging standard capable of tracking the end-to-end process, from trade initiation to settlement confirmation. This standard uniquely accounts for the distinct data fields and characteristics inherent in fiat-digital currency transactions. The solution also incorporated an escrow mechanism to overcome the challenge of irreversible blockchain transactions, while ensuring PvP settlement and eliminating settlement risk of both parties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest executed significant trades, notably involving Circle Internet Group Inc (NYSE:CRCL), Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc (NYSE:BMNR), Bullish (NYSE:BLSH), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT). These trades reflect Ark's strategic positioning in the market, with particular focus on the tech and crypto sectors. Despite this dip, analysts at Bernstein remain optimistic about Circle's potential, citing its strong third-quarter performance and a $230 price target. Bernstein flagged intensifying competition from "frenemies" like Stripe and PayPal, who are building their own stablecoin ecosystems. Still, analysts said USDC's (CRYPTO: USDC) liquidity edge continues to outpace rivals, and Circle's Arc blockchain and Payments Network rollout bolster its long-term positioning. Ark Invest increased its holdings in Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc through ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW by purchasing 242,347 shares. BitMine said it expanded its Ethereum holdings to 2.9% of total ETH supply, adding more than 110,000 ETH last week as it pushed toward its long-term 5% accumulation goal. The company now holds over 3.5 million ETH, along with 192 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and $398 million in cash reserves. Chairman Tom Lee said growing institutional interest and Ethereum's role in tokenization continue to strengthen the firm's conviction. Bullish, backed by Peter Thiel, has been a focus for Ark, with previous million-dollar buys. Ark Invest reduced its AMD position by 87,051 shares through ARKK. Ark's sale was valued at about $21.6 million. AMD's ambitious target of $20 EPS by 2030 drew mixed reactions from analysts. Some argued the stock already prices in these aggressive assumptions, while others warned the forecast depends heavily on steep growth, margin expansion and sustained hyperscaler spending. Ark Invest sold Reddit shares through ARKF and ARKW. The sale of 39,854 shares was valued at $7.5 million. Reddit recently beat expectations with third-quarter earnings of 80 cents per share and $585 million in revenue. Daily active users rose 19% to 116 million, while ad revenue surged 74%. Margins and cash flow also improved sharply, with adjusted EBITDA climbing to $236 million. Here is how the stock compares with other semiconductor plays.

There currently are at least 32 crypto kiosks, according to St. Paul police, where users can deposit cash and see it converted into a digital alternative. Alarmed by fraud cases that have cost victims millions of dollars nationally, the St. Paul City Council is poised to ban virtual currency kiosks that have proliferated citywide. The ATM-like kiosks are placed in high-traffic areas such as convenience stores and allow users to make cash deposits, which are then converted into Bitcoin or other digital currencies and transferred into an account or virtual wallet. Digital currency is money that exists only in an electronic form and can be exchanged online. An ordinance before the city council calls for prohibiting any person from operating a virtual currency kiosk within city limits. It would not affect online virtual transactions conducted by businesses and residents. Michael Carter, an enforcement audit director with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, told the council Wednesday that there have been 51 law enforcement reports statewide involving $700,000 lost to various kiosk scams. “Criminals are becoming more sophisticated in their approach which authorities struggle to keep up.” However, Ethan McClelland, the director of government relations for Bitcoin Depot – a leading Bitcoin machine operator – called the proposed ordinance an overreaction. “We share the council's goal of protecting consumers from fraud,” McClelland said. “However, placing a reactionary ban on the industry that is already licensed and regulated by the state, which serves a legitimate purpose for St. Paul residents, is unnecessary and will deprive many customers their only way of participating in the digital economy.” Law enforcement investigators have called crypto scams especially dangerous because there is no centralized authority to flag suspicious behavior, and they are often untraceable. In 2023, Americans reported losing $5.6 billion in cryptocurrency scams, according to the FBI, which found that the frauds were more likely to target older people. Often, residents unfamiliar with cryptocurrency are warned by fraudsters that they owe the Internal Revenue Service or another federal agency back payments, and they're pressured to use a kiosk to deposit cash to a serial number within a matter of hours, or they'll be prosecuted, they're told. The Minnesota Legislature implemented a degree of cryptocurrency fraud protection in 2024. “These kiosks serve as a very specific flashpoint for which criminal activity defrauds citizens and no amount of disclosure or tapping of a screen or a receipt can be as effective as  simply removing them from operation,” Greenfield said. Scammers impersonated Xfinity technicians and told him abnormally high activity on his desktop had led them to find evidence of money laundering and other illegal acts. “The first thing they want you to do is to get you in a state of confusion,” he told the council.​ Crypto scams have become lucrative crimes in recent years. ​In June, an Eagan couple was almost scammed out of $125,000. The couple was able to avoid losing all of their money when Gabby Conklin, an office assistant in the city attorney's office who had stopped at a convenience store for gas, intervened, Noecker said. “The elderly couple were literally one press of a button away from losing their life savings irreversibly, but through Gabby's work that was averted,” Noecker said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. Blockchain technology is gaining mainstream traction in the U.S., with clearer regulations emerging as a key driver of adoption. To explore what that means for financial infrastructure, I sat down with Jeremy Fox-Geen, CFO of Circle Internet Group, a leading stablecoin issuer. “We are at the beginning of what can only be described as a global megatrend—the building of the internet financial system,” Fox-Geen told me. That system, he explained, encompasses blockchains, digital assets, and the applications built upon them—technologies that promise “massive benefits to businesses and consumers all around the world,” he said. While blockchain is already transforming parts of the economy, he emphasized that we are still in the early stages of its impact. Fox-Geen described Circle as a market-neutral infrastructure company: a platform that sits within the internet financial system's foundation—spanning blockchain, digital-asset, and application layers. “We're a platform that other companies choose to build upon,” he said. Stablecoins, such as Circle's USD Coin (USDC), are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to and backed by the U.S. dollar or equivalent assets. Key use cases for stablecoins include trading, settlement, dollarization, and cross-border payments. Circle's platform supports these use cases, aiming to reduce friction and cost in global financial transactions, Fox-Geen said. Circle made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5, marking the largest two-day post-IPO surge since 1980, Fortune reported. On Wednesday, the company reported its Q3 results: combined revenue and reserve income grew 66% year-over-year to $740 million, while net income rose 202% to $214 million. USDC circulation reached $73.7 billion, up 108% from a year earlier, and on-chain transaction volume jumped 580% to $9.6 trillion—evidence of its expanding real-world utility, Fox-Geen explained. JPMorgan has upgraded Circle's stock to “overweight” from “underweight” and increased its price target to $100 from $94, which helped rebound Circle shares in pre-market trading on Thursday. “We're seeing use cases grow fastest where costs, frictions, and business needs are highest,” Fox-Geen added. Circle is now building the fourth generation of blockchains, he said, as well as Arc, a native Layer-1 blockchain optimized to bring economic activity to the internet. To illustrate his thoughts on blockchain's promise, Fox-Geen posed this question: “Why can't you send money to anyone in the world—instantly and for free—just like sending a photo or text message? “You don't have to be a pioneer,” he said. Adam Schneider was appointed CFO of Millennium Systems International, the maker of Meevo, a salon, spa, and med spa software platform. Madhav Srinivasan was appointed CFO of Frost Brown Todd (FBT). Before joining FBT, Srinivasan served as CFO at a leading Am Law 50 firm, where he directed its global finance operations. Earlier in his career, he held senior financial and operational leadership roles at several international law firms and major corporations.

"Record U.S. government shutdown is over—but Wall Street only has 10 weeks to relax before the next one could begin" is a Fortune report by Eleanor Pringle. An optimist might assume the funding deal will avert a similar crisis—perhaps until the next administration, or for a couple of years at least? "Last night, President Donald Trump signed a funding bill to end the 43-day impasse on Capitol Hill. In it were funding provisions for departments including SNAP food aid, the Department of Agriculture, Congress, and veterans affairs through September next year. Unfortunately, the vast majority of federal departments only had their budgets approved until January 30." "AI and automation are already reshaping the future of work, but our collective choices will determine whether the disruption leads to decline or renewal. Deeper partnerships across government, academia, and industry will build a talent pipeline that is more innovative than ever before." —Vimal Kapur, chairman and CEO of Honeywell, writes in a Fortune opinion piece.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Threshold has introduced upgrades to its tBTC bridge, which it claims will better position the $500 billion worth of Bitcoin held by institutions and whales to access DeFi opportunities. Crypto infrastructure platform Threshold has rolled out a major upgrade for its tBTC bridge, aimed at enticing institutions to put their billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to work in decentralized finance protocols. Threshold's latest upgrade now enables institutions to mint tBTC directly to supported chains in a single Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, without secondary approvals and without gas fees, while redemptions back to the Bitcoin network are equally as straightforward, Threshold said in a statement. Threshold's head of marketing, Rizza Carla Ramos, went into more depth in an interview with Cointelegraph at the Web Summit in Lisbon this week, explaining that the feature improvements could incentivize more Bitcoin-holding institutions to put their BTC to work in DeFi instead of just letting it sit there and waiting for it to appreciate: Every tBTC minted is verifiably backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, with no middlemen or custodian risk, by implementing a threshold rule where at least 51 out of 100 Bitcoin node operators must sign the transaction for it to be valid. It could empower more than $500 billion in institutional and whale-held Bitcoin to move into Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Sui and other blockchains to chase DeFi opportunities. Threshold has seen over $4.2 billion in cumulative volume cross its tBTC bridge since it launched five years ago. It competes with Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and renBTC (RENBTC), which have seen far more trading volume than Threshold but operate on a more centralized model to move Bitcoin across other blockchains. Threshold also argued that tBTC would make the decentralized finance space more robust, as Bitcoin would deepen liquidity in decentralized exchange pools and lending protocols while enabling more sustainable yields.
