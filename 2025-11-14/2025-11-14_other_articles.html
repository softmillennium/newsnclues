The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, has opened ‘Dead Sea Scrolls: The Exhibition,' featuring a collection of ancient Jewish manuscripts along with 200 other artifacts. Rumors and stories of special appearances made by Jesus Christ in the town of Dozulé, France, have been declared not true. In the 1970s, a Catholic mother, Madeleine Aumont, reported seeing Jesus 49 times, sharing that the Lord told her to build an enormous cross in the French town. There is a similar and smaller cross on display in the town. "The phenomenon of the alleged apparitions ... is to be regarded, definitively, as not supernatural in origin, with all the consequences that flow from this determination," text from the doctrinal office approved by Pope Leo XIV said. "The Cross does not need 738 meters of steel or concrete to be recognized: It is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness." The town had a population of 2,279 people in 2022, according to Ville-Data. Father Patrick Mary Briscoe, a Dominican friar based in Rome, Italy, told Fox News Digital the Dozulé messages inspired curiosity in some circles. "Pope Leo is keeping the focus where it belongs — on Christ." Father Briscoe said Pope Leo's approval of this declaration shows how seriously the church takes discernment in spiritual matters — "not to suppress faith, but to purify it" — and to ensure that faith is not anchored by emotion or speculation, but truth. Pope Leo's approval of the new declaration shows how seriously the Church takes discernment in spiritual matters, "not to suppress faith, but to purify it," said a Dominican friar based in Rome. "It's clear that Pope Leo intends to speak directly to our scientific age," Father Briscoe also said. "His recent comments on compulsive gambling and internet addiction, for example, show that he's thinking about pressing issues." He shared that doctrinal clarity helps protect Christian teaching from superstition and excess. "The Vatican's discernment here safeguards authentic devotion. This is about protecting believers from confusion," said Briscoe. Instead, Pope Leo is keeping the focus where it belongs — on Christ." Ashley J.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before extraterrestrial rovers are sent to outer space, they undergo rigorous mechanical and mobility testing to ensure they can handle the new terrain. These tests aim to simulate the sand, rocks and slopes of planets, to ensure the rovers can be remotely controlled successfully. Engineers have traditionally accounted for this difference in gravity by creating prototypes that are one-sixth the mass of an actual rover. Dan Negrut, a professor of mechanical engineering at UW–Madison, and his collaborators have discovered that these past tests have missed one key terrain detail, which impacts a rover's success – the impact of the Earth's gravity on sand. News outlets like NBC News and ScienceDaily have praised the team for drawing attention to a long-overlooked issue in rover design and testing. “Our findings underscore the value of using physics-based simulation to analyze rover mobility on granular soil.” Using computer simulation, Negrut and his team have proven that the Earth's gravity pushes down on the sand beneath a rover much more than previously thought. However, on the moon, the weaker gravity leads to a less firm or “squishy” surface of sand, which can cause rovers to lose traction or get stuck. The study, titled “A Study Demonstrating That Using Gravitational Offset to Prepare Extraterrestrial Mobility Missions Is Misleading,” confirms that decades of rover testing on Earth may have led to overly optimistic performance predictions. The team's discovery came from combining two tools. This discovery has implications beyond improving extraterrestrial rovers, said Negrut. “It's very unusual in academia to produce a software product at this level,” Negrut says. “There are certain types of applications relevant to NASA and planetary exploration where our simulator can solve problems that no other tool can solve, including simulators from huge tech companies, and that's exciting.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the five years since Supernatural went silent after a staggering 15-season run, Jared Padalecki has poured himself into his fair share of other roles. After his time as a gritty man of the law was given the axe by the network, the Gilmore Girls alum moved onto a guest spot in CBS' smash hit series, Fire Country, in a role that audiences had hoped would turn into a spin-off of its own. So far, we know that the series will see Padalecki return to his recent rootin' tootin' Texan roots where he'll play a doctor who doesn't always play by the book. Loved by the community, Padalecki's medical professional runs a mobile clinic to better reach those who have been turned away by regular care providers. Accompanying him on his quest for good health for all is a young doctor who, according to the official logline, is “escaping her past.” In addition to starring, Padalecki will also serve the untitled project, which was announced as a possibility for the network earlier this year, as an executive producer alongside its writer, Anna Fricke. Fricke's Pursued by a Bear banner backs the production, with the company's Laura Terry executive producing and CBS Studios producing. The procedural serves as a reunion between the Supernatural alum and Fricke, as they previously worked alongside one another during Walker's four-season run. Padalecki seems to be following in the footsteps of his Supernatural co-star, Jensen Ackles, when it comes to the roles he's going after. Ackles, who appeared as the older brother to Padalecki's character in the demon hunting TV show, recently appeared in Prime Video's Countdown, a fast-paced drama overflowing with explosive action. Stay tuned to Collider for more about Padalecki's newest project. Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has been 18 long years since the last Metroid Prime. Nintendo has not produced one since Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, so the question lingering over the announcement of Prime 4 has been: Does anyone still know how to make one of these? A lengthy hands-on ahead of its release in December reassured me that Retro Studios has the look and feel of Metroid Prime well in-hand, but more importantly, has its objective marker set on expanding the world with new psychic powers that feel just as natural as Samus's other abilities. Our first taste of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, playable at the debut event for the Switch 2 itself, was composed of an initial tutorial section--an action spectacle as Samus comes to the aid of Federation forces under assault. That initial mission was meant to be a showpiece for both the game and the new hardware, and I walked away suitably impressed. Want us to remember this setting for all your devices? By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's                         Terms of Use and         Privacy Policy In the midst of Samus lending aid to the Federation, she gets transported to a strange planet, cut off from communications and not entirely sure where she is--and of course, missing some key pieces of her equipment. At that point she discovers a psychic crystal, which fuses itself to her helmet and imbues her with the ability to interface with the planet's technology. So in a way similar to how Samus has traditionally found Chozo artifacts that augment her suit, now she's finding psychically imbued Lamorn power-ups. And this sense of psychic power is accented by the only other speaking character in the demo commenting on how objects seem, from his perspective, to be moving by themselves as you manipulate them through telekinesis. This is where Prime 4 opens up into more expansive exploration, but I could still feel the presence of training wheels. It was still relatively linear and easy to tell where exactly you had to go, so I didn't feel overwhelmed by the alien landscape. The first one, at least, was almost entirely standalone, but I did see clues of things to come back to once I received other powers. And on a visual level, I had mixed feelings about this area. Nintendo excels at art direction and makes the most of its comparatively low hardware power, especially when it comes to the rubbery, cartoonish styles of Mario and his pals. When it comes to a more realistic style with lots of organic elements, the Switch 2 limitations, or perhaps Nintendo and Retro's inexperience with realism, are more apparent. There are moments that it looks surprisingly great, though, like when you navigate through vines as a morph ball and get to see the organic elements in a tightly controlled space, or viewing the sheen of calcified resin that blocks certain doors. In this initial section, enemies were mostly minor nuisances and the emphasis was on exploring, learning about your powers, and acquiring a few new ones. Finding a missile power-up lets you crack through the resin. But you also get psychic twists on both new and old powers. That element adds a twist to your usual suite of powers, and gives you that much more reason to flip into your visor mode and see what you can interact with. Samus Aran is a bona fide legend, so Myles is obviously impressed, giving the relationship echoes of classic Halo games when ordinary people would come face-to-face with Master Chief. Myles is obviously in way over his head on a hostile planet where everything is trying to kill him, but he knows his way around machinery, so he's an asset. Your mileage may vary, but I found his hapless dorky chatterbox persona endearing, especially contrasted against Samus's quiet stoicism. Myles even comments on it at one point, which makes me think the relationship is intended to be comedic. The demo culminated in a boss battle against Carvex, an aggressive, sentient plant. The fight started by using your weapon to cut through weak points in the vines, but as more appeared, you had to use the Control Beam to cut through several sections of its vines near-simultaneously, which couldn't be done through normal fire, all while dodging its swinging and swaying tendrils. The prize for defeating Carvex was another new power, the Psychic Bomb, which ordinarily operates like a standard Metroid Prime bomb but can be charged to create a floating version that can be grabbed with your mind-powers just like the psychic motes. That lets you activate switches remotely, which then allowed me to open a transport pod. What lies beyond that point is a mystery, and will be until the game releases on December 4. What I've seen so far, though, feels promising enough to fuel my anticipation. Nintendo and Retro Studios appear to understand the fundamental core of what makes a Metroid Prime game, with satisfying exploration, tense combat puzzles, and meaningful new abilities that change how you look at the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick discuss how scientists saw a man move a magnetic field with his mind—then the government classified it. What if your mind could do more than just think? What if it could manipulate the world around you? That's the idea behind one of Pop Mech's most compelling recent stories, “The CIA Watched Him Bend Reality With Just His Mind—Then Tried to Turn His Consciousness Into a Weapon.” In 1972, an artist named Ingo Swann allegedly altered the magnetic field in a sealed vacuum chamber just by thinking about it. That event led to one of the most surreal programs in U.S. government history: Project Stargate. Watch Pop Mech's Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick unpack the strange origins of Stargate, the Cold War paranoia that fueled it, and the CIA's mission to train “psychic spies” who could see across time and space through a technique called remote viewing. Andrew and John break down how the tests were run under ultra-secret conditions, and how the government tried—and maybe succeeded?—at unlocking human consciousness as a tool for intelligence gathering. Are There More Humans on Earth Than We Thought? Did Scientists Just Bend the Laws of Physics?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The enigmatic interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers worldwide, and fresh observations have led some experts to speculate it may actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The enigmatic interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers worldwide, and fresh observations have led some experts to speculate it may actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Unlike typical comets, 3I/ATLAS remained intact and luminous after passing near the Sun, defying expectations. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet's strange behaviors—such as its anti-tail and twin jets—could be the result of “technological thrusters,” implying it might be a mothership from another planet. Fresh images from the Nordic Optical Telescope, a 2.56-meter research telescope situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain's Canary Islands showed that 3I/ATLAS continues to display a confounding "anti-tail". Typically, a comet's tail streams behind, pushed by solar winds, but this weird reversal has left experts puzzled, with some proposing it's just an optical illusion, the Daily Mail reported. Considering the object's small size, roughly 3.5 miles wide, Professor Loeb has argued there's simply not enough ice to account for such intense eruptions, rejecting the notion that they're merely water vapor. Loeb had previously issued warnings the massive space rock could be an "extraterrestrial artefact" preparing to make first contact. But most scientists believe it's a comet that has been journeying for billions of years. It's also thought that the recently detected radio waves are evidence of its natural origins, resulting from specific wavelength absorption related to the presence of hydroxyl radicals, or OH molecules, in the comet's coma, according to Livescience. The publication explains: "These radicals are formed by the breakdown of water molecules as they are ejected from the comet via a natural process known as outgassing, which is a clear sign of cometary activity, according to a 2016 study."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fresh observations now suggest it might actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Just days ago, astronomers detected a strange radio signal from the mysterious interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS as it raced through our solar system, sparking wild theories that it could be an alien vessel. Rather than breaking up, 3I/ATLAS appeared as one solid, luminous object, featuring a strange "anti-tail" and two massive jets shooting material in opposing directions - occurrences that experts claim violate the laws of physics. Consequently, Harvard professor Avi Loeb has recently suggested these strange behaviors could be the result of "technological thrusters", implying the object might be a mothership from another planet. Fresh images from the Nordic Optical Telescope, a 2.56-meter research telescope situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain's Canary Islands showed that 3I/ATLAS continues to display a confounding "anti-tail". Typically, a comet's tail streams behind, pushed by solar winds, but this weird reversal has left experts puzzled, with some proposing it's just an optical illusion, the Daily Mail reported. Considering the object's small size, roughly 3.5 miles wide, Professor Loeb has argued there's simply not enough ice to account for such intense eruptions, rejecting the notion that they're merely water vapor. The professor posted on his Medium blog: "This post-perihelion manoeuvre might be employed by a spacecraft that aims to gain speed rather than slow down through the gravitational assist from the sun." Loeb had previously issued warnings the massive space rock could be an "extraterrestrial artefact" preparing to make first contact. But most scientists believe it's a comet that has been journeying for billions of years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The decision was approved by Pope Leo XIV on November 3. In the French town of Dozulé, Jesus is said to have appeared 49 times between 1972 and 1978 to Madeleine Aumont, a mother, asking for the construction of the so-called “Glorious Cross of Dozulé,” which was never built. The cross was to be fully illuminated and reach a height of 738 meters, with arms measuring 123 meters, thus visible from far away as a sign of universal redemption. At times, there is a mention of ‘multiplying the sign,' as if such diffusion were a mission given by Christ Himself.” Rather, the Cross “is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness; every time a soul converts; every time hope is rekindled where the situation seemed impossible; and even when, by kissing a small cross, believers entrust themselves to Christ.” It goes on to reiterate that “no private revelation may be considered a universal obligation or a sign binding the conscience of the faithful, even if spiritual fruits may accompany such phenomena. The letter then points out other messages that have been disproven by events. One such message, for example, asked for the “Glorious Cross” and Shrine to be built before the end of the 1975 Holy Year, “for it will be the last Holy Year.” “Clearly, this purported prophecy was not fulfilled,” the Dicastery notes, as two other ordinary Holy Years (2000 and 2025) and two extraordinary Holy Years (1983 and 2016) have subsequently been celebrated. Instead, they adore the One who offered His life upon it…The veneration of the Cross thus forms us in a tangible spirituality and an incarnate faith: not an abstraction, but a way of facing life with our gaze fixed upon the Crucified, recognizing in every trial the possibility of a redemptive encounter.” You can keep up-to-date by subscribing to our daily newsletter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Montana's ancient rocks, scientists uncovered the tiny remains of a land-dwelling crocodyliform that challenges what we thought we knew about crocodile evolution. Around 95 million years ago, a small crocodyliform affectionately called Elton roamed what is now southwest Montana, near the ancient shoreline of the Western Interior Seaway. According to Montana State University paleontology professor David Varricchio, the juvenile measured less than 2 feet long from snout to tail—roughly the size of a large lizard. Even as an adult, it would have reached only about 3 feet in length, making it much smaller than most members of the Neosuchia clade, which includes modern crocodiles and their extinct relatives. Most of these species were aquatic or semi-aquatic predators equipped with simple, conical teeth suited for catching prey in the water. It lived on land and likely fed on plants, insects, or small animals, using its varied and specialized teeth to process a wider range of food. “I brought it to Dr. Varricchio and knew it must be something good, because he said, ‘Take me to where you found this,'” said Allen, who is now studying croc paleontology as a doctoral student at Stony Brook University in New York. It was an exciting moment for Allen, originally from Kentucky, who chose MSU because it offers a paleontology track for undergraduates majoring in earth sciences. It had so much visible anatomy to explore, and he could see it was a tiny, tiny croc skull, fully articulated and preserved – it was a special thing,” Allen said. “We have found dinosaurs (in the Blackleaf) before, but this was the second known vertebrate animal we'd ever found in this formation.” “As an undergraduate student new to research, I nervously went up to Dr. Varricchio and asked if I could study this specimen,” Allen said. “It led me down the rabbit hole into this amazing world of prehistoric, extinct crocs and their evolutionary niches.” Back in Bozeman, Allen and his friend Dane Johnson, who graduated in 2022 and is now a paleontology lab and field specialist at MSU's Museum of the Rockies, spent between 10 and 20 hours sifting out fine particulate matter and dirt, eventually recovering dozens of tiny pieces of the Thikarisuchus skeleton that collectively fit into the palm of Allen's hand. Allen and Johnson recovered bits of bone from almost all areas of the animal's body, including its limbs, vertebrae, jaw and 50-millimeter-long skull. Instead, they took them for a series of CT scans, including some at MSU's Subzero Research Laboratory. “Harrison worked super hard to digitally reconstruct the animal, and it came out beautifully,” said Varricchio. He said this suggests that Thikarisuchus was likewise preserved within a burrow, further supporting the notion that fossils recovered from these formations are biased toward those that were preserved in burrows. The specimen also presented clues about Thikarisuchus' newly named family group Wannchampsidae and a similar group found in Eurasia known as Atopasauridae. “It suggests that during the same time period, we're seeing convergent evolution between two distantly related groups due to similar environmental conditions, prey availability, and who-knows-what that prompted crocs on opposite sides of the planet to develop similar features,” Allen said. As he works toward his Ph.D. and a career as a paleontology professor, Allen said his experiences with Elton cemented his research interest, which has since broadened to include extinct crocs from all over the world. Varricchio said he feels fortunate that students like Allen choose to study at MSU. “It was a true pleasure to have Harrison as a student here – so much positive enthusiasm, followed up with great research,” he said.

Following Los Angeles, the production will be presented by Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. from January 28 to February 7, and American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco from February 19 to March 15. The story follows James and Lou, who move from Chicago to London to escape the past but soon discover that places aren't haunted—people are. The cast includes Cher Álvarez, Patrick Heusinger, Shannon Cochran and Kate Fry. Levi Holloway said, “Writing Paranormal Activity for the stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London—working to create an actual nightmare—has been a dream. They'll find it here, right alongside all the mischief we've made to trouble their sleep.” Heusinger has been seen on Broadway in Next Fall and Fiddler on the Roof and starred as Lancelot in the national tour of Spamalot. His television credits include Gossip Girl, Royal Pains and Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce. Fry, whose many credits include Henry V, As You Like It, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, and The Merchant of Venice at Chicago Shakespeare Theater, has recently appeared in The Cherry Orchard at Goodman Theatre and Birthday Candles at Northlight Theatre. Levi Holloway is an ensemble member of A Red Orchid Theatre, which debuted his plays Grey House—later produced on Broadway—and Turret, starring Michael Shannon. He previously taught in the deaf department at Bell Elementary in Chicago for more than a decade and teaches playwriting at Silk Road Rising.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Kardashian took the California bar exam after a six-year journey to become a lawyer in June 2025. After calling psychics “pathological liars” in a TikTok video, Kim sparked reactions from fans and fellow celebrities. While psychics have a long history, the rise of platforms like #WitchTok has made spirituality a viral trend. Kim Kardashian has been on an unconventional six-year journey to become a lawyer, and in June 2025, she finally took the California bar exam. A long-time criminal justice reform advocate, she previously expressed confidence she had passed, though that confidence may have come more from her family's psychics than her studies. In a TikTok recap of her mother Kris Jenner's 70th birthday, Kim called the psychics “pathological liars”, sparking reactions from fans and highlighting a trend among celebrities like Khloé Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, and Brad Pitt, who have all consulted psychics for guidance. Psychics have fascinated people for centuries, from ancient temples to 19th-century parlors, and today, Gen Z has made the metaphysical world a viral trend on platforms like TikTok's #WitchTok. While many explore spirituality and alternative practices online, scammers have also taken advantage, with most readings focusing on money, love, and careers, making discernment crucial. Even so, some psychics, like Matt Fraser, suggest the spirit world operates on its own timeline — meaning Kim could still pass the bar, the next time she takes it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is 20 years since Florida police first investigated the financier Jeffrey Epstein for the sexual abuse of underage girls; six years since he killed himself in prison following his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges; and more than a year since Donald Trump said that he would have “no problem” with releasing the FBI files on the offender. It is not only about their own behaviour, but about any knowledge or suspicion of his crimes, and willingness to overlook them. Mr Trump has said that he had “no idea” about Epstein's crimes. On Wednesday, questions were reignited by the Democrats' release of emails in which Epstein described Mr Trump as “that dog that hasn't barked”, adding that “[victim's name redacted] spent hours at my house with him”. Republicans said the victim was the late Virginia Giuffre, who told lawyers that “I don't think Donald Trump participated in anything”. Mr Trump, who has mainstreamed and legitimised conspiracy politics and the championing of emotion over fact, attacks the issue as a “hoax”. The very people who urged Maga supporters to pursue this story – such as Kash Patel, now FBI chief – abruptly changed their minds this year without adequate explanation. Republicans released thousands of documents in response to the emails published by Democrats. The Republicans took a drubbing in off-year elections last week, and Mr Trump's approval rating is the lowest of this term. Mr Trump has shaken off troubles that would have ended any other political career – including E Jean Carroll's successful civil suit against him for sexual abuse (which he is again asking the supreme court to dismiss) and two dozen allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. For the Maga base, previously fired up by lurid and false “Pizzagate” claims of a paedophile ring connected to the Democratic political elite, this remains a burning issue. Their claims about Epstein's circle have at times been partisan, provably wrong and antisemitic. A fuller reckoning for his associates – from across the political spectrum – is overdue.
