                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The enigmatic interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers worldwide, and fresh observations have led some experts to speculate it may actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The enigmatic interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers worldwide, and fresh observations have led some experts to speculate it may actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Unlike typical comets, 3I/ATLAS remained intact and luminous after passing near the Sun, defying expectations. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet's strange behaviors—such as its anti-tail and twin jets—could be the result of “technological thrusters,” implying it might be a mothership from another planet. Fresh images from the Nordic Optical Telescope, a 2.56-meter research telescope situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain's Canary Islands showed that 3I/ATLAS continues to display a confounding "anti-tail". Typically, a comet's tail streams behind, pushed by solar winds, but this weird reversal has left experts puzzled, with some proposing it's just an optical illusion, the Daily Mail reported. Considering the object's small size, roughly 3.5 miles wide, Professor Loeb has argued there's simply not enough ice to account for such intense eruptions, rejecting the notion that they're merely water vapor. Loeb had previously issued warnings the massive space rock could be an "extraterrestrial artefact" preparing to make first contact. But most scientists believe it's a comet that has been journeying for billions of years. It's also thought that the recently detected radio waves are evidence of its natural origins, resulting from specific wavelength absorption related to the presence of hydroxyl radicals, or OH molecules, in the comet's coma, according to Livescience. The publication explains: "These radicals are formed by the breakdown of water molecules as they are ejected from the comet via a natural process known as outgassing, which is a clear sign of cometary activity, according to a 2016 study."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fresh observations now suggest it might actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Just days ago, astronomers detected a strange radio signal from the mysterious interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS as it raced through our solar system, sparking wild theories that it could be an alien vessel. Rather than breaking up, 3I/ATLAS appeared as one solid, luminous object, featuring a strange "anti-tail" and two massive jets shooting material in opposing directions - occurrences that experts claim violate the laws of physics. Consequently, Harvard professor Avi Loeb has recently suggested these strange behaviors could be the result of "technological thrusters", implying the object might be a mothership from another planet. Fresh images from the Nordic Optical Telescope, a 2.56-meter research telescope situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain's Canary Islands showed that 3I/ATLAS continues to display a confounding "anti-tail". Typically, a comet's tail streams behind, pushed by solar winds, but this weird reversal has left experts puzzled, with some proposing it's just an optical illusion, the Daily Mail reported. Considering the object's small size, roughly 3.5 miles wide, Professor Loeb has argued there's simply not enough ice to account for such intense eruptions, rejecting the notion that they're merely water vapor. The professor posted on his Medium blog: "This post-perihelion manoeuvre might be employed by a spacecraft that aims to gain speed rather than slow down through the gravitational assist from the sun." Loeb had previously issued warnings the massive space rock could be an "extraterrestrial artefact" preparing to make first contact. But most scientists believe it's a comet that has been journeying for billions of years. It's also thought that the recently detected radio waves are evidence of its natural origins, resulting from specific wavelength absorption related to the presence of hydroxyl radicals, or OH molecules, in the comet's coma, according to Livescience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The decision was approved by Pope Leo XIV on November 3. In the French town of Dozulé, Jesus is said to have appeared 49 times between 1972 and 1978 to Madeleine Aumont, a mother, asking for the construction of the so-called “Glorious Cross of Dozulé,” which was never built. The cross was to be fully illuminated and reach a height of 738 meters, with arms measuring 123 meters, thus visible from far away as a sign of universal redemption. At times, there is a mention of ‘multiplying the sign,' as if such diffusion were a mission given by Christ Himself.” Rather, the Cross “is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness; every time a soul converts; every time hope is rekindled where the situation seemed impossible; and even when, by kissing a small cross, believers entrust themselves to Christ.” It goes on to reiterate that “no private revelation may be considered a universal obligation or a sign binding the conscience of the faithful, even if spiritual fruits may accompany such phenomena. The letter then points out other messages that have been disproven by events. One such message, for example, asked for the “Glorious Cross” and Shrine to be built before the end of the 1975 Holy Year, “for it will be the last Holy Year.” “Clearly, this purported prophecy was not fulfilled,” the Dicastery notes, as two other ordinary Holy Years (2000 and 2025) and two extraordinary Holy Years (1983 and 2016) have subsequently been celebrated. Instead, they adore the One who offered His life upon it…The veneration of the Cross thus forms us in a tangible spirituality and an incarnate faith: not an abstraction, but a way of facing life with our gaze fixed upon the Crucified, recognizing in every trial the possibility of a redemptive encounter.” You can keep up-to-date by subscribing to our daily newsletter.</p>

During an interview with host Ross Coulthart on NewsNation's “Reality Check,” Nightcrawler Research's John Tedesco revealed that one of the UFO sightings they captured on video in New York took place July 5. (RELATED: Mysterious ‘Crop Doodle' Spotted In Argentine Wheat Field) “This was an object that presented over the water. “Within a short period of time, that object disappeared, and we saw this, what looked like a sphere on the water, an extremely bright, luminous sphere.” In one instance, they captured footage of an object seemingly entering and exiting the water. They also detailed another sighting involving a number of black triangular crafts, which they detected inside a cloud and recorded using radar. Coulthart questioned the team whether or not federal agencies, such as the FBI, have been treating their reported UFO sightings seriously, with Tedesco responding, “Absolutely.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Montana's ancient rocks, scientists uncovered the tiny remains of a land-dwelling crocodyliform that challenges what we thought we knew about crocodile evolution. Around 95 million years ago, a small crocodyliform affectionately called Elton roamed what is now southwest Montana, near the ancient shoreline of the Western Interior Seaway. According to Montana State University paleontology professor David Varricchio, the juvenile measured less than 2 feet long from snout to tail—roughly the size of a large lizard. Even as an adult, it would have reached only about 3 feet in length, making it much smaller than most members of the Neosuchia clade, which includes modern crocodiles and their extinct relatives. Most of these species were aquatic or semi-aquatic predators equipped with simple, conical teeth suited for catching prey in the water. It lived on land and likely fed on plants, insects, or small animals, using its varied and specialized teeth to process a wider range of food. “I brought it to Dr. Varricchio and knew it must be something good, because he said, ‘Take me to where you found this,'” said Allen, who is now studying croc paleontology as a doctoral student at Stony Brook University in New York. It was an exciting moment for Allen, originally from Kentucky, who chose MSU because it offers a paleontology track for undergraduates majoring in earth sciences. It had so much visible anatomy to explore, and he could see it was a tiny, tiny croc skull, fully articulated and preserved – it was a special thing,” Allen said. “We have found dinosaurs (in the Blackleaf) before, but this was the second known vertebrate animal we'd ever found in this formation.” “As an undergraduate student new to research, I nervously went up to Dr. Varricchio and asked if I could study this specimen,” Allen said. “It led me down the rabbit hole into this amazing world of prehistoric, extinct crocs and their evolutionary niches.” Back in Bozeman, Allen and his friend Dane Johnson, who graduated in 2022 and is now a paleontology lab and field specialist at MSU's Museum of the Rockies, spent between 10 and 20 hours sifting out fine particulate matter and dirt, eventually recovering dozens of tiny pieces of the Thikarisuchus skeleton that collectively fit into the palm of Allen's hand. Allen and Johnson recovered bits of bone from almost all areas of the animal's body, including its limbs, vertebrae, jaw and 50-millimeter-long skull. Instead, they took them for a series of CT scans, including some at MSU's Subzero Research Laboratory. “Harrison worked super hard to digitally reconstruct the animal, and it came out beautifully,” said Varricchio. He said this suggests that Thikarisuchus was likewise preserved within a burrow, further supporting the notion that fossils recovered from these formations are biased toward those that were preserved in burrows. The specimen also presented clues about Thikarisuchus' newly named family group Wannchampsidae and a similar group found in Eurasia known as Atopasauridae. “It suggests that during the same time period, we're seeing convergent evolution between two distantly related groups due to similar environmental conditions, prey availability, and who-knows-what that prompted crocs on opposite sides of the planet to develop similar features,” Allen said. As he works toward his Ph.D. and a career as a paleontology professor, Allen said his experiences with Elton cemented his research interest, which has since broadened to include extinct crocs from all over the world. Varricchio said he feels fortunate that students like Allen choose to study at MSU. “It was a true pleasure to have Harrison as a student here – so much positive enthusiasm, followed up with great research,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Center Theatre Group will present Paranormal Activity with an original story based on Paramount Pictures' terrifying film franchise. Get all the top news & discounts for Los Angeles & beyond. Production photos have been released from Center Theatre Group's presentation of Paranormal Activity, the new stage production with an original story inspired by Paramount Pictures' film franchise. Paranormal Activity, in its North American premiere production, is from Levi Holloway, who chilled Broadway audiences with his Tony Award-nominated Grey House in 2023, and Felix Barrett, pioneering founder and artistic director of the acclaimed Punchdrunk, whose immersive Sleep No More played more than 5,000 performances in a record-breaking 14-year run in New York at The McKittrick Hotel. Barrett and Punchdrunk are currently represented in New York by Viola's Room at The Shed through October 19. Following Los Angeles, the production will be presented by Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. from January 28 to February 7, and American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco from February 19 to March 15. The story follows James and Lou, who move from Chicago to London to escape the past but soon discover that places aren't haunted—people are. The cast includes Cher Álvarez, Patrick Heusinger, Shannon Cochran and Kate Fry. Levi Holloway said, “Writing Paranormal Activity for the stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London—working to create an actual nightmare—has been a dream. They'll find it here, right alongside all the mischief we've made to trouble their sleep.” Heusinger has been seen on Broadway in Next Fall and Fiddler on the Roof and starred as Lancelot in the national tour of Spamalot. His television credits include Gossip Girl, Royal Pains and Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce. Fry, whose many credits include Henry V, As You Like It, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, and The Merchant of Venice at Chicago Shakespeare Theater, has recently appeared in The Cherry Orchard at Goodman Theatre and Birthday Candles at Northlight Theatre. Levi Holloway is an ensemble member of A Red Orchid Theatre, which debuted his plays Grey House—later produced on Broadway—and Turret, starring Michael Shannon. He previously taught in the deaf department at Bell Elementary in Chicago for more than a decade and teaches playwriting at Silk Road Rising.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Kardashian took the California bar exam after a six-year journey to become a lawyer in June 2025. After calling psychics “pathological liars” in a TikTok video, Kim sparked reactions from fans and fellow celebrities. While psychics have a long history, the rise of platforms like #WitchTok has made spirituality a viral trend. Kim Kardashian has been on an unconventional six-year journey to become a lawyer, and in June 2025, she finally took the California bar exam. A long-time criminal justice reform advocate, she previously expressed confidence she had passed, though that confidence may have come more from her family's psychics than her studies. In a TikTok recap of her mother Kris Jenner's 70th birthday, Kim called the psychics “pathological liars”, sparking reactions from fans and highlighting a trend among celebrities like Khloé Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, and Brad Pitt, who have all consulted psychics for guidance. Psychics have fascinated people for centuries, from ancient temples to 19th-century parlors, and today, Gen Z has made the metaphysical world a viral trend on platforms like TikTok's #WitchTok. While many explore spirituality and alternative practices online, scammers have also taken advantage, with most readings focusing on money, love, and careers, making discernment crucial. Even so, some psychics, like Matt Fraser, suggest the spirit world operates on its own timeline — meaning Kim could still pass the bar, the next time she takes it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is 20 years since Florida police first investigated the financier Jeffrey Epstein for the sexual abuse of underage girls; six years since he killed himself in prison following his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges; and more than a year since Donald Trump said that he would have “no problem” with releasing the FBI files on the offender. It is not only about their own behaviour, but about any knowledge or suspicion of his crimes, and willingness to overlook them. Mr Trump has said that he had “no idea” about Epstein's crimes. On Wednesday, questions were reignited by the Democrats' release of emails in which Epstein described Mr Trump as “that dog that hasn't barked”, adding that “[victim's name redacted] spent hours at my house with him”. Republicans said the victim was the late Virginia Giuffre, who told lawyers that “I don't think Donald Trump participated in anything”. Mr Trump, who has mainstreamed and legitimised conspiracy politics and the championing of emotion over fact, attacks the issue as a “hoax”. The very people who urged Maga supporters to pursue this story – such as Kash Patel, now FBI chief – abruptly changed their minds this year without adequate explanation. Republicans released thousands of documents in response to the emails published by Democrats. The Republicans took a drubbing in off-year elections last week, and Mr Trump's approval rating is the lowest of this term. Mr Trump has shaken off troubles that would have ended any other political career – including E Jean Carroll's successful civil suit against him for sexual abuse (which he is again asking the supreme court to dismiss) and two dozen allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. For the Maga base, previously fired up by lurid and false “Pizzagate” claims of a paedophile ring connected to the Democratic political elite, this remains a burning issue. Their claims about Epstein's circle have at times been partisan, provably wrong and antisemitic. A fuller reckoning for his associates – from across the political spectrum – is overdue.
