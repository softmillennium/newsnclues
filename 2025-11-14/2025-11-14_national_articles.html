Several 5-mg pills of Oxycodone are seen June 17, 2019, in Zelienople, Pa. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company. If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl. Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits. This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough. “The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video. A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries. Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities. And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public. Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue's products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal. About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue's opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive. One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder. “Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can't do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein, March 28, 2017. (New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File) By the time Jeffery Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade. They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up. The emails do not implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year after Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that the German media underestimated Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.” Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you'll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn't work.” “its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.” In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director. “you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler now works, declined to comment. That included Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who Epstein sent an email to in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks.” In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him.” A year earlier, Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking, “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.” In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask, “any fun?” But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. “It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)” Nikolic wrote. The theoretical physicist and cosmologist Laurence Krauss was among them. In 2017, Krauss reached out to Epstein via email for advice on responding to a reporter writing a story about allegations of sexual harassment against him. In an explicit exchange, Epstein asked Krauss if he'd had sex with the person in question and then suggested he should not reply to the journalist. Decided it wasn't a good idea,” replied Krauss, who has previously denied all allegations of sexual harassment and assault. In the same exchange, which dipped into academic arguments about warning signs on currency collapses, behavioral science models, and Big Data, Epstein offered his residences for Chomsky's use. The emails also show that Epstein kept up a friendly relationship with Larry Summers, who was the treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and former Harvard University president, and bantered about the 2016 presidential race and Trump. In 2019, Summers was discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing to Epstein that “I said what are you up to. Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life.” Chomsky, Thiel, Bannon, Krauss and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem did not immediately respond to requests for comment, which were sent through email addresses available on their own or their organization's websites.</p>

Democratic National Committee employees were mercilessly mocked this week after news came out that staffers were very unhappy with a recent directive from DNC Chairman Ken Martin  end to remote work for employees who will now be required to show up to the office five days a week. Leadership of the union representing DNC employees put out a statement following news of the new directive, describing it as "callous." "It was shocking to see the DNC chair disregard staff's valid concerns on today's team call," they wrote. staff worked extremely hard to support historic wins for Democrats up and down the ballot last Tuesday, and this change feels especially callous considering the current economic conditions created by the Trump administration." Martin reportedly told employees that if they don't like the new policy, they should go find a job elsewhere. And Martin wasn't the only Democrat who had some harsh and pointed words for the Democratic Party staffers. Neera Tanden, former President Joe Biden's domestic policy advisor, had a similar message for DNC staffers, suggesting there were many eager folks waiting in line who would likely be more than willing to go into the office. Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin speaking from the DNC's home studio. "If you think democracy is on the line – working in the office is not a big ask," Tanden wrote in a post on X. "And there are plenty of other people willing to step up. "When you accept a job on a campaign, or with an org like the DNC, DCCC, etc, your single purpose is to win the election. It is a demanding job that requires long hours & sacrifices," the group wrote on X. "The other part of this is that I suspect [work from home] staff are probably losing opportunities for themselves by not being in the office. Campaigns require a lot of personal sacrifice, but the people who are good at their job and work to make themselves noticed in the office usually tend to go on to do big things!" One Florida-based Democratic strategist, Steve Schale, who led Barack Obama's statewide efforts in Florida in 2008 and returned to help his campaign in 2012, said the DNC should implement a "requirement" to ensure those who want to work at the DNC really have what it takes. "There should be a requirement that to work at the DNC that you've done at least two cycles on an actual battleground campaign, where terms like flex hours & hybrid work don't exist," Schale wrote on X.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Meanwhile, Republicans did not spare the opportunity to slam Democratic Party staffers as well. GOP strategist, Matt Gorman, quipped that the image of DNC staffers logging onto a Zoom call in their pajamas amid all the chaos of Biden's reelection "is hilarious." "The best part is that they still get two full months before they actually have to get out of bed 5 days week," GOP National Press Secretary Kiersten Pels said. Martin reportedly told his employees that the work-from-home policy the DNC implemented during COVID was never meant to be permanent, describing it as a "Band-Aid" that has long needed to be ripped off. He did say that remote work would still be allowed on a case-by-case basis, however. Neera Tanden, one of former President Joe Biden's top advisors in the White House, was among those Democrats who slammed DNC staffers for being upset of having to go back into the office full-time, as opposed to remote work. The group previously ratified a collective bargaining agreement with the DNC over the summer that "reaffirms its commitment to making hybrid work available," but also includes language that allows for a full return to in-person working as long as there is a 60-day notice period, according to the New York Times. Earlier this year, the Congressional Progressive Staff Association sent a letter to top House and Senate leaders proposing a rotating 32-hour work week for congressional staffers, arguing it would be a more "sustainable approach to work on a national level." "Why not be bold and ask for a 0-hour workweek?" "I wonder how blue-collar Americans would feel about white-collar workers demanding a 32-hour workweek."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani watches his home run against the Toronto Blue Jays during the seventh inning in Game 3 of baseball's World Series, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, in Los Angeles. New York Yankees' Aaron Judge is congratulated after hitting a two-run home run during the seventh inning of a baseball game against the Athletics, June 29, 2025, in New York. Los Angeles Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani celebrates his home run against the Toronto Blue Jays during the seventh inning in Game 3 of baseball's World Series, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, in Los Angeles. Seattle Mariners designated hitter Cal Raleigh hits a solo home run against the San Diego Padres during the first inning of a baseball game Monday, Aug. 25, 2025, in Seattle. Shohei Ohtani likes winning Most Valuable Player awards. He loves winning the World Series even more. The two-way Japenese star did both for a second season in a row for the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning his fourth career MVP on Thursday night while unanimously earning the National League honor. He's just the second to win four MVPs after Barry Bonds with seven and the only player to win unanimously more than once. Considering Ohtani is 31, overtaking Bonds doesn't seem out of the question. Especially if it leads to more Fall Classic opportunities. “If I'm playing well as an individual that means I'm helping the team win, so in that sense, hopefully I can end up with a couple more MVPs,” Ohtani said through an interpreter. Judge, who won the AL award in 2022 and 2024, joined Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle as three-time MVPs with the Yankees. “It's tough for me to wrap my head around,” Judge said. Later he added: “You've got to pinch yourself every single day. Ohtani signed with the crosstown Dodgers the following offseason and won NL MVP in 2024 during his first season in Chavez Ravine. Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber finished second in the NL with 23 second-place votes and New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto was third with four. Ohtani hit .282 and led the NL with a 1.014 OPS. He also had 55 homers, 102 RBIs and 20 stolen bases. He struck out 62 batters over 47 innings, slowly increasing his workload while preparing for the postseason. He hit three homers while striking out 10 over six dominant innings on Oct. 17, leading the Dodgers over Milwaukee to finish an NL Championship Series sweep. Schwarber, who earned a $50,000 bonus for finishing second, hit an NL-best 56 homers and led the big leagues with 132 RBIs for Philadelphia. The four-time All-Star — who signed a $765 million, 15-year deal last December — had 43 homers, 105 RBIs and an NL-best 38 stolen bases. He received a $150,000 bonus for finishing third in the MVP voting. Judge is the first AL player to win back-to-back MVPs since Detroit's Miguel Cabrera it in 2012 and 2013. He started 119 games behind the plate and another 38 at designated hitter. Judge said he got to know Raleigh a little during the All-Star break and the catcher asked for some leadership tips. “I could sit here and talk all night about the player he is, but really the kind of leader and person he is really stuck out to me at the All-Star Game.” Cleveland's José Ramírez finished third in the AL. Arizona's Geraldo Perdomo was fourth in the NL voting, earning him $2.5 million annual salary increases in 2028 and 2029 along with the price of Arizona's 2030 club option.</p>

FIRST ON FOX: The Coast Guard Cutter Seneca interdicted 5,500 pounds of cocaine northeast of the Galápagos Islands Sept. 10, 2025, as part of Operation Pacific Viper, a Coast Guard and Navy effort to combat illegal drugs entering the U.S. (Credit: DHS) The U.S. Coast Guard announced Thursday it detected a Russian military spy vessel operating near U.S. territorial waters Oct. 29, and personnel are continuing to monitor the ship. Officials said the Vishnya-class intelligence ship was about 15 nautical miles south of Oahu, prompting a response by the Coast Guard HC-130 Hercules from Air Station Barbers Point and the Coast Guard Cutter William Hart. The Coast Guard responded to the Russian Federation Navy Auxiliary General Intelligence ship, Kareliya, by conducting a safe and professional overflight and transiting near the vessel, according to a news release. Acting in accordance with international law, the Coast Guard said personnel are monitoring the vessel's activities near U.S. territorial waters to provide maritime security for U.S. vessels operating in the area. Coast guardsmen will also monitor the vessel to support U.S. homeland defense efforts. Matthew Chong, chief of response for the Coast Guard Oceania District, wrote in a statement. The Coast Guard said it is continuing to monitor the ship, which was first spotted in October. There are seven ships still in service with the Russian Navy. They are large, purpose-built vessels designed for signals intelligence gathering via an extensive array of sensors, according to the site. Data can be transmitted to shore via satellite link antennas. While the ships are designed for intelligence gathering, they are armed with two AK-630 close-in weapon systems and SA-N-8 surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers, for last resort self-defense, according to the Army. Coast Guard Oceania District works in conjunction with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and interagency partners to constantly monitor the activity of foreign military vessels operating near U.S. territorial waters to ensure homeland security and defense. Under customary international law, foreign military vessels are permitted to transit and operate outside other nations' territorial seas, which extend up to 12 nautical miles from shore. The Coast Guard did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor reports on ICE's joint operation with Florida law enforcement targeting illegal sexual offenders and convicted murderers on ‘The Story'. Locals in San Francisco, California, have begun passing out whistles to communicate and coordinate against ICE deportations. Activists and organizations have started distributing whistles for local residents to coordinate against the federal government's immigration enforcement efforts, SFGate reported. "By following the same whistle code, locals can communicate from afar: Three short whistles signal that ICE is nearby, and one long whistle means that somebody is being detained," SFGate reported. Frameline, the nonprofit behind San Francisco's LGBTQ+ Frameline film festival, has been stocking "whistle stops" in the city, where people can pick up free whistles and join anti-ICE efforts. Federal agents block people protesting an ICE immigration raid at a nearby licensed cannabis farm on July 10, 2025, near Camarillo, California. In an email to SFGATE, Roxie Theater manager Gabriella Siaton, whose venue is one of multiple participating whistle stops, said the theater's initial supply of whistles was gone within a day of arrival. "Prior to this, I had not heard about the whistle code," she wrote. "I knew there were different sharings on social media regarding ICE agents being spotted in the Mission, but I appreciate how the whistle allows for a more instant and in-the-moment response." "The sound of a whistle tells immigrants and other vulnerable community members to run away while also urging fellow neighbors to gather in a crowd and run toward the scene to film arrests," the California news outlet wrote.

"We were inspired by the bold legacy of queer resistance — from San Francisco's Butterfly Brigade blowing whistles in the Castro to defend each other from violence to the community organizing coming out of Chicago now," Frameline's executive director Allegra Madsen told SFGate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SEATTLE (AP) — First-term Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell conceded his reelection fight to progressive activist Katie Wilson on Thursday, handing another victory to leftist Democrats around the country frustrated with unaffordability, homelessness, public safety and the actions of President Donald Trump's administration. Harrell, a centrist Democrat who previously served three terms on the City Council, led in early results. But Washington conducts all-mail elections, with ballots postmarked by Election Day. Wilson, 43, is a democratic socialist who has never held elected office. She told a news conference later Thursday that it was hard for her to believe she had been elected mayor, considering that at the beginning of this year she had no intention of running, and she acknowledged concerns about her lack of experience: “No one saw this coming.” But she also spoke to the resonance of her volunteer-driven campaign among voters concerned about affordability and public safety in a city where the cost of living has soared as Amazon and other tech companies proliferated. Universal child care, better mass transit, better public safety and stable, affordable housing are among her priorities, and she said she would take office with a strong mandate to purse them, though she acknowledged the city also faces a significant budget shortfall. Wilson called herself a coalition builder and community organizer, and said she would also work with those who questioned her qualifications to lead a city with more than 13,000 employees and a budget of nearly $9 billion: “This is your city too.” She will be working with a relatively new City Council: Only two of the seven council members have served more than one term. Harrell was elected mayor in 2021 following the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic and racial justice protests over George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police. With crime falling, more police being hired, less visible drug use and many homeless encampments removed from city parks, the business-backed Harrell once seemed likely to cruise to reelection. But Trump's return to office — and his efforts to send in federal agents or cut funding for blue cities — helped reawaken Seattle's progressive voters. The lesser-known Wilson, a democratic socialist, ran a campaign that echoed some of the themes of progressive mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in New York. Wilson studied at an Oxford University college in England but did not graduate. She founded the small nonprofit Transit Riders Union in 2011 and has led campaigns for better public transportation, higher minimum wages, stronger renter protections and more affordable housing. She herself is a renter, living in a one-bedroom apartment in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood, and says that has shaped her understanding of Seattle's affordability crisis. Wilson criticized Harrell as doing too little to provide more shelter and said his encampment sweeps have been cosmetic, merely pushing unhoused people around the city. Wilson also painted him as a City Hall fixture who bore responsibility for the status quo. Harrell, 67, played on the Rose Bowl champion University of Washington football team in 1978 before going to law school. His father, who was Black, came to Seattle from the segregated Jim Crow South, and his mother, a Japanese American, was incarcerated at an internment camp in Minidoka, Idaho, during World War II after officials seized her family's Seattle flower shop — experiences that fostered his understanding of the importance of civil rights and inclusivity. Both candidates touted plans for affordable housing, combating crime and attempting to Trump-proof the city, which receives about $150 million a year in federal funding. Wilson has proposed a city-level capital gains tax to help offset federal funding the city might lose and to pay for housing. Harrell says that idea is ineffective because a city capital gains tax could easily be avoided by those who would be required to pay it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nevada GOP chair Michael McDonald walks on stage before speaking ahead of Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump at a campaign event Jan. 27, 2024, in Las Vegas. CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — The yearslong case against six Nevada Republicans who were accused of submitting a bogus certificate that falsely declared President Donald Trump the winner of the state's 2020 presidential election has been sent back to Clark County, where a jury is more likely to rule against them. Clark County is home to Las Vegas and leans Democratic. The higher court's decision to let the case move forward marks a rare win for swing-state efforts to prosecute so-called fake electors who tried to keep Trump in the White House after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. In Michigan, a judge recently dismissed charges against 15 Republicans who had been charged by that state's Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel. The dismissal came after a judge in Arizona sent the fake electors case there back to the grand jury for fuller instructions about what federal law requires. “Today the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed what we have maintained all along — that Clark County is the proper and lawful venue to prosecute our case, and I am pleased with the court's decision to overturn the District Court's dismissal of our case in Clark County,” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said in a statement. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. After the 2020 election, the six electors gathered outside of the Nevada Legislature to sign certificates giving the state's six electoral votes to Trump, despite former President Joe Biden winning the state by more than 30,000 votes. Criminal cases were also brought against Republican electors in Michigan, Georgia and Arizona. On Monday, Trump pardoned his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others accused of aiding his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. They say they were exercising their First Amendment rights to criticize the state's election processes. The six Nevadans, who had pleaded not guilty, include Michael McDonald, the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, and Jesse Law, the former Clark County Republican Party chairman who was recently ousted in a July election. A main argument in the case focused on where the alleged crimes occurred. It was also sent to the Nevada secretary of state in Carson City and a federal judge in Las Vegas. The Nevada Supreme Court justices sided unanimously with the attorney general's office, saying in its Thursday opinion that Nevada law does not preclude a venue from being appropriate in multiple counties for the same offense. As a precaution, Ford filed a separate case in Carson City in December 2024 to avoid the statute of limitations expiring while the Nevada Supreme Court made its decision. In the Carson City case, he charged the defendants with “uttering a forged instrument.” That case will likely be withdrawn. Ford, a Democrat, is running for governor in 2026.</p>

An American Airlines flight carrying four members of Arizona's congressional delegation to Washington, D.C., diverted Tuesday to Kansas City, Missouri, after a passenger became disruptive. The airline told Fox News Digital that Flight 1218 left Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport Nov. 11, 2025, and was rerouted because of "a disruptive customer." "On Nov. 11, American Airlines flight 1218, with service from Phoenix (PHX) to Washington, D.C. (DCA), diverted to Kansas City (MCI) due to a disruptive customer," American Airlines told Fox News Digital. Kansas City police officers board American Airlines Flight 1218 to remove a disruptive passenger after the plane diverted from its route to Washington, D.C., Nov. 11, 2025. Rep. Greg Stanton, a Democrat from Arizona, posted on X that he and three Republican colleagues — Reps. Eli Crane, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar — were aboard when the incident occurred. @RepEliCrane, @RepAndyBiggsAZ & @RepGosar all on this flight. We're making emergency stop in Kansas City to remove disruptive passenger. None of my colleagues is the disruptor. Freedom Caucus losing its mojo," Stanton wrote. Flight data shows the Airbus A320 had been airborne for roughly two hours and 40 minutes before diverting to Kansas City International Airport around 6:15 p.m. local time. Video posted to X by another passenger shows Kansas City police officers boarding the plane to remove a woman who apologized as she was led away, saying, "We live in a fascist state." Kansas City police officers board American Airlines Flight 1218 to remove a disruptive passenger after the plane diverted from its route to Washington, D.C., Nov. 11, 2025. The flight departed again about an hour later and landed at Reagan National Airport shortly after 10 p.m. "On a serious note, thank you Kansas City police for handling the situation professionally and without incident," Stanton later wrote. Stanton said he was headed to Washington to vote against the Republican continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, while his GOP colleagues supported the plan. The House passed the Senate's funding bill, 222-209, restoring federal paychecks, funding air traffic controllers and replenishing nutrition programs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani is once again adding well-deserved hardware to his growing collection and further securing his reputation as a generational talent. New York Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge took home honors in the American League for a second consecutive year. Ohtani yet again proved why he is considered an all-time talent, leading the Dodgers to their second straight World Series win. Ohtani also made an impact on the mound for LA, making his return to pitching in June after an almost two-year layoff, following two procedures, including one to repair the right ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow and his left shoulder last offseason. In 14 starts, he went 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA and had 62 strikeouts. Tuesday night's game will be yet another for the history books 3 straight MVPs, 4 total, and all of them UNANIMOUS.Shohei Ohtani is superhuman 💥 pic.twitter.com/7CjePY120c Ohtani beat out award finalists New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber, getting all 30 votes to win unanimously. “Biggest thing is winning the World Series,” Ohtani said via his translator on MLB Network. He joins Barry Bonds as the only player in MLB history to win four MVPs. Bonds, MLB's all-time home run leader, has won the award seven times. Standing at an opposing 6-foot-7, Judge became just the third player to hit at least 50 home runs and win a batting title in the same season, joining Yankees great Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx. Judge called it “pretty wild” when asked about all the silverware he's won. From one Yankees great to another!Don Mattingly announces Aaron Judge as the 2025 AL MVP 💪 https://t.co/eljyAVwNOC pic.twitter.com/NCFP6XktjO “You try not to think about it during the season. I try to keep my head down through all 162,” Judge said with his family and two dogs beside him. “Just do whatever I can in today's game to help the team win. Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh and Cleveland Guardians third baseman Jose Ramirez with 17 first-place votes. Raleigh, affectionately known as the “Big Dumper,” came in second with 13 votes. The seven-time All-Star congratulated Raleigh and Ramirez for having “two incredible seasons.” “Especially when we play Seattle, the main objective is making sure Cal (Raleigh) doesn't beat you. He can beat you from both sides of the plate.” On Wednesday, Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal won his second straight AL Cy Young award, while Pittsburgh Pirates' 23-year-old phenom Paul Skenes was named the NL Cy Young winner.</p>

Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) Director Daniel Rogers, during a rare public appearance Thursday, said nearly one in 10 of the agency's terrorism investigations include at least one person under the age of 18, an alarming trend driven by online extremism. Since 2014, there have been nearly two dozen violent extremist attacks in Canada resulting in 29 deaths and at least 60 injuries, according to Rogers. Worryingly, he said, nearly one in ten terrorism investigations at CSIS, the country's domestic spy agency, include at least one "subject of investigation" under the age of 18. In August, a minor was arrested in Montreal for allegedly planning an attack on behalf of the terrorist group Daesh, according to Rogers. Just a few months earlier, a 15-year-old Edmonton-area minor was charged with a terrorism-related offense, after Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigators feared the teen would commit serious violence related to COM/764, a transnational violent online network that manipulates children and youth across widely accessible online platforms. "Clearly, radicalized youth can cause the same harms as radicalized adults, but the societal supports for youth may help us catch radicalization early and prevent it," Rogers said. "These tragic numbers would have been higher if not for disruptive actions taken by CSIS and our law enforcement partners." Multiple attacks over the last year were intercepted by Canadian authorities, officials said. The report provides advice to parents, guardians and others with information to help them identify early concerns and address youth radicalization before it's too late. "Since 2022, CSIS has been involved in the disruption of no fewer than 24 violent extremist actions, each resulting in arrests or terrorism peace bond charges," Rogers said. In another, an individual was arrested before allegedly attempting to illegally enter the United States to attack members of the Jewish community in New York. In these examples, and in many others I can't discuss publicly, our counter-terrorism teams have partnered with law enforcement and saved lives." Canadian officials said they also blocked potentially 'lethal threats' by Iran. He attributed the radicalization to "eroding social cohesion, increasing polarization and significant global events," which he said "provide fertile ground for radicalization." "Many who turn to violence radicalize exclusively online, often without direction from others," Rogers said. "They use technology to do so secretly and anonymously, seriously challenging the ability of our investigators to keep pace and to identify and prevent acts of violence." Rogers also noted the CSIS collects intelligence and defends against transnational repression, previously focusing on transnational repression by the People's Republic of China, India and others. "In particularly alarming cases over the last year, we've had to reprioritize our operations to counter the actions of Iranian intelligence services and their proxies who have targeted individuals they perceive as threats to their regime," he said. "In more than one case, this involved detecting, investigating and disrupting potentially lethal threats against individuals in Canada."

After winning his second World Series in as many years with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Shohei Ohtani also has back-to-back NL MVP Awards under his belt after a unanimous vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. The two-way Japanese superstar was named the 2025 NL MVP, giving him four over his MLB career. In fact, he has won an MVP Award in each of the last three seasons, having won the 2023 award in his final year as an Angels star. Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani, right, talks with interpreter Ippei Mizuhara during the ninth inning against the San Diego Padres at the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul, South Korea, March 20, 2024, in Seoul, South Korea. Now, Ohtani has just Barry Bonds to chase for the most MVP Awards in MLB history. Bonds won seven NL MVPs, a feat some believe is still untouchable. Ohtani was tied with 10 other players with three over their careers, but the 31-year-old is in a new position now and only looking up at Bonds. Schwarber received 23 second-place votes to Soto's four. Ohtani, a five-time All-Star, led the National League in runs scored (146), slugging percentage (.622) and OPS (1.024), while mashing 55 home runs with 102 RBIs and a .282 average. And after not being able to pitch in 2024, Ohtani was back on the mound this season with a 2.87 ERA in 14 starts (47 innings) with 62 strikeouts and nine walks. Over 17 postseason games, Ohtani slashed .265/.405/.691 with eight homers, three doubles and 14 RBIs. While it was virtually a lock Ohtani would be named the NL MVP, one of baseball's biggest debates revolved around the AL MVP. Was it going to be New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge going back-to-back, or would Seattle Mariners switch-hitting catcher Cal Raleigh's dream season end with the award? The New York Yankees' Aaron Judge runs to first after hitting a two-run home run in the first inning against the Kansas City Royals June 10, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. While Raleigh had Judge beat in the home run department, the Yankees slugger won his first career batting title, leading MLB with a .331 average. He also led all of MLB with a .457 on-base percentage, .688 slugging percentage and 1.144 OPS and was the leader in the American League with 137 runs. Judge tallied 114 RBIs, and he was intentionally walked 36 times, blowing away Ohtani's NL-leading total. This was Judge's seventh All-Star season as he continues to be arguably the best pure hitter in MLB. It just seemed Raleigh couldn't be stopped, and he couldn't stop breaking records in the process. Raleigh hit 60 home runs, which not only led MLB, but set the league record for the most ever by a catcher, a switch-hitter and a Mariners player. He finished with 125 RBIs while slashing .247/.359/.948 in 159 games. Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh reacts after hitting his 60th home run during the eighth inning against the Colorado Rockies in Seattle Sept. 24, 2025. Raleigh played in all but three games this season, which includes 128 games at the league's most demanding position as a catcher. Those pulling for Raleigh during the season pointed to how he was consistently breaking records for a position that usually gets overlooked for this type of award.
