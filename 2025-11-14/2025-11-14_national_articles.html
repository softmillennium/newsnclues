                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Thus far, the justices have signaled they may not let him — yet. About a month ago, Trump v. Illinois looked like it was going to be one of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions of the entire Trump era. After two lower courts ruled that Trump's use of the National Guard in this way is illegal, Trump asked the Supreme Court — which has a Republican majority that frequently rules in his favor — to greenlight his use of troops in mid-October. Yet, in a break from their ordinary practice, the Court signaled in an October 29 order that they are skeptical of many of Trump's legal arguments. And they asked for additional briefing on a question that neither party raised to the justices. The upshot is that Trump's attempt to send troops to Broadview remains blocked by the lower court orders, at least for now. The Court's October 29 order, moreover, suggests that the justices may look to delay a showdown on whether and when Trump can use the military against Americans on US soil until a future case. But, even if the Court does rule against Trump, that will likely only punt the question of when Trump is allowed to deploy troops against Americans until a future date. Beginning in September, a small group of people have protested the Trump administration's immigration policies outside of a detention facility in Broadview. According to Judge April Perry, a federal district judge who ruled against Trump's use of troops, “the typical number of protestors is fewer than fifty,” and “the crowd has never exceeded 200.” Some allegedly vandalized federal law enforcement vehicles, and others have been arrested for more serious crimes such as aggravated battery. When Illinois first reached the Supreme Court, the case seemed to turn on whether federal law permits using National Guard members against such a minor protest. In their initial brief to the justices, Trump's lawyers made some very aggressive arguments. Among other things, they claimed that the decision to take control of National Guard members “is committed exclusively to the president” and cannot be reviewed by federal courts. There would be no need, for example, to parse the meaning of the words “regular forces” if Trump's decision to deploy troops against protesters cannot be reviewed by the courts. It is likely, moreover, that the justices are sympathetic to a reading of these two words that would require them to rule against Trump in the Illinois case. But a ruling against him on these narrow grounds would merely delay the question of whether and when Trump can use the military against Americans on US soil. Thus, as Trump's lawyers presented the case to the justices, Illinois turned on whether Trump was unable to enforce US law in Broadview without relying on the military at all. And it appears that Lederman's argument is sufficiently persuasive that it convinced a majority of the justices to seek additional briefing from Trump and from the Illinois plaintiffs on whether Lederman is correct. To understand Lederman's argument, it's helpful to understand some of the history of the National Guard. Many of the United States's founders feared a permanent, national, standing army; as the Supreme Court summarized this fear in a 1990 opinion, “there was a widespread fear that a national standing Army posed an intolerable threat to individual liberty and to the sovereignty of the separate States.” Instead, the framers imagined that states would maintain a militia that would generally operate under the state's control. The framers' original vision of a nation with no permanent federal army obviously no longer describes America's relationship with the military. In 1901, Roosevelt asked Congress to enact new legislation that would replace the atrophied militias with what became the modern-day National Guard. Notably, Roosevelt's message to Congress proposed that the armaments and other resources provided to this new militia should “be made identical with those provided for the regular forces.” (Congress removed the words “at his command” in 1956 because it deemed them to be “surplusage.”) In any event, much of Lederman's brief is a long list of historical examples showing that Congress used the words “regular forces” to distinguish a standing federal military from state militias. An 1806 law, for example, provides that militiamen are subject to the same rules of military justice as federal troops when “acting in conjunction with the regular forces of the United States.” A broader 1814 law concerned court martials of militiamen serving under the United States “whether acting in conjunction with the regular forces or otherwise.” Unless you are a fan of military forces in US streets, the implications of Lederman's argument may seem alarming. The Justice Department has long interpreted these circumstances very narrowly. In a 1964 memorandum signed by then-Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, for example, the DOJ concluded that the Insurrection Act may only be used if “state authorities are either directly involved, by acting or failing to act, in denials of federal rights of a dimension requiring federal military action, or are so helpless in the face of private violence that the private activity has taken on the character of state action.” If the justices accept Lederman's interpretation of the amended Dick Act, then that will mean Trump will lose his bid to send National Guard members to Broadview. The government has had troves of evidence for years. Will JD Vance‘s vision set the GOP's course after Trump? The global backlash to Trump's politicization of US intelligence, explained. After 43 days, the government is almost open again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein, March 28, 2017. (New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File) By the time Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade. They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up. The emails do not implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you'll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn't work.” “its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.” In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well-known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, a tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director. “you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler now works, declined to comment. That included Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who Epstein sent an email to in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks.” In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him.” A year earlier, Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking, “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.” In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask, “any fun?” But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. “It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)” Nikolic wrote. The theoretical physicist and cosmologist Laurence Krauss was among them. In 2017, Krauss reached out to Epstein via email for advice on responding to a reporter writing a story about allegations of sexual harassment against him. In an explicit exchange, Epstein asked Krauss if he'd had sex with the person in question and then suggested he should not reply to the journalist. Decided it wasn't a good idea,” replied Krauss. Krauss said in an email to The Associated Press that he never hid the fact that he knew Epstein, and interacted with him several times. “I sought out advice from essentially everyone I knew when false allegations about me were circulated in the press in 2018,” said Krauss. In the same exchange, which dipped into academic arguments about warning signs on currency collapses, behavioral science models, and Big Data, Epstein offered his residences for Chomsky's use. The emails also show that Epstein kept up a friendly relationship with Larry Summers, who was the treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and former Harvard University president, and bantered about the 2016 presidential race and Trump. In 2019, Summers was discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing to Epstein that “I said what are you up to. Epstein replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life.” Chomsky, Thiel, Bannon, and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem did not immediately respond to requests for comment, which were sent through email addresses available on their own or their organizations' websites. This story has been corrected to fix spelling of former French president Sarkozy's first name, It also corrects that Epstein was not a billionaire.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE — Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, speaks during a news conference to announce charges against Ghislaine Maxwell for her alleged role in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein, July 2, 2020, in New York. Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee offer a new glimpse into what Jeffery Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade. They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. The emails don't implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said air traffic controllers received 70% of their back pay Friday for working during the shutdown. A number of controllers called out of work during the shutdown as they dealt with the financial pressure from going without pay for so long. Some controllers even got side jobs to help make ends meet. That led to delays and other flight disruptions when the Federal Aviation Administration ran short of controllers at airport towers and other radar facilities. Controller staffing improved significantly earlier this week as the shutdown drew to a close. Duffy and President Donald Trump have also proposed that controllers who didn't miss a shift during the shutdown should receive $10,000 bonuses. But the details of exactly who might get those checks haven't been released. Democratic members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure asked federal officials for an explanation of the decision to cut up to 10% of flights at 40 major airports during the shutdown, along with details on staffing levels and how airports were chosen. “It appears that the administration made this decision without adequate coordination with key aviation stakeholders,” said Friday's letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, . The group requested a briefing and written response by Nov. 20. Requests for comment were sent to the department and FAA. The president is planning to attend the World Economic Forum's meeting in Switzerland in January, according to a senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans that were not yet publicly announced. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is working with state and local law enforcement agencies to carry out welfare checks on roughly 450,000 migrant children. The administration launched a similar effort earlier  this year, but this one includes state and local law enforcement agencies authorized to work with ICE. Migrant children traveling alone initially stay in government shelters before being released to sponsors. Migrant advocates are suspicious that the Trump administration's efforts could end up being a way to deport sponsors or children. Boonville is a small, mostly white town set in an area teeming with cattle and row crops. The incumbent is Democrat Emanuel Cleaver, who preached about racial justice as a Methodist minister and has worked for decades for federally funded projects in 18th and Vine. Boonville's decades-long project is a trail favored by cycling enthusiasts. A union representing federal prison workers is suing the Bureau of Prisons after the agency said it was canceling its collective bargaining agreement. Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III announced the termination for the collective bargaining agreement Sept. 25, citing President Trump's executive order in March that exempts certain federal agencies from collective bargaining or recognizing employee labor unions. Marshall said the union had become “an obstacle to progress instead of a partner in it.” The union, in its lawsuit, contends the Bureau of Prisons failed to provide “any reasoned explanation” for its decision, as required under federal law. Steve Sadow said he's confident that “fair and impartial review” will lead to a dismissal of the case against Trump. The president kicked off his Friday with posts on social media complaining about Democratic lawmakers focusing on thousands of documents from Epstein's estate released this week by the House Oversight Committee. Trump called it a “hoax” and a distraction from Democrats' policies and the “EMBARASSMENT” of the government shutdown and decried “Weak Republicans” who “have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish.” Trump seemed to be referring to the House Republican who are joining Democrats in a push to release files related to the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein. Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.” The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia was tasked with finding someone to lead the case after Willis was disqualified over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she'd chosen to lead it. While it's unlikely that any action against Trump could proceed while he's the sitting president, there are 14 other people still facing charges in the case, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. ▶ Read more about the election interference case in Georgia U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on CNBC on Friday that the White House plans to post details of the deal online Friday. Antifa-Ost — a German network suspected in attacks on people it perceived as fascists — was among four European left-wing groups designated as terrorist organizations by the Trump administration Thursday. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Josef Hinterseher said at a regular news conference in Berlin that his ministry has “taken note” of the designation. Interior Ministry spokesperson Sarah Frühauf said “we don't evaluate the decisions and assessments of other states, so I also have no assessment of whether we consider this proportionate or disproportionate.” Trump does not have any pubic events on his schedule for today, but this evening he will travel to Mar-a-Lago. They are an Italian anarchist front that sent explosive packages to the then-president of the European Commission in 2003, two Greek networks believed to have planted bombs outside riot police and labor department buildings in Athens, and an anti-fascist group whose members were prosecuted by German authorities for a hammer attack against neo-Nazis in Dresden. Europe has a long history of left-wing political violence, while in the United States political violence has been more likely to come from the right in recent decades, according to multiple studies, including by the Justice Department. However, there's been an uptick in American political attacks across ideologies in recent years, culminating in the September fatal shooting of Kirk by a gunman who prosecutors contend was driven by hostility toward Kirk's stance against transgenderism and other positions. The frameworks are about increasing the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, according to a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity as a condition for briefing reporters on a call about the agreements. The White House also released statements on the frameworks, which have yet to be finalized and are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. President Javier Milei of Argentina hailed his country's first bilateral trade framework with the U.S. in nearly a decade as “tremendous news.” “As you can see, we are strongly committed to making Argentina great again,” he said. In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year after Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that the German media underestimated Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.” Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.” Trump and Epstein were friends for years but at some point had a falling out, even before underage girls started to come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse. One of those writers was Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump. In a 2019 email to Wolff, Epstein mentioned that one of his best-known accusers, Virginia Giuffre, had worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. “She was the one who accused Prince Andrew,” Epstein wrote. Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, had said that Epstein's longtime companion Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from Mar-a-Lago to give sexualized massages to Epstein. And Trump had long claimed that he banned Epstein from coming to Mar-a-Lago. Epstein said in an email to Wolff that Trump hadn't asked him to resign from the club, because he hadn't been a member. By the time Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Energy Secretary Chris Wright, National Nuclear Security Administration leader Brandon M. Williams and officials from the US National Laboratories are planning to inform the White House that they do not think blowing up weapons for nuclear warhead testing, as Trump suggested last month, is tenable, two sources familiar with the matter said. A White House official reiterated on Thursday that “because of other countries' testing programs, President Trump has instructed the Department of War and Department of Energy to test our nuclear weapons on an equal basis.” CNN has reached out to the Department of Energy. Trump's recent suggestion the US could resume nuclear testing comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted in October that Moscow had successfully tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo. “The reason I'm saying — testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test,” Trump told “60 Minutes” recently. Other countries are testing,” he said, adding: “I don't wanna be the only country that doesn't test.” At the upcoming White House meeting, NNSA and DOE officials will be prepared to tell the administration that “there's not going to be any testing” involving exploding nuclear materials and will seek to steer the White House into a workable plan that doesn't involve blowing anything up, one source said. “NNSA does not comment on ongoing or potential private meetings with the White House, especially regarding matters of nuclear security,” NNSA spokesperson Mariza Smajlaj told CNN in a statement. Wright, Trump's energy secretary, told Fox News earlier this month that US nuclear tests are “system tests” and “not nuclear explosions.” A senior White House official, when pressed this week on what exactly the president meant by his initial comments, told CNN that Trump was being “purposefully vague” in his calls to resume nuclear testing. Another administration official argued that they viewed the president's comments as wanting to do more testing on nuclear-capable missiles, rather than detonating nuclear bombs. So far, Trump's comments haven't changed agency policy: No plans are underway for exploding nuclear weapons for testing purposes. One source told CNN that no one in the administration has explained to those in the agency what exactly Trump meant by his comments. NNSA officials recently prepared a memo for Wright and Williams outlining all the things the agency does to make sure its weapons are up to speed, including supercomputer bomb simulations and test flights of non-explosive warheads, the sources told CNN. That memo also lays out what the timeline would be if the administration directed NNSA to go back to nuclear testing like Trump had suggested. One source said it would take 36 months of underground testing at a minimum to obtain scientifically useful data, but that timeline could get much longer if the federal government were sued by environmental or other groups to delay or stop the testing. If the US returned to nuclear testing, it would be done in Nevada – at the only underground site designed to explode nuclear weapons. That space sits on federal land in a vast desert, but the state government would also need to sign off on the testing – another thorny issue. “There's a big resistance from states about dealing with nuclear materials like we used to,” the source said. Testing has had devastating health impacts on nearby downwind communities, from radiation exposure to illnesses like cancer. There is no need for weapons testing, as the US still has a lot of “really good data” from Cold War-era nuclear testing, one of the sources said. There are concerns that if the US resumed testing, China could also use it as an excuse to perform nuclear tests — something it says it is not currently doing — raising the geopolitical temperature across the globe. Neither Beijing nor Moscow have tested a nuclear warhead in many decades, according to experts. In response to questions about whether the Trump administration has more intelligence on Russia and China's nuclear activities than what is publicly known, a person who worked in the West Wing during Trump's first term, including on national security issues, told CNN: “It would be hard for either country to blow up nuclear warheads underground and keep that quiet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE — Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, speaks during a news conference to announce charges against Ghislaine Maxwell for her alleged role in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein, July 2, 2020, in New York. Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee offer a new glimpse into what Jeffery Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade. They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. The emails don't implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. Democratic members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure asked federal officials for an explanation of the decision to cut up to 10% of flights at 40 major airports during the shutdown, along with details on staffing levels and how airports were chosen. “It appears that the administration made this decision without adequate coordination with key aviation stakeholders,” said Friday's letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, . The group requested a briefing and written response by Nov. 20. Requests for comment were sent to the department and FAA. The president is planning to attend the World Economic Forum's meeting in Switzerland in January, according to a senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans that were not yet publicly announced. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is working with state and local law enforcement agencies to carry out welfare checks on roughly 450,000 migrant children. The administration launched a similar effort earlier  this year, but this one includes state and local law enforcement agencies authorized to work with ICE. Migrant children traveling alone initially stay in government shelters before being released to sponsors. Migrant advocates are suspicious that the Trump administration's efforts could end up being a way to deport sponsors or children. Boonville is a small, mostly white town set in an area teeming with cattle and row crops. The incumbent is Democrat Emanuel Cleaver, who preached about racial justice as a Methodist minister and has worked for decades for federally funded projects in 18th and Vine. Boonville's decades-long project is a trail favored by cycling enthusiasts. A union representing federal prison workers is suing the Bureau of Prisons after the agency said it was canceling its collective bargaining agreement. Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III announced the termination for the collective bargaining agreement Sept. 25, citing President Trump's executive order in March that exempts certain federal agencies from collective bargaining or recognizing employee labor unions. Marshall said the union had become “an obstacle to progress instead of a partner in it.” The union, in its lawsuit, contends the Bureau of Prisons failed to provide “any reasoned explanation” for its decision, as required under federal law. Steve Sadow said he's confident that “fair and impartial review” will lead to a dismissal of the case against Trump. The president kicked off his Friday with posts on social media complaining about Democratic lawmakers focusing on thousands of documents from Epstein's estate released this week by the House Oversight Committee. Trump called it a “hoax” and a distraction from Democrats' policies and the “EMBARASSMENT” of the government shutdown and decried “Weak Republicans” who “have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish.” Trump seemed to be referring to the House Republican who are joining Democrats in a push to release files related to the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein. Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.” The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia was tasked with finding someone to lead the case after Willis was disqualified over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she'd chosen to lead it. While it's unlikely that any action against Trump could proceed while he's the sitting president, there are 14 other people still facing charges in the case, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. ▶ Read more about the election interference case in Georgia U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on CNBC on Friday that the White House plans to post details of the deal online Friday. Greer said the agreement will see Switzerland move manufacturing of some pharmaceuticals, gold smelting and railway equipment to the United States. Antifa-Ost — a German network suspected in attacks on people it perceived as fascists — was among four European left-wing groups designated as terrorist organizations by the Trump administration Thursday. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Josef Hinterseher said at a regular news conference in Berlin that his ministry has “taken note” of the designation. Interior Ministry spokesperson Sarah Frühauf said “we don't evaluate the decisions and assessments of other states, so I also have no assessment of whether we consider this proportionate or disproportionate.” Trump does not have any pubic events on his schedule for today, but this evening he will travel to Mar-a-Lago. They are an Italian anarchist front that sent explosive packages to the then-president of the European Commission in 2003, two Greek networks believed to have planted bombs outside riot police and labor department buildings in Athens, and an anti-fascist group whose members were prosecuted by German authorities for a hammer attack against neo-Nazis in Dresden. Europe has a long history of left-wing political violence, while in the United States political violence has been more likely to come from the right in recent decades, according to multiple studies, including by the Justice Department. However, there's been an uptick in American political attacks across ideologies in recent years, culminating in the September fatal shooting of Kirk by a gunman who prosecutors contend was driven by hostility toward Kirk's stance against transgenderism and other positions. The frameworks are about increasing the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, according to a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity as a condition for briefing reporters on a call about the agreements. The White House also released statements on the frameworks, which have yet to be finalized and are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. President Javier Milei of Argentina hailed his country's first bilateral trade framework with the U.S. in nearly a decade as “tremendous news.” “As you can see, we are strongly committed to making Argentina great again,” he said. In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year after Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that the German media underestimated Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.” Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.” Trump and Epstein were friends for years but at some point had a falling out, even before underage girls started to come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse. One of those writers was Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump. In a 2019 email to Wolff, Epstein mentioned that one of his best-known accusers, Virginia Giuffre, had worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. “She was the one who accused Prince Andrew,” Epstein wrote. Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, had said that Epstein's longtime companion Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from Mar-a-Lago to give sexualized massages to Epstein. And Trump had long claimed that he banned Epstein from coming to Mar-a-Lago. Epstein said in an email to Wolff that Trump hadn't asked him to resign from the club, because he hadn't been a member. By the time Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade. Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Epstein files latest: President Donald Trump said he will ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's ties to some high-profile figures, including some of his perceived political opponents, as he blasted the release earlier this week of emails from the late Epstein that mention him. • Vote next week: House GOP leaders are bracing for a significant number of Republicans to break from Trump and support the bipartisan bill calling for the Justice Department to release the Epstein case files. Earlier today, Trump slammed “weak Republicans” for siding with Democrats on the release. • DC's gradual reopening: With the longest-ever government shutdown over, federal employees are expected to start receiving their back pay, and SNAP food aid is set to be restored by Monday. Questions also still remain about when flight cancellations will end. It's been a busy Friday at the White House and on Capitol Hill. We are closely following the latest developments as lawmakers are set to vote on releasing the full Jeffrey Epstein case files next week, and President Donald Trump looks to deflect from the effort. But here are some other top headlines from around the administration you might have missed. CNN's Ella Nilsen, René Marsh, Alayna Treene, Alicia Wallace, Elisabeth Buchwald and Andy Rose contributed reporting to this post. JPMorgan Chase ended its relationship with Jeffrey Epstein “years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges,” spokesperson Patricia Wexler said in a statement today, after President Donald Trump said he was asking the Justice Department to probe the bank's ties to the disgraced financier. JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein's survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein's sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement. “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,” Wexler said. Earlier: Trump named several high-profile figures in his announcement about the DOJ probe today, including Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, “and many other people and institutions.” CNN's Adam Cancryn and Donald Judd contributed to this report. Food stamp recipients in Maryland will receive their full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits beginning on Tuesday, the state Department of Human Services announced today. After saying it did not have the money to provide November's food stamp benefits, the US Department of Agriculture last week authorized states to make partial payments after a federal court ordered it to do so. Wes Moore announced that he would direct $62 million in state funds to support SNAP recipients, as well as $10 million in emergency food assistance. As of November 13, the state issued nearly $47 million in benefits to nearly 218,000 households to ensure they received at least half of their usual allotments. President Donald Trump said Friday he will ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's ties to many other high-profile figures, including some of his perceived political opponents, again blasting Democrats following the release earlier this week of emails from the late Epstein that mention him. “Now that the Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures, I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. CNN is reaching out to the Department of Justice and JP Morgan, as well as the people Trump named, about his comments. President Donald Trump lashed out at congressional Democrats — and some “weak Republicans” — Friday over the push to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, criticizing those Republicans as “soft and foolish” for backing the effort. “The Democrats are doing everything in their withering power to push the Epstein Hoax again, despite the DOJ releasing 50,000 pages of documents, in order to deflect from all of their bad policies and losses, especially the SHUTDOWN EMBARRASSMENT, where their party is in total disarray, and has no idea what to do,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,” Trump added. CNN has reported that House GOP leaders are bracing for a significant number of Republicans to support the bipartisan bill led by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna that would compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files. The president has yet to respond on camera to this week's House Oversight Committee release of Epstein emails that mentioned Trump, not stopping to answer reporters' questions on Thursday during an event in the East Room. CNN's Annie Grayer, Ellis Kim, Alison Main, Manu Raju, Kristen Holmes and Sarah Ferris contributed reporting to this post. The sprawling 2023 racketeering indictment case against President Donald Trump and several allies for their efforts to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat in Georgia will continue and is now in the hands of a new prosecutor. The case was assigned in September to Peter Skandalakis, director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, a bipartisan collaboration of six district attorneys and three solicitors general from across the state. Skandalakis previously said he could also take the case himself if he could not find another prosecutor willing to take it on. Remember: Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had launched the case, but was removed after a legal fight over her authority. Here's when they are opening, according to the Smithsonian. The Smithsonian previously said most museums, except for the museums of American History and Air and Space, would reopen Monday. In addition, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, which is not part of the Smithsonian Institution, will partially open today and fully open tomorrow. Now, the GOP is under mounting pressure to figure out its own plan. And it's causing deep anxiety among some in the party, particularly in battleground seats, who worry Republicans will end up doing nothing to prevent those price hikes and enter a critical midterm year with the issue of health care haunting them once again. GOP leaders in the House have begun work on their own package, which is unlikely to extend those subsidies and instead will seek other ways to reduce costs, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions. But Republicans are not committing to doing anything on health care by December 31, when those subsidies expire and premiums are set to spike. The move is a step closer to normalcy for flyers after FAA-mandated cuts led to thousands of flight delays and cancellations at major airports across the country. More than 600 US flights have been canceled as of early today and over 500 are delayed, according to FlightAware data. This is down from the nearly 1,000 flights canceled yesterday. The past few weeks have been a wild ride for air travelers, who have seen flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said this week that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up. Still, we know this year, the thought of traveling may be even more stress inducing than usual given the recent disruptions. Do you have a plan to get through possibly chaotic travel days? More than a million federal employees went unpaid during the longest government shutdown in US history, while nearly 42 million Americans were left in limbo when the Department of Agriculture announced it could not distribute food stamps for November. Here's what we know about the post-shutdown timeline for various paychecks and benefits:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Friday he will ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's ties to many other high-profile figures, in an extraordinary step that comes just days after Democrats released emails from the late Epstein that mention him. Trump announced the directive in a Truth Social post that accused Democrats of trying to revive attention to his past ties with Epstein, contending they are “using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.” And it serves as the latest example of Trump's belief that he can defuse the issue through sheer force of will, despite deepening fears among allies that his actions are only further amplifying it while damaging his own credibility. Just release them!” conservative podcast host Megyn Kelly said of the Epstein files during her show on Wednesday. Trump earlier this week tried and failed to convince Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files, with the White House even holding a Situation Room meeting with one key GOP lawmaker who had signed on ahead of it receiving its decisive 218th signature. Officials during that meeting argued that the administration was not hiding anything, according to a senior White House official, including showing GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert unreleased documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee but they could not change her mind. In recent days, at least one ally on Capitol Hill directly told Trump that he was getting bad advice on his approach to the Epstein case by continuing to delay and downplay it, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. “These people have no idea what advice the president is getting,” another senior White House official said. Multiple other sources told CNN that Trump himself has dictated the administration's response to Epstein-related developments, specifically opposing any actions that risk pushing the storyline forward. “Trump doesn't want his people to get ahead of it. Everybody has been instructed to wait until information comes out and then respond that it is a hoax or doesn't prove anything,” one of the sources said. The vote is expected to attract significant support from rank-and-file GOP lawmakers. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predate his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. But on Friday, Trump again vented his frustration over the state of affairs in a series of Truth Social posts, blasting Republicans backing the Epstein files release as “soft and foolish” and repeatedly branding the issue a “Hoax.” Among his most frequent communications were with former Obama White House chief counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who represented Epstein as his attorney, and Summers, the former Clinton Treasury secretary and Obama National Economic Council director. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there's no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein's wrongdoing.) The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler said the bank “ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.” JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein's survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein's sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement. “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,” Wexler said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The government reopened after 43 days, following the House's passage, mostly along party lines, with six Democrats voting in favor and two Republicans voting against, of a legislative package that extended funding until the end of January and included three appropriations bills. However, with the new January deadline, appropriators are up against the clock, as both chambers must now agree on the nine remaining bills so they can be sent to President Donald Trump's desk before funding runs out once again. The House, in particular, is backlogged after being out of session for 54 days, already eyeing a stock trading bill and legislation to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. “There's a lot of bipartisan things in them, but we need to sit down and go forward with the others,” Cole told reporters outside the Rules Committee hearing room on Tuesday night. “I still think that the biggest problem here all along has been Democratic leadership's decision to link this to Medicaid, which there's no way the Republicans are going to undo what they did in the big, beautiful bill.” “Our numbers are a lot closer together than most people seem to realize,” Cole said Tuesday. “I'm confident that under Speaker Johnson alongside House Leadership, and Chairman Cole, we will continue to restore regular order and pass the remaining appropriations bills,” Simpson said in a statement. However, having a December CR was unlikely to garner any support from fiscal hawks such as those in the Freedom Caucus, whose considerable numbers could easily sink any bill, thanks to Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) razor-thin majority. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins (R-ME) also would not hear of a December CR, instead favoring something that went into the new year. “It is unfortunate Senate Republicans prematurely released partial text of the minibus without getting agreement from all corners,” DeLauro said. She also claimed that the 54 days during which the House was out on recess could have been used for appropriators to work on bills. “Because we've come to that, there really is a lack of trust. Under the Jan. 31 CR, all programs except those for veterans, food aid, farmer assistance, and legislative branch operations will remain funded at the Biden-era spending levels set by Congress in March 2024. The remaining nine bills are expected to be even more complicated to pass, including the labor and health and human services appropriations bill, which is one of the most contentious and expensive. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) acknowledged that there were more choppy waters ahead earlier this month after Trump signed the deal to end the shutdown. “But the real negotiation is going to be: Can we get an agreement on how to properly fund the government with individual appropriations bills, packages of appropriations bills?” “But you guys have been here long enough — we'll probably be having this conversation Jan. 28.” Others are bullish that if they can move on to another minibus, they can avoid another shutdown come winter. Other hiccups, such as the Trump administration's recessions requests and a last-minute Senate FBI provision tucked into the spending deal, are a cause for concern for Democratic appropriators that they will not be able to achieve a bipartisan negotiation. “President Trump and Russ Vought's illegal stealing of funds from American communities has made it difficult to reach any appropriations agreement,” DeLauro said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “Those challenges are compounded by Senate Republicans' decision to secretly insert language into the Legislative Branch bill that would aid January 6th insurrectionists.” “Democrats are ready to negotiate spending bills on a bipartisan basis that lower costs for families and protect Congress's constitutional power of the purse,” she added.

(AP Photo/Javier Arciga) WASHINGTON (AP) — Unapproved peptide drugs have become a trendy new hack among wellness influencers, fitness coaches and celebrities, pitched as a way to build muscle, shed pounds and look younger. But many of the products have never been extensively studied in humans, raising concerns that they could cause allergic reactions, metabolic problems and other dangerous side effects. Within the human body, peptides are short chains of amino acids that perform essential functions. Insulin, for example, controls blood sugar levels and helps break down foods into energy. Likewise the popular weight loss drugs, GLP-1s — short for glucagon-like peptides — are based on a hormone found in the intestines that helps regulate blood sugar. The Food and Drug Administration has approved both substances as drugs. But there are many more peptides that have never been approved by regulators as safe and effective, though some have shown interesting study results in rodents and other animals. This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Some doctors have prescribed them for decades off-label, or for unapproved uses, in patients with gastric ulcers, nervous system disorders and other conditions. In recent years, peptides have become a focus for wellness gurus and other public figures with large online followings. That's driven interest in using obscure peptides for unsubstantiated uses like healing injuries, improving complexion and even extending life. Peptides in this group include an alphabet soup of injectable compounds, including BPC-157, thymosin alpha, GHK-Copper and many more. “These influencers are often advocating taking a stack of peptides each month, so it could be two, three, four different peptides,” said Dr. Eric Topol of Scripps Research Translational Institute. Interest in the trend is being amplified by celebrities. Joe Rogan has repeatedly talked about using BPC-157 to recover from injuries. Jennifer Aniston has talked about using weekly peptide injections to improve her skin and currently serves as a paid spokesperson for a company selling peptide-enriched supplements. “If any celebrity is using a peptide, and they're saying this is what worked for me, then of course it's going to be more mainstream and people are going to be looking into it,” said Kay Robins, a clinical nurse and operator of Pure Alchemy Wellness, a clinic outside of San Diego that sells peptide infusions and injections. Robins says she no longer offers BPC-157 and other peptides that have been targeted by the FDA. Most of the unproven peptides promoted online are technically being sold illegally. The agency considers many peptides to be biologics, the most complicated and potentially high-risk type of drugs, requiring extra precautions in their manufacture and storage. In recent years, the agency has added more than two dozen peptides to a list of substances that should not be produced by pharmacies due to safety risks. While dietary supplements are less tightly regulated than drugs, the FDA still requires them to only contain ingredients found on a list of approved substances. Experts generally agree that consuming peptides by mouth likely has little or no effect, since they will dissolve in the gut. Most of the injectable peptides sold in the U.S. are produced by compounding pharmacies, which custom-mix medications that aren't available from drug manufacturers. In recent years, compounding pharmacies have jumped into the market for blockbuster GLP-1 drugs. But many have continued making custom versions of the drugs — adding extra ingredients like vitamin B, which they say benefits patients. “There had never been the monetary incentive to push the envelope of what is legally permissible with compounding before,” said Nathaniel Lacktman, a lawyer specializing in FDA-related issues. Some of the industry's new production capacity has gone into producing unapproved peptides, such as BPC-157. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is among those who have touted the potential benefits of peptides. He has repeatedly vowed to end “FDA's war” on peptides, which have become popular among many followers of his Make America Healthy Again movement.

Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide. Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Janta Power's 3D solar towers capture more sunlight throughout the day while using just a third of the land. Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.

Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments. Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide. The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15. That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy. Built to endure 170 mph winds, Janta's modular towers are already powering airports in Munich, Dallas–Fort Worth, and across Aena's global network. For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms. For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As sports gambling accusations spread through Major League Baseball, the NBA and college basketball, the NCAA has one week to decide whether to adopt a proposed rule change that would allow college athletes and staff to bet on professional sports. The presumption from many in college athletics can be best summed up by one coach, who asked not to be named – “There's no way that happens, right?” And yet, to rescind the proposal that would OK betting on professional sports, two-thirds of the Division I member schools must submit paperwork by 5 p.m. If the needed 241 (out of 361) D1 schools do not respond, the change will go into effect on November 22. For years, college athletes, coaches and staff members were prohibited from betting on any sport in which the NCAA crowns a champion. Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not. But as sports betting becomes legal in more and more states and readily available to regular college students, the NCAA argued, that although it was not encouraging athletes to bet, prohibiting them from gambling on pro sports no longer made sense. Betting on college sports will remain a no-no. “This change recognizes the realities of today's sports environment without compromising our commitment to protecting the integrity of college competition or the well-being of student-athletes,'' Roberta Page, director of athletics at Slippery Rock and chair of the Division II Management Council, said in an NCAA statement. The change was initially meant to go into effect on November 1. A week earlier, the feds unsealed an indictment alleging two separate sports gambling schemes - one involving rigged poker games, the other point shaving - that included members of three New York crime families, two NBA players and an NBA head coach. “On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association's commitment to maintaining strong standards that keep college participants separated from sports wagering at every level,'' Sankey wrote in a letter obtained by ESPN. Three days later, the NCAA announced it was delaying its decision, but not because of public outrage. It was because less than 75 percent of the cabinet member votes were in favor of the change, prompting an automatic 30-day rescission process. In the three weeks since the NCAA implemented its rescission period, two MLB pitchers have been indicted for rigging games and six college basketball players from three separate schools have been permanently banned from NCAA competition for game fixing. On Thursday, the New Jersey Attorney General's office announced 14 people, including student athletes, were charged for running an illegal online sports betting scheme in conjunction with members of the Lucchese crime family.</p>

King Charles is reportedly weary and withdrawn as he marks his 77th birthday, burdened by the shadow of his disgraced brother's ongoing scandals. Royal experts told Fox News Digital that the monarch will spend his birthday focused on duty — a hallmark of his reign. Yet behind palace walls, they say Charles remains deeply troubled by how ex-Prince Andrew's controversies continue to cast a long, painful cloud over both his family and the monarchy he leads. Fox News Digital reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment. "During Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph Parade, King Charles was particularly emotional, shedding a tear while standing in silence," British royals expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital. He is also known to be wanting to double down on duty, rather than anything verging on a shallow or frivolous celebration." Ex-Prince Andrew vehemently denies any wrongdoing and maintains his innocence. "While Andrew, of course, will always remain his brother, now that he's a private citizen, the king is likely to further publicly distance himself," Fordwich shared. "We won't be seeing Andrew at any birthday festivities. He's actually made it worse for himself due to his pride and pervasively privileged attitude, thinking he's still entitled." Fordwich claimed that the former Duke of York, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, is "refusing to negotiate residence terms." A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace previously told Fox News Digital they don't answer for Andrew as he's not a working royal. King Charles is reportedly "fed up" with his disgraced younger brother. "Charles is purportedly ‘fed up' with Andrew and, to the greatest extent possible, will be barring Andrew from any royal events," Fordwich added. Prince Andrew was officially stripped of his royal titles and honors by King Charles III on Oct. 30, 2025. He will no longer be styled "Prince Andrew" or "His Royal Highness," and will instead be known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Ongoing pressure has loomed over the palace to punish the 65-year-old over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed attention on sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. "Nobody's Girl - A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice" by Virginia Roberts Giuffre is seen in London on Oct. 21, 2025. Charles stripped Andrew of his princely title, one that he'd had since birth. Late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was connected with several prominent people, including politicians, actors and academics. Emails included in the files referenced Andrew in connection with Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her on three separate occasions in 2001 when she was a teenager after Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked her. Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were both indicted on federal sex trafficking charges stemming from Epstein's years of abuse of underage girls. However, several emails included in the documents and obtained by The Telegraph and Sky News appeared to cast doubt on Andrew's denials, including statements that he made during a 2019 interview on BBC's "Newsnight." Prince Andrew allegedly appears in this photograph with his arm around the waist of then-17-year-old Virginia Giuffre. In one email that Epstein sent to a journalist, he seemed to contradict a suggestion made by Andrew during the interview that a now-infamous photo showing the former prince with an underage Giuffre was fake. This undated photo shows Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein at Ascot in the U.K. (Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images) In the newly released correspondence, which was sent in July 2011, Epstein appeared to confirm the image's authenticity and claimed "many" of his employees also took photos with Andrew. The birthday cake at a party for King Charles III, at the British High Commissioner's residence during a two-day visit by the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence to Singapore to mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between the U.K. and Singapore. "King Charles may be choking on his birthday cake as more allegations over Andrew are revealed," royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital. "There is little more the king can do to further punish his erstwhile brother," he said. Ex-Prince Andrew was evicted from Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion located on the grounds of Windsor Castle. But the king wonders how he can preserve the monarchy from this latest twist, knowing that further recriminations may continue. Brotherly love between them is at an all-time low. Prince William is said to be demanding that all these revelations mean not showing any leniency towards Andrew." Ex-Prince Andrew and Prince William at Katharine, Duchess of Kent's requiem mass service at Westminster Cathedral on Sept. 16, 2025, in London. In a 2015 federal lawsuit that Giuffre filed against Maxwell, she claimed that she met and was recruited by the socialite in the summer of 2000 when she was 16 and working as a spa attendant at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. In her book "Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice," Giuffre — who died by suicide at the age of 41 earlier this year — provided further details about meeting Maxwell and how events unfolded afterward. Virginia Robert Giuffre leaves federal court in New York on Aug. 27, 2019. During his interview with the BBC, which was widely considered disastrous for the former prince, Andrew addressed the infamous image, saying, "I have absolutely no memory of that photograph ever being taken." Virginia Roberts holds a photo of herself at age 16, when she says Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein began abusing her sexually. "Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored, but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken," Andrew continued. Ex-Prince Andrew was known as Queen Elizabeth II's favorite son. In another 2011 email obtained by The Telegraph from the newly released files, Andrew appeared to express distress over the mounting public and media scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein and Giuffre's allegations. Ex-Prince Andrew reportedly met Jeffrey Epstein in the late 1990s, around 1999, through Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite and longtime associate of Epstein. According to the outlet, a reporter from the Mail on Sunday emailed Epstein on March 4, 2011, to ask for comment on the relationship that he, Maxwell and Andrew had with Giuffre. "I can't take any more of this."

"Given the current fervor regarding Andrew, birthday celebrations for the king are likely to be subdued with a greater emphasis on service," said Fordwich. Prince William, Prince of Wales and his father, King Charles III, attend a reception for veterans who served in World War II in the Pacific and their families at Windsor Castle on Nov. 11, 2025. "Prince William and Princess Catherine are stepping up, with her better health and his determination to move past his uncle," she said. King Charles continues to be supported by Prince William, heir to the British throne, and his wife Princess Catherine, also known as Kate Middleton by royal followers. They are intimately involved in succession planning, international engagements and global initiatives. British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that for Charles, the show must go on. King Charles III and Queen Camilla meet members of the public in Rome on Oct. 23, 2025. "The king's decision to keep his birthday celebrations low-key is a reflection of his philosophy that the monarchy should serve, rather than celebrate itself," she explained. "Instead of hosting a lavish reception, he will be engaging in official duties. According to British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard, King Charles will have a low-key birthday celebration with his wife, Queen Camilla. "The relationship between Charles and Andrew is strained," said Chard. "The king's inner circle has also shrunk, with some now pushing for an even stronger stance against Andrew as he's still making headlines for all the wrong reasons." "Andrew's downfall was brought on by his hubris. Despite these challenges, the king remains committed to his role." Fox News Digital's Ashley Hume contributed to this report.

Democratic National Committee employees were mercilessly mocked this week after news came out that staffers were very unhappy with a recent directive from DNC Chairman Ken Martin  end to remote work for employees who will now be required to show up to the office five days a week. Leadership of the union representing DNC employees put out a statement following news of the new directive, describing it as "callous." "It was shocking to see the DNC chair disregard staff's valid concerns on today's team call," they wrote. staff worked extremely hard to support historic wins for Democrats up and down the ballot last Tuesday, and this change feels especially callous considering the current economic conditions created by the Trump administration." Martin reportedly told employees that if they don't like the new policy, they should go find a job elsewhere. And Martin wasn't the only Democrat who had some harsh and pointed words for the Democratic Party staffers. Neera Tanden, former President Joe Biden's domestic policy advisor, had a similar message for DNC staffers, suggesting there were many eager folks waiting in line who would likely be more than willing to go into the office. Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin speaking from the DNC's home studio. "If you think democracy is on the line – working in the office is not a big ask," Tanden wrote in a post on X. "And there are plenty of other people willing to step up. "When you accept a job on a campaign, or with an org like the DNC, DCCC, etc, your single purpose is to win the election. It is a demanding job that requires long hours & sacrifices," the group wrote on X. "The other part of this is that I suspect [work from home] staff are probably losing opportunities for themselves by not being in the office. Campaigns require a lot of personal sacrifice, but the people who are good at their job and work to make themselves noticed in the office usually tend to go on to do big things!" One Florida-based Democratic strategist, Steve Schale, who led Barack Obama's statewide efforts in Florida in 2008 and returned to help his campaign in 2012, said the DNC should implement a "requirement" to ensure those who want to work at the DNC really have what it takes. "There should be a requirement that to work at the DNC that you've done at least two cycles on an actual battleground campaign, where terms like flex hours & hybrid work don't exist," Schale wrote on X. A man is seen walking in front of the Democratic National Committee's headquarters located in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Meanwhile, Republicans did not spare the opportunity to slam Democratic Party staffers as well. GOP strategist, Matt Gorman, quipped that the image of DNC staffers logging onto a Zoom call in their pajamas amid all the chaos of Biden's reelection "is hilarious." "The best part is that they still get two full months before they actually have to get out of bed 5 days week," GOP National Press Secretary Kiersten Pels said. Martin reportedly told his employees that the work-from-home policy the DNC implemented during COVID was never meant to be permanent, describing it as a "Band-Aid" that has long needed to be ripped off. He did say that remote work would still be allowed on a case-by-case basis, however. Neera Tanden, one of former President Joe Biden's top advisors in the White House, was among those Democrats who slammed DNC staffers for being upset of having to go back into the office full-time, as opposed to remote work. The group previously ratified a collective bargaining agreement with the DNC over the summer that "reaffirms its commitment to making hybrid work available," but also includes language that allows for a full return to in-person working as long as there is a 60-day notice period, according to the New York Times. Earlier this year, the Congressional Progressive Staff Association sent a letter to top House and Senate leaders proposing a rotating 32-hour work week for congressional staffers, arguing it would be a more "sustainable approach to work on a national level." "Why not be bold and ask for a 0-hour workweek?" "I wonder how blue-collar Americans would feel about white-collar workers demanding a 32-hour workweek."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the commencement of Operation Southern Spear on Thursday evening, an operation he said is aimed at protecting the Western Hemisphere from “narcoterrorists.” Hegseth made the operation announcement in a post on X, noting that President Donald Trump ordered the action. The Western Hemisphere is America's neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth said. The Trump administration ordered a 20th strike on a suspected drug-smuggling boat Tuesday, killing four people in the Caribbean. Venezuela has begun organizing its defense forces, with Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López announcing this week that the “entire country's military arsenal” is “on full operational readiness.” The Pentagon referred the Washington Examiner to Hegseth's X post in response to requests for comment on further information about Operation Southern Spear. “This is principally a maritime effort, and our team will leverage maritime patrols, aerial surveillance, precision interdictions, and intelligence sharing to counter illicit traffic, uphold the rule of law, and ultimately better protect vulnerable communities here at home,” Lt. Gen. Calvert Worth, designated JTF commander, said in the October release. In late January, the Navy announced an “Operation Southern Spear” in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. The operation's deployment was “to help determine combinations of unmanned vehicles and manned forces to provide coordinated maritime domain awareness and conduct counternarcotics operations,” according to a January press release. “Southern Spear will operationalize a heterogeneous mix of Robotic and Autonomous Systems (RAS) to support the detection and monitoring of illicit trafficking while learning lessons for other theaters,” Commander Foster Edwards, hybrid director of the U.S. 4th Fleet, said in a January statement.</p>
