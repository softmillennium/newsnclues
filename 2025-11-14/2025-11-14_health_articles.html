                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center have developed a way to diagnose Lyme disease earlier and more accurately than traditional testing methods. If left untreated, Lyme disease can cause joint, heart and nervous system complications. Many patients develop skin lesions mimicking other illnesses, complicating the clinical diagnosis. Further complicating diagnosis, antibody tests often show false negatives during the first few weeks of infection. To address these diagnostic complications, researchers at New Hampshire's Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center have developed a new way to detect Borrelia burgdorferi, allowing for faster and more accurate diagnosis. Doctors initially believed the patient had morphea, a condition that causes hard, thickened patches of skin. However, immunosuppressant medication used to treat morphea did not improve the patient's symptoms. In this patient's case, antibody testing only showed evidence of prior Lyme infection, but she responded positively to the antibiotic doxycycline, a medication commonly used to treat Lyme disease. The team, including Joel A. Lefferts, Ph.D., created three droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) tests-which are used to gather precise, highly sensitive measurements-to identify different types of Borrelia bacteria: one that detects all Borrelia species, one that targets those responsible for Lyme disease and one specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, the main cause of Lyme disease in the U.S. When tested on limited number of skin samples from patients with confirmed or suspected Lyme disease, the new assays showed excellent accuracy and could detect as few as five to ten bacterial cells. Ultimately, the test for Borrelia burgdorferi developed by her team had an estimated sensitivity of 90.9% in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples, making it a potential new avenue for testing Lyme disease. Sensitivity is expected to increase when using fresh or frozen tissues, which typically yield DNA with higher quantity and quality. Using the ddPCR assay, we successfully detected B. burgdorferi DNA in this patient's skin biopsy. This finding was further confirmed by DNA sequencing, supporting the diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease." Huang noted that traditional serological tests cannot distinguish between active infection and past exposure. This is another clinical scenario where the ddPCR assay offers a clear advantage by detecting active bacterial presence rather than relying on indirect immune markers," Huang said. Although it took the patient more than four years to get a final diagnosis, the test developed by Huang and her team could save future patients from such extended waits. Early diagnosis is crucial in reducing the risk of long-term complications. With further development of the team's test, prompt treatment will be possible for more patients. This work was led by Guohong (Grace) Huang, Ph.D., in the Laboratory for Clinical Genomics and Advanced Technology (CGAT), Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, and will be presented during a poster session at 9:15am Eastern time on Nov. 14, at the Thomas M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are emerging as a transformative tool in colorectal cancer (CRC) research, offering unparalleled insights into tumor biology, drug resistance, and personalized treatment approaches. These models, created by transplanting fresh human tumor tissue into immunodeficient mice, faithfully replicate the genetic, histological, and molecular features of the original tumors. As such, they serve as invaluable resources in the study of tumor heterogeneity and in the development of precision oncology. Despite advances in therapeutic strategies, the genetic diversity and adaptive nature of CRC significantly hinder long-term treatment efficacy. Traditional preclinical models, like cell lines, often fail to capture the complexity of human tumors, resulting in limited predictive accuracy for clinical outcomes. In contrast, PDX models preserve the tumor microenvironment (TME), maintain clonal diversity, and reflect the biological and pathological traits of patient tumors. By correlating genetic profiles with drug responses, researchers can predict how a patient's cancer might respond to specific treatments. This capability enhances the precision medicine approach, allowing for more personalized and targeted therapies. PDX models also provide insights into drug resistance mechanisms, an area of growing importance as many patients develop resistance to initially effective therapies. Through long-term studies, these models have helped identify molecular pathways that enable cancer cells to evade treatment, guiding the development of next-generation therapies.However, the establishment and maintenance of PDX models present significant challenges. The process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring the selection of high-quality tumor samples, careful engraftment into immunodeficient mice, and meticulous long-term monitoring. Moreover, genetic drift over multiple passages can alter the tumor's original characteristics, posing challenges for longitudinal studies. Despite these limitations, advances in humanized mouse models are helping to overcome these barriers, enhancing the model's relevance for immunotherapy research.The future of CRC research will likely see an increased reliance on PDX models, particularly in co-clinical trials that test potential treatments alongside human patients. By mimicking real-world patient responses, PDX models are driving the development of more effective cancer therapies and helping researchers understand the dynamic nature of tumor evolution. As these models continue to evolve, they hold the promise of transforming how colorectal cancer is understood and treated, offering new hope for improved patient outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This leads to awareness of unconscious habits, thoughts, and drives and has long been a cornerstone of psychotherapy. "So, it's very hard to design a therapy." In a 2025 paper in Perspectives on Psychological Science, Aru and Nick Kabrel, Aru's graduate student at the University of Zurich, wrote that becoming aware of unrecognized psychological and behavioral challenges is the most crucial mechanism in conversation-based psychotherapy. Furthermore, they argue that becoming aware can be best framed as a process that expands one's cognitive map and changes the way one navigates through the mind. This framework also provides a testable theory about the neural correlates behind successful psychotherapy. Kabrel came to this theory through personal experience. He noticed how a therapist's questions could prompt him to search through his memories and beliefs, and the introspection was surprisingly powerful. He wondered what was happening in his brain in those moments and noticed something that sparked his interest. "When I search through memory or search in my mind, it always feels as if I am navigating in some kind of environment," he said. In a 2024 paper, he and Aru showed that patients and therapists used more spatial language-such as "this is unexplored territory" or "I'm going in circles"-during psychotherapy sessions than during everyday conversation. In the new paper, Aru and Kabrel proposed a framework based on how individuals construct their internal worlds in the form of cognitive maps: structured representations of phenomena like objects, concepts, people, and memories, and the relationships among them. Research revealing how the brain represents three-dimensional space helped inspire how this navigation may occur in the brain (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; Hafting, 2005). In the hippocampus, place cells fire when animals are in a specific location, while the entorhinal cortex's grid cells act like a coordinate map. More recent research revealed these cells also encode abstract concepts, such as time, sound, social hierarchies, and word meanings (MacDonald, 2011; Aronov, 2017; Park, 2021; Solomon, 2019; Viganò, 2021). "The brain is highly likely to make use of this mapping system in these other domains, too," Aru said. This idea of mental navigation could be a very general framework to understand thinking and abstract cognition." Framing introspection in this way may help people realize that changing the way they navigate through their thoughts could help them out of a pathological way of thinking. For example, someone suffering from depression might think they are flawed, and any interaction with someone else that ends negatively will be interpreted as their fault because of these perceived flaws. It's analogous to hiking through a forest: The more a path is used, the wider it gets and the more likely it is to be used again. But a therapist helping them see a different interpretation-a different navigational route-may allow them to reframe their thoughts and not see everything as their fault. Kabrel recommends a psychotherapist say something like, "This is the place where we are stuck. And it's a very general problem," he said. "Our goal as a society could be to expand the way people actually think." On a smaller scale, the goal of the paper is to encourage psychological scientists and neuroscientists to design experiments to test this new framework and the possible neural correlates involved. In the meantime, Aru knows that some scientists may be doubtful. How do you know that it's really related to grid cells?'" "For me, this is the fun thing about science.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This approach cuts the number of stent procedures in half, according to cardiologists from Radboud university medical center, writing in The New England Journal of Medicine. Each year, 33,600 people are admitted to the hospital with a heart attack. Yet during the procedure, it often becomes clear that other coronary arteries are also narrowed. Researchers from 41 hospitals, led by Radboudumc, investigated whether it is necessary to treat those narrowed vessels immediately, or if it can be done safely later, under calmer circumstances. Their study, involving 1,146 participants, shows that waiting is safe. Only patients with an acute heart attack were included. Half of the patients received full treatment immediately, while for the other half, additional stenting was done up to six weeks later. Robin Nijveldt, Professor of Cardiovascular Imaging at Radboudumc, explains. We saw no difference between the two groups in terms of death, new heart attacks, or hospital admissions due to heart failure." Robin Nijveldt, Professor, Cardiovascular Imaging, Radboud University Medical Center One striking finding: in the later, calmer phase, cardiologists treated only half as many narrowed arteries as in the acute phase. Later, we can perform an MRI scan to map the heart's overall blood flow. Still, the cardiologists don't advise delaying additional treatment deliberately. 'For patients, it's usually more convenient to have everything done in one procedure', Van Royen explains. 'But sometimes that's not possible - for example, if the patient is in pain and exhausted, or if another person with an acute heart attack arrives and takes priority. Now we know it's safe to stop at that point. There's no need to force things, because faster is not better.' It's also now clear that cardiologists can reassure patients a few weeks later with an MRI scan showing that no further stenting is needed. 'But patients do need to come back for the MRI', Van Royen notes. 'Some choose to skip the follow-up, even though additional treatment might still be wise.' The cardiologists expect that current guidelines - which recommend immediate treatment of all narrowed arteries during the acute phase - will soon be revised. 'These guidelines were based on two major studies that showed a small short-term benefit to immediate treatment, but not in the long term', Nijveldt says. 'Our study provides more clarity: that benefit doesn't actually exist.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A plant-based drink and an animal-based meal triggered similar satiety hormone responses and small appetite reductions after breakfast, yet neither changed how much participants ate at lunch, suggesting that increasing protein at breakfast may support satiety without automatically reducing total energy intake. Study: The effect of consuming different dietary protein sources at breakfast upon self rated satiety, peptide YY, glucagon like peptide-1, and subsequent food intake in young and older adults. In a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, researchers at Newcastle University, UK, investigated the impact of consuming different protein sources at breakfast on adults' subsequent hunger and food consumption, as well as the regulation of associated hormones. Their findings indicate that high-protein breakfasts, both plant-based and animal-based, elicited stronger satiety hormone responses and appetite suppression, which was significant for the plant-based drink and trending for the animal-based meal. Adequate protein intake is vital for health, but environmental and ethical concerns are driving interest in sustainable, plant-based alternatives. The Food and Agriculture Organization promotes alternative proteins as part of its global sustainability goals, leading to growth in plant-based foods and drinks. Protein source can influence digestive, metabolic, and appetite responses, as amino acids stimulate satiety hormones such as peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) while suppressing ghrelin. Studies comparing protein types have yielded inconsistent results; some find that casein or pea proteins are more satiating than soy, while others report stronger effects for whey. Plant- and animal-based meals may also differ in their ability to trigger gut hormone release, with outcomes varying by population and protein form. Liquids typically reduce appetite less than solid foods, though this difference in relation to protein source remains unclear. In the UK, most adults meet their protein recommendations, but older adults may require more due to a reduced appetite and an increased risk of muscle loss. This study aimed to compare the effects of plant-based and animal-based high-protein breakfasts with a low-protein control on appetite, satiety hormones, and energy intake in younger and older adults. Researchers employed a randomized, within-subject, crossover design, in which 18 healthy adults, comprising 12 between 18 and 35 years old and 6 over 65, participated in three breakfast conditions: a plant-based, high-protein drink, an animal-based, high-protein breakfast, and a low-protein, high-carbohydrate breakfast. Each meal was energy-matched, with the high-protein treatments containing 30 g of protein. However, the plant-based drink contained more fiber at 7.8 g than the animal-based meal at 4.5 g. Participants attended the laboratory in a fasted state after consuming a standardized evening meal and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and exercise. Appetite was measured using visual analogue scales at baseline and at regular intervals for four hours after breakfast, while blood samples were collected at specific time points to measure plasma PYY and GLP-1 concentrations. After the final blood draw, participants consumed an ad libitum pasta lunch to assess energy intake. Statistical analyses employed mixed models to evaluate the effects of treatment, time, and age group, while controlling for baseline values. Associations between appetite, hormone levels, and energy intake were examined using repeated measures correlation analysis. Both plant-based and animal-based high-protein breakfasts produced stronger satiety hormone responses than the low-protein, high-carbohydrate meal. GLP-1 levels were significantly higher after both high-protein meals compared with the control, with no difference between the two protein types. Similar patterns were observed for PYY, which increased significantly after the high protein meals compared with the control, again showing no difference between protein sources. However, these differences were modest and mostly below the 15 mm threshold considered necessary to influence eating behavior meaningfully. Energy intake at the ad libitum lunch did not differ between treatments, and no age-related effects were observed. Correlation analyses showed that subjective appetite was positively associated with subsequent energy intake. Unexpectedly, GLP-1 and PYY levels showed weak, positive associations with energy intake; however, this represented only a statistical trend, with p values of 0.074 and 0.078, respectively, and was not significant at the 0.05 level. Within participants, no associations were found between changes in hormone levels, appetite, or energy intake. Overall, both high-protein breakfasts promoted greater satiety hormone responses and appetite suppression than the low-protein meal, but did not affect later food intake. This study found that plant- and animal-based high-protein breakfasts similarly enhanced satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY, and reduced appetite, compared with a high-carbohydrate, low-protein meal, with no difference observed between protein sources or age groups. Although the plant-based drink appeared to produce slightly quicker hormonal responses, a tentative observation the authors suggested might be due to faster gastric emptying of liquids, these effects did not translate into reduced energy intake at lunch. The comparable responses indicate that plant-based proteins can effectively replace animal proteins in supporting satiety without affecting subsequent calorie intake. Moreover, the study was not statistically powered to detect age differences, which increases the risk of overlooking true age-related effects. In conclusion, a plant-based, high-protein drink appears to be a practical and sustainable alternative for increasing protein intake without affecting later eating behavior. However, future studies are needed to assess the long-term acceptability of these dietary interventions and the real-world applications of these findings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Mary Wanjau from Griffith's School of Medicine and Dentistry said if we eliminated alcohol consumption over the first 25 years, we could prevent more than 25 million cases of diseases and injuries and more than 200 thousand deaths, of which the majority would be from cancers. If we act now and eliminate alcohol consumption to zero, we could save the healthcare system $55 billion in the first 25 years. These findings can help policymakers understand the scale of the future alcohol burden which can be prevented." Dr. Mary Wanjau from Griffith's School of Medicine and Dentistry Excessive use of alcohol was one of the leading risks for mortality and disability globally with the evidence suggesting there is no safe level of alcohol-use for overall health. Young adults aged 15-39 years bear most of the acute consequences due to high rates of injuries leading to death and disability. Even minor decreases in alcohol consumption across the population could significantly reduce health burdens for individuals and the healthcare system while also lowering costs for individuals, communities, and governments. Professor Lennert Veerman said the findings support prioritisation of investment in alcohol harm reduction. "Policies and interventions which reduce consumption at the population level are likely to offer favourable impact as they create environments which support and allow for an increase in the number of people who abstain from drinking, a delay in the age when people start drinking, and reductions in alcohol consumption for those who drink," he said. "Stronger alcohol control policies are needed to realise these gains in the reduction of alcohol harm and related healthcare costs."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international study co-led by University of Calgary researchers has found new insulin delivery technology helps control glucose levels during pregnancy for those with Type 1 diabetes, which is crucial to the health of women and their newborns. The technology, known as automated insulin delivery (AID), mimics a healthy pancreas. The system automatically adjusts the amount of insulin given by a pump in real-time, based on current and predicted glucose levels. "For pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes, keeping glucose within a healthy range is very important to the health of the woman and fetus," says an endocrinologist at Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary and Cumming School of Medicine researcher Dr. Lois Donovan, MD, the study co-principal investigator. In a multicenter clinical trial, published in JAMA, researchers evaluated the impact of a hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin therapy treatment regime with standard insulin injections or an insulin pump that was not automated, along with continuous glucose monitoring. Keeping blood glucose in the optimal range for pregnancy is exceptionally challenging when someone has Type 1 diabetes, despite their best efforts and the support of dedicated health care clinics." Dr. Denice Feig, MD, study's other co-principal investigator She is an endocrinologist and clinician scientist at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health, and a professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto. Risks associated with Type 1 diabetes in pregnancy can include increased chances of miscarriage, preeclampsia, which involves dangerous spike in blood pressure, and other significant health concerns. Newborns of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes are more likely to be born excessively large or early and have low blood glucose at birth and are at higher risk of birth defects. "The study found this AID system worked in pregnancy. It resulted in a three hours per day improvement in the time spent in the desired glucose range compared to the standard delivery with insulin injections or regular insulin pumps," says Donovan. "This is very important because we have learned from other larger studies that every 72 minute per day increase, with glucose in the desired range during pregnancy, is associated with reduction in newborn complications." The AID system used in the study is knowns as a Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology. "We've known for a while that AID systems have achieved better glucose control with less diabetes management burden in non-pregnant people with Type 1 diabetes, but its use had not been well studied in pregnancy," Donovan says. These results were found at all 14 sites involved in the trial. "This finding will help inform people who are pregnant or planning pregnancy regarding the benefits of this AID system, which can help them achieve better glucose levels in pregnancy and hopefully better pregnancy outcomes" says Feig.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new sociomedical perspective shows how off-label use of GLP-1 drugs for slimness is redefining what counts as a healthy, responsible body, revealing hidden moral pressures and global inequalities behind the weight loss boom. In a recent perspective in the journal Obesity, researchers discussed recent medical developments that have not only revolutionized the treatment of diabetes and obesity, but whose popularity has also quickly spread among groups who lack clinical indication for obesity or diabetes treatment. This off-label use, the authors argue, is exposing deeper tensions between medical innovation, weight stigma, and the social value attached to thinness, as medication becomes a means of attaining social and aesthetic goals rather than improving health. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have revolutionized the treatment of obesity and diabetes, offering significant weight loss with manageable side effects. However, their popularity has rapidly spread to individuals without obesity or metabolic disorders, who use them off-label to achieve or maintain slimness. This phenomenon, marked by celebrity endorsements, media attention, online sales, and widespread social media discussion, reflects more than a medical trend. It reveals a growing cultural shift in which slimness is equated with moral virtue, self-discipline, and social value, as the authors describe it - a moral economy of the body. The authors argue that this off-label use exposes deeper tensions between medical innovation, body image ideals, and the social meanings attached to thinness, and explicitly ask whether such use should be considered an abuse of medical technology or a rational adaptation to weight-stigmatizing environments. Understanding these behaviors requires moving beyond clinical data to explore the psychological, cultural, and political contexts that shape how people use these drugs. Off-label use represents a form of pharmacological thinness, where medication becomes a means of attaining aesthetic and social goals rather than health improvement. GLP-1 RA drugs were initially developed for individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes, but their reach has extended far beyond this population. With the rise of online promotion and influencer marketing, these drugs are now positioned as tools of lifestyle optimization and bodily perfection. This expansion also highlights the limitations of the body mass index (BMI) in defining obesity, as many individuals with normal or mildly elevated BMIs may perceive themselves as needing intervention. Weight loss, once a clinical outcome, has become a visible marker of personal virtue, performative achievement, and conformity to dominant beauty and health ideals, reflecting broader neoliberal healthism ideals that conflate appearance with moral responsibility. Within this moral economy, losing weight symbolizes effort and commitment, while failing to do so is seen as a moral shortcoming. For users without obesity, these drugs may represent a means of achieving socially approved body shapes and social worth without the burden of traditional self-discipline. They help individuals navigate a culture that equates thinness with attractiveness, competence, and even employability. Research gaps remain across multiple domains regarding the off-label use of GLP-1 RAs. While some individuals may feel liberated by reduced hunger, others may experience distress, alienation, or loss of enjoyment associated with food. For some, these effects are interpreted as signs of drug efficacy or commitment to weight loss, whereas others experience them as discomforting or harmful. Gaps also persist in understanding the impact of these drugs on body image and self-worth. While weight loss may enhance self-esteem for some, it may simultaneously heighten dissatisfaction or lead to further body modification pursuits, such as cosmetic procedures. Further research is required on access and dependency, particularly regarding how users obtain these drugs through medical or informal channels, and how cost, medical oversight, medical gatekeeping, and social privilege shape accessibility. Emotional dependence also warrants investigation, as some users may fear weight regain more intensely than adverse effects, raising concerns about long-term reliance. Social media plays a pivotal role in normalizing GLP-1 RA use, spreading narratives that frame pharmacological weight loss as desirable and legitimate. However, the ways digital spaces shape motivations, self-image, and peer validation remain poorly understood. Users may view pharmacological weight loss as more legitimate or effective than other methods, reinforcing moral hierarchies around body management. The authors propose a multinational research initiative, currently involving Brazil, the US, Denmark, and Japan, to examine how off-label GLP-1 RA use manifests across different societies, where cultural contexts shape distinct motivations. This is not merely a deviation from medical norms but part of a broader cultural transformation in how the body, health, and morality are understood. An intersectional framework is vital to understanding how factors such as gender, race, age, class, and geography shape who uses these drugs, how they are judged, and what outcomes they experience. Without such nuance, users risk being stereotyped as vain or irresponsible, while the deeper structural pressures that normalize pharmaceutical thinness remain invisible. Ultimately, understanding off-label GLP-1 RA use requires integrating biomedical insights with sociological and cultural analysis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published in Nature and Science of Sleep reveals a strong connection between social media addiction and poor sleep quality among high school graduates in Bangladesh, offering fresh insights into the mental health and digital habits of young people. The study found that higher levels of social media addiction were closely associated with poorer sleep quality. Two key symptoms - "relapse" and "daytime performance disruption" - emerged as major links between excessive social media use and sleep problems. Female participants experienced poorer sleep quality when social media addiction was present, while male students exhibited a higher overall prevalence of addiction, suggesting a differential, sex-related susceptibility to the effects of social media use. Through network analysis, the researchers identified several "central" symptoms that bridged social media use and sleep health: "mood modification," "taking time to fall asleep" (sleep latency) and "efficiency disruption during the day." These findings underscore that sleep health and social media behaviors are deeply intertwined. Our results highlight the importance of targeted interventions to promote healthier digital and sleep habits among young people."
