                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I'm a self hosting GoGogs / Gitea user for almost 10 years, I did follow the Gitea fork. The ideologically forked Forgejo made some license changes and hard fork decisions that increased the maintenance burden even more, resulting in missing upstream features and decreased security. Forgejo is more busy managing ideals, than creating software. But then a couple of years have passed, and I started to hear about Forgejo more often only very recently, so I was wondering, if maybe the original project actually had some downfall and questionable technical decisions since. As far, as I've heard it's still basically a matter of running the different docker container with the same volume, and it should work seamlessly. So what's about this "hard fork" you are mentioning? Isn't it sensible for a European government to talk to a player that is being backed by European companies and has a cleaner approach to open source?I'm not arguing, I'm asking what's the rationale here. > resulting in missing upstream features and decreased securityI.e. it's a matter of technical superiority, which, to me, how the decisions should be made. Not by having friends in the community and all of us being Europeans and so on. I.e. it's a matter of technical superiority, which, to me, how the decisions should be made.

AMD increased its share across all markets served by x86 processors at Intel's expense in the third quarter of 2025, according to Mercury Research. Intel is holding strong, and as its latest offerings for client and server systems got significantly more competitive than they were several quarters ago, the pace of AMD's gains has slowed down considerably. Normally, we start our coverage of the x86 market based on data from Mercury Research with client CPUs, but the third quarter was very unusual as unit shipments of x86 CPUs were flat quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), which significantly contradicts the normal seasonal bump when PC makers start to prep for the back-to-school (BTS) season in June – July as well as Christmas season in September. Indeed, PC and server makers increased their CPU procurements in Q3, but the weakness came almost entirely from Intel, which saw sharp drops in IoT/SoC and entry-level mobile processors as it shifted manufacturing capacity toward server processors, and strong shipments of such parts in Q2. By contrast, AMD's unit shipments were flat to slightly up, so the company gained share sequentially and year-over-year (YoY), hitting two psychologically important milestones. For the first time in years, AMD's unit share of all x86 client and server CPUs shipped exceeded 25% and now stands at 25.6%, up from 24.2% in the prior quarter and up from 24% in the same quarter a year ago. Intel still commands 74.4%, but it lost some share in certain segments, allowing AMD to hit an important milestone amid a market shrink. If we add embedded, IoT, and game consoles SoCs to the equation, then AMD's share looks even more impressive: a 30.9% share of all x86-based chips, up from 25% in the third quarter of 2024. Yet, it should be noted that AMD shipped significantly more game console SoCs in the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of 2024, which inflated its results a bit. Strong desktop and mobile CPU lineups as well as Intel struggles with supply of small-core mobile CPUs and prior-generation desktop offerings allowed AMD to slightly outgrow Intel in the third quarter both sequentially and year-over-year, according to data from Mercury Research. AMD's client unit share rose to 25.4%, up 1.5% QoQ and 1.4% YoY, driven mainly by strong desktop momentum. By contrast, Intel's share fell to 74.6%, down 1.5% sequentially and 1.4% compared to the same quarter a year ago, as its entry-level mobile shipments were constrained by reduced small-core CPU supply. Although Intel still dominates in total volume, Q3's numbers reflect the ongoing pressure on its mobile PC shipments and AMD's sustained improvement in desktops. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Both AMD and Intel saw strong sequential unit shipments growth in Q3 2025 on the desktop CPU market, although Q2 -> Q3 market growth in general was lower than normal seasonal rates, according to Mercury Research. On the revenue front, AMD reached another record quarter for desktop CPU revenue, driven by higher shipments and a strong mix of premium SKUs, as the company noted in its conference call a week ago. Intel's revenue position weakened as its unit share declined and AMD absorbed more of the market's high-margin demand. AMD lost market share to Intel in the mobile CPU space in Q1 and Q2 2025, but the company outperformed Intel in Q3 2025 on a sequential basis, gaining unit share as Intel struggled with reduced shipments of its entry-level small-core processors. AMD's mobile CPU unit share rose from 20.6% in Q2 to 21.9% in Q3, a sequential gain of 1.4%, while Intel's share fell from 79.4% to 78.1%, down 1.4% QoQ. Intel's shortage of low-end CPUs pushed its average selling prices upward, while AMD — which does not have direct rivals for Intel Atom-like SoCs — benefited from increased shipments of mid-range and premium Ryzen mobile processors as Intel faced some shortages on this side of the spectrum as well. In the server CPU market, Q3 2025 saw relatively flat unit shipments overall, but while AMD managed to edge out another small gain, its gains have been negligible this year. Both companies saw YoY shipment growth, but AMD's increase was stronger, helping it push unit share higher compared to the same quarter a year earlier, so overall things look good for AMD. Most of the real action in Q3 came from product mix rather than volume, according to Mercury. AMD's EPYC 'Turin' ramp accelerated, driving stronger demand for high-core-count EPYC processors, while Intel saw increasing adoption of Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids,' which helped lift its average selling prices despite slightly lower unit volumes. The combination of flat unit shipments and rising prices meant that AMD's server revenue continues to grow significantly faster than its unit share, while Intel's revenue gains were more limited due to modest declines in its overall shipment mix. In terms of unit share, AMD continued to gain ground in Q3 2025 across nearly all major x86 segments, helped by strong desktop growth driven by the halo effect of range-topping Ryzen 9000-series CPUs and Intel's struggles to ship enough previous-generation desktop CPUs, as well as the relatively low popularity of its latest offerings for desktops. As a result, AMD expanded its presence in client CPUs, reached a new high in desktops, and inched upward in servers, while Intel's share declined modestly as supply constraints and product transitions limited its ability to address all orders. Intel's revenue performance was more mixed: constrained low-end supply pushed its average prices higher, but it ceded more of the high-margin market to AMD, especially in desktops and enterprise servers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Obesity wonder drugs Wegovy and Zepbound are already showing that they can reduce the risk of cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease in addition to helping people lose weight. Now, a US-wide trial will test whether tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, may be an effective treatment for people with long Covid. As many as 20 million people in the US have experienced long Covid, a chronic condition that lasts for at least three months after an initial infection. Scientists still don't fully understand how and why long Covid occurs, but they've found persistent inflammation in many patients. This chronic inflammation may be caused by lingering traces of virus in the body or by misdirected antibodies, known as autoantibodies, that attack a person's own cells and tissues. The hope is that tirzepatide could tamp down this inflammation to improve patients' symptoms. Scripps researchers are recruiting 1,000 people across the country who are 18 years of age or older and have medical documentation of long Covid. Unlike most medical studies, which typically require multiple in-person visits, the Scripps trial is fully remote. They'll receive a fitness tracker so that researchers can measure their step count, an important indicator of fatigue. “For the long Covid population, it's so crucial, because if you're requiring people to come into a clinic, you're systematically excluding the most severely affected folks who are housebound or bedbound. A lack of investment from the pharmaceutical industry has also stalled research. And despite a hefty $1.8 billion investment into long Covid research under the Biden administration, progress on finding effective treatments has been slow. “There is an urgent need for investment in long Covid clinical trials, and in decentralized clinical trials like this one in particular,” says Hannah Davis, cofounder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a long Covid research and advocacy group. One published study found that in 47 people with mast cell activation syndrome, or MCAS, a condition in which white blood cells release inflammatory chemicals, 89 percent benefited from a GLP-1, especially at low doses. The findings are relevant for long Covid, which shares many symptoms with MCAS. David Kaufman, a private practice physician who specializes in MCAS, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune diseases, and chronic infections, has been treating long Covid patients with small doses of tirzepatide at his clinic, the Center for Complex Diseases, in Seattle and Mountain View, California. What it does is it seems to move the needle so patients can become more functional, but they may still need some fine tuning with the other medication,” he tells WIRED. To avoid unwanted weight loss and the gastrointestinal side effects that come with GLP-1s, Kaufman typically starts patients out on one-tenth of the standard starting dose of 2.5 milligrams. He currently has 40 to 50 long Covid patients who are taking microdoses of tirzepatide. At a long Covid workshop in September, Kaufman presented his and other providers' experience treating more than 350 patients with microdosing. They have found a 60 to 90 percent decrease in fatigue, brain fog, pain, and MCAS symptoms. An NIH-sponsored trial also plans to test a GLP-1 drug for long Covid. Given the spectrum of symptoms associated with long Covid, there's unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's the question on many minds in Seattle and beyond after the startup revealed Monday it is facing a potential shutdown due to “significant financial challenges.” Rad started as a scrappy hardware startup and grew into the largest e-bike seller in North America. During a ride along the Burke-Gilman Trail in Seattle this week, we met John Ward, who was cruising on his Rad City electric bike. “It's a bummer,” Ward said of the hometown company's struggles. We spoke with former Rad execs, industry experts, bike shop owners, and hardware startup leaders to understand what went wrong at the company. Rad gave customers “that feeling like they were a kid again,” co-founder Ty Collins told GeekWire this week. “They made bicycles accessible to people that may be intimidated going into a bike shop,” said Peter Clancy, business partner at Westside Bicycle in Seattle. Rad opened up a new “lifestyle” market segment — sub-$2,000 e-bikes for regular people, not hardcore cyclists. “Rad kind of built the e-bike space,” said Justin Taylor, editor at Electric Bike Report. The company's early team was a ragtag crew doing multiple jobs at once. “We just really efficiently scaled our spend,” Collins said. Rad quickly found product-market fit after an initial crowdfunding campaign. Later that year it inked a delivery partnership with Domino's. But like many other businesses during the pandemic, Rad dealt with supply chain delays and disruption. The company went to great lengths to meet demand — in mid-2021, it bought 64 containers and chartered its cargo from Asia into a non-traditional port near Seattle. Bike companies over-ordered on long lead times assuming COVID demand would keep going, according to Pluth. “We just had too much inventory liability that we couldn't be flexible,” said Leah Hunkins, a former supply chain leader at Rad. Pluth stressed that selling bikes below cost to clear inventory can be problematic. The other companies were able to work through that, given they have a lot longer track record and more diversified product. I'm just not sure Rad was able to do that.” A growth-at-all-costs mindset may have made sense while Rad's bikes were selling faster than they could be built. “The only thing we're probably guilty of is being overly optimistic that Rad was on this trajectory of growth that would never stop,” Hunkins said. He added that the “internal secret sauce” to Rad's success was allowing employees to “take real ownership over the brand and feel like they were really a part of everything.” At the same time, Rad faced an influx of strong competitors — Lectric, Velotric and others — plus traditional brands finally moving into e-bikes, all slicing off pieces of the pie. “The differentiation of our product got more challenging,” Hunkins said. During his short stop to talk to GeekWire, cyclists riding e-bikes from Aventon, Lectric, Emotion, Super 73, Gazelle, Urban Arrow and more passed by on a trail that's been dominated by Rad in recent years. Clancy noted how easy it was for new entrants to appear. “It takes nothing to become a bike brand,” he said. More recent online posts about Rad highlight customer service issues. While Rad's direct-to-consumer strategy was an advantage early on (shorter supply chain, bypass bike shops), it carried long-term service obligations. Rad's scale meant tens of thousands of riders looking for service in markets where independent shops had to juggle labor costs, parts sourcing and warranty expectations on bikes they didn't sell. “It worked in the beginning, until people started having problems with proprietary parts,” said Matt Thomas, owner of The Polka Dot Jersey bike shop in Seattle. Rad shut down its mobile services arm in 2022 and cut 100 jobs. Rad pulled out of Europe starting in 2024 and closed some service shops. Meanwhile, the company went through multiple rounds of layoffs under new CEO Phil Molyneux, the former Sony president who departed earlier this year. The company is now led by CEO Kathi Lentzsch, who previously ran Bartell Drugs as CEO before the company sold to Rite-Aid in 2020. Rad's challenges reflect broader difficulties facing consumer hardware startups in the post-2022 investment climate. “Hardware success requires patient capital as it will take a long time and money to build an enduring brand,” said Clayton Wood, former CEO of Seattle-based cooking automation startup Picnic. “That capital is very scarce in the last few years.” Wood noted that pre-2022, venture capital focused on creating unicorns, and hardware companies could raise on high valuations because of high price points and gross profits. “In 2022 the game changed, leaving anyone who raised prior with overvalued companies,” he said. It's easier to pivot in software, he said, but hardware has high production setup and development costs. Amish Patel, managing director at Conduit Venture Labs, a hardware-focused startup studio, also pointed out structural challenges. Patel said consumer hardware companies with unit-margin-based business models face particular challenges. Hardware brands selling $250+ products rely almost entirely on consumer demand and scale, he said, and when margins tighten — with no software, service, or subscription revenue to offset — the business becomes extremely fragile. RELATED: Seattle's long history of hardware heartbreak: Big raises, high hopes, hard landings “Add together over-ordering from the boom, inventory risk as demand cooled, high interest and debt servicing costs — and you get classic hardware scaling pain,” Patel said. Rad's funding rounds may have been seen as a sign of strength. “It just seemed weird that a company like that couldn't stand on its own without huge cash influxes,” said David Johnson, owner of Electric & Folding Bikes Northwest. Thomas, the owner at Polka Dot, shared a similar sentiment. “I don't quite understand why anyone thought during the pandemic that they were going to sustain a 500% increase in business year-over-year for five years,” he said. But that one didn't seem too hard to figure out.” GeekWire contacted Vadon and Cavens for comment, but have not heard back. The company's other investors include Fidelity Management & Research Company, Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Cercano Management, Durable Capital Partners LP, The Rise Fund (TPG's multi-sector global impact investing strategy), and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A German court has found that Google has abused its dominant market position in the price comparison sector and ruled that the company must pay a total of €572 million ($665.6 million) in damages to two German price comparison companies, according to a report by Reuters. Idealo had claimed damages of €3.3 billion from Google, arguing that its lawsuit was a direct response to the European Court of Justice's ruling in 2024 that found the search giant was self-preferencing its own shopping comparison service, breaking competition rules, and fined it about $2.7 billion. We will continue to fight – because market abuse must have consequences and must not become a lucrative business model that is worthwhile despite fines and compensation payments,” Idealo's co-founder and CEO Albrecht von Sonntag said in a statement. The number of price comparison sites in Europe using the remedy Shopping Unit has multiplied from seven then to 1,550 today,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The company added that it offers rival comparison shopping services the same opportunity as Google Shopping to display ads, and said Google Shopping operates as if it were a separate business, participating in auctions the same as everyone else. The company was recently fined €2.95 billion (just under $3.5 billion) by the EU for allegedly breaching EU antitrust rules by favoring its own advertising services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a step down from Pine Labs' 2022 private valuation of over $5 billion, but still a clear signal that investors are backing India's growing push to take its fintech model global. Founded in 1998, Pine Labs has been steadily expanding beyond India and now operates in 20 markets, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the UAE, the U.S., and some parts of Africa. In India, Pine Labs competes with the likes of Razorpay, Paytm, and Walmart-owned PhonePe. “We will never stop being a startup,” said Amrish Rau, CEO of Pine Labs, during its public listing ceremony. Existing investors, including Peak XV Partners, Temasek Holdings, PayPal, and Mastercard, were among those who sold part of their holdings in the public listing. “Pine Labs never wanted to compete on price,” said Shailendra Singh, managing director at Peak XV Partners. “It always wanted to compete on a superior proposition. The VC firm is also seeing back-to-back partial public exits this week, as Pine Labs is its second portfolio company to list after Groww, which debuted on Indian exchanges with a 12% pop and closed its first trading day 29% above its issue price of ₹100.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI just went from vibe hacking to a nation-state-sponsored cyberattack. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude, just published a report detailing how its agentic coding tool was used in a cyberattack that targeted 30 institutions, including tech, finance, and chemical manufacturing companies, plus some government agencies. According to Anthropic, this is the first time an AI-orchestrated cyber attack has been reported. The company says that although AI with agentic capabilities has increased its usefulness in productivity-related tasks, it has also allowed bad actors to take advantage of AI tools to execute complicated attacks without needing constant human supervision. Although LLMs typically have built-in safeguards to prevent them from being used in criminal acts, the recent event showed that there are ways to circumvent this. This includes increased intelligence, which allows the AI to follow multiple, layered instructions and understand the context in which they were to be executed; agency, allowing the tool to make decisions on its own without human input; and access to advanced tools through the Model Context Protocol, letting it use security-related software like password crackers and network scanners. In Phase 2, the AI is instructed to conduct its initial reconnaissance, using scan, search, data retrieval, and code analysis tools to deliver an initial analysis and summary of the target to its operator. Phase 3 is a more targeted version of Phase 2, where the AI runs a vulnerability scan based on its findings to determine how it will compromise the target. Anthropic says that Claude has built-in safeguards to help prevent this from happening, but the attackers were able to circumvent this. The first thing they did was to convince the LLM that it was working for a cybersecurity company, and that it was being used for penetration testing and red teaming. They also broke down the entire operation into smaller, seemingly innocent tasks. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. While AI has previously been used for “vibe hacking”, this is the first time that it was used in an attack of this magnitude. Advancing AI technology has now allowed smaller teams with fewer resources to conduct complex campaigns such as this, although it must be noted that Anthropic suspects that this was driven by a nation-state sponsor. Thankfully, its team soon discovered what was happening and took steps to document the entire operation. It also banned accounts that were detected to be engaged in illegal activity, as well as notifying both the targets and the authorities of what was happening.

The LG 34GX90SA just hit $679 on Amazon, slashed from its $1,399 list price, and this price makes premium curved ultrawide gaming a lot more accessible. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this monitor since it was released so it's been the early Black Friday deal gamers have been waiting for all year. Fast-paced shooters like Valorant or Apex Legends benefit a lot from this speed, and allows you to track enemies through quick movements without ghosting or motion blur which causes you to miss shots. The response time is basically a measure of how fast individual pixels change colors, and at 0.03ms, this monitor reacts about 100 times faster than typical gaming monitors that hover in the range of 3-5ms. This technical advantage translates into clearer visual information during heated moments of gameplay where split-second decisions make all the difference between winning and losing. Where the OLED panel technology pays off is in perfect blacks created by turning off individual pixels rather than backlighting that bleeds through, like LCD displays. That equates to a contrast ratio of 1.5 million to 1-the darkest darks and brightest brights can exist on-screen at the same time without washing each other out. Games like Cyberpunk 2077 or horror titles like Resident Evil Village take on incredible depth and atmosphere when the shadows actually look black instead of murky gray. Color accuracy goes up to 98.5% of the DCI-P3 color space which matters for both gaming and creative work like photo editing or video production. This wide color gamut means you see colors as developers intended them-from the vibrant neon lights of futuristic cityscapes to the subtle earth tones of realistic military shooters. Both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-SYNC compatibility eliminate screen tearing and stuttering by synchronizing your graphics card's frame output with the monitor's refresh rate. This works across the whole 48-240Hz variable refresh rate range, keeping visuals smooth as the frame rate drops to 60fps in demanding scenes or hits 240fps in less intensive moments. The integrated webOS platform converts this game monitor into a smart display, streaming Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and more than 300 free LG Channels without the need for a connected PC or streaming device. Cloud gaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna, and Blacknut run natively from the monitor's UI, enabling you to game without a dedicated gaming rig by streaming games over your internet connection. USB Type-C connectivity offers 65W power delivery to charge laptops while simultaneously passing video and data over a single cable, which cleans up desk space and streamlines your setup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>YMTC plots 2027 production start as Beijing sets its sights on memory sovereignty. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC), China's top NAND flash manufacturer and one of the most heavily scrutinized names in the chip war, is pushing ahead with plans for a third semiconductor plant in Wuhan. The facility is expected to begin mass production in 2027, in a move that underscores Beijing's intention to double down on domestic memory capacity even as YMTC remains barred from acquiring advanced U.S. chipmaking tools. Entity List in December 2022, a designation that has crippled access to EUV and advanced DUV lithography, precision etching gear, and key U.S.-origin design IP. YMTC's situation is unlike that of Huawei, which was forced into a radical pivot toward software and cloud services following its sanctions. Its most advanced product, the 232-layer Xtacking 3.0 NAND, was benchmarked in late 2022 as competitive with Micron's and Samsung's offerings. But sustaining that lead has proven impossible without access to ASML's cutting-edge tooling. Various reports suggest that YMTC's Fab 2 has been operating with domestic workarounds and modified legacy tools, relying in part on procurement from third-party intermediaries to secure essential chemicals and maintenance components. One potential candidate is SMEE's immersion lithography equipment, but this has yet to deliver consistent yields beyond 28nm logic equivalents, far from the sub-20nm half-pitch necessary for leading-edge NAND stacking. Still, YMTC's new fab suggests confidence that by 2027, domestic toolchains will be capable enough to support high-volume NAND production if not at the bleeding edge, then at commercial scale. While DRAM remains the performance bottleneck in AI inference, NAND underpins persistent storage for massive model checkpoints, training data lakes, and parameter weights for retrieval-augmented generation. That imperative is reflected in the composition of China's "Little Giants" initiative, which is understood to support key industrial chains and strategic emerging industries such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing in the upstream value chain. It's also worth noting that YMTC's return to expansion mirrors Beijing's new appetite for high-risk, high-capex investment in areas where U.S. export controls bite hardest, but enforcement remains inconsistent. From a business standpoint, YMTC's decision to break ground on a third fab lands during one of the tightest NAND cycles in recent memory. Pua, the price of a 1Tb TLC NAND die has more than doubled in the past six months, climbing from $4.80 to $10.70, with virtually all 2026 production capacity already sold out. NAND flash pricing is expected to remain elevated into 2027, as AI datacenter deployments and enterprise SSD demand continue to outpace wafer output across the major suppliers. Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung are all riding that upturn, but their responses have been measured. Micron is prioritizing DRAM and HBM3E, while SK Hynix has pivoted to premium AI NAND. What none of them are doing is flooding the market with new capacity. YMTC, by contrast, is hoping to do exactly that, not because it sees an opening to grab global share, but because its political and economic mandate is different. If YMTC can bring its third fab online by 2027 — even at 128-layer or similar nodes — it can serve national storage demand across hyperscalers, surveillance systems, and edge compute. That volume won't threaten Samsung's lead, but it could give Chinese cloud providers a secure NAND supply at a time when export controls are steadily tightening and global inventories are already claimed. On paper, its production timeline puts it three years away from volume output, which is an eternity in semiconductor terms. By 2027, however, the efficacy of U.S. sanctions will hinge on how well Chinese tooling ecosystems mature. YMTC bets that by then, it won't need American equipment, or at least not enough to make the fab infeasible. For the world's top memory makers, YMTC's continued growth even under U.S. sanctions is more than a marginal concern. With a third fab now in planning and domestic demand accelerating, the company is on track to become the fifth-largest NAND producer globally, and could climb to fourth if its expansion proceeds on schedule. According to Nikkei Asia, industry executives estimate that YMTC could capture 10% or more of global NAND production capacity by as early as next year, potentially overtaking Micron in volume terms. Even if YMTC remains focused on serving China's domestic market, that shift has global implications. For Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, it may force a recalibration of pricing strategies and long-term exposure to China, especially as Beijing continues to push for procurement of domestic components.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin wallet and lending platform Lava has come under scrutiny in the past few weeks due to a lack of clarity around a recent update. According to numerous users of the app, the rug was pulled out from under them in a way, as the update in question completely altered the wallet's trust and security model by switching from a non-custodial setup to a fully trusted and custodial model where Lava has full control over users' digital assets. According to a report in Blockspace, the controversy started in September when Lava users were shown a screen that indicated an update was necessary to gain access to all of the latest features. Additionally, there was no way to access loans that had already been taken out via the app without the update. Eventually, Lava CEO Shehzan Maredia made an X post on some changes that had been made in terms of how the financial app functions behind the scenes. In response, Foundation Head of Physical Design Owen Kemeys publicly asked on X for more specifics about what exactly had changed and whether those alterations had already been implemented via an update of the app. The move to a custodial model for Lava would be particularly odd, as Maredia has a long list of posts on X regarding the problems with custodial setups. Additionally, while all this was happening, Lava had also announced a new $200 million fundraising round. Maredia allegedly told Blockspace that a post-mortem regarding this event would be provided on Wednesday, but such an update providing more clarity had not been published as of the time of this writing on Thursday. Lava was founded as DLC based and "non custodial"; ie local keys (for what that's worth – not 100% accurate whilst lender is also the oracle, but, baby steps). I used to have "contracts updating, please wait" type loading screens.3. This issue was on full display a few weeks ago when a large amount of crypto infrastructure went down amid an Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage. A large part of the decentralization theater that has occurred in crypto over the years has also been centered around stablecoins, and there is an increasing sense that much of the technology used in crypto is now mainly focused on regulatory arbitrage for centralized entities rather than any sort of cypherpunk philosophy. Additionally, the Lava app has also operated on a closed-source basis this whole time, so what exactly has been happening behind the scenes hasn't really been known. Stablecoins are just traditional fintech that have to use the word "blockchain" for regulatory arbitrage purposes. Doesn't really make sense to build on Bitcoin. Solana is so centralized it's basically just traditional fintech. Users of closed-source crypto wallets are effectively using a custodial system, as they have no way of knowing whether the developers behind the app have access to users' private keys. Open source software is generally viewed as a requirement for any Bitcoin-related software, as the whole point is to operate as a decentralized financial system without trusted third parties. This is also why the Bitcoin Core node client goes the extra mile with practices such as reproducible builds and forcing users to manually opt in to software updates. Due to the embrace of crypto by the Trump administration, there could be a continuation of this bifurcation of the space between Bitcoin's focus on decentralization and fintech-esque use cases that heavily involve centralized stablecoins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI on Thursday introduced a group chat feature for ChatGPT. The feature, currently being tested in select regions, including Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, lets users collaborate directly within the app. OpenAI says the pilot is designed to explore how people use group conversations in ChatGPT. The announcement comes after earlier reports that OpenAI had been testing a direct-message-style tool. Early users will be invited to provide feedback, which the company says will help shape how the feature eventually expands to more regions and offerings. Group chats are invitation-only, and members can leave at any time. For users under 18, content is filtered, with extra safeguards and parental controls in place. Just tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. If you add someone to an existing chat, a new group is created, leaving the original conversation unchanged. Group chats work just like regular ChatGPT conversations but with multiple people joining in. Messages between human participants don't count toward these limits. It can also react with emojis and use profile photos to create personalized images for the conversation. The group chat feature represents the latest step in OpenAI's gradual transformation from a simple AI assistant into something resembling a social platform. In late September, the company launched Sora 2, a stand-alone social media app with a TikTok-style feed for sharing AI-generated videos, complete with algorithmic recommendations based on user activity and location, parental controls, and direct messaging capabilities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Amazon just launched early Black Friday deals exclusively for Prime members, and this speaker has dropped to an all-time low price of $29, down from its regular $44 price tag. Neodymium drivers offer stronger magnetic fields in a compact size, enabling these speakers to produce louder, clearer sound without adding bulk or weight to the overall design. The Bass response often suffers in portable speakers because producing low frequencies requires moving a lot of air, and that usually requires larger drivers and enclosures. Anker tackles this challenge by implementing BassUp technology-a method that uses digital signal processing to analyze and enhance low-end frequencies in real time. Patented Spiral Bass Port works in conjunction with this technology by creating a longer air path within the compact speaker body and allows bass waves to develop more fully before reaching your ears. This speaker supports wireless stereo pairing, so you can link two Soundcore 2 units together for true left and right channel separation. It really opens up your audio when you can create a proper stereo soundstage with instruments and vocals occupying specific points in space rather than emanating from a single source. Two-speaker pairing is ideal for larger rooms or an outdoor party if you need the extra coverage, and it only takes a few seconds to set up using the Bluetooth connection. Battery life is not an issue, especially during prolonged stays outdoors, away from power outlets. With an IPX7 waterproof rating, serious protection against water damage far exceeds basic splash resistance. That means it can survive full submersion in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes, so if it accidentally fell in the pool, was caught in a rainstorm, or became splashed by waves while hanging at the beach, there's no need to panic. The device can be rinsed under running water as a way of cleaning off sand, dirt, or spilled drinks, which really comes in handy when trying to take care of the device after some outdoor fun. This straightforward design means anyone can operate the speaker without reading instructions or fumbling with complicated menus. With its cylindrical shape and a rubberized base, it sits stable on most surfaces and fits easily into backpack side pockets, car cup holders, or beach bags. Bluetooth 5 connectivity is present to offer reliable wireless range of up to about 66 feet in open spaces for freedom of movement sans constant audio cutouts.</p>
