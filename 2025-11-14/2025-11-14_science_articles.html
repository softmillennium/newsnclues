Brain tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and brain metastases, present a notable clinical challenge. Recent research highlights the presence of intratumor bacteria across many tumor types, yet the microbiome of brain tumors remains largely underexplored. Here we show that the microbiome of 322 brain tumors differs markedly by tumor type and location. Using multiple approaches to visualize, culture and sequence bacterial communities, we found that brain metastases harbor higher bacterial richness and diversity than GBM, with distinct microbial compositions. Moreover, metastases in posterior brain regions exhibited greater diversity than those in anterior regions. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of bacterial metabolic pathways associated with tumor spread and metastasis in brain metastases while GBM was enriched with pathways supporting alternative phosphorus use. These findings provide valuable insights into the microbial landscape of brain tumors, highlighting tumor-type-specific and location-specific variation and suggesting potential roles for bacteria in brain tumor biology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If it ever becomes achievable, hypersonic flight could dramatically reshape international travel. "It really shrinks the planet," says Professor Nicholaus Parziale, whose work centers on turning hypersonic travel from aspiration into reality. Parziale recently received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in recognition of his research into fluid mechanics at extreme speeds. Covering half the world in just one hour may seem impossible, yet the technology is not as far away as it appears. There is a fundamental difference between how air behaves around an aircraft at lower speeds and how it behaves at higher speeds. These shifts influence how an aircraft interacts with the air around it. "Compressibility affects how the airflow goes around the body and that can change things like lift, drag, and thrust required to take off or stay airborne." All of these factors play a major role in aircraft design. Engineers already understand airflow fairly well for aircraft that fly below or near the speed of sound, a range called "low Mach" numbers. Much of that behavior is still uncertain, except for guidance provided by Morkovin's hypothesis. Although high-speed airflow involves larger shifts in temperature and density, Morkovin suggested that the general pattern of turbulent motion stays mostly consistent. "If the hypothesis is correct, it means that we don't need a whole new way to understand turbulence at these higher speeds. This also suggests that future hypersonic aircraft may not require a completely different design philosophy. Despite its importance, the hypothesis has lacked solid experimental validation. A Laser and Krypton Experiment Eleven Years in the Making In the study, Parziale's team introduced krypton gas into a wind tunnel and used lasers to ionize it. This process briefly created a straight, glowing line formed by the krypton atoms. High-resolution cameras then captured how this illuminated line bent, twisted, and distorted as it moved through the airflow, similar to how a leaf drifts and spins within small swirling currents in a river. "As that line moves with the gas, you can see crinkles and structure in the flow, and from that, we can learn a lot about turbulence," Parziale says. He notes that developing the experimental setup required 11 years of effort. Parziale's group received early support from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Research Program (YIP) in 2016 and from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) YIP in 2020, with the latest work also funded by ONR. What the Findings Mean for Future Flight and Space Access While Morkovin's hypothesis is not yet completely proven, the new results move scientists closer to understanding how to design aircraft that can withstand hypersonic speeds. "Today, we must use computers to design an airplane, and the computational resources to design a plane that will fly at Mach 6, simulating all the tiny, fine, little details would be impossible," Parziale explains. "The Morkovin's hypothesis allows us to make simplifying assumptions so that the computational demands to design hypersonic vehicles can become more doable." Parziale adds that the same principles could transform future access to space. "If we can build planes that fly at hypersonic speed, we can also fly them into space, rather than launching rockets, which would make transportation to and from low Earth orbit easier," he says. "It will be a game-changer for transportation not only on earth, but also in low orbit." Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some patients say this condition induces feelings of pure bliss, making them feel as one with the universe. For more than 40 years, Margot has suffered from epileptic seizures, which she describes as “unforgettable.” Ever since she was a child, these seizures have made her feel like she has a “special link” with God—“as if I was chosen,” says Margot, who chose to use a pseudonym for privacy. The rare condition is called ecstatic epilepsy, and the altered state of consciousness patients experience just before a seizure can be life changing; according to some researchers, it could even explain profound religious experiences. Scientists don't yet understand where ecstatic seizures come from, but they do have some knowledge of epilepsy in general, which is a condition that causes an electrical storm in the brain. Occasionally, patients' neurons will rapidly misfire, which overwhelms the brain and causes seizures. Not to be confused with the spiritual term for energy, epileptic auras are brief sensory experiences—such as visual hallucinations or feelings of déjà vu—that occur moments before a seizure. Experts are getting closer to understanding where exactly these ecstatic experiences originate from. Researchers studying epilepsy generally point to a dysfunctional temporal lobe, the region of your brain responsible for functions like memory formation and sensory processing, as the culprit for ecstatic epilepsy. Some patients report that their ecstatic auras feel “mystical” and have had a transformative effect on their lives, according to Fabienne Picard, MD, a French-Swiss neurologist who studies the rare form of epilepsy. Another patient told Picard that her ecstatic auras made her more confident because she understood that “there is something greater than us.” Margot explains that her ecstatic auras transcend bodily experience. She feels like she is floating in the air and becomes flooded with an overwhelming sense of power, a greater understanding of the universe. Some researchers believe that epileptic experiences like Margot's could even explain some mystical accounts from historical and religious figures like Joan of Arc, Saint Paul, and Saint Teresa of Ávila. Picard explains in an email that these “awakening experience[s]” could be due to a momentary slip of the brain's filter. She says humans have become increasingly good at predicting our environments, but ecstatic auras may interrupt that process, stripping away our preconceived notions and revealing a “direct perception” of the world. “Most of them [would] not want to take medication” if they experienced only the ecstatic auras, Picard writes. However, these brief moments of serenity are often followed by a loss of consciousness or a convulsive seizure, which can be distressing and force patients to seek intervention. Ecstatic epilepsy is a unique medical condition that requires more research to be fully understood—but it could eventually illuminate our knowledge of higher consciousness as a whole. In fact, those who don't suffer from ecstatic epilepsy might be able to achieve similar “mystical experiences,” Picard explains on the podcast. Possible methods include meditation and psychedelics, two practices commonly associated with higher consciousness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tar was often used to seal coffins and not an usual part of the find, but the metal bars and layers of fabric archaeologists found with the coffins raised some questions. Once they got inside the subterranean room under the church's altar—it took a month using modern mining techniques—the team was surprised with what they discovered. According to a translated statement from the Kazimierz Biskupi government, the crypt featured three layers of coffins stacked on top of each other, totaling six burials, with one layer was separated by metal rods. There was also an unusual layer of a fabric and tar mixture likely used to seal a burial. “Such a layered sandwich of fabric and tar has never been encountered in any research, at least not in my own studies,” said Malgorzata Grupa of the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, according to the Polish Press Agency. “I'm not aware of such a case in any publication.” The tar and fabric mixture were likely present because of a delayed burial. Tar was commonly used to seal coffins, so using some sort of fabric may have allowed for additional layers of tar on the coffin, possibly since the deceased was traveling from a significant distance to reach the monastery's crypt. “It must have been a significant figure, since they didn't want to place the subsequent coffins directly on top of this person's coffin,” Grupa said. Getting to the site wasn't easy. Entering the crypt has been a few years coming, as researchers first started work in 2022 to investigate the remains of at least 100 people from dozens of coffins in the church's vaults. The human remains will be repositioned in a side crypt. Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From COVID shots to cancer therapy, mRNA is changing medicine. By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Rowan Moore Gerety, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Jeffery DelViscio Cancer: it's a diagnosis that most of us have learned to fear. On the one hand decades of medical advancements have increased treatment and survival rates. A number of people who in the past might have died from cancer now go on to live long, full lives without recurrence. For certain kinds of cancers, including cancer of the pancreas, effective treatments largely remain elusive, so increasingly, researchers are looking to a perhaps unexpected tool for help: vaccines. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. It turns out that before mRNA vaccines became a key tool to protect people against COVID-19, researchers were initially eyeing them as a way to target cancer. He covered this topic for the December edition of Scientific American. Rowan Moore Gerety: When this first came on my radar about a year ago, partly, I was just surprised to be reading kind of frank mentions of cancer vaccines because, you know, growing up we think of vaccines as one of these miraculous interventions in public health that can basically eradicate a disease, right? But all the same it's the same kind of mechanism, and so I was just really interested to understand, “Wow, like, this is an approach that is seeming like it may be viable for cancer.” I have, as we all have, grew up hearing of people becoming gravely ill and dying with different forms of cancer, and it often just seems like a roll of the dice. And so I was really interested to learn more. Pierre-Louis: Before we get into sort of, like, what makes these vaccines so unique, I think kind of on the, like, the specter of cancer and, like, the living with cancer, in the story you talk to Barbara Brigham, a woman who has been in remission from pancreatic cancer for four years. And that's a disease where most people don't make it five years. What was that kind of, like talking to someone who, absent this treatment, should be dead? But I think, if you have known anybody who gets a pancreatic cancer diagnosis, often it's something that is sort of diagnosed as a terminal illness. There is nothing to do but sort of treat it and see, “Can we get a few more months—or a few weeks, even?” And as I note in the story, you know, she has been able to do quite a lot: She welcomed a new grandchild. She got to see all these volleyball games of her other grandchildren. She saw one grandchild get married and another start graduate work. And she lives on Shelter Island, which is near the tip of Long Island, and she sort of has had a very active and full social life, partly, not necessarily as, like, a cancer-survivor support group, but the way she explained her—she has these weekly get-togethers where they play mah-jongg and eat dessert together, which sounds just lovely. Everybody has lost spouses, siblings; parents are long gone. And so I think it has been really meaningful for her to be able to convene a group of people and talk about surviving and talk about enjoying life on a day-to-day level. One thing I love that she said to me was her mother said you should try to have a little bit of adventure every single day. And she's adopted that as kind of a maxim over these last four years, and I think it's really served her well. Pierre-Louis: I also like that, like, the thing that is ailing her the most right now, at least that you put in the piece, is, like, her touch of arthritis. Moore Gerety: And she also survived breast cancer, actually, I should note ... While she's been in remission from pancreatic cancer she has fought off a bout of breast cancer, as I understand it. Moore Gerety: So one of the things that makes cancer unique among diseases, or relatively unusual, is that it's not like a virus, where, you know, you have this pathogen that's introduced into the body and the body goes, “Oh, my God, you look really, really different. I better go after you and attack you with all my might.” Cancer, because it arises from these genetic mutations in our own cells, a tumor's genetics end up looking quite similar to the rest of your body's genetics. And so it creates a kind of a quandary for the immune system of figuring out, “Where is that line?” Researchers talk about “self” versus “not self,” and one of the kind of riddles of cancer treatment for a very long time has been how the body manages to make that distinction and how we can kind of put our thumb on the scales with medical interventions to accelerate immune responses to cancer. And then you have chemotherapy and radiation, which are targeting still pretty broad parts of the body, or systems within the body. And so naturally, through all those things, there's a lot of collateral consequences. If you've ever talked to somebody who's going through chemotherapy, they're really tired. Like, so these are not things that you would do to yourself absent having a life-threatening disease. And there's one more distinction to draw here, which is that about 30 years ago researchers started to have success with something called checkpoint inhibitors. So in our body we are always fighting off pathogens of one kind or another. And the body's always deciding, like, “Do I need to pay attention to you, or, oh, is this thing over here more serious?” And so part of what controls that immune response is a group of proteins called checkpoint proteins, and cancers can actually kind of trick the body using those checkpoint proteins to say, “Hey, don't worry about me. We can turn off your T cells,” those killer cells that would normally come after a tumor, “and instead just let the tumor grow.” So checkpoint inhibitors are a class of drugs that has been around for 20, 25 years that act on that capacity that tumors have to sort of shut off your T cells using checkpoint proteins. And so rather than your body needing to know, “Hey, this is what your cancer looks like,” the mRNA vaccine can actually tell your body, “Hey, this is what your cancer looks like.” And in that way it can help your body form what people call a de novo, or a brand-new, immune response rather than just amplifying the existing immune response, which is what earlier forms of immunotherapy have done. Pierre-Louis: And my understanding is researchers who are using the mRNA, it's not, like, a standalone thing. It's, like, used in conjunction with other immuno treatments. So because cancer's so serious, and I think because of, you know, the Hippocratic injunction “Do no harm,” you can't just say, “Well, to find out if this works we're gonna withhold the cancer treatments that we know work a little bit and just give you the shot and kind of see what happens.” So the people who participate in early studies, or really any study, of mRNA vaccines—and this is now quite a huge area; there are 50-some-odd trials going on right now. But we're kind of thinking of it a little bit backwards, which is they were tinkering with this treatment in order to treat cancer, and then the COVID pandemic broke out, and they were like, “Hey, we actually think we can use this as an inoculate against this, you know, very deadly virus.” Moore Gerety: Yeah, this is a fascinating story and one that I was not familiar with through the pandemic even though, you know, I have, at this point, many mRNA shots in my arm. So this is a Turkish couple in Germany named Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci. And they first became interested in mRNA as cancer researchers 30 years ago because they were looking at precisely this question of: “How can we find a way to boost the immune response, and how can we personalize the response?” So, you know, a little while ago I was talking about how cancer really looks like any other part of your body. And so even, you know, a generation ago the founders of BioNTech were really interested in figuring out, like, “How can we personalize treatment?” And they decided to kind of bet on mRNA as a platform. When you change between one patient and another or one disease and another you don't need to start from scratch. You can just go in and basically splice out a portion of those genetic instructions and say, “Okay, now go look for this genetic mutation,” and everything else in the molecule can remain the same. Try to be stable,” right—the body's kind of a messy place. “Don't get corrupted or kind of thrown off your axis by whatever's going on inside us. So they spent, like, decades, really, tinkering with that cap and tail, the rest of the mRNA molecule, in order to say, “Hey, how can we make this really stable? And so what that means is, in terms of the demands of your body's immune response, it's much, much larger. I think they told me you have somewhere on the order of, like, tens of thousands of cells that would need to be active and creating an adequate immune response to fight off a virus, because those antibodies are always circulating, looking for the first signs of an invasion, but [for] a cancer response you might need billions of T cells to be engaged. And so in order to sort of customize the mRNA they had to figure out, “How can we make this molecule work so that it can generate a big enough immune response?” Along comes the pandemic, and they say, “I think mRNA could really help here because it's so flexible. Each time the COVID-19 virus changes we can just tinker with that middle section and then spit out a new vaccine in a few weeks.” And lo and behold that's exactly what happened, and that's what allowed us all to get boosters throughout the pandemic that were tailored to the genetic versions of the pathogen that was sort of most in evidence around the world so that when Omicron became a thing the vaccine's tailored to Omicron, and you can suppress whatever wave is happening that looks like Omicron. So then after the pandemic, again, they realized, “Now we have this incredible proof of concept. All of that decades of work we did sort of pursuing mRNA vaccines as a good platform for cancer treatment, now we have shown people that it's safe, we have learned a lot about how to manufacture them effectively, and now we can kind of pivot and go back towards our original research interest.” And of course, BioNTech is not the only company that was going through that journey. This research is maybe not quite at risk but, like, potentially moving a lot more slowly and helping less people than it could otherwise. A lot of the technological advances that have made mRNA vaccines possible and practical as a form of cancer treatment in this moment are things that just weren't around five or even 10 years ago. You have all these tools, these algorithms that can predict how different kinds of proteins will appear in the body, and that's important to sort of figure out which of the different mutations in a tumor we might go after with a vaccine. We saw what I think a Senate report estimated to be a [roughly] 30 percent reduction in federal funding for cancer research just in the first few months of the second Trump administration earlier this year. We have since seen cuts to major federal grant programs that supported mRNA vaccines for other diseases, so those haven't yet targeted the ongoing mRNA vaccine trials for cancer, but certainly, that is an anxiety that a number of researchers expressed to me. And I think you also have, for Americans, this new reason to question the sort of primacy of the American research establishment on a global level. I had a couple conversations with folks just about how different it feels to recruit young postdocs who are figuring out, “Well, where does it make sense for me to start my researching life? And so, as hopeful a moment as it is, I think there's a very long shadow over the field at this moment because these things take generations to develop, in some ways. And so there's this really long-term dimension to cancer research that is very, very important, and I think the longer the sort of interruption or pause or even just sort of uncertainty persists, the more people worry, “Are we going to be able to rebuild or sustain the institutions that have made this research possible?” Pierre-Louis: It also feels like, a little bit, like—I don't wanna say that the people, you know, who died early on were choosing to sacrifice themselves, but it is a sort of sacrifice to say, “I know that I'm not gonna survive. I'm gonna allow myself to be kind of poked and prodded for medical science so that, you know, the future generations can survive.” And it seems like we're really at risk of kind of losing that sacrifice. I think it's great that people are willing to participate in studies, but as you say it's not that it's going to negatively impact their treatment, but the sales pitch is basically, “Hey, we don't know if this thing will work. You're at the, like, most difficult moment of your life. You have all kinds of new metaphysical thoughts about mortality and these things. And so even if it does hold out a little bit of hope for improved health, it's not always, I've gotta think, an easy trade-off. And we should really cherish people's willingness to participate in what is really a sort of an act of solidarity not only just across place, but across time, and try to support that as best we can. Pierre-Louis: That's really beautiful, and I think that's a really good place to end this, so thank you so much for your time.
