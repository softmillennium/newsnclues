                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Australian was a picture of despair after a defeat to Lorenzo Musetti, but staged an unlikely resurrection in more ways than one.ByTENNIS.comPublished Nov 14, 2025 copy_link What a difference two days makes. Alex de Minaur could only feel relief after scoring a much-sought after win at the ATP Finals on Thursday, a feeling that only got better when he officially qualified for the semifinals after Carlos Alcaraz's win over Lorenzo Musetti.Read more: Carlos Alcaraz clinches 2025 year-end No. 1 ranking after victory over Musetti at ATP FinalsDe Minaur confessed to being in a "very dark place" after losing to Lorenzo Musetti on Tuesday, in a match where he held match point, to drop to 0-2 this year in Turin, and 0-5 at the ATP Finals for his career. Can you tell us how you came in, your mentality for the match.ALEX de MINAUR: Yeah, I mean, sport (smiling)...Couple days ago was one of the toughest days I've had in my career. Here we are two days later and I'm feeling great about myself (smiling). It's incredible.But more than anything, regardless of the result today, I had made peace with myself.

When did that making peace with yourself actually click in? Did you have to be on your own completely? You're second only at the moment now to Alcaraz for match wins, lead the tour with hard court wins. If you could, reflect on that.ALEX de MINAUR: To be honest, I'm incredibly lucky with the support system that I have, the people I've got around me, every single one in my team, even Katie. They were able to, or they tried to, talk some sense into me and get me out of a very dark place.Sometimes when you're in that dark place, you make peace. You start to care less, right? Ultimately you can focus on other elements and not the results.For the first time in a long time, I forgot about the what if's, the results, what happens if I miss this shot, what happens if I lose this match. A couple days ago I didn't. That's what hurt so much.Today I knew that no matter what, I wanted to be proud of my decision making, my aggressive mindset, and I wanted to go out there and try to win the match.
