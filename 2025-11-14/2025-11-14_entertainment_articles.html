How do you best tell a tragic story that everyone already seems to know? For “Murdaugh: Death in the Family” star and executive producer Jason Clarke, you have a little fun with it. “I'll give it to you straight up: it's enjoyable being a narcissist,” Clarke said during a recent chat with IndieWire as part of our Pass the Remote panel series, presented in partnership with Disney, to celebrate the art and craft of TV. “It's enjoyable being a good ol' boy, you know what I mean? I looked and thought about that a lot. Which is where he truly ends up, with a lack of empathy. The man stands by his decision, I guess, in still not coming clean.” Related Stories How Director Matt Ross Found the Surprises in the Historical Drama of ‘Death by Lightning' ‘Poker Face' Cancelled at Peacock, but the Show Seeks a New Home with Peter Dinklage Taking Over Natasha Lyonne's Role In the miniseries, Clarke stars as convicted murderer Alex Murdaugh (complete with Southern accent and rusty red hair), infamous for killing his wife Maggie (Patricia Arquette) and son Paul (Johnny Berchtold) in 2021 following years of interfamily drama, trauma, and oops, yes, other mysterious deaths. For Clarke, tapping into Alex's most basic (and base) desires was key to unlocking his character. During the panel, hosted by IndieWire's own Editor in Chief & Senior Vice President Dana Harris-Bridson, some of the limited series' cast and crew joined Pass the Remote to talk about their meticulously researched show and what they hope viewers get out of it. Clarke was joined by co-creator and executive producer Erin Lee Carr; co-creator, showrunner, and executive producer Michael D. Fuller; hair department head Katie Ballard; casting director John Papsidera; and makeup department head Addison Foreman. And while Clarke was joking a bit about enjoying the process, Clarke clearly relished tapping into whatever it is that makes Alex tick and applying it to his performance. He also credited Ballard and Foreman for assisting that transformation, not just through their own craft work, but by similarly diving head-long into a journey through “absurdity and vulgarity.” And Will Ferrell outtakes? “There's the mechanical way of going through that and processing it, and then there's the subconscious way of just doing it,” Clarke said. “I'll say, with Addison and Katie, we used to listen to what you could term narcissistic music and dance. … We'd do a lot of things, watch Will Ferrell to laugh, to get into, ‘fuckin' the plums, just drippin' down my chin!' More Pass the Remote panels are available as well on IndieWire's website and YouTube channel. “Murdaugh: Death in the Family” is now streaming on Hulu, with new episodes rolling out through Wednesday, November 19, when the series finale will start streaming. The IndieWire Pass the Remote Winter Edition, presented in partnership with Disney, will celebrate the art and craft of TV through a series of panels rolling out through early December 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: After breathing new life into high-profile IP like the Spider-Man franchise and Dungeons & Dragons, Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley are looking to boldly go where no directors have gone before with a very popular franchise. Sources tell Deadline, the duo are coming on to write, produce and are attached to direct a new original Star Trek film for Paramount. They will produce under their GoldDay banner. Plot details are being kept under wraps for now, but sources say Goldstein and Daley's film is a completely new take on the Star Trek universe and not connected to any previous or current television series, movie or prior movie development projects. That pitch falls in line with Skydance founder David Ellison's recent comments on an earnings call where he said the next Star Trek film would not be a sequel in the Chris Pine-led series but something different with new actors. As for Goldstein and Daley, the two have shown a knack for not only delivering scripts with new and fresh takes on existing IP but adding a fun and lightness that differentiated them from other films in the franchise. Films like Spider-Man: Homecoming, which the two wrote, and the recent Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, which they also directed, earned strong marks from fans and critics alike for not only having strong stories but fun, witty humor that consistently is seen in their work and will be fresh for the Star Trek franchise. As for Skydance, Goldstein and Daley recently wrote, produced and directed the original Cold War action comedy Mayday starring Ryan Reynolds. Sources say it has tested through the roof in early screenings for Skydance and Apple, with plans to release next year. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

If the movie's bad, something will have gone terribly wrong here. That's a tall order but it's better than yet another remake of Kirk and Spock. Didn't they already do ‘light and goofy' with that first Abrams reboot? I hope this is a real attempt along with the GoldDay team understanding what Trek is and appreciation for what Trek means.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jelly Roll is embracing a whole new chapter — and a whole new look — as he continues celebrating his incredible 200-plus–pound weight loss. “I have been with my husband for going on 10 years now, and I have never seen this man without his facial hair,” Bunnie said in a video shared via Instagram on Thursday, November 13. “You guys know as women we get catfished, because we don't know what the hell's under there.” Jelly, 40, joked that he might need plastic surgery for the loose skin left behind after losing weight. “We know we're gonna have to get some skin cut here, but we're trying to see if a face lift might be in order,” he said, tugging at his neck. Baby, it looks really good,” she said as he paused his shave halfway through to show her what he'd look like with a goatee. “Oh my god, the cop ‘stash is fire.” Shortly after, however, Jelly — real name Jason DeFord — shaved it completely. “The total naked face…it's not terrible,” Bunnie said before bursting out laughing. The country singer has lost more than 200 pounds through his journey, weighing in at under 300 pounds for the first time in his adult life. I was over 300 pounds coming out of middle school. I'm gonna be under 300 pounds for the first time since middle school the night I walk to that ring at SummerSlam,” he told Stephanie McMahon on her “What's Your Story?” podcast earlier this year. Everyone should take a note from you,” one follower praised the “Dumb Blonde” podcast host. “Unrecognizable in the best way omg!” a third follower responded. I'm so happy for you and him,” yet another reacted. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. Go here and check the boxnext to EntertainmentNow</p>

Pop quiz, hot shot: What do “Cruel Intentions,” “A Colt Is My Passport,” “Night of the Hunter,” “Possession,” “The Faculty,” and “Vertigo” all have in common? Now that I think of it, at least two different things come to mind. The first is that they all should have spawned gratuitously sleazed out direct-to-video sequels that recast Amy Adams in the lead role and aired on Cinemax every other night for the entirety of my high school years (shout out to Roger Kumble, the James Mangold of Adrian Lynes). The second — and perhaps more broadly relevant — aspect that binds those movies together is that Hollywood is currently in the process of remaking each and every one of them. Related Stories ‘The Things You Kill' Director Alireza Khatami Dares Audiences to ‘Almost Leave' His Exhilarating Canadian Oscar Entry Inside the First Square Peg Social: A Quietly Radical Gathering for Rising Filmmakers Some, like Gareth Evans' “A Colt Is My Passport,” are already in the can. Others, like Robert Downey Jr.'s “Vertigo,” are still in the “ominous threat” stage of development. But regardless as to whether they're right over the horizon or still just percolating in a series of cursed email chains, each of these remakes is misbegotten for the same reason: They're all based on objective masterpieces. “But David,” you might say, “isn't one's response to art an inherently subjective experience?” To which I would simply reply: “You are in no way entitled to your own wrong opinion about a movie where Josh Hartnett, Clea DuVall, and Elijah Wood save their high school from salt-phobic aliens while swagged out in late '90s Tommy Hilfiger.” So I guess that's three things these films all have in common? In short: Leave good movies alone and devote the same attention to remaking bad ones instead. In slightly less short: Forget the IP that people love with all their might, and focus instead on the IP that people recognize against their will. In an age where content is king and studios only exist to create shareholder value for their corporate overlords, executives have become so fixated on brand recognition that Disney would sooner bet $200 million — or more! The “Jurassic World” franchise notwithstanding, diminishing returns beget diminishing returns, and there's only so many times you can charge people top dollar for reheated leftovers of their favorite childhood meals before they lose their appetite altogether. What if you served those same people fresh and completely reformulated versions of the processed garbage they slopped up as kids (or even as grown adults who'd been conditioned not to expect any better)? What if you took the scraps of processed nostalgia, the kind of food that people fondly recall but would never eat again by choice, and challenged today's most inventive chefs to reimagine them for an audience whose palette has been starved of flavor for so long that they've forgotten the taste of a hot meal? If the faint whiff of a memory is all that's motivating people to pay for these movies (as producers and consumers), wouldn't it be more prudent to improve upon the past rather than risk constantly reinforcing the idea that the present is so much worse? It doesn't matter that “The Running Man” 1.0 isn't streaming anywhere, or that its limp TV satire of Reagan-era consumerism feels like ancient history, or even that our last remaining scientists are still trying to figure out how a movie featuring Yaphet Kotto, Jesse “the Body” Ventura, and homicidal ice hockey could still be so bland — the only thing that matters is that “The Running Man” as a three-word phrase has retained some vague and unquantifiable purchase over the last several decades. The casual pop consumer's brain recognizes it as “a real thing” in much the same way as the average executive's brain does, even if only by osmosis; for better or worse, it comes to both of them pre-installed with a credibility that original content has to earn on its own terms. A credibility that endures without being hamstrung by any real association to quality. In stark contrast to Hollywood's updated versions of “Robocop,” “Point Break,” and “The Day the Earth Stood Still” (to pick literally the first three movies that jumped to mind, all of them built on the reputations of unassailable classics), it's clear that Wright was committed to preserving the raw edges of his film's story rather than sanding them down, and even the least successful elements of his “Running Man” are strengthened by a sociopolitical anger that's rare to find in modern studio films of its size. Had the previous film made from King's book not been such an ineffective piece of satire, it's possible that a corporation as odious as Paramount Skynet — whose allegiance to The Network grows clearer every day — would never have rubber-stamped such an unambiguous “fuck you” to David Ellison's friends in our government. Of course, there are only so many bad movies that are ripe to be remade; only so many movies that are famous enough to feel like safe investments, but also flawed enough to guarantee that Hollywood executives will feel like creative geniuses for improving upon them. David Lowery's “Pete's Dragon” is one obvious choice; Steven Soderbergh's “Ocean's Eleven” perhaps a slightly more contentious pick. Again, there's a reason why the movie that felt best-suited as a peg for this article isn't actually a remake, although I suppose I could have waited a few weeks for Sony Pictures' new “Anaconda,” which sounds like a perfect test for what I'm talking about despite being framed as more of a meta reboot; no one has any particular attachment to the original (much as I'd argue that no movie where Jon Voight gets swallowed alive by a giant snake could ever be considered truly bad), but its title carries an ineffable weight of some kind, and the comforting familiarity it triggers is deepened by the sense that a new “Anaconda” is more likely to build on our collective memory of the old one than to tarnish it. Typically, however, remakes have only been made as backhanded compliments by directors who've seen room for improvement in their own work: Think Alfred Hitchcock revisiting “The Man Who Knew Too Much,” or Michael Mann evolving “L.A. More often, successful remakes have been created from beloved source material by people who had no previous relationship to it, but even these are few and far between. And then of course — with perhaps the highest hit-rate — there are those instances when people have seen the opportunity to rejigger a foreign-language film for an English-speaking audience (“The Departed,” “Sorcerer,” and Luca Guadagnino's “Suspiria,” which is not bad, as you might have mistakenly been led to believe, but in fact very good). At a time when most young people refuse to watch a video clip of Theo Von's podcast without having subtitles on, however, the transliteration model may not have the same currency that it once did (though widespread exposure to “Save the Green Planet!” is sadly not to blame for the underwhelming box office of “Bugonia”). I mean, we simply cannot afford to do another “Starship Troopers” while millions of people on Twitter are still failing to grasp the point of the original. But a new “Hackers” where Jenna Ortega or whatever leads a team of roller-blading computer nerds who steal billions in ill-gotten crypto from the president's large adult sons? “Conspiracy Theory” for the era of virulent rightwing message boards? You wouldn't even have to recast Mel Gibson. “Tango & Cash” but it's the Apple Dance and Tap-to-Pay? Everyone knows the future is going to be bad. But given the most plausible options left available to us, perhaps it's possible that bad might be our best hope for something better.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Duarte, who is known to his followers as ‘FoodWithBearHands,' tragically passed away, and his wife, Jessica, has now broken her silence. The news was initially announced on a GoFundMe created after Duarte's passing. “It is with a heavy heart that we share the sad news that Michael Duarte passed away in a horrible incident on Saturday, November 8th during his travel in Texas. Michael's death occurred just 3 short days after he and his wife celebrated their 9 year wedding anniversary,” the page said. Jessica posted a long message on her husband's social media page, paying tribute to the food influencer, while also sharing a photo of their family, as the two share a 6-year-old daughter named Oakley. “l've struggled with what to do since his passing so I'm doing what feels right and that's sharing his stories. Whether they be about his content or Mike as my husband, daddy and friend to all,” she wrote. “I feel so touched and proud to know so many people that he has inspired over his time here on earth. I plan to keep his legacy going not only for him but his family.He gave everyone every bit of him so it's my turn to give it back. I can feel him moving mountains❤️ a big thank you to my tribe & Mike's BBQ community for making me feel like I have an army behind me. I'm still struggling with the fact that he is no longer with us but l'm starting to see his purpose was SO much bigger. I'm starting to see God work in mysterious ways that l've never experienced before and hoping that will bring our family some peace,” she continued. This is an active investigation and I ask that all media and the public refrain from sharing unverified information,” she concluded. “Mike, I'm proud to be your wife and I will carry that title with honor for the rest of my life.

Shakira and her sons made a rare red carpet appearance together on Thursday, attending the “Zootopia 2” premiere in Los Angeles. 

The trio made a colorful statement in coordinated lavender outfits. Milan, 12, and Sasha Piqué Mebarak, 10, twinned in custom purple tuxedos with matching bow ties and bright white sneakers while mom, Shakira, wore a high-neck, long-sleeve dress in the same hue, featuring an asymmetric hemline with a high left leg line that revealed strappy purple satin heels below.

Her long hair was in a high ponytail with two strands framing her face.

The singer is finishing up her “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran” tour, which began last February and ends on Dec. 11.

Shakira doesn't frequent red carpet events, so it's particularly sweet that she not only brought her sons but also coordinated all their high-fashion looks for the family-friendly screening.

Last year, she shared that taking her sons to “Barbie” was a bust, saying that they “absolutely hated” it. 

Hopefully, “Zootopia 2” was more of a hit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With her nose ring, blue hair streaks, and tattoos that extend from her shoulders to her fingertips, DJ Tori is, in the words of her boss, “every guy's fantasy of what a rock chick would look like.” In that regard, she's the logical personality to crank Pearl Jam, Shinedown, or Stabbing Westward songs during her overnight and weekend shifts at a hard-rock radio station in Hiawatha, Iowa. Every so often, Tori will mispronounce the name of the vintage alt-rock band Live — so that it rhymes with “give” — or talk about a pairing of artists and say “feat” instead of “featuring.” But her listeners and her station, KFMW Rock 108, just roll with it, since DJ Tori isn't likely to get fired anytime soon. AI continues to infiltrate the music business: Fake photos of aging rockers in hospitals flood Facebook, artificial bands like Velvet Sundown are streaming on Spotify, and a computer-generated R&B artist, Xania Monet, has a song that's charting. Radio — especially nonsatellite terrestrial stations in whatever city or town you live — is now becoming the next artificial frontier. “But AI is learning every day, and once they get that worked out, there will be a lot of people out of work long term. DJ Tori, which launched last year, is just one of many examples of the way AI has begun creeping into radio or radio-like sites. We still need improv and human banter on what's happening in a city. On traditional radio, one person could talk to the host at a time. With our radio, you can have 1,000 conversations at the same time about one segment.” Last month, radio industry veterans announced the startup of SonicTrek.ai, where AI versions of genre experts will play and talk about classic rock, country, alternative rock, or current hits, with geographically oriented playlists to boot. Those hosts' voices will also chat about local weather and businesses. “We're not trying to pull the wool over anybody's eyes,” says SonicTrek.ai co-founder Mike Agovino. We will deliver talent and content that can interact with listeners on a one-to-one basis, and do it 24/7, 365 days a year, with unlimited endurance. You could never do that with live air talent. You could never have the audience interacting all day long, talking about artists, eras of music, best albums ever, whatever the topic or format might be. In a document shared with Rolling Stone, Audacy — which owns more than 200 stations around the country — asked an undetermined number of on-air employees to sign a contract that would give the company the rights, “in perpetuity,” to create “a computer-generated electronic representation or digital replica that is readily identifiable as the voice or visual likeness of Employee,” among other things. Audacy declined to comment, but according to a source close to the situation, it is “not the company's policy to clone or replicate a talent's voice without their permission, and the company has no plans to do so without their specific permission.” (SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents disc jockeys as well as actors, singers, dancers, and other performing professionals, declined comment on the matter.) This Spiral-Obsessed AI ‘Cult' Spreads Mystical Delusions Through Chatbots People Are Using Racist ‘AI Slopaganda' to Fuel ‘Welfare Queen' Stereotypes But He's Definitely a Sign of Our Bleak Reality AI is “gimmicky right now, but it's on its way to becoming a threat,” says one veteran DJ who, like many contacted by Rolling Stone, would only speak anonymously for fear of reprisals. “Until people start legitimately losing jobs, they're just putting it in the background of their minds. SEVERAL YEARS AGO, HUDSON HOTT, then a leading DJ at the L.A. rock station Alt 98.7, received an unsolicited letter offering to turn her personality and traits into AI versions. She never followed up, but others saw the potential. The generally acknowledged first AI DJ launched two years ago, when Ashley Elzinga, a jock at a station in Traverse City, Michigan, was approached about replicating her voice with AI for KBFF in Portland, Oregon. After being reassured that the technology wasn't meant to replace her — “it was just meant to enhance what we were doing,” she says — Elzinga signed on. With the help of RadioGPT from Futuri, a leading AI content company, Elzinga began reading prompts and was asked questions by the company's software. From there, it was about fine-tuning each inflection and how I say words. My first reaction was, ‘Why does it sound like that?' And they had to tell me, ‘You have a Michigan accent.' “You can't replicate the human touch and spontaneity,” says Hott. For anyone driving in their car, we were all experiencing that together. “They were like, ‘I got through and won something.' The same company that worked on AI Ashley also reached out to Russ Mottla, program director at Iowa's KFMW Rock 108, who was intrigued and heard a sample of how a female AI jock could sound. But it gave us the opportunity to talk about something everybody's talking about — ‘We have an AI DJ too' — and make promos making fun of her. But we're claiming the position, as they say.” A local gun shop, Midwest Shooting, became an on-air sponsor and even hosted an appearance by DJ Tori in the store — a photo of “her” attached to a mannequin. As Mottla insists, “We're not hiding anything from the audience. In their defense, those who've turned to AI or are experimenting with it on radio argue that it's a remedy for companies and stations that use pretaped or syndicated shows during off hours or can't afford overnight DJs. “There are fewer and fewer shifts done live,” says veteran New York-area DJ Dennis Elsas, who hosts shows on SiriusXM and WFUV, a noncommercial public station. “More often than not, the overnight time after midnight is pretaped.” SonicTrek.ai's Agovino insist his fledgling company's goal, once it gets up and running, isn't to “replace the successful midday jock” but to instead focus on local stations in smaller markets that use satellite feeds or voice tracking to fill up their airtime. “We built this as a strategy for radio stations that have, for whatever their rationale was at the time, drifted away from live and local,” he says. But as the technology improves and as the standards lower over time, we're not far away from something like that being on major stations. “The audience is way more perceptive about subtle changes in personality than you might think,” says talent agent Paul Anderson of Workhouse Media, which represents numerous podcast and radio hosts. And when you spend multiple hours a day listening to them while stuck in traffic, you can pick up on all those subtle intonations. How Lady Gaga Found Herself Again: ‘I Feel Lucky to Be Alive' Billie Eilish Calls Out ‘Pathetic Coward' Elon Musk for Hoarding Wealth During Global Crises How the Rolling Stones Found Their Third Act With ‘Black and Blue' But he felt the time had come to wrap it up after two years. But I don't know if, moving forward, an AI DJ is going to have a place on radio. As a society, we like AI but not when it comes to human connection.” Then again, no one denies how fast the technology is moving, and how “much more likelife,” in Agovino's words, AI voices now sound. “If they can make this kind of progress in 24 months, I can't imagine what it's going to be like in another two years.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's an old internet adage often incorrectly attributed to Nintendo guru Shigeru Miyamoto that goes, “A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.” Although it's not a genuine quote, the oft-used meme does mostly align with what fans perceive to be the Mario creator's sensibilities — do it right, even if it takes a while. Famously, the company's creatives have been blunt when it comes to explaining why beloved series like Star Fox and F-Zero have remained on ice for decades at a time: They just don't know what to do with them. Compared to Rockstar or  Ubisoft — hell, most of the industry — it paints a clear picture that if you've even heard of a Nintendo game's existence, it's probably pretty far along in its development cycle. Two years later, after the internet worked itself into a tizzy, Nintendo officially confirmed that development on the game wasn't up to their standards. Now, another six years later, the game is nearing completion and is set to launch on Dec. 4 for both Switch and its successor, Switch 2. Rolling Stone recently attended a preview event in New York City to go hands-on with Metroid Prime 4's early areas, and the most realistic answer is “maybe?” Based on the roughly one-hour demo, here's what we know. This section sees Samus arriving at a Galactic Federation station to help combat an invasion of pirates led by Sylux, who is seeking a mysterious relic. This introductory portion is entirely on-rails, ushering Samus room to room for small incursions while serving as a basic tutorial for her combat abilities and Morph Ball rolling. In most Metroid games, Samus is a loner; the series itself was inspired by Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), meaning that the bounty hunter generally sees herself stranded on an alien planet to survive. Occasionally, certain games will give her support from NPCs via comms, but rarely is she engaging in squad-based warfare. ‘The Super Mario Galaxy Movie' Trailer Reveals Brie Larson's Rosalina ‘Lumines Arise' Is a Trippy Puzzle Game Beamed Into Your Eyeballs ‘Dispatch' Episodes 5 and 6: Don't Get Drunk With Your Supervillain Co-workers But being a superpowered Amazonian type, towering over the solders in height and physical prowess, she's seen more as a messianic savior than just another grunt. After this brief sequence that ends in a relatively easy boss fight, the demo jumps ahead past a bunch of exposition and story set up (all of which are under wraps at Nintendo's request). This lush jungle environment is pretty different from anything seen in other Metroid games, which may have had biomes with vegetation and foliage, but never to this degree. In Metroid Prime 4, they're mostly based on new psychic powers. Like in Prime games past, the first-person perspective allows players to comb the world using a scanning visor, which highlights pertinent information and clues on where to go next. In Prime 4, this is augmented by a Psychic Visor which, paired with the Psychic Glove, lets Samus see invisible trails and objects and manipulate them with a form of telekinesis. It mostly works for puzzles; simple ones include unlocking doors with specific sliding nodes, with more complexity coming later as Samus can guide a Control Beam blast through the air like a remote drone. The preview culminates in a big boss fight wherein Samus must whittle away at the plant-like foe's armor then guide her psychic shots into its weak points. It's a cool gimmick but doesn't entirely feel revolutionary. Not only did the entire life cycle of the Switch (its intended home platform) pass by, but first-person shooters and exploration games have evolved. Open world titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018) and a wave of action-RPGs have broadened the horizons on what exploration looks like in modern gaming. But even by Metroid standards, the areas in Fury Green are extremely linear. In the series' best entries, like Super Metroid (1994) and the first Prime, players are dropped into sprawling worlds that are mazelike in their design. Filled with competing routes, dead ends, and challenges to return to later, there's a sense that every step is filled with discovery. Had I not stopped to take notes or comb every room for secrets, the demo would've been quick to breeze through, even without any prior experience playing Metroid. In 2021, Metroid Dread brought the franchise back to 2D on Switch, and it felt like a course correction for how easy the games had become post-Prime 2. While not quite the brain buster the early entries were, Dread leaned into its roots as an explorable puzzle in ways that could leave newer players scratching their heads, and its combat was tough as nails. Its pathways are narrow, funneling players between relatively easy enemy encounters and puzzles with obvious solutions. Another reversion that, for now, seems ill-advised is pairing Samus up with other characters. The first scene with Mackenzie has Samus rescuing him from a horde of aliens, followed quickly by an escort mission — one of the most agonizing cliches in gaming. Their dialogue (or lack thereof on Samus' part) has funny moments. Nintendo has learned that the bounty hunter's most affecting personality trait is remaining a mute goliath who handles nuisances — from chatty scientists to roaring monsters — with annoyed nonchalance. The recurring joke here is that Mackenzie talks a lot and Samus doesn't. It's hard to say how much of a presence characters like Mackenzie will have in the larger story, but Nintendo learned firsthand how detrimental poorly written NPCs and forced interactions can be with 2010's abysmal Metroid: Other M. That game, which fans would kill to forget, turned the series into a Ninja Gaiden-like third-person action title, but its worst crimes were in the painful dialogue and dumb-as-rocks story. There's some great lighting, too, with bloom effects and glints of sunbeams peering through Samus' visor, as well as the return of the occasional reflection of her face in the helmet's glass (a detail that blew fans' collective minds back in 2002). Waterfalls lack complex physics, mostly appearing as flat sheets with some misting to cover up the seams. The game runs very smoothly — even hitting up to 120 frames per second in performance mode — but it doesn't feel like much of a leap forward. It's a game that was clearly designed to run on the now-geriatric Nintendo Switch, which results in a game that aesthetically lags behind its Switch 2-exclusive peers like Donkey Kong Bananza. How Lady Gaga Found Herself Again: ‘I Feel Lucky to Be Alive' Billie Eilish Calls Out ‘Pathetic Coward' Elon Musk for Hoarding Wealth During Global Crises How the Rolling Stones Found Their Third Act With ‘Black and Blue' Nitpicking aside, it's a small miracle that Metroid Prime 4 exists at all. Metroid has never been one of the company's best-sellers; it's an IP that they've invested in to keep their hardcore fans happy in between higher grossing fare.

Danny Glover and Maya Rudolph also get thanks in the closing credits. In his new feature, the black-and-white Trillion, filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky tells a minimalist story, but he is hoping for maximum impact. Described as “a cinematic and wordless interpretation of the Myth of Sisyphus” in collaboration with an artist using the name K49814, Trillion world premieres Sunday in the Envision Competition of this year's International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA). Its executive producers include none other than Joaquin Phoenix, along with Susan Rockefeller, Frank Lehmann, Fridrik Mar and Kaja Bjelke. Welcome to 'Versalles,' Where a Mexican Politician and His Wife Reinvent Themselves as Monarchs (Exclusive Tallinn Clip) Given Kossakovsky's past work, though, you know that he will want to make us aware of something profound and make us think about it. '” And it explains the filmmaker's hope for the impact of Trillion this way: “Provoking deeply relevant questions about the meaning and purpose of life in a time when all sentient beings face existential threat.” Kossakovsky has made a splash with such recent works as Gunda (2020), about a pig and her piglets that was the first film in his “empathy trilogy,” which Phoenix also executive produced. And when the closing credits roll, Danny Glover and Maya Rudolph are among the other big Hollywood names mentioned in a “thank you” section. So, what exactly is this woman in Trillion doing? “In the last frame, you know why it's called Trillion and what it is about.” (THR will for now not spoil further details.) “People waiting on the red carpet for George Clooney.” Kossakovsky says that “every film I make, I'm trying to make differently in form.” But he has earned a reputation for using narrative images more than dialogue. “I'm not using many words in my movies,” he acknowledges. We are able to look at someone and read that other person. He adds: “We understand the world not through voiceovers and talking heads. Watching Trillion, audiences will see images and movement, but “in a way, nothing much is happening,”  Kossakovsky offers. My duty was [to make sure] that you sit and watch until the end.” And he quips: “That's why I trick people. I use this dramatic music” in parts of the film. The director shares that his distinct approach to documentary filmmaking means he also tends to be notably affected by his projects. “Some people make documentaries in order to teach someone something,” Kossakovsky explains. “And that's why they use a voiceover to tell you something. I'm making films in order to become a different person.” Asked about his empathy trilogy, Kossakovsky tells THR: “I decided to to make three films about something we don't pay attention to.” In Gunda, he tackled that in this way: “We don't pay attention to pigs. “He watched Gunda, and he immediately called me and said, ‘Finally, someone made a film about pigs, not about us humans,'” Kossakovsky recalls. “He watched it and said, ‘I want to support such movies. '” Now, the actor is back on board for Trillions. “And I hope Joaquin Phoenix will be part of it as well.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Miles Teller has opened up a bit about one of the more distressing moments of his entire career: The way his efforts, post-Whiplash, to fully embrace the Hollywood leading man stereotype (i.e., by getting himself his own superhero franchise) collided full-on with the disaster surrounding 2015's Fantastic Four. Specifically (per Variety), Teller talked to Andy Cohen on Sirius XM this week about the flop, saying that, “Honestly, maybe there was one really important person who kind of fucked it all up.” Fantastic Four was, after all, dogged for months by rumors of conflict between director Josh Trank and pretty much everybody else on set—including Teller, who supposedly nearly got into a full-on fist fight with his director over clashing personalities. Everybody tried to make nice in public as the film's August 2015 premiere approached, with Trank notably doing damage control with producer and writer Simon Kinberg, hoping to dispel rumors he'd been fired from his own movie in all but name. And, again, Teller himself was classy enough not to get into any of this well-known superhero movie lore, beyond pointing out the singular nature of the culprit for his movie's famed fucking up. (He does note that “When I first saw the movie, I remember talking to one of the studio heads and said, ‘I think we're in trouble,'” which suggests that he was not as enamored with Trank's initial, reportedly much more somber, cut of the film than the director himself was.) The actor mostly just sounds kind of wistful at the missed opportunity, saying of his co-stars (which included Kate Mara, Toby Kebbell, Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan) that “The casting, I thought, was spectacular.

Si Bad Bunny era el gran favorito, Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso fueron la sorpresa. Además, los productores de su galardonado álbum, Rafa Arcaute y Federico Vindver, se alzaron con el premio al productor del año, compartiendo el galardón con Nico Cotton en un empate. Más temprano, en la Premiere del Latin Grammy, Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso (cuyos nombres reales son Catriel Guerreiro y Ulises Guerriero, sin parentesco entre ellos) recogieron premios vestidos con conjuntos de seda estampados, los mismos que usaron para su presentación. “A nuestras madres, Estrella y Andrea, que son las culpables de todo esto”, dijo. Irónicamente, ni Bad Bunny ni Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso ganaron grabación o canción del Año, dos categorías en las que los Latin Grammys, inexplicablemente, los hicieron competir contra sí mismos con dos canciones de un mismo álbum, prácticamente asegurando que se anularan entre ellos. Edgar Barrera también se alzó con tres galardones, al igual que Natalia Lafourcade, quien ganó mejor álbum cantautor por Cancionera. Pero, conforme avanzaba la noche, avanzaron las actuaciones, empezando por Rauw Alejandro, quien presentó un medley de canciones respaldado por sus propios bailarines y banda, con una deslumbrante producción escénica y una interpretación vocal sobresaliente. En su emotivo discurso tras ganar el premio a canción del año, Karol G pidió “por favor no me corten” porque tenía algo importante que decir. Cuando uno se olvida del otro, lo único que queda es la pasión”. “Baile Inolvidable”, Bad Bunny; Big Jay, Elikai, Julito Gaston, La Paciencia & Mag, productores; Antonio Caraballo, Luis Amed Irizarry, Armando López & Roberto Rosado, ingenieros;

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You win when they call you a liar, and it usually doesn't take that long: After all, we're talking about a post-apocalyptic walking simulator where Norman Reedus plays the world's most badass mailman, hogtying obsessive package thieves and launching himself out of cannons. Where major characters are played by motion-captured copies of Guillermo Del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn. Where you fend off ghosts by throwing grenades filled with your main character's magical pee, while he carries a canteen that automatically fills itself back up with Monster brand energy drink. We haven't even gotten to the part where the Norman Reedus character talks glowingly about how riding a motorcycle is just like watching AMC's Ride With Norman Reedus! This is per THR, which reports that Kojima has apparently signed with Disney to make a Disney+ animated series, Death Stranding Isolations, set in the world of the show, and which we can only assume will also be suitably bonkers. Featuring 2D animation (courtesy of Japanese studio E&H Production), the show will apparently center on a man and a woman going on a journey in the world of Kojima's games, where humanity screwed everything up for itself by reaching out to the realm of death, opening a door that's caused deadly time-accelerating rain called timefall to blanket the earth. and lethal ghosts to prowl the vast stretches of countryside now abandoned by humanity. In announcing the show, Metal Gear creator Kojima—who's also working on a film adaptation of the series with A24, and has long held ludicrously unsubtle desires to break into his beloved worlds of TV and film—stated that his goal was to bring the story of his games to people who don't play video games.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I'd brave any weather 'cause nothing is better than being together again," the rivals-turned-friends sing to each other in the festive new song. From the fiery summer release of ZOMBIES 4: Dawn of the Vampires to the icy winter melody of “Snow Angels,” Freya Skye and Malachi Barton are back together again. Skye's Nova and Barton's Victor started out on opposite sides of an ancient fight as members of the rival Daywalkers and Vampires, respectively, in the fourth ZOMBIES installment that came out in July, but in the snow-dusted music video for “Snow Angels” — premiering exclusively on Billboard Family below — they're realizing the holidays are so much better when they're together. Later in the tune, they sing in harmony: “I'd brave any weather 'cause nothing is better than being together again.” In the visual, they both harness their powers — Nova's solar flares and Victor's night winds — to conjure a flurry of snow. The “Snow Angels” song will be available across all digital music platforms first thing Friday (Nov. 14) at midnight ET, while the music video hits Disney+ and DisneyMusicVevo at 3 a.m. ET, which will help kick off the network's “Fa-La-La-Lidays” holiday programming. 1 on Billboard‘s Kid Albums chart (dated July 26) and also bowed at No. 2 and ZOMBIES 3 (2022) spent two weeks at No. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

It doesn't solve any ‘problem' — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
