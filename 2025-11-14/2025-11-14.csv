            Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday, according to state media, more than a week later than their scheduled landing, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris hit left their spaceship with a cracked window.
    


            After the capsule hatch opened medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported.
    


            The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China's Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they'd even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.
    


            But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
    


            After a nine-day wait, they finally headed home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
    


            The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.
    


            During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.
    


            The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China's Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.
    


            Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a nine-hour sortie, and it's about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.
    


            The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China's youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.
    


            The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.
    


            China's rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed bans on Chinese citizens with US visas participating in NASA programs.
    


            The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts stuck in space. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned. They eventually returned home in March.
    


            Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.

            More than half a million people in South Korea sat for the country's grueling university entrance exam on Thursday as police mobilized to ensure they made it to the test sites on time and all flights were halted for half an hour.
    


            The number sitting the test, essential to secure a place at the country's top universities, was the highest in seven years. Most of the candidates were born in 2007 when there was a surge in births because it was considered an auspicious time to have a baby.
    


            Flights at all airports, including Incheon International Airport, were banned from landing or takeoff between 1:05 p.m. and 1:40 p.m. to ensure there was no disturbance while the students sat for the listening comprehension section of the English test.
    


            The decision affected 140 flights, including 65 international arrivals and departures. Flight trackers showed aircraft circling near airports as the Transport Ministry restricted aircraft from altitudes below 3,000 meters (9843 ft).
    


            Financial markets and offices opened an hour later than usual to ensure test candidates arrived on time for the nine-hour exam that is seen as crucial for success in the hyper-competitive society.
    


            “This exam has been a goal for nearly 20 years and also a new beginning,” said Yeseon Kim, who was waiting outside a test site where her daughter was sitting the exam.
    


            A total of 554,174 people registered this year, up 6% from last year and the highest since 2019. Some 496,000 babies were born in 2007 in a jump that paused a steady decline since the mid-1990s.
    


            South Korea is one of the world's fastest-aging societies, although its birthrate rose to 0.75 in 2024.

            The Israeli government identified the deceased hostage whose remains were handed over by Hamas on Thursday as Manny Godard, 73, an Israeli resident of a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip.
    


            Godard and his wife Ayelet were killed during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israeli communities near the Strip. His body was then taken to Gaza.
    


            During the attack, Godard and his wife hid in the safe room of their home in Be'eri Kibbutz. They later fled after their house was set on fire, and the attackers “ambushed them outside,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Thursday. After the father of four was killed, “Ayelet hid in the bushes for several hours before she was also murdered,” the forum added.
    


            Godard spent his childhood on Israeli beaches alongside his father, who was a lifeguard, the forum said. Later, Godard also became a lifeguard, the group said.
    


            Israel's National Center of Forensic Medicine confirmed his identity after his remains were released by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross and then turned over to Israeli authorities. The handover leaves three remaining deceased hostages in the Gaza Strip.
    


            Israel is “determined, committed and tirelessly working to bring back all of our fallen hostages for a proper burial in their homeland,” the prime minister's office said in a statement announcing the identification of Godard.
    


            In a transfer that was part of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement, Israel earlier said it received a coffin containing the remains via the Red Cross in Gaza and transported them to Israel's national forensics laboratory for identification. Hamas did not identify which of the last few deceased hostages it was handing over.
    


            Hamas' military wing said earlier Thursday that it would hand over the body of an Israeli found near Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
    


            This release of remains comes after a series of such transfers last week, including that of the longest-held deceased hostage in Gaza. On Sunday, Hamas handed over the remains of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in the final days of a 2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas. The transfer of Goldin's remains was the fifth such occurrence in little more than a week, bringing Hamas down to the final few deceased hostages still in Gaza.
    


Israeli intelligence has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. But Hamas has continued to search for remains in different parts of Gaza.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has continued to organize rallies in Tel Aviv and elsewhere across Israel calling for the release of the remaining deceased hostages.
    


            Eitan Horn, who was recently freed after 738 days in captivity, said in Hostages Square last weekend: “I cannot begin my journey of healing and recovery as long as I know there are families who are not with me on this journey. We have no future without the return of all the hostages.”
    


            Other freed hostages have expressed the same sentiment, saying they cannot begin to heal until all of the hostages – living and deceased – have returned home.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro has denounced the US strikes on alleged cartel vessels in the Caribbean Sea as the Pentagon announced a new operation to fight drug traffickers.

Colombia has historically cooperated with the US on security matters, particularly in dealing with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government and fighting drug trafficking, although their policy alignment has recently shifted under Petro, a former M-19 Marxist guerrilla. 

In an interview with NBC News, Petro did not mince words when criticizing US President Donald Trump. “He's a barbarian,” Petro said in excerpts aired Thursday. “He wants to frighten us,” he added.

The Colombian president did not rule out that some of the vessels hit by the strikes were linked to cartels. “Maybe or maybe not. We do not know,” he said, adding that, “According to due process, the civilized treatment of people, they should be seized and detained.”

Petro described the victims as “poor boatmen” hired by cartels. “Then when one of those missiles arrives [it] kills that boatman. It doesn't kill the drug trafficker,” he said. He previously said that at least some of the victims were ordinary fishermen not involved with organized crime.

The US imposed sanctions on Petro last month after Trump labeled him “a drug leader.” Colombia restricted intelligence-sharing with the US this week, although Interior Minister Armando Benedetti later clarified that Bogota would continue cooperating with US federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI.

The US has hit at least 20 boats since September, killing an estimated 80 people. US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth announced Thursday the launch of Operation Southern Spear against “narcoterrorists” in the region.

CNN reported that as part of the operation, Trump had been briefed on target options in Venezuela; he has accused Maduro of helping cartels smuggle drugs into the US.

LONDON, November 14. /TASS/. The British intelligence services and the military have stopped providing the United States with intelligence on the movement of ships in the Caribbean on recommendation of Attorney General for England and Wales Richard Hermer, The Times reported citing sources.

According to them, Hermer fears an international lawsuit against the UK over its involvement in the US strikes on ships in the Caribbean. Earlier, the British shared with the Americans the coordinates of the boats, on which drugs were allegedly transported, as well as data on the number of people on board. CNN was the first to report on November 12 that the United Kingdom had stopped providing the intelligence.

According to the newspaper, the recommendations indicated that the UK had signed up to stricter rules of conduct in international waters than the United States, and could be considered complicit in what the UN called ""extrajudicial executions.""

The government declined to comment saying only that the United States remains Britain's closest partner in defense, security and intelligence matters.

Washington accuses Venezuela of not actively fighting drug smuggling. The US Navy has deployed eight ships, one nuclear submarine, and more than 10,000 troops in the Caribbean Sea and is destroying high-speed boats in international waters, allegedly involved in drug smuggling from Venezuela.

According to The New York Times, US President Donald Trump has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela. The American media has repeatedly reported that the United States may soon begin attacking drug cartel facilities in Venezuela. However, on October 31, Trump said he was not considering attacks on Venezuelan territory.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

STOCKHOLM, November 14. /TASS/. Swedish TV channel SVT, like the British broadcasting corporation BBC, edited Donald Trump's speech of January 6, 2021 to create the impression that he was calling for riots, Kvartal newspaper reported.

According to the newspaper, last year SVT used an excerpt from Trump's speech, which spliced several parts in one of the reports in such a way that it appeared to the audience that Trump was in favor of storming the Capitol. Like in the BBC version, a fragment where he calls on his supporters to peacefully and patriotically express their opinions was dropped.

In the first response to Kvartal's request for comment on how the speech was edited, SVT responded that the TV channel's owners were ""confident in SVT's publications dedicated to the storming of the Capitol."" But later SVT changed the text and the clip, where black frames with pauses between different parts of the performance were added. Executive producer Karin Ekman said that SVT has updated the text of the clip ""to make it clearer to the audience in what context it was published."" She does not believe that the scandal with the BBC will affect SVT's credibility.

Norwegian TV channel NRK has also changed the story about Capitol storming previously presented similarly, explains SVT.

The BBC was at the center of a scandal over a Panorama program, which the broadcasting corporation aired last October. In it, Trump's speech was doctored in a way that it can be concluded that he is calling for the seizure of the Congress building. The scandal forced CEO Tim Davey and head of news Deborah Turness to resign. Trump demanded that the BBC remove the program by November 14, apologize and pay compensation, threatening to sue for $1 billion. The corporation apologized, but refused to pay compensation.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

SEOUL, November 14. /TASS/. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui has denounced the appeal of the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) states to denuclearize calling it hostile machinations, according to the Central Telegraphic Agency of Korea (KCNA).

""I express my complete dissatisfaction and regret over the outright hostile machinations of the G7 foreign ministers, which are a direct encroachment on the constitution of our state,"" she said, referring to a joint G7 foreign ministers' statement issued after their meeting in Canada.

North Korean nuclear status is specified in its constitution.

She called the G7's desire for denuclearization a manifestation of ""inertia of thought"" because the international community ""understands its impossibility.""

""No one has the right to force us to violate the constitution, and no one can try to change it,"" Choe Son Hui said.

""The current status of the DPRK will not change under the influence of external rhetoric and insistence, in today's harsh geopolitical environment, the possession of nuclear weapons is the most accurate choice to deter the most dangerous states.""

Choe Son Hui called on the international community to pay attention to the threat to peace and security from the Group of Seven, which she called a ""nuclear alliance."" She reiterated that North Korea will possess nuclear weapons until ""the nuclear threat from external forces is put an end to, as long as there are forces that consider nuclear weapons to be a means of their tyranny.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Investigation by Guardian and Carbon Brief finds just a fifth of funds to fight global heating went to poorest 44 countries

China and wealthy petrostates including Saudi Arabia and UAE are among countries receiving large sums of climate finance, according to an analysis.

The Guardian and Carbon Brief analysed previously unreported submissions to the UN, along with data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), that show how billions of dollars of public money is being committed to the fight against global heating.

The investigation found a broadly functioning system that shifts capital from rich polluters to vulnerable nations, helping them clean their economies and adapt to a hotter world.

But it also found that because the distribution of the largest part of the funds had no central oversight and was entirely at the discretion of individual countries, it was subject to political interests and not always directed where it was most needed.

Although official data is not extensive enough to trace all the recipients of climate finance, the Guardian analysis found that about a fifth of the funding in 2021 and 2022 went to the world's 44 poorest countries, known as the least developed countries (LDCs). Much of that was in the form of loans, rather than grants.

Some LDCs received more than two-thirds of their climate finance in the form of loans, whose repayment terms can push governments further into debt traps. The share of loans rose to 95% or more in the cases of Bangladesh and Angola.

Most of the world's developed countries provide finance to support climate action in developing ones, bilaterally and through multilateral organisations such as development banks. At a UN summit in Copenhagen in 2009, rich countries promised to mobilise $100bn (£76bn) a year by 2020 in recognition of their greater responsibility for climate breakdown and ability to fund solutions.

But the analysis of the most recent submissions, covering more than 20,000 global projects during 2021 and 2022 – the year in which the Copenhagen target was belatedly met, found that vast sums were going to petrostates, as well as to China, the world's second-largest economy.

UAE, a fossil fuel exporter with a GDP per capita on a par with France and Canada, received more than $1bn in loans from Japan that were logged as climate finance. The projects include $625m for an offshore electricity transmission project in Abu Dhabi and $452m for a waste incinerator in Dubai.

Saudi Arabia, which is one of the top 10 carbon emitters thanks to its giant oilfields and majority-ownership of Aramco, received about $328m in Japanese loans, including $250m to its electricity company and $78m for a solar farm.

Six countries in the Balkans that hope to join the EU received more than $3.5bn in climate finance. The bulk of the money went to Serbia, which on a per capita basis received 10 times more money than the LDCs.

European recipients of climate finance included an EU member state, Romania, which received an $8m grant from the US for an engineering study to build a small modular nuclear reactor.

Joe Thwaites, a climate finance advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said overall flows of climate finance were increasing but “not enough” was getting to the poorest and most vulnerable communities, with debt-distressed countries needing more grants and concessional loans.

“This is not charity,” he said. “It is a strategic investment that addresses the root causes of many of the crises we see daily: cost of living, supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, forced migration and conflict.”

Over the two years under consideration, about $33bn was committed to the LDCs, which include Haiti, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Yemen.

A much larger sum of money – about $98bn – went to developing countries, a broader group that includes lower middle-income countries such as India and upper middle-income countries such as China. Another $32bn could not be classified. India was the single largest recipient of finance over the reporting period, receiving about $14bn, while China received $3bn, mostly from multilateral banks.

The analysis suggests the underrepresentation of the LDCs reflects their smaller population size, but the makeup of the developing country group is a growing source of tension at climate negotiations.

China's economy, for instance, has boomed since the UN classified it as developing in the 1990s, and its emissions have surpassed European levels on a per capita basis. China is thought to be a significant provider of finance to foreign climate projects but has resisted efforts to formally count its contributions. The UN's development categories have not changed since they were drawn up in 1992.

“That allows countries such as Israel, Korea, Qatar, Singapore and UAE – all of which have become wealthy nations with large carbon footprints over the last 30 years – to shirk their international responsibilities,” said Sarah Colenbrander, climate director at the Overseas Development Institute. “It is absurd that such nations remain in the same category as countries like Togo, Tonga and Tanzania.”

Some of the world's poorest countries receive more than two-thirds of their climate finance in the form of loans, despite warnings that many cannot afford the terms and interest repayments.

“The hidden story of climate finance is not in the volume of commitments, but in their forms,” said Ritu Bharadwaj, climate finance director at the International Institute for Environment and Development.

“Climate finance is increasing the financial burden on poorer nations. Even if the money donated is a concessional loan, those loans do also come with conditions which might benefit the lender more than the recipient.”

Data from the World Bank shows that over the same period, LDCs have together repaid almost $91.3bn in external debts – three times their climate finance budgets. Over the past decade, repayments of external debts of the poorest nations have trebled, from $14.3bn in 2012 to $46.5bn in 2022.

“Conventional thinking is that taking on more debt isn't bad if it is being used to fund growth-enhancing expenditure,” said Shakira Mustapha, a finance expert at the Centre for Disaster Protection. “My concern is whether countries are just taking on new debt to repay old debt and we are just kicking the can down the road.”

The foreign ministries of China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and UAE did not respond to a request for comment.

The Guardian and Carbon Brief analysis on climate finance includes the bilateral and multilateral public funding that developed nations have committed for climate projects in developing countries. The analysis excludes other types of funding that contribute to the $100bn target for climate projects such as private donations and export credits.

Data for the multilateral funding comes from the OECD. The bilateral funding comes from the Biennial Transparency Report each country submits to the UN framework convention on climate change. Due to the lag in official reporting, the most recent figures go up only to 2022.

As only annex II countries (23 industrialised nations and the EU) are responsible for contributing to the $100bn target, the analysis of the bilateral files was restricted to these nations. Likewise, using OECD methodology, we calculated the share of multilateral climate finance which is attributable to this group.

We also calculated the shares of multilateral finance that can be attributed to individual donor countries, based on shareholdings in multilateral development banks and cumulative contributions to multilateral climate funds. This is based on a methodology that has been used by analysts at the World Resources Institute and ODI.

The analysis classified the recipients of the bilateral projects using the UN country classification. But many projects remain unclassified because the recipients are not specified, are reported as “multi-country”, or are part of a group of countries for which the funding cannot be disaggregated.

These projects have not been included when calculating the amount of finance that individual developing countries received, but they are included in the total figures.

A spokesperson for UN Climate Change said: “The inequities revealed in climate finance flows highlight why a shift in the global financial system is urgently needed. Treating climate finance as charity has held back the progress the world needs, as has treating it purely as a cost and ignoring the massive human and economic dividends it pays.”

The original $100bn target is being replaced this year with a new target for developed countries to provide $300bn a year by 2035, with a wider goal of mobilising $1.3tn a year. Last week, the heads of the two most recent UN climate summits published a report that explored ways of sustainably raising the cash that included taxes on fossil fuels and climate-resilient debt clauses. It also called for an expansion of concessional and grant-based climate finance.

“Climate finance must be accessible, affordable, and fair,” the UN Climate Change spokesperson said. “The fact that many of the world's lowest-income countries face barriers and still rely on high-interest loans for climate finance underscores the urgency of reform.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Reaction follows Wall Street's worst day in a month and unprecedented slump in investment in China

Business live – latest updates

Global markets have fallen after a tech sell-off that fuelled Wall Street's worst day in a month and weak economic data in China showing an unprecedented slump in investment.

Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei fell 1.8% on Friday, South Korea's Kospi plunged 2.6% and there was a 1.5% fall in Australia, after a torrid day on Wall Street as Nvidia and other tech companies tumbled over valuation concerns.

Nvidia, the $4.5tn (£3.4tn) tech company, led a wider sector decline, falling 3.6% as investors reassessed the value of companies involved in the AI sector after Japan's SoftBank sold its entire stake in the company.

SoftBank and SK Hynix, a Chinese chipmaker for mobiles and computers, fell more than 6%, Samsung Electronics dropped 4% and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company dropped 1.8%.

Global markets also reacted to fears of a slowdown in the Chinese economy after data showed that activity cooled more than expected at the start of the final quarter of the year.

Figures showed that fixed-asset investment shrank 1.7% in the first 10 months, a record decline, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

China's CSI 300 fell 0.7%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.9% and Taiwan's Taiex slumped by 1.4%.

US markets were also jittery over the impact on the economy of the world's largest market over the longest federal government shutdown in history.

The shutdown has forced the government to put the release of data on inflation and jobs on hold.

A growing number of officials have also signalled caution over the prospects of a US rate cut next month.

Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: “It's certainly been a volatile week in terms of sentiment, with relief over the end of the shutdown vying with concerns over AI valuations and whether the Fed will cut rates again after several speakers have struck a more cautious tone this week.

“The S&P 500 posted its worst day in over a month with a December cut probability falling sharply from about 59% at Wednesday's close to 49% last night.”

Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, said: “The weakness in Asian markets wasn't quite as profound as what was experienced on Wall Street. It stands to reason. There's more air in US valuations and the locus of the sell-off is a combination of dialled back Fed rate cut expectations and a loss of momentum behind the AI trade amid fears of inadequate return on investment.

“But there was still a high degree of sluggishness in Asian risk assets, notwithstanding a brief pop in Chinese stocks after underwhelming data, including extraordinarily weak investment figures, raised hopes of more stimulus from Chinese authorities.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai, on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels and local officials reported.

The attack hit the Sheskharis oil complex, where infrastructure facilities were damaged and a blaze broke out. The facility is a major oil export terminal that serves as the endpoint for pipelines run by Russia's state-run Transneft, the world's largest oil pipeline company.

The Krasnodar Krai operational headquarters reported the hit at the oil terminal and said several coastal facilities had been damaged in the attack. Officials claimed the fire at the Sheskharis complex had been extinguished. 

Russian state media RIA Novosti also resported that a civilian vessel in the port was hit during the mass UAV strike, leaving three crew members injured.

Russian air defense units shot down 66 drones over Krasnodar Krai overnight, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 

The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims at the time of publication.

Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, commented on the attack on social media. 

""This is the oil terminal in Novorossiysk after the strike,"" he wrote on Telegram. ""Meanwhile, Russia is hitting residential buildings and energy infrastructure.""

The strike on Novorossiysk came as Russia pounded Kyiv with waves of drones and missiles during a massive attack that left at least 14 people injured and a dozen apartment buildings in flames.Novorossiysk, a key hub for Russia's Black Sea logistics and energy infrastructure, has been repeatedly targeted in Ukrainian strikes. Kyiv considers Russian oil refineries and petrochemical facilities to be valid military targets as they help fund Moscow's war efforts.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

Ukrainian drones attacked the Russian city of Saratov overnight on Nov. 14, striking the local oil refinery, residents claimed. 

If confirmed, this would mark the fourth time Ukraine has hit the Saratov oil refinery in fall 2025.

Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin confirmed that drones attacked the region overnight and said that ""civilian infrastructure"" in Saratov had been damaged. Emergency services are operating at the site, he said. 

Locals, however, said that the drones struck the Saratov oil refinery — a frequent target of Ukrainian long-range attacks. Photos and videos of explosions circulated on social media amid the attack. 

The Russian Defense Ministry reported that air defense units shot down 45 drones over Saratov Oblast during the night. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims at the time of publication. 

The Saratov refinery lies in southwestern Russia, roughly 150 kilometers (100 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan and nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the front line in Ukraine.

The facility, owned by the Russian oil giant Rosneft, has a processing capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude per day. It produces over 20 different petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, and bitumen.

The refinery has been hit several times this fall. Previous attacks forced the facility to temporarily halt oil intake in August, Bloomberg reported.

Ukraine regularly launches long-range drone attacks on industrial and military facilities in Russia. Oil refineries, which fund and fuel Moscow's war machine, are frequent targets.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he told President Volodymyr Zelensky that the number of young Ukrainian men coming to Germany should be reduced, AFP reported on Nov. 13.

Following a phone call with the Ukrainian leader, Merz said that young Ukrainians should remain to ""serve in their own country.""

""They are needed there,"" the chancellor added.

Close to 1.3 million Ukrainian refugees have been recorded in Germany as of October 2025 after fleeing Russia's full-scale invasion. This represents the highest number among all EU countries.

Commenting on the phone call, Zelensky said he briefed Merz on the situation at the front and thanked Germany for its military and political support, without mentioning the issue of Ukrainian refugees.

Military-age men have faced strict travel restrictions under martial law, instituted when Russia launched its all-out war in 2022.

Germany said that young Ukrainian men began arriving in large numbers after Kyiv eased travel rules for those aged between 18 and 22 in August.

As a result, the number of Ukrainian men in this age group registering in Germany went from 100 a week to almost 1,000, according to the German Interior Ministry.

The development comes as Kyiv struggles with a continued manpower shortage on the front as Russia sustains offensive operations in the east and south of Ukraine.

Around 490,000 Ukrainians of working age staying in Germany are receiving unemployment benefits, a point of criticism from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

AfD, Germany's leading opposition party, which has consistently criticized Berlin's military and economic support for Kyiv, suggested that unemployment benefits for Ukrainians should be replaced with lower-level payments for asylum seekers.

Facing political pressure, Germany's ruling coalition is preparing a bill that would reduce benefits for Ukrainians who arrived after April 1, with the aim of incentivizing them to seek employment.

The US is launching a military operation called ""Southern Spear"" to target ""narco-terrorists"" in the Western Hemisphere, according to Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth.

United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a new US military operation that is aimed at targeting so-called ""narco-terrorists"" in the Western Hemisphere.

""Today, I'm announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR,"" the Pentagon boss declared on social media platform X on Thursday.

""Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and @SOUTHCOM, this mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people,"" he said.

The Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) is one of the US military's eleven unified combatant commands which is tasked with contingency planning, operations and security cooperation for 31 countries in Central America, South America and the Caribbean.

Last week, the USS Gerald R Ford — world's largest aircraft carrier — arrived in the waters of the Caribbean and Latin America, adding to an already massive naval build-up in the region.

Washington said that its military presence in the area is aimed at reining in transnational criminal gangs in order to protect the US from illicit drugs.

As part of its campaign against drug trafficking, the US has carried out military strikes against a number of vessels in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, claiming that they are ""drug boats."" Dozens of people have died in the strikes.

The US action has heightened tensions in the region, particularly with Venezuela.

Washington claims that the smugglers have links to Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro.

Maduro denied the accusations and, in turn, claims that the US is ""fabricating a new war.""

He alleges that the US military buildup is to oust him from power.

According to Maduro, the US naval deployment in the region is ""the greatest threat our continent has faced in the past 100 years.""

The US State Department announced it would classify four European left-wing groups as terrorist organizations. In addition to Antifa Ost in Germany, one group is based in Italy and the other two are in Greece.

The US State Department said on Thursday that it was moving to designate four self-styled ""antifa"" (anti-fascist) groups as terrorist organizations, citing Germany-based Antifa Ost by name. 

It also said it was pursuing three other violent antifa groups in Italy and Greece.

The Italian group is known in English as the Informal Anarchist Federation/International Revolutionary Front, or as FAI/FRI, to use its Italian language acronym.

The State Department translated the two Greek groups' names as Armed Proletarian Justice and Revolutionary Class Self-Defense.

The State Department intended to designate all four groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations as of November 20, it said. 

""The designation of Antifa Ost and other violent Antifa groups supports President Trump's National Security Presidential Memorandum-7, an initiative to disrupt self-described 'anti-fascism' networks, entities, and organizations that use political violence and terroristic acts to undermine democratic institutions, constitutional rights, and fundamental liberties,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio was quoted as saying.

""Groups affiliated with this movement ascribe to revolutionary anarchist or Marxist ideologies, including anti-Americanism, 'anti-capitalism,' and anti-Christianity, using these to incite and justify violent assaults domestically and overseas,"" he said.

Among other things, the designation makes it illegal for US citizens to seek membership or to support the groups, for instance by donating funds.

President Donald Trump has been vocal in his criticism of ""antifa"" organizations in the US and beyond in recent years.

The US also designated Antifa as a domestic terror organization in September.

The US government did not mention specific incidents or reasons for the Antifa Ost designation but noted attacks in Germany and Hungary, and Hungary having designated the group as a terrorist entity.

""Antifa Ost conducted numerous attacks against individuals it perceives as 'fascists' or part of the 'right-wing scene' in Germany between 2018 and 2023 and is accused of having conducted a series of attacks in Budapest in mid-February 2023,"" the US State Department said. 

One high-profile court case involving the group in Germany in recent years was the 2023 prison sentence for Dresden student Lina E., deemed the ringleader of a group of people who would seek out and attack individuals or groups they considered far-right extremists.

Another suspected member, Johann G., believed to be the leader of a group within Antifa Ost that calls itself the ""Hammer Gang"" (Hammerbande), was arrested late last year. Prosecutors are seeking to try him and several other suspects on charges including attempted murder.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched its New Glenn rocket, carrying two NASA Mars orbiters into space, while the booster successfully landed back on an offshore barge.

Blue Origin, the space tech company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, successfully launched its huge New Glenn rocket on Thursday, carrying with it a pair of twin NASA spacecraft bound for Mars.

The 321-foot (98-meter) rocket, named after former US astronaut John Glenn, blasted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida four days later than planned due to inclement weather.

After releasing the Mars orbiters, the rocket booster also successfully landed back on an offshore platform in a manner similar to that used by rival company SpaceX — but which was a remarkable first for Blue Origin.

The recovery and then re-use of the powerful rocket booster is seen as an essential part of cutting costs and making space flight more financially feasible.

An ecstatic Bezos watched the action personally from Launch Control, where employees chanted ""Next stop, moon!"" following the booster's bull's-eye landing. NASA officials conveyed their congratulations, as did SpaceX's Elon Musk.

Twenty minutes after separating from the booster, the rocket's upper stage then completed the mission's main objective by deploying the two Mars orbiters in space.

The twin NASA craft, collectively known as Escapade, will remain around a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away from Earth for a year until the planet aligns with Mars again, at which point they will set off towards the red planet with the help of a gravity assist.

Upon arrival at Mars in 2027, the spacecraft will map the magnetic fields and solar winds in the planet's upper atmosphere, observations which should shed light on how the planet became so dry and dusty.

""Escapade is going to bring an unprecedented stereo viewpoint because we're going to have two spacecraft at the same time,"" said lead scientist Rob Lillis of the University of California, Berkeley, ahead of the launch.

Scientists also want to continue studying how best to protect astronauts against Mars' harsh radiation environment on potential future flights to the red planet — although a return to the moon is planned first with NASA's Artemis program.

Musk's SpaceX outbid Blue Origin for the first and second crew landings using its Starships, which are nearly 100 feet (30 meters) taller than Bezos' New Glenn. But Blue Origin holds a NASA contract for the third Artemis moon landing.

Twelve astronauts walked on the moon during NASA's Apollo program in the 1960s and 70s, more than a half-century ago. The space agency is pushing to get astronauts back on the lunar surface by the end of the decade — and before China.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

DENG YUWEN was Deputy Senior Editor at the Chinese Communist Party's Central Party School from 2002 to 2013 and worked as a political affairs consultant at Eurasia Group from 2023 to 2025.

 Why Party Elders Can't Save the Country From Xi

 Deng Yuwan

For the past year, an increasing number of rumors about Chinese leader Xi Jinping have been swirling around Beijing. Some sources privately claim that Xi has lost real power and been sidelined. Others whisper that Xi's health has deteriorated; the politician appearing in public, they say, is merely a lookalike, while a group of the party's most venerable elder statesmen are actually calling the shots. Still other stories even imagine an alliance of unlikely bedfellows—once powerful liberal political reformers and conservative generals from the People's Liberation Army, for instance—who are teaming up to admonish Xi or to replace him.

Such fanciful rumors are common in authoritarian systems, especially in the lead-up to major political events—such as the Chinese Communist Party's fourth plenum, which took place in October, and whose outcomes are expected to set the country's developmental direction for the next five years. With few clear signals about who has influence and how decisions are made, the halls of power in Beijing are fertile ground for political conjectures. The shared thread in all these rumors is the idea that a powerful group of party elders with access to insider information—leaders and high-level cadres who have usually stepped back from active political roles but remain influential behind the scenes—still hold enough clout to overrule Xi and shape China's political course.

This particular idea has gained traction in part because such elder statesmen have, in fact, played a central role in the party's history. Citizens disillusioned with Xi's rule hold out hope that a group of hidden arbiters might intervene, just as Deng Xiaoping did to steer China away from radical politics in the late 1970s and to overrule more conservative leaders and insist on market-oriented economic reforms in the 1990s. Elder politics provides a convenient way to interpret and analyze the opaque inner workings of the country's most powerful elite.

But in truth, in today's China elders have largely lost their power. Xi has systematically dismantled the channels of influence through which elders previously operated, including the ability to appoint personnel and their ties within the military. Moreover, the current crop of party elders does not carry the moral authority that the first generation of elders earned from fighting in the communist revolution. The institutional checks on power that have replaced party elders cannot constrain incumbent leaders as effectively as the elders once did, leaving little to rein Xi in as he remolds the party and country.

During the first 30 years of communist rule in China, Mao Zedong had unrivaled revolutionary stature, a firm grip on the military and propaganda systems, and control of the party hierarchy. He was the supreme elder statesman. After Mao died, in 1976, however, the party faced a leadership vacuum. Cadres who had survived war and political upheaval alongside Mao but who had been purged or sidelined during the Cultural Revolution returned to the center of politics. These leaders included Deng; Chen Yun, a senior economic planner; and Ye Jianying, a founding marshal of the People's Liberation Army.

The authority of these political figures derived from seniority and from their direct contributions to the communist revolution. They were not merely leaders but also founders of the state. They had powerful patronage networks, including deep ties to the military. And as the custodians of the party's history, they could define the party's official narrative and frame how and why the party was pursuing its policy choices.

In the early 1980s, to formalize their role, party leaders under Deng's initiative established the Central Advisory Commission, a kind of upper chamber that gave elders an institutional platform to influence personnel and policy decisions. Party leaders chose who was on the commission, and they limited membership to veteran officials who had a long record of serving the party.

Yet elders' real power lay in how they leveraged their unimpeachable authority in informal spaces throughout the rest of China's political system. These elders privately consulted with leading officials, military commanders, and senior bureaucrats to guide their decision-making and, at times, signal their disapproval. They also released public statements that were timed to influence current leaders at critical moments, including debates about who should lead the party and what policies they should pursue. In 1979, the first generation of party elders, including Deng Xiaoping, pushed aside Hua Guofeng, Mao's chosen successor, by exploiting widespread discontent with Hua's insistence on preserving Mao's political direction. A decade later, these same elders supported the decision to deploy military force against protestors in Tiananmen Square. These were not ceremonial gestures; they were acts of real power.

The conditions that empowered these elders also eventually led to their marginalization. Their role arose to provide balance during the transition from Mao's personal rule to a more collective style of leadership. In that transitional stage, which lasted roughly from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, elders stabilized Chinese politics by checking the power of the top leaders. They could halt dangerous policy experiments or dismiss leaders who they felt were pursuing the wrong priorities or failing to recognize shifting political winds.

As communist China's revolutionary generation grew old and passed away, no new elders had the historical prestige or military leverage to inherit their authority. The party elders who succeeded them—the second and third generations—were mainly administrators whose authority derived from their former positions of power, not from revolutionary credentials. The Central Advisory Commission was quietly abolished in 1992. Party leaders also established clear term limits and retirement ages for cadres, curtailing the political options available to leaders who wanted to remain influential after they aged out of office.

Changes in the military further eroded elders' influence. Many of China's early revolutionaries were soldiers who had trained their own protégés. Administrative reforms such as the 1985 reduction in troops, however, weakened the entrenched networks through which elders exercised their power within the military hierarchy. In 2015, Xi carried out another round of sweeping reforms, which, by reorganizing the armed forces into regional commands, effectively severed the ability of any senior military leaders to build their own coherent internal factions. Xi also concentrated authority in the Central Military Commission, which he directly controls.

But what fully ended elders' power was Xi's systematic attack on personal networks. Xi's anticorruption campaign, which he launched soon after taking the reins of the party, in 2012, cut the informal bonds that once linked current and retired elites. He methodically dismantled alternate power centers in the security services, the military, and strategically important sectors such as energy and finance. At the same time, Xi increased oversight of retired senior cadres and introduced new rules prohibiting them from publicly commenting on the country's leaders or their policies. Xi even reclassified dinners among elders as potential matters of political security, which meant that they could no longer visit one another freely. If elders wished to influence Xi, their avenues of influence dried up.

Party elders have not vanished from public life in the Xi era. They still appear at national ceremonies, occupy front row seats at important meetings, deliver anodyne remarks when called upon, and receive briefings behind closed doors. But they lack power. With Xi's consolidation of control and the natural evolution of China's political system, elders no longer have the capacity to mobilize a coalition that fuses personnel leverage, military clout, procedural know-how, and moral authority in a way that could seriously check the current leadership.

Without powerful elders, China's party-state must rely on other mechanisms to constrain top leaders. A more institutionalized bureaucracy can slow decision-making and resist the personal whims of individual leaders by subjecting them to lengthy formal processes. For instance, some universities and research institutes have pushed back on Xi's attempt to relocate their campuses to a brand-new, futuristic metropolis in Xiong'an, about 75 miles south of Beijing, and the project has proceeded far more slowly than was laid out in original plans. Elites also still have self-preservation instincts, which means that they tend to avoid risky decisions that could jeopardize their careers. And external shocks that shape domestic politics, such as financial stress or trade pressure, can limit leaders' choices. Yet none of these checks is as direct, swift, or effective at balancing personal power as elders' intervention once was.

The difference lies in the logic of power symmetry. In prior eras, elders and incumbent leaders often stood on roughly equal ground. The admonitions of the first generation of revolutionaries carried the weight of superiors addressing subordinates. Even the second generation of elders could still counterbalance the sitting party secretary. After Jiang Zemin, Deng's successor, stepped down, in 2002, and handed the reins of the party to Hu Jintao, he continued to wield influence behind the scenes. Jiang effectively diluted Hu's authority and cemented his own power by expanding the Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision-making body, from seven members to nine, and installing several of his protégés in key positions.

The new arrangement under Xi presupposes the absence of rivals. Stability is maintained not through horizontal checks but through vertical, one-way channels of power. The bureaucracy can stall Xi's directives, but it cannot veto them. Economic officials can advise, but they cannot compel leaders to change course. Generals may express concern, but they cannot voice public dissent. Interactions that were once equal deliberations are now more like a pipeline in which information flows up and orders flow down. Elder politics was opaque and personalistic, but its power symmetry made it possible for other elites to address the top leader as an equal and speak candidly about the problems that the party faced.



China's troubled response to the COVID-19 pandemic reveals the dangers of this new situation. A group of powerful elders could not have prevented the outbreak. But it might have limited the damage by making it easier for information to flow to decision-makers. Elders could have pushed leaders to heed early warning signs when the virus first started spreading, in 2020, and forced Xi to relax his draconian policies sooner as the pandemic dragged on into its second and third years. The presence of elders creates space among the party's upper echelons that allows internal debate in times of crisis and makes it possible for more experts to convey their knowledge to top leaders.

Of the partial substitutes that have emerged to replace the ballast once provided by party elders, only external pressure—chiefly the impacts of U.S.-Chinese competition and confrontation—has significantly limited Xi's power. Aggressive tariffs and export controls have forced Xi to adapt his economic approach by diversifying China's trade partners and even embracing some domestic private-sector companies that can contribute to Xi's goal of technological self-reliance. Internal stressors, such as high unemployment and financial fragility, may also constrain Xi's options to pursue his goals, but so far they have merely slowed, rather than stalled, his agenda. Yet overall, Xi's decision-making is getting more insular as he relies ever more on a tight inner circle of confidants, heightening the risk of misjudgment that could turn manageable challenges into systemic risks.

Many outside observers who recognize that elders have lost power treat that fact as a footnote to Xi's consolidation of power. But it is much more consequential. A system that relies on the fusion of rigid bureaucratic rules and strong personal leadership is much more fragile than one that relies on an unwritten balance of power because it lacks substantive ways of constraining leaders. And even if a future leader after Xi sought to rule more collectively, party elders will still lack the stature or the networks necessary to act as a check on power. Far removed from the halcyon days of revolution, China must hope that a combination of imperfect substitutes—and some good luck—will limit Xi and stop preventable crises before they spin out of control.

 How Washington Should Manage Its Most Complicated Relationships

 Rebecca Lissner

During his successful 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, Donald Trump assured voters that he would end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, perhaps even before taking office. But both conflicts dragged on at great human cost, and diplomacy proceeded only in fits and starts. Nine months into his presidency, Trump finally brokered a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas—but only after presiding over the breakdown of the truce he inherited from President Joe Biden and an escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The war in Ukraine, meanwhile, continues unabated.

These challenges are not unique to Trump; they bedeviled Biden, too. Indeed, the difficulty of bringing both wars to an end illustrates the strategic dilemmas facing the United States in managing a small but critical subset of its partners: so-called quasi allies. Quasi allies—which, since the end of World War II, the United States has cultivated as it has built its alliance system—are more than partners but less than treaty allies. They have special status in Washington, but they lack the feature of an alliance that matters most: a formal U.S. security guarantee.

The recent wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have put quasi allies at the center of U.S. foreign policy. The United States has supported Ukraine in resisting Russia's attempt at subjugation, sending billions of dollars' worth of advanced weaponry to its armed forces. Ukraine has maintained its sovereignty and political independence, whereas Russia has suffered more than a million military casualties and significant materiel losses—results achieved without direct conflict between Moscow and Washington. In the Middle East, the United States has enabled an Israeli-led campaign that set back Iran's nuclear program and broke its regional network of armed proxy groups, even as those operations also deepened the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. This record points to the advantages of supporting strong quasi allies at the frontlines of geopolitics: these relationships allow the United States to advance its interests in consequential regions through indirect, less costly means.

But the United States' attempts to manage its role in these wars have also highlighted strategic dilemmas endemic to quasi alliances and particularly pronounced in wartime. If Trump is to fulfill his goal of bringing peace to the Middle East and Europe, his administration needs to better manage these dilemmas. And Washington's experience with Ukraine and Israel should inform planning for a high-stakes contingency involving Taiwan, another quasi ally in a perilous neighborhood.

Within its vast network of relationships around the globe, the United States categorizes most of its friends as either allies or partners. Washington is bound to its allies by legally codified treaties featuring mutual defense clauses. This pledge that an attack on one is an attack on all backstops allies' security and extends the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Partners, by contrast, may receive security assistance from the United States but do not presume that the U.S. military would come to their aid if they were attacked.

Quasi allies represent an awkward third category. These are countries through which the United States sees opportunities to advance its interests. They may receive significant military training and assistance, host a large U.S. troop presence, and coordinate closely with Washington. Some even enjoy a confusing designation, conferred by the president, as a “major non-NATO ally,” which does not entail a security commitment. And unlike partners, the scope and scale of Washington's investment in their security creates ambiguity around whether and to what extent the United States would intervene to defend quasi allies if they were attacked. Indeed, the United States has occasionally come to the defense of its quasi allies, as when it helped Israel defeat Iranian aerial attacks twice in 2024 and again during the Iran-Israel war in June. But there tend to be good reasons why the United States stops short of extending the kind of mutual defense commitment that would cement a treaty alliance—including concerns about becoming entangled in a turbulent region, provoking an adversary, or pledging to defend a partner that may not pursue Washington's preferred policies. This ambiguity makes quasi alliances weaker tools of deterrence and reassurance than formal alliances, and it helps explain why quasi allies are more vulnerable to external aggression than treaty allies.

Despite Washington's deep investment in these relationships, quasi allies often have interests that diverge from those of the United States. Quasi ally leaders have their own agendas and domestic politics, especially when their country is at war. The United States has repeatedly experienced these dynamics with Ukraine and Israel, a challenge I witnessed firsthand as a senior official in the Biden White House. In both cases, U.S. policy sought to enable quasi allies to pursue common objectives while managing disagreements over diplomatic and military strategy.



During Ukraine's 2022 counteroffensive campaign against Russia, Ukrainian and U.S. military leaders jointly developed a strategy to punch through Russian defensive lines in Kherson and take territory that would enable Ukrainian forces to break the land bridge connecting Crimea with occupied Ukraine. Yet this plan foundered when confronted with Ukraine's understandable loss aversion—breaching Russian defenses would have been an exceptionally bloody endeavor—and distracting rivalries among Ukrainian commanders and political leadership. Despite careful joint planning, U.S. policymakers could do little to compel Ukraine to see the campaign through. Domestic political imperatives have similarly prevented Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from taking the painful but necessary step of lowering the draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages, which in turn has exacerbated demand for military materiel from the United States and Europe.

The dilemma of divergent interests has also challenged U.S. policymaking toward Israel since October 7, 2023. Hamas's heinous attack came at a moment when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was politically vulnerable and facing serious corruption charges. He has deftly managed to stay in power, often by taking steps opposed by Washington: restricting humanitarian aid into Gaza, expanding West Bank settlements, and escalating attacks on Iran and Hezbollah, its Lebanese proxy militia. The past two years have thus exposed real policy differences, as well as the limits of U.S. influence over Israeli decision-making.

The United States may also diverge from its quasi allies on how to assess or manage the risk of escalation. Although Washington may have a strong strategic interest in the outcome of wars involving quasi allies, it can choose to calibrate its involvement. For the quasi ally, the stakes are always higher and often existential. They may be more willing to gamble on steps that could lead to significant escalation, including actions that could draw their sponsors into direct conflict. And in some cases, entanglement is the point.

Kyiv's greater risk tolerance has created friction in the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship from the early months of Russia's invasion. During the Biden administration, Ukrainian leaders had a perennial wish list of ever more capable weapons systems. Long-range missiles known as ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) topped the list, and unlike some other sophisticated systems the Ukrainians requested, these promised real military utility. But Biden officials believed that providing these missiles carried risks in terms of U.S. military readiness and the potential for escalation. The subsequent years-long push and pull between Kyiv and Washington distracted from other policy debates and Ukrainian military imperatives. By the time Biden authorized the shipment of a limited number of ATACMS to Ukraine in April 2024, with clear restrictions on their use, the weapons provided tactical benefits but did not generate a strategic breakthrough. A similar dynamic played out, albeit less publicly, as Ukraine repeatedly sought permission to use U.S. equipment to strike Russian territory. Ukraine ultimately won the United States' limited acquiescence.

In both cases, Ukraine was willing to gamble to score military or even morale-boosting wins and would likely have welcomed direct U.S. military intervention, whereas Washington sought to both meet Kyiv's military needs and avoid the kind of escalation that would draw the United States or NATO directly into the war. Attempts to resolve this tension resulted in suboptimal policies for both sides: Washington accepted more risk than it wanted to, but not enough to deliver Ukraine a decisive boost.

The United States has managed similar tensions with Israel in its recent wars with Hezbollah and Iran. In the days immediately following October 7, Biden dissuaded Israel's leadership from launching a preemptive strike on Hezbollah and parried Netanyahu's request for U.S. military participation in the strike by arguing that it would trigger a regional firestorm at a time when Israel was ill prepared for a multifront war. In April 2024, after Iran launched its first aerial attack on Israel, Biden told Netanyahu that the United States would not support an Israeli counterattack against Iran, urging him to take the unsuccessful nature of the Iranian salvo as a win, thanks to joint defensive operations. Netanyahu partially accepted this advice, hitting a strategic air defense site inside Iran without claiming public credit for the strike.

When Trump took office, he clearly signaled a strong preference to address Iran's nuclear program via diplomatic means. Israel nevertheless launched a military campaign against Iran. The fact that only the U.S. military had bombs capable of penetrating Iran's nuclear facilities meant that Netanyahu was betting on Washington's ultimate involvement, a gamble that paid off in June, when Trump authorized U.S. strikes. Of all the points on which interests diverge between the United States and its quasi allies, escalation and risk tolerance are the highest-stakes areas because the danger of entanglement is the greatest.

If relative power and material dependence translated neatly into influence, the United States would have overwhelming leverage over its quasi allies, resulting in an ability to manage tension through coercive means, such as withholding weapons, and to dictate wartime decisions. But the reality is more complicated. The relationship between the United States and its quasi ally is itself a center of gravity, especially during wartime: if the relationship frays, the break advantages the adversary.

When quasi allies fight enduring wars, the most effective way for the United States to secure its desired outcome is either to help its partner win the war outright or to convince the adversary that support will continue to flow until a favorable negotiated settlement is reached. These dynamics make it difficult to withhold vital military support as leverage in shaping how a quasi ally fights and what peace it will accept. And it makes wars involving support to quasi allies challenging to end.

In his bid to end the war in Ukraine, Trump calculated that Ukraine's dependence on the United States meant that he could browbeat Kyiv into a negotiated settlement that heavily favored Moscow. Trump tested this hypothesis by publicly berating Zelensky in the Oval Office, then cutting off military and intelligence assistance. Rather than coercing Ukraine into war-ending concessions, however, this gambit only spotlighted the frailty of the bonds between Kyiv and Washington under the Trump administration and led the Kremlin to double down on its strategy of diplomatic recalcitrance and intensified military pressure.

Biden took the opposite approach. In 2022, the United States and its G-7 allies declared their intent to support Ukraine for “as long as it takes.” This commitment and the consistent support that followed bolstered Ukraine's will to fight and telegraphed that time was not on Russia's side. But it obscured two difficult realities: that Congress would not indefinitely sustain billions of dollars in support to Ukraine and that ending the war would inevitably require pressuring Kyiv to step back from its unattainable near-term objective to restore its pre-invasion border.



The United States' efforts to use its leverage to moderate Israel's maximalist war aims and to end the war in Gaza were always fraught and only grew more so as the humanitarian calamity in Gaza deepened. The Biden administration continually wrestled with the question of whether and how to condition military support to Israel at a time when Israel remained under threat from Iran and Hezbollah. It came closest to doing so in May 2024, in anticipation of major Israeli military operations in Rafah. Concerned that this move would endanger nearly a million civilians and undermine prospects for a cease-fire, Biden proclaimed he would not supply the weapons for the offensive and paused the delivery of 2,000-pound bombs. Biden officials ultimately succeeded in persuading Israel to downscale its Rafah operation, one of several modest successes in using pressure to improve humanitarian outcomes in Gaza, and never resumed the delivery of 2,000-pound bombs. But the administration's concern about limiting support to Israel while it faced other regional threats constrained the options for further restrictions.

Trump has taken a very different approach. During his first nine months in office, he largely gave Israel free rein to conduct its Gaza operations as it wished, effectively backing its decision to restart the war in March after a cease-fire, stop humanitarian aid deliveries, and push into Gaza City. But after Israel attempted to kill Hamas negotiators with a September airstrike in Qatar, Trump changed tack and pressured Netanyahu to agree to a cease-fire. With a credible, if seemingly nonspecific, threat of abandonment, Trump compelled Netanyahu to accept elements of a peace plan he had previously opposed and pause the war. Although the United States' relationship with Israel is the most politically charged, the United States will always face tradeoffs between the strategic benefits of fulsome support to quasi allies and the temptation to parlay that support into meaningful influence over military and diplomatic decision-making.

The strategic dilemmas that quasi alliances pose are endlessly frustrating to policymakers. But they are here to stay. Ending the war in Ukraine on favorable terms and preserving a fragile truce in Gaza will require deft navigation of these dilemmas. Several lessons emerge from the United States' recent experience with Ukraine and Israel. First, leaders face a temptation to paper over differences and exaggerate the convergence of interests, especially when helping to defend a close partner against brutal aggression. But Washington should commit to support quasi allies in wars only if they have clearly defined objectives that closely correspond with its own. Once the United States decides to undertake such support, it should build mechanisms to align priorities and privately manage disagreements. Models include U.S.-Ukrainian military planning channels and the national security adviser–led U.S.-Israeli strategic dialogue on Iran. And clear leader-level communication is paramount.

Policymakers should also design credible forms of leverage to shape quasi allies' behavior. Security assistance should be strategically calibrated—a reframing that emphasizes U.S. interests rather than the coercive connotations of aid conditionality. Such a process begins with conveying clear expectations in writing, such as end-use restrictions on U.S. military equipment. Even minor violations should be addressed early to create an expectation of enforcement. If the White House keeps up a regular cadence of reviews of U.S. arms deliveries, it can better ensure that the pace and content of these transfers are aligned with policy objectives and legal requirements, not conducted on autopilot. Congress is an essential partner: it can legislate restrictions itself as well as help preserve leader-level relationships by deferring blame to Capitol Hill.

Careful public messaging can make all of this easier. It is crucial to project strong support for quasi allies and explain that support to the American public without creating commitments that become politically costly to walk back. Too often, critics of Biden's sound Ukraine policy seized on the difference between his soaring rhetoric and his well-founded escalation concerns. Adhering to a policy that there should be “no daylight” between the United States and its quasi ally is a mistake because it creates an impossible choice between burying disagreement and absorbing the political blowback associated with a public break.

An even more consequential conflict involving a quasi ally could be lurking on the horizon: war between China and Taiwan. The United States could quickly become a direct combatant in such a conflict, assuming far more risk but also exerting much greater influence over the course of the war and its outcome. But even if the United States intervenes outright on Taiwan's behalf, quasi-alliance dilemmas would resurface: divergent interests and domestic-political incentives, especially given Taiwan's highly polarized politics; escalatory steps by Taipei that could undercut Washington's efforts to carefully manage risk; and the difficulty of finding a mutually acceptable endgame. These challenges all place a premium on quiet peacetime coordination between Washington and Taipei to build alignment on notional military plans and war aims, procedures for escalation management and signaling to Beijing, and conditions for terminating a war.

Leaders cannot wish away close friends such as Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine that straddle combustible geopolitical fault lines—nor would it benefit the United States to do so. But to advance U.S. interests, Washington needs better answers to the strategic dilemmas inherent in managing quasi alliances. Only by grappling with recent successes and failures can policymakers develop a better playbook.

            Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani is once again adding well-deserved hardware to his growing collection and further securing his reputation as a generational talent.
    


            The Japanese pitcher-slugger was again unanimously voted the National League's Most Valuable Player on Thursday, the second year in a row he has been named the league's best player. New York Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge took home honors in the American League for a second consecutive year.
    


            Ohtani, sitting next to his wife, Mamiko Tanaka, and their dog, Decoy, when his name was announced on MLB Network, gave a lil smooch to his pup to celebrate the occasion.

            The 31-year-old is now the first player in Major League Baseball history to win the award twice in both leagues. The five-time All-Star was named the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 with the Los Angeles Angels before leaving for the cross-town Dodgers after signing a reported $700 million contract.
    


            Ohtani yet again proved why he is considered an all-time talent, leading the Dodgers to their second straight World Series win.
    


            The Japanese star hit 55 home runs, 102 RBI with a .282 batting average this season, highlighted by a magical postseason run that saw him hit three home runs on the way to the Fall Classic victory.
    


            Ohtani also made an impact on the mound for LA, making his return to pitching in June after an almost two-year layoff, following two procedures, including one to repair the right ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow and his left shoulder last offseason. In 14 starts, he went 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA and had 62 strikeouts.
    


Shohei Ohtani is having an October unlike any other. Tuesday night's game will be yet another for the history books



            The second-straight MVP award comes after posting a historic season last year in which he became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single campaign.
    

3 straight MVPs, 4 total, and all of them UNANIMOUS.Shohei Ohtani is superhuman 💥 pic.twitter.com/7CjePY120c


            Ohtani beat out award finalists New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber, getting all 30 votes to win unanimously.
    


            Ohtani gave a “shout out” to Soto and Schwarber for “bringing out the best” in him this season.
    


            “Biggest thing is winning the World Series,” Ohtani said via his translator on MLB Network. “That's first and foremost, it's icing on the cake to be able to get an individual award – being crowned MVP. But I just really want to appreciate the support from all my teammates, everybody around me, my supporting staff.”
    


            He joins Barry Bonds as the only player in MLB history to win four MVPs. Bonds, MLB's all-time home run leader, has won the award seven times.
    


            The 33-year-old Judge proved his value for the Bronx Bombers, hitting 53 home runs along with a .331 batting average, now winning the award for the second straight year and third time in his career.
    


            Standing at an opposing 6-foot-7, Judge became just the third player to hit at least 50 home runs and win a batting title in the same season, joining Yankees great Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx.
    


            Judge called it “pretty wild” when asked about all the silverware he's won.

            “You try not to think about it during the season. I try to keep my head down through all 162,” Judge said with his family and two dogs beside him. “Just do whatever I can in today's game to help the team win. Do what you can, give it your all and you wake up the next day and do it again.”
    


            Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh and Cleveland Guardians third baseman Jose Ramirez with 17 first-place votes. Raleigh, affectionately known as the “Big Dumper,” came in second with 13 votes.
    


            The seven-time All-Star congratulated Raleigh and Ramirez for having “two incredible seasons.”
    


            “It's always fun playing against those two,” Judge said. “Especially when we play Seattle, the main objective is making sure Cal (Raleigh) doesn't beat you. He can beat you from both sides of the plate.”
    


            With the MVPs awarded, the league year is now complete, with the Winter Meetings scheduled to begin next week.
    


            On Wednesday, Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal won his second straight AL Cy Young award, while Pittsburgh Pirates' 23-year-old phenom Paul Skenes was named the NL Cy Young winner.
    


            Earlier in the week, Athletics first baseman Nick Kurtz unanimously won the AL Rookie of the Year. Atlanta Braves catcher Drake Baldwin was named the NL Rookie of the Year.
    


            Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy was named the NL Manager of the Year and Guardians manager Stephen Vogt won AL Manager of the Year for the second consecutive year.

By the time Jeffery Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Emails made public this week show the crime did little to diminish the desire of that network to stay connected to the billionaire financier.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. One consulted him on how to respond to accusations of sexual harassment.

Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, and killed himself in jail a month later. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up. 

The emails do not implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein's influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender.

Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors.

In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year after Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that the German media underestimated Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.”

“luv it,” Epstein responded. 

Epstein wrote that he'd just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.” 

Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you'll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn't work.”

“its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” 

Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. 

Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.”

In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director.

“you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote.

Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler now works, declined to comment.

The financier emailed often with people in the upper echelons of wealth around the world, brokering introductions and chatting about politics and foreign affairs.

That included Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who Epstein sent an email to in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks.”

Four years later, Epstein asked if Thiel was enjoying Los Angeles, and, after Thiel said he couldn't complain, replied “Dec visit me Caribbean.” It's unclear if Thiel ever responded. 

In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him.”

“Trump doesn't like him,” responded Sulayem.

A year earlier, Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking, “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.”

“Call to discuss,” Epstein wrote back. 

In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask, “any fun?” 

Nikolic replied that he had met “your friend” Bill Clinton, as well as then-French President Nicholas Sarkozy and “your other friend,” Prince Andrew, “as he has some questions re microsoft.”

But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. Later, he wrote Epstein that “it would be blast that you are here.” He mentioned flirting with a 22-year-old woman.

“It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)” Nikolic wrote.

The theoretical physicist and cosmologist Laurence Krauss was among them. In 2017, Krauss reached out to Epstein via email for advice on responding to a reporter writing a story about allegations of sexual harassment against him.

“Is this a reasonable response? Should i even respond? Could use advice,” Krauss asked Epstein.

In an explicit exchange, Epstein asked Krauss if he'd had sex with the person in question and then suggested he should not reply to the journalist. 

“No. We didn't have sex. Decided it wasn't a good idea,” replied Krauss, who has previously denied all allegations of sexual harassment and assault.

In an August 2015 email exchange, Epstein told Chomsky, the famed linguist and social scientist, to only fly to Greece if he feels well, joking he previously had to send a plane for another “lefty friend” to see a doctor in New York.

In the same exchange, which dipped into academic arguments about warning signs on currency collapses, behavioral science models, and Big Data, Epstein offered his residences for Chomsky's use.

“you are of course welcome to use apt in new york with your new leisure time, or visit new Mexico again,” Epstein wrote. 

The emails also show that Epstein kept up a friendly relationship with Larry Summers, who was the treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and former Harvard University president, and bantered about the 2016 presidential race and Trump.

Other emails showed a closer relationship. In 2019, Summers was discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing to Epstein that “I said what are you up to. She said ‘I'm busy'. I said awfully coy u are.” 

Epstein replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.” 

Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life.” 

“As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement,” the statement said.

Chomsky, Thiel, Bannon, Krauss and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem did not immediately respond to requests for comment, which were sent through email addresses available on their own or their organization's websites.

Shohei Ohtani likes winning Most Valuable Player awards. He loves winning the World Series even more.

The two-way Japenese star did both for a second season in a row for the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning his fourth career MVP on Thursday night while unanimously earning the National League honor. He's just the second to win four MVPs after Barry Bonds with seven and the only player to win unanimously more than once.

Considering Ohtani is 31, overtaking Bonds doesn't seem out of the question. Especially if it leads to more Fall Classic opportunities.

“If I'm playing well as an individual that means I'm helping the team win, so in that sense, hopefully I can end up with a couple more MVPs,” Ohtani said through an interpreter. “But at the end of the day, it's all about winning games.”

In the American League, Aaron Judge became the New York Yankees' fourth three-time winner, edging Seattle's Cal Raleigh with 17 first-place votes to 13 for the switch-hitting catcher. The vote was the closest for an MVP since the Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout topped Houston's Alex Bregman by 17-13 in 2019.

Judge, who won the AL award in 2022 and 2024, joined Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle as three-time MVPs with the Yankees. The 33-year-old outfielder led the majors with a .331 batting average and 1.144 OPS while hitting 53 homers.

When asked about his place in MLB and Yankees lore, Judge acknowledged he's in rare company.




“It's tough for me to wrap my head around,” Judge said. “It's mind blowing from my side of things, because I play this game to win, I play this game for my teammates, my family, all the fans in New York.”

Later he added: “You've got to pinch yourself every single day. It's truly an incredible honor.”

Ohtani won a MVP for the third straight year, his second in the NL with the Dodgers after two in the AL with the Angels. He became the first to win in each league twice after getting the AL honor in 2021 and 2023. Ohtani signed with the crosstown Dodgers the following offseason and won NL MVP in 2024 during his first season in Chavez Ravine. He's also won the World Series in both his seasons with the Dodgers.

Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber finished second in the NL with 23 second-place votes and New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto was third with four.

Ohtani hit .282 and led the NL with a 1.014 OPS. He also had 55 homers, 102 RBIs and 20 stolen bases. 

The right-hander returned to pitching in June after missing 1 1/2 seasons on the mound because of an elbow injury. He struck out 62 batters over 47 innings, slowly increasing his workload while preparing for the postseason. 

Ohtani continued to shine in October with arguably the greatest single game in MLB history. He hit three homers while striking out 10 over six dominant innings on Oct. 17, leading the Dodgers over Milwaukee to finish an NL Championship Series sweep.

Schwarber, who earned a $50,000 bonus for finishing second, hit an NL-best 56 homers and led the big leagues with 132 RBIs for Philadelphia.

Soto overcame a slow start to the season to have his typically stellar offensive output. The four-time All-Star — who signed a $765 million, 15-year deal last December — had 43 homers, 105 RBIs and an NL-best 38 stolen bases. He received a $150,000 bonus for finishing third in the MVP voting.

Judge is the first AL player to win back-to-back MVPs since Detroit's Miguel Cabrera it in 2012 and 2013.

Raleigh, nicknamed “Big Dumper,” led the big leagues with 60 homers, the most for a player primarily a catcher. He started 119 games behind the plate and another 38 at designated hitter.

The 28-year-old also had a career-high 125 RBIs, leading the Mariners to one of their best seasons in franchise history. Judge said he got to know Raleigh a little during the All-Star break and the catcher asked for some leadership tips.

“Cal's a special player,” Judge said. “I could sit here and talk all night about the player he is, but really the kind of leader and person he is really stuck out to me at the All-Star Game.”

Cleveland's José Ramírez finished third in the AL. 

Arizona's Geraldo Perdomo was fourth in the NL voting, earning him $2.5 million annual salary increases in 2028 and 2029 along with the price of Arizona's 2030 club option.

CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — The yearslong case against six Nevada Republicans who were accused of submitting a bogus certificate that falsely declared President Donald Trump the winner of the state's 2020 presidential election has been sent back to Clark County, where a jury is more likely to rule against them. 

The opinion released Thursday from the Nevada Supreme Court reverses an earlier decision from a state judge who dismissed the case after ruling Clark County was the wrong venue for the case because the alleged crimes had occurred elsewhere in the state. Clark County is home to Las Vegas and leans Democratic. 

The higher court's decision to let the case move forward marks a rare win for swing-state efforts to prosecute so-called fake electors who tried to keep Trump in the White House after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. In Michigan, a judge recently dismissed charges against 15 Republicans who had been charged by that state's Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel. The dismissal came after a judge in Arizona sent the fake electors case there back to the grand jury for fuller instructions about what federal law requires. 

“Today the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed what we have maintained all along — that Clark County is the proper and lawful venue to prosecute our case, and I am pleased with the court's decision to overturn the District Court's dismissal of our case in Clark County,” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said in a statement.

Electors declined to comment Thursday.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




After the 2020 election, the six electors gathered outside of the Nevada Legislature to sign certificates giving the state's six electoral votes to Trump, despite former President Joe Biden winning the state by more than 30,000 votes. The ceremony was broadcast online, and the video footage was used as evidence in the case.




Criminal cases were also brought against Republican electors in Michigan, Georgia and Arizona. On Monday, Trump pardoned his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others accused of aiding his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

The defendants have called the case political prosecution. They say they were exercising their First Amendment rights to criticize the state's election processes.

The six Nevadans, who had pleaded not guilty, include Michael McDonald, the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, and Jesse Law, the former Clark County Republican Party chairman who was recently ousted in a July election.

A main argument in the case focused on where the alleged crimes occurred. After that ceremony, one of the electors mailed the documents from Douglas County to the archivist of the United States and the president of the Senate in Washington, D.C. It was also sent to the Nevada secretary of state in Carson City and a federal judge in Las Vegas.

Ford argued the case belongs in Clark County because the envelope was sent to Las Vegas, however one of the electors argued that the envelope was redirected to the judge's chambers in Reno.

The Nevada Supreme Court justices sided unanimously with the attorney general's office, saying in its Thursday opinion that Nevada law does not preclude a venue from being appropriate in multiple counties for the same offense. 

As a precaution, Ford filed a separate case in Carson City in December 2024 to avoid the statute of limitations expiring while the Nevada Supreme Court made its decision. In the Carson City case, he charged the defendants with “uttering a forged instrument.” That case will likely be withdrawn. 

Ford, a Democrat, is running for governor in 2026.

SEATTLE (AP) — First-term Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell conceded his reelection fight to progressive activist Katie Wilson on Thursday, handing another victory to leftist Democrats around the country frustrated with unaffordability, homelessness, public safety and the actions of President Donald Trump's administration.

Harrell, a centrist Democrat who previously served three terms on the City Council, led in early results. But Washington conducts all-mail elections, with ballots postmarked by Election Day. Later-arriving votes, which historically trend more liberal, broke heavily in Wilson's favor, adding to a progressive shift to the left nationally.

In a concession speech at City Hall on Thursday afternoon, Harrell said he had congratulated Wilson in a “delightful” call.

“I feel very good about the future of this country and this city still,” he said.

Wilson, 43, is a democratic socialist who has never held elected office. She told a news conference later Thursday that it was hard for her to believe she had been elected mayor, considering that at the beginning of this year she had no intention of running, and she acknowledged concerns about her lack of experience: “No one saw this coming.”

But she also spoke to the resonance of her volunteer-driven campaign among voters concerned about affordability and public safety in a city where the cost of living has soared as Amazon and other tech companies proliferated. Universal child care, better mass transit, better public safety and stable, affordable housing are among her priorities, and she said she would take office with a strong mandate to purse them, though she acknowledged the city also faces a significant budget shortfall.




Wilson called herself a coalition builder and community organizer, and said she would also work with those who questioned her qualifications to lead a city with more than 13,000 employees and a budget of nearly $9 billion: “This is your city too.” 

“When I say this is your city, that means you have a right to be here and to live a dignified life — whatever your background, whatever your income,” Wilson said. “But it also means that we all have a collective responsibility for this city and for each other. ... We cannot tackle the major challenges facing our city unless we do it together.”

She will be working with a relatively new City Council: Only two of the seven council members have served more than one term.

Harrell was elected mayor in 2021 following the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic and racial justice protests over George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police. With crime falling, more police being hired, less visible drug use and many homeless encampments removed from city parks, the business-backed Harrell once seemed likely to cruise to reelection.

But Trump's return to office — and his efforts to send in federal agents or cut funding for blue cities — helped reawaken Seattle's progressive voters. The lesser-known Wilson, a democratic socialist, ran a campaign that echoed some of the themes of progressive mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in New York. She trounced Harrell by nearly 10 percentage points in the August primary and quickly became favored to win the mayor's office.

Wilson studied at an Oxford University college in England but did not graduate. She founded the small nonprofit Transit Riders Union in 2011 and has led campaigns for better public transportation, higher minimum wages, stronger renter protections and more affordable housing. She herself is a renter, living in a one-bedroom apartment in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood, and says that has shaped her understanding of Seattle's affordability crisis.

Wilson criticized Harrell as doing too little to provide more shelter and said his encampment sweeps have been cosmetic, merely pushing unhoused people around the city. Wilson also painted him as a City Hall fixture who bore responsibility for the status quo.

Harrell, 67, played on the Rose Bowl champion University of Washington football team in 1978 before going to law school. His father, who was Black, came to Seattle from the segregated Jim Crow South, and his mother, a Japanese American, was incarcerated at an internment camp in Minidoka, Idaho, during World War II after officials seized her family's Seattle flower shop — experiences that fostered his understanding of the importance of civil rights and inclusivity. 

Both candidates touted plans for affordable housing, combating crime and attempting to Trump-proof the city, which receives about $150 million a year in federal funding. Both want to protect Seattle's sanctuary city status. 

Wilson has proposed a city-level capital gains tax to help offset federal funding the city might lose and to pay for housing. Harrell says that idea is ineffective because a city capital gains tax could easily be avoided by those who would be required to pay it.

NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.

If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.

Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.

The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.




A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.

A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough.

“The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.

A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.

Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis.

The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing.

The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.

There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.

Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities.

And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.

Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue's products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.

About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue's opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive.

One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder.

“Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can't do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.

Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.

The U.S. Coast Guard announced Thursday it detected a Russian military spy vessel operating near U.S. territorial waters Oct. 29, and personnel are continuing to monitor the ship.

Officials said the Vishnya-class intelligence ship was about 15 nautical miles south of Oahu, prompting a response by the Coast Guard HC-130 Hercules from Air Station Barbers Point and the Coast Guard Cutter William Hart.

The Coast Guard responded to the Russian Federation Navy Auxiliary General Intelligence ship, Kareliya, by conducting a safe and professional overflight and transiting near the vessel, according to a news release.

Acting in accordance with international law, the Coast Guard said personnel are monitoring the vessel's activities near U.S. territorial waters to provide maritime security for U.S. vessels operating in the area.

Coast guardsmen will also monitor the vessel to support U.S. homeland defense efforts.

""The U.S. Coast Guard routinely monitors maritime activity around the Hawaiian Islands and throughout the Pacific to ensure the safety and security of U.S. waters,"" Capt. Matthew Chong, chief of response for the Coast Guard Oceania District, wrote in a statement.

""Working in concert with partners and allies, our crews monitor and respond to foreign military vessel activity near our territorial waters to protect our maritime borders and defend our sovereign interests.""

The Vishnya-class is a group of intelligence collection ships built for the Soviet Navy in the 1980s, according to the U.S. Army website. There are seven ships still in service with the Russian Navy. 

They are large, purpose-built vessels designed for signals intelligence gathering via an extensive array of sensors, according to the site. Data can be transmitted to shore via satellite link antennas.

While the ships are designed for intelligence gathering, they are armed with two AK-630 close-in weapon systems and SA-N-8 surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers, for last resort self-defense, according to the Army.

Coast Guard Oceania District works in conjunction with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and interagency partners to constantly monitor the activity of foreign military vessels operating near U.S. territorial waters to ensure homeland security and defense.

Under customary international law, foreign military vessels are permitted to transit and operate outside other nations' territorial seas, which extend up to 12 nautical miles from shore.

Witnesses say anti-Israel agitators violently stormed an event in Toronto, breaking glass and attacking attendees Nov. 5, 2025.

Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) Director Daniel Rogers, during a rare public appearance Thursday, said nearly one in 10 of the agency's terrorism investigations include at least one person under the age of 18, an alarming trend driven by online extremism.

Since 2014, there have been nearly two dozen violent extremist attacks in Canada resulting in 29 deaths and at least 60 injuries, according to Rogers.

Worryingly, he said, nearly one in ten terrorism investigations at CSIS, the country's domestic spy agency, include at least one ""subject of investigation"" under the age of 18.

In August, a minor was arrested in Montreal for allegedly planning an attack on behalf of the terrorist group Daesh, according to Rogers.

THE NEW MAFIA: TRUMP, CIVIL RICO AND THE GLOBAL INTIFADA

Just a few months earlier, a 15-year-old Edmonton-area minor was charged with a terrorism-related offense, after Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigators feared the teen would commit serious violence related to COM/764, a transnational violent online network that manipulates children and youth across widely accessible online platforms.

Rogers also noted two 15-year-olds were arrested in Ottawa for allegedly conspiring to conduct a mass casualty attack targeting the Jewish community in Canada's capital in late 2023 and early 2024.

""Clearly, radicalized youth can cause the same harms as radicalized adults, but the societal supports for youth may help us catch radicalization early and prevent it,"" Rogers said. ""These tragic numbers would have been higher if not for disruptive actions taken by CSIS and our law enforcement partners.""

The CSIS joined the RCMP and intelligence partners from the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand in releasing a joint public report in December, highlighting the evolving issue of young people and violent extremism. 

The report provides advice to parents, guardians and others with information to help them identify early concerns and address youth radicalization before it's too late. 

""Since 2022, CSIS has been involved in the disruption of no fewer than 24 violent extremist actions, each resulting in arrests or terrorism peace bond charges,"" Rogers said. ""In 2024, CSIS played an integral role in the disruption of two Daesh-inspired plots. 

""In one case, a father and son were allegedly in the advanced stages of planning an attack in the Toronto area. In another, an individual was arrested before allegedly attempting to illegally enter the United States to attack members of the Jewish community in New York. In these examples, and in many others I can't discuss publicly, our counter-terrorism teams have partnered with law enforcement and saved lives.""

Canadian officials said they also blocked potentially 'lethal threats' by Iran. (Mert Alper Dervis/Anadolu Agency)

He attributed the radicalization to ""eroding social cohesion, increasing polarization and significant global events,"" which he said ""provide fertile ground for radicalization.""

""Many who turn to violence radicalize exclusively online, often without direction from others,"" Rogers said. ""They use technology to do so secretly and anonymously, seriously challenging the ability of our investigators to keep pace and to identify and prevent acts of violence.""

Rogers also noted the CSIS collects intelligence and defends against transnational repression, previously focusing on transnational repression by the People's Republic of China, India and others. 

""In particularly alarming cases over the last year, we've had to reprioritize our operations to counter the actions of Iranian intelligence services and their proxies who have targeted individuals they perceive as threats to their regime,"" he said. ""In more than one case, this involved detecting, investigating and disrupting potentially lethal threats against individuals in Canada.""

Shohei Ohtani spoke with Tom Verducci after the Los Angeles Dodgers' Game 3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series. 

The MLB Most Valuable Player Awards for the 2025 season are official, and while one league had a tight race, it wasn't close in the other. 

After winning his second World Series in as many years with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Shohei Ohtani also has back-to-back NL MVP Awards under his belt after a unanimous vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America.

The two-way Japanese superstar was named the 2025 NL MVP, giving him four over his MLB career. He won his first two in the American League with the Los Angeles Angels. In fact, he has won an MVP Award in each of the last three seasons, having won the 2023 award in his final year as an Angels star.

Now, Ohtani has just Barry Bonds to chase for the most MVP Awards in MLB history. Bonds won seven NL MVPs, a feat some believe is still untouchable. Ohtani was tied with 10 other players with three over their careers, but the 31-year-old is in a new position now and only looking up at Bonds. 

The Philadelphia Phillies' Kyle Schwarber and New York Mets' Juan Soto were the two remaining finalists in the NL. Schwarber received 23 second-place votes to Soto's four. 

Ohtani, a five-time All-Star, led the National League in runs scored (146), slugging percentage (.622) and OPS (1.024), while mashing 55 home runs with 102 RBIs and a .282 average. Ohtani also sported a .392 on-base percentage with 20 intentional walks, which also led the NL. 

And after not being able to pitch in 2024, Ohtani was back on the mound this season with a 2.87 ERA in 14 starts (47 innings) with 62 strikeouts and nine walks. 

PAUL SKENES, TARIK SKUBAL WIN CY YOUNG AWARDS AS TRADE RUMORS SWIRL AROUND STAR PITCHERS

The award is based strictly on the regular season, but Ohtani played a major part in the Dodgers' retaining their World Series title in an epic seven-game series against the Toronto Blue Jays. Over 17 postseason games, Ohtani slashed .265/.405/.691 with eight homers, three doubles and 14 RBIs. 

While it was virtually a lock Ohtani would be named the NL MVP, one of baseball's biggest debates revolved around the AL MVP. Was it going to be New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge going back-to-back, or would Seattle Mariners switch-hitting catcher Cal Raleigh's dream season end with the award?

The baseball writers chose Judge.

Judge received 17 first-place votes to Raleigh's 13, which the BBWAA said was the closest MVP race since 2019.

Judge has won the MVP three of the last four years in the American League.

While Raleigh had Judge beat in the home run department, the Yankees slugger won his first career batting title, leading MLB with a .331 average. He also led all of MLB with a .457 on-base percentage, .688 slugging percentage and 1.144 OPS and was the leader in the American League with 137 runs. 

Judge tallied 114 RBIs, and he was intentionally walked 36 times, blowing away Ohtani's NL-leading total.

BACK-TO-BACK, TWICE: PAT MURPHY, STEPHEN VOGT REPEAT AS MLB MANAGERS OF THE YEAR

This was Judge's seventh All-Star season as he continues to be arguably the best pure hitter in MLB. Unfortunately for him and the pinstripes, they were unable to make the run Ohtani and the Dodgers did. The Yankees were beaten by the AL pennant-winning Blue Jays in the ALDS, though Judge had a memorable moment in Game 3 with a clutch home run off the foul pole to keep the Yankees' season alive. 

Raleigh was one of the greatest baseball stories of the season. It just seemed Raleigh couldn't be stopped, and he couldn't stop breaking records in the process. 

Raleigh hit 60 home runs, which not only led MLB, but set the league record for the most ever by a catcher, a switch-hitter and a Mariners player. He finished with 125 RBIs while slashing .247/.359/.948 in 159 games.

Raleigh played in all but three games this season, which includes 128 games at the league's most demanding position as a catcher. 

Those pulling for Raleigh during the season pointed to how he was consistently breaking records for a position that usually gets overlooked for this type of award. He was a clear factor in the Mariners securing the AL West title for the first time since 2001, and they made a strong run in the postseason, too, before ultimately succumbing to the Blue Jays in Game 7.

Influencer Isabel Brown on findings that Gen Z prefers hybrid or in-office work to fully remote options in the post-COVID era.

Democratic National Committee employees were mercilessly mocked this week after news came out that staffers were very unhappy with a recent directive from DNC Chairman Ken Martin  end to remote work for employees who will now be required to show up to the office five days a week.

Leadership of the union representing DNC employees put out a statement following news of the new directive, describing it as ""callous."" Reports from those on the staff-wide call also described an immediate flurry of thumbs-down emojis and other signs of anger upon news of the new requirement.

""It was shocking to see the DNC chair disregard staff's valid concerns on today's team call,"" they wrote. ""D.N.C. staff worked extremely hard to support historic wins for Democrats up and down the ballot last Tuesday, and this change feels especially callous considering the current economic conditions created by the Trump administration."" Martin reportedly told employees that if they don't like the new policy, they should go find a job elsewhere. 

And Martin wasn't the only Democrat who had some harsh and pointed words for the Democratic Party staffers. Neera Tanden, former President Joe Biden's domestic policy advisor, had a similar message for DNC staffers, suggesting there were many eager folks waiting in line who would likely be more than willing to go into the office.

""If you think democracy is on the line – working in the office is not a big ask,"" Tanden wrote in a post on X. ""And there are plenty of other people willing to step up. Get yourselves together people.""

A left-wing group, the Center for New Liberalism, echoed the view that the staffers ""should look elsewhere"" if working from home is a ""must-have.""

""When you accept a job on a campaign, or with an org like the DNC, DCCC, etc, your single purpose is to win the election. It is a demanding job that requires long hours & sacrifices,"" the group wrote on X. ""The other part of this is that I suspect [work from home] staff are probably losing opportunities for themselves by not being in the office. Campaigns require a lot of personal sacrifice, but the people who are good at their job and work to make themselves noticed in the office usually tend to go on to do big things!""

One Florida-based Democratic strategist, Steve Schale, who led Barack Obama's statewide efforts in Florida in 2008 and returned to help his campaign in 2012, said the DNC should implement a ""requirement"" to ensure those who want to work at the DNC really have what it takes.   

""There should be a requirement that to work at the DNC that you've done at least two cycles on an actual battleground campaign, where terms like flex hours & hybrid work don't exist,"" Schale wrote on X.

Meanwhile, Republicans did not spare the opportunity to slam Democratic Party staffers as well.  

""You can't make this up -- the DNC union is pissed that the Chairman is calling staff back into the office 5 days a week,"" former Trump White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said after learning of the anger. GOP strategist, Matt Gorman, quipped that the image of DNC staffers logging onto a Zoom call in their pajamas amid all the chaos of Biden's reelection ""is hilarious.""

""The best part is that they still get two full months before they actually have to get out of bed 5 days week,"" GOP National Press Secretary Kiersten Pels said. ""Is this a political committee or a daycare?""

Martin reportedly told his employees that the work-from-home policy the DNC implemented during COVID was never meant to be permanent, describing it as a ""Band-Aid"" that has long needed to be ripped off. He did say that remote work would still be allowed on a case-by-case basis, however.

The staffer's union said it is considering all options in terms of challenging the measure. The group previously ratified a collective bargaining agreement with the DNC over the summer that ""reaffirms its commitment to making hybrid work available,"" but also includes language that allows for a full return to in-person working as long as there is a 60-day notice period, according to the New York Times.     

Earlier this year, the Congressional Progressive Staff Association sent a letter to top House and Senate leaders proposing a rotating 32-hour work week for congressional staffers, arguing it would be a more ""sustainable approach to work on a national level.""

The proposal was widely mocked, however. 

""Why not be bold and ask for a 0-hour workweek?"" quipped Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., at the time. ""I wonder how blue-collar Americans would feel about white-collar workers demanding a 32-hour workweek.""

Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor reports on ICE's joint operation with Florida law enforcement targeting illegal sexual offenders and convicted murderers on ‘The Story'.

Locals in San Francisco, California, have begun passing out whistles to communicate and coordinate against ICE deportations.

Activists and organizations have started distributing whistles for local residents to coordinate against the federal government's immigration enforcement efforts, SFGate reported. 

""By following the same whistle code, locals can communicate from afar: Three short whistles signal that ICE is nearby, and one long whistle means that somebody is being detained,"" SFGate reported. 

Frameline, the nonprofit behind San Francisco's LGBTQ+ Frameline film festival, has been stocking ""whistle stops"" in the city, where people can pick up free whistles and join anti-ICE efforts. The organization explained in a post on Instagram that it was inspired by efforts in Chicago.

In an email to SFGATE, Roxie Theater manager Gabriella Siaton, whose venue is one of multiple participating whistle stops, said the theater's initial supply of whistles was gone within a day of arrival.

""Prior to this, I had not heard about the whistle code,"" she wrote. ""I knew there were different sharings on social media regarding ICE agents being spotted in the Mission, but I appreciate how the whistle allows for a more instant and in-the-moment response.""

This trend appears to have begun with Chicago's local anti-ICE efforts, where there are entire group meetups to assemble whistles to give out. 

""The sound of a whistle tells immigrants and other vulnerable community members to run away while also urging fellow neighbors to gather in a crowd and run toward the scene to film arrests,"" the California news outlet wrote.

Similar efforts reportedly date back long before the immigration crackdowns of 2025, all the way back at least to the 1970s, where LGBTQ+ groups used whistles to alert people of alleged hate crimes in progress.

""We were inspired by the bold legacy of queer resistance — from San Francisco's Butterfly Brigade blowing whistles in the Castro to defend each other from violence to the community organizing coming out of Chicago now,"" Frameline's executive director Allegra Madsen told SFGate.

A flight carrying four federal lawmakers to Washington, D.C., was diverted to Kansas City after a passenger became disruptive and shouted about a ‘fascist state.' (@Adam_Burtner via X)

An American Airlines flight carrying four members of Arizona's congressional delegation to Washington, D.C., diverted Tuesday to Kansas City, Missouri, after a passenger became disruptive.

The airline told Fox News Digital that Flight 1218 left Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport Nov. 11, 2025, and was rerouted because of ""a disruptive customer.""

""On Nov. 11, American Airlines flight 1218, with service from Phoenix (PHX) to Washington, D.C. (DCA), diverted to Kansas City (MCI) due to a disruptive customer,"" American Airlines told Fox News Digital. ""Law enforcement met the flight and removed the customer, and the flight later re-departed for DCA, where it landed normally.

""We thank our customers for their patience and our crew members for their professionalism.""

Rep. Greg Stanton, a Democrat from Arizona, posted on X that he and three Republican colleagues — Reps. Eli Crane, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar — were aboard when the incident occurred.

""Flying to DC rn to vote no on CR that fails to lower health care costs. @RepEliCrane, @RepAndyBiggsAZ & @RepGosar all on this flight. We're making emergency stop in Kansas City to remove disruptive passenger. None of my colleagues is the disruptor. Freedom Caucus losing its mojo,"" Stanton wrote.

Flight data shows the Airbus A320 had been airborne for roughly two hours and 40 minutes before diverting to Kansas City International Airport around 6:15 p.m. local time.

Video posted to X by another passenger shows Kansas City police officers boarding the plane to remove a woman who apologized as she was led away, saying, ""We live in a fascist state.""

The flight departed again about an hour later and landed at Reagan National Airport shortly after 10 p.m.

""On a serious note, thank you Kansas City police for handling the situation professionally and without incident,"" Stanton later wrote.

Stanton said he was headed to Washington to vote against the Republican continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, while his GOP colleagues supported the plan.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Epstein Returns at the Worst Time for Trump","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/11/jeffrey-epstein-trump-emails/684926/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:23:00 GMT","

The president is desperate to make the questions go away, but there is no sign they will.

Since his return to office, President Donald Trump has missed few chances to flex the power he wields over the nation's most formidable institutions and its wealthiest people. So when the White House announced that Trump would host the latest in a series of dinners with top business executives, this time including JPMorgan Chase head Jamie Dimon and the chief executive of Nasdaq, reporters in the White House press pool prepared to watch Trump show off.



Nope. Last night's dinner was closed to the press. No reporter was even given a glance. And later, when the White House held a signing ceremony for the president to officially end the longest federal-government shutdown in history, the reporters present were quickly whisked out of the Oval Office. Today, too, he didn't talk to the press after signing an executive order alongside the first lady in the East Room. The president, to be clear, had not suddenly become camera-shy. But he had indicated to aides that he didn't want to face reporters' questions, because every inquiry was going to be about the one subject that Trump, for all his power, simply can't make go away.



Jeffrey Epstein is dead. But the disgraced financier and sex offender continues to shadow Trump. The storyline's reemergence yesterday—with the release of thousands of Epstein's emails, some of which highlight his relationship with Trump—delivered another blow to a president already at the weakest moment of his second term. Trump's party got wiped out in last week's elections as voters assigned it the greater portion of blame for the shutdown. The Supreme Court seems set to unravel his signature tariffs. His poll numbers have dipped as Americans conclude that he cares too much about gilded ballrooms and is not focused nearly enough on bringing down high prices. And dread has crept into the West Wing now that Trump faces a rare rebuke from fellow Republicans, including some who have been among his most loyal MAGA foot soldiers.



Trump and a number of top Department of Justice officials this week tried to persuade a pair of normally close allies, Representatives Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace, to withdraw their names from a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing a trove of Epstein material. Their efforts failed, and it will go to the House floor next week. The president in the past two days has made a round of calls to longtime allies to rage against the Epstein matter, blaming Democrats and the media, one of the people who received a call told me. (A White House official later confirmed that the president was “speaking to trusted friends”; both people spoke with me under the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.) In those calls, Trump mused about pressuring GOP senators to block the release of additional files when the matter could go to the upper chamber later this month.



Read: Wait, are the Epstein files real now?



The White House's push to keep more Epstein materials from being released came after Democrats on the House Oversight Committee leaked emails yesterday morning that suggested close ties between the sex offender and Trump. House Republicans, hoping to distract from the initial emails, released an additional 23,000 messages. (Some of those emails, including one in which Epstein offered to give the Russian government information on Trump, only raised more uncomfortable questions for the president.) All of this came after Speaker Mike Johnson sent the House home for nearly eight weeks, in part so that he could delay swearing in the Democratic representative-elect whose vote provided the needed margin to authorize the release of the Epstein files. And although Trump has avoided reporters, his anger broke into the open on social media yesterday.



“The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein hoax again” to distract from the shutdown, Trump posted. “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.”



All of this, of course, raises the question: What exactly is Trump trying to prevent from being released? For months, White House aides have snapped at reporters who even mentioned the word Epstein. But in private moments, members of the president's inner circle acknowledge that they don't know the true extent of Trump's relationship with Epstein. The men were close, to be sure, and clearly enjoyed chasing women decades ago in the party circles of Manhattan and Palm Beach. That's been known for years, and although that history is embarrassing, Trump has never been charged with any wrongdoing. Is he trying to protect himself? Or someone close to him? He doesn't talk about it, allies say, except to fume that it's still a story. But Trump's over-the-top response prompted the ally he called to urge Trump to change tactics because he's “not acting like someone who has nothing to hide.”



Trump was always an unlikely champion for those on the right who believed in the Epstein conspiracy theories. The men were undeniably friends. There are plenty of photos of them together, including at Trump's private Mar-a-Lago Club. Trump flew on Epstein's private jets seven times in the mid-1990s, according to flight logs that emerged at an Epstein-related trial. And in a 2002 New York magazine profile of Epstein, Trump said he'd known Epstein for 15 years and praised him as a “terrific guy.” The financier pleaded guilty in Florida state court in 2008 and was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute. He received a generous—and controversial—plea deal and served a short prison sentence before being released. He was arrested again in August 2019 and was accused of sex-trafficking minors. Epstein died a month later in jail, while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide, but many on the far right suspected that he had been killed to keep him from revealing what he knew about the rich and the powerful. The so-called Epstein files—an accounting of who else in his orbit might have been involved—became something of an obsession in the MAGA movement. Though Trump never quite championed that cause, he led many to believe that, were he to return to power, he'd expose the truth and deliver justice.



That's not at all what has happened. Even after Attorney General Pam Bondi declared early this year that she had the Epstein files on her desk, only scattered documents were released to right-wing influencers. Trump then made clear that he wanted to move on, blasting those still obsessed with Epstein, who, in the president's words, has been “dead for a long time. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is.” He sued his on-again, off-again friend Rupert Murdoch for $10 billion after The Wall Street Journal reported in July that Trump had sent Epstein a lewd birthday card in 2003.

But some in Trump's base felt betrayed, like he was trying to invalidate a core political belief of theirs. And some Republicans refused to abandon the issue. Four of them—Mace, Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Thomas Massie—defied Trump to vote with Democrats this week on the Epstein discharge position. Boebert and Greene did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesperson for Massie said the representative was unavailable. A spokesperson for Mace responded by pointing to a social-media post in which the candidate for governor in South Carolina urged a focus on the women and underage girls whom Epstein trafficked. If the measure passes both houses of Congress, Trump would likely veto it—and face even more scrutiny.



Indeed, Trump's own efforts to manage the story have only fed it. His account of why he and Epstein had a falling-out two decades ago has shifted multiple times. His aides have advised him to stop saying that he has the right to pardon Epstein's former partner Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking and related offenses. (Maxwell was transferred to a cushier prison in Texas over the summer after an unusual one-on-one meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Trump's former personal lawyer.) White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt raised eyebrows yesterday when she said that Trump was not considering a pardon for Maxwell “at this moment in time.” The White House did not respond to my request for comment.



Few people in the White House believe that the Epstein matter will swing many votes next year. But it has the makings of an unrelenting distraction, a scandal that could bog down Trump's presidency. Further Republican rebellions could loosen Trump's grip on the GOP just as he is trying to preserve his party's Capitol Hill majorities. Should he lose one or both of the houses of Congress next year, he'd face congressional investigations and be firmly relegated to lame-duck status.

Trump is set to depart Washington tomorrow for another weekend at Mar-a-Lago, according to the White House. At the lush Palm Beach club, where he once palled around with Epstein, the president will surely talk to allies, eager to change the subject from the one consuming his administration.



A travel press pool will also make the trip to Florida on Air Force One. At least for now, Trump is not scheduled to take questions.

When QAnon meets Veep

Some generations get a nationally televised car chase featuring O. J. Simpson fleeing police in a white Bronco. Others get the communal adrenaline rush of frantically “CTRL-F”-ing a House Oversight Committee trove of Jeffrey Epstein's emails.



Yesterday, lawmakers released more than 20,000 pages of documents related to Epstein, including thousands of emails between him and his powerful contacts in the government, Silicon Valley, and the British royalty. There is an obvious voyeuristic thrill to reading them, but these documents have a deeper relevance. They are a skeleton key for understanding the dynamics of Donald Trump's America, one in which the wealthy and powerful appear not as master operators but as bumbling sycophants, eager to cozy up to influence no matter how villainous or depraved.



Like Epstein's birthday book, published in September by the House Oversight Committee, the messages are often enthusiastic, even fawning (unlike the birthday book, these messages were sent long after Epstein took a plea deal to reduce his sentence for sex-trafficking charges). His interlocutors ask for favors, seeking insight or dirt on Trump, or advice. In some instances, Epstein responds pompously (“Needs edit,” he wrote in one message, when asked to forward an invitation). When glimpses of his character come through in a message—“‘Girls?',, careful i will renew an old habit,” he replied to an innocuous email that used the word girls—they seem to always be tolerated or ignored.

But perhaps most striking is how unimpressive Epstein seems. He appears to have been a serial emailer, frequently pecking out barely legible, one-line messages in rapid succession to political advisers, journalists, and well-known personalities such as Peter Thiel and Deepak Chopra. (Reached through a spokesperson about his email correspondence with Epstein, Chopra told me, “I'm always cognizant of Dr. and patient privilege. However, in this case, I hope that all of the truth comes out after ongoing and proper investigations. I'm happy to share whatever I know with authorized officials. Otherwise there are only endless speculations without knowing the context.”)





The emails reminded me of the Elon Musk text messages that were made public in 2022 as part of a legal dispute with Twitter: Here we have another coterie of men infatuated with their own ideas and engaged in shallow conversations and insipid gossip. In one representative email exchange, the economist Larry Summers—the former president of Harvard and a member of the Obama and Clinton administrations—griped about women to Epstein: “I'm trying to figure why American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard, but hit on a few women 10 years ago and can't work at a network or think tank,” Summers wrote. He then added, “DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.” A spokesperson for Summers declined to comment. Summers has previously acknowledged “regretting my past associations with Mr. Epstein.”



Read: Elon Musk's text messages explain everything



Some of the emails read like absurdist tone poems. In one email to himself with the subject line “radical breakthrough,” Epstein appears to be free-associating and journaling his thoughts about anatomy, science, and consciousness, jotting down disconnected phrases such as “Skin as part of brain?” and “Beards and long hair   , are meant to catch and hold smells. ?”



Other emails are unnerving, given that Epstein was arrested for allegedly sex-trafficking minors. In March 2016, he emailed Thomas Barrack, a Trump ally and the current United States ambassador to Turkey, “Send photos of you and child. — make me smile.” A State Department representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.



Trump has personally called the emails part of a hoax. “The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,” he wrote on Truth Social yesterday.



The emails show that, in the lead-up to and during the first Trump administration, Epstein was in communication with journalists looking for dirt on the president. He also frequently discussed his relationship with Trump. “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump,” Epstein wrote in 2011 to Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator, who is serving time in prison for child sex-trafficking. Epstein said in one email to himself that Trump “came to my house many times.” In another, Epstein wrote that he once “gave” a 20-year-old girlfriend to Trump; in yet another, he alleged that Trump “spent hours” with a “victim,” as the redacted document says, while at Epstein's home. At one point, Epstein emailed a journalist: “Would you like photos of donald and girls in bikinis   in my kitchen?” Across these messages to various correspondents, Epstein describes Trump as “dirty,” worse “in real life and upclose,” and “borderline insane.”



Yet it also seems that Epstein was acting as an informal adviser to people in Trump world; prominent Trump associates such as Thiel and Steve Bannon corresponded with him. One email with Bannon suggests that he and Epstein were scheduled to have dinner in March 2018. (A spokesperson for Thiel has said that he never visited Epstein's island; Bannon did not respond to a request for comment.) One email dated August 21, 2018, to an unknown recipient captures this dynamic. Epstein writes:



1. Peter Thiel in town. 2. Lets make sure you are keeping your own path on front burner. Strategy etc. 3 at the same time . Take no heat re me. Not worth it for the moment. Mid terms . Over exposure , create shooting star risks. 4. The mooch ( still in contact with Ivanka ) has reached out to me ,  and asked how he can re engage with you. ?? I ve only met him once. odd. 5 /



He follows that message with the equally cryptic “Like musk, your health first. Its a very long game.”



This is a near-perfect representation of the Epstein trove in all of its dizzying, typo-plagued ingloriousness. Epstein's pidgin writing style, paired with his name-dropping and vagueness, makes emails like this excellent fodder for both speculation and genuine concern. There's enough detail to cause the mind to race, and not quite enough to get a full picture of what is going on. It's conspiracy-theory jet fuel, yet it seems to point to some very real behind-the-scenes maneuvering.



There's a surreal quality to reading these messages for yourself. At times, some of the emails read almost like QAnon fan fiction. One of the eerier documents is an email from Epstein sent to himself six days before his 2019 arrest with the subject line “list for bannon steve.” The body of the email is just a list of a few dozen names, some recognizable, some not. There is no context here, just names, rattled off by the subject of the 21st century's most durable conspiracy theory just 41 days before his mysterious death in a jail cell.



It's too early to tell what the release of these emails will ultimately accomplish. The messages certainly suggest that Epstein and Trump had a longer and closer relationship than the president previously said, and they imply that Trump had, at minimum, firsthand knowledge of Epstein's depravity. The House is now poised to hold a vote as part of a bipartisan effort to force the Justice Department to release a broader set of documents related to the case, known colloquially as the Epstein files.



Read: The Epstein ‘client list' will never go away



As grist for the algorithmic mills of social media, the emails are a cursed document—one that seems all but certain to sow maximum chaos online. There are enough famous names, insinuations, and revelations that the messages are inherently newsworthy. But they are also a perfect storm of context collapse—a massive, searchable supply of salacious and screenshottable fodder, dumped online for anyone with any political motive to post. Given that many of Epstein's correspondents are redacted and that threads start and stop randomly, many of the emails are perfect building blocks for constructing plausible but ultimately unprovable narratives. On X, the far-right influencer Jack Posobiec suggested that the emails actually show Epstein and other associates “trying to figure out ways to enwrap Trump into this.” In right-wing spheres, Epstein's email to the journalist Michael Wolff, which includes the assertion that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,” is now being used as proof of Trump acting heroically to intervene. “Trump was the first to expose Epstein. That's why they came after him,” Infowars' Alex Jones said on his show. (An attorney for Wolff did not respond to a request for comment.)



Read: MAGA's next top influencer



The emails are corrosive in another way too. When Epstein's birthday book was released, I argued that the fawning messages therein were more proof that “there is a festering rot among at least one group of powerful elites with an abiding belief that their money and power make them invincible.” Now we know that the birthday book was just the tip of the iceberg. Although the extent of Epstein's crimes might not have been known to all of his correspondents, he was still a registered sex offender who took a highly unusual plea deal to avoid a long prison sentence for child sex-trafficking—yet this doesn't appear to have stopped people from wringing whatever value they could from him. What the obsequious emails to Epstein seem to illustrate is that many people with influence were willing to overlook his crimes, horrific behavior, and witless observations as long as there was something in it for them.



In this respect, it's hard not to see these emails as something like a final nail in the coffin when it comes to a broader distrust and contempt for the ruling class of lawmakers, gatekeepers, and the ultra-wealthy. The populist sentiment that elites are corrupt and operate with impunity is one that Trump and the MAGA movement have harnessed successfully. Trump himself has amplified and endorsed the QAnon conspiracy theory, which offers a dramatic fantasy that a cabal of pedophiles is controlling world events from the shadows. Like many durable conspiracy theories, QAnon depicts an immoral elite that is both evil and hyper-competent. There is always a master plan shrouded in secrecy and protected by code words.



From the June 2020 issue: The prophecies of Q



The Epstein revelations of the past few months suggest that these conspiracies actually do represent reality in some way—plainly speaking, some of the most powerful people in the world were communicating with one another through the kingpin of an alleged child-sex-trafficking operation. But the emails also prove that the truth is dumber than fiction. These global elites are far from organized and hyper-competent—it feels like how Veep would have treated QAnon. The elites don't message with sex pests using code words; they openly muse about having fun with girls at “Hawaiian Tropic” parties.



That reading these emails feels surreal makes sense—they shatter the myth of genius and merit that the ruling class tries carefully and spends exorbitantly to cultivate, and they affirm the worst suspicions of the conspiracy-minded. As more revelations are made public, it may feel like the conspiracy theorists have won. But they've been wrong as well. Cabal is too flattering a word for this crowd of cosplaying, hunt-and-peck email addicts. Conspiracy theories are a flawed tool meant to help make sense of a nonsensical world. The truth is darker: You don't need an elaborate master plan to dodge accountability when everyone's all too willing to simply look the other way.

Transportation Security Administration officers ""who served with exemplary service"" during the 43-day government shutdown will receive $10,000 bonus checks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced on Thursday.

She was seen onstage in Houston giving out bumper $10,000 bonuses to TSA agents.

Noem said this reward was in addition to back pay, which agents are set to receive in the coming days.

Before giving out the checks to around a dozen staff standing behind her, Noem lauded TSA officers who'd worked without pay for ""outstanding patriotism and service.""

""We're going to continue to evaluate every single employee that helped during the shutdown and stepped up and went above and beyond,"" Noem said, adding that employees will be rewarded if they performed ""exceptional service.""

It is unclear how many TSA agents will get this bonus.

DHS said in a press release on Thursday that it is paying for these bonuses using carryover funds from fiscal year 2025.

""This funding is available thanks to President Trump and Secretary Noem's commitment to fiscal responsibility, enabling DHS to save the American taxpayer over $13.2 billion since President Trump returned to office,"" the press release said.

Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and TSA did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Noem also said on Thursday that Americans were ""damaged and harmed by what Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and the Democratic Party did,"" blaming congressional Democrats for triggering the shutdown.

In an earlier clip in October, Noem said TSA operations had been disrupted and that most employees were working without pay because ""Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government.""

Noem's move comes after President Donald Trump recommended on Monday that air traffic controllers who did not call in sick during the shutdown should receive a $10,000 bonus.

""For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Monday, adding that those who continued working are ""GREAT PATRIOTS.""

Air traffic controllers who failed to come back to work immediately would be substantially ""docked,"" Trump said, presumably referring to their salary.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Tuesday that air traffic controllers could be penalized if they stopped working before missing a paycheck.

The government shutdown ended on Wednesday after a prolonged back-and-forth in the Senate and House. Some Democratic lawmakers broke with the party line this week and voted with their GOP colleagues to end the shutdown, funding the government through January 30.

The 43-day shutdown was the longest in US history. It caused widespread travel chaos, as air traffic controllers faced staffing shortages, and FAA flight reductions led to widespread cancellations.

On November 6, the FAA ordered airlines to cut flights by 4% at 40 major airports, a reduction that took effect last Friday.The FAA added that the flight reductions would be mandated to increase to 10% by Friday to ""maintain the highest standards of safety.""

But even with the shutdown now over, travel disruptions are expected to stretch into Thanksgiving, which is typically the busiest travel period of the year.

Pressed on when flight schedules might return to normal, Duffy said Tuesday that delays would likely continue even after the shutdown ended, citing ongoing shortages of air traffic controllers.

China's slowdown worsened in October, dragged by soft consumer demand and a deepening property downturn, with the long holiday period further denting factory activity.

Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, contracted 1.7% for the first ten months of the year, steepening from a 0.5% decline in the January-to-September period, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Friday. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.8% drop.

The last time China recorded a contraction in fixed-asset investment was in 2020 during the pandemic, according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information, a private database focused on the country.

On a single-month basis, fixed-asset investment fell 11.4% from a year earlier, the weakest reading since early 2020 when the first Covid lockdowns hit, according to Goldman Sachs' estimates. The bank attributed the drop to Beijing's efforts in reining in industrial overcapacity and the housing downturn.

Within that segment, property investment continued to decline, shrinking 14.7% in the year through October, compared with a 13.9% contraction in the first nine months.

Manufacturing investment rose 2.7% and utilities spending, which includes electricity, fuel and water supplies, climbed 12.5%.

Industrial output expanded 4.9% in October, slowing from a 6.5% the prior month and missing expectations for a 5.5% jump.

China's manufacturing activity contracted more than expected in October, falling to the lowest level in six months, as a weeklong holiday that ran from Oct. 1 to Oct. 8 shuttered most factories across the country.

Retail sales climbed 2.9% in October from a year earlier. While beating the 2.8% growth forecast in a Reuters poll, the consumption gauge fell for a fifth straight month to its lowest level this year, according to LSEG data.

The survey-based urban unemployment rate ticked down to 5.1% last month from 5.2% in September.

The sharp drop in fixed-asset investment was largely dragged down by lackluster investment in the property sector and infrastructure, according to Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.

Manufacturing investment has seen ""modest and uneven growth,"" with state-owned enterprises increasing spending on infrastructure, such as electricity, heat and gas supply, while foreign investment contracted sharply, Yuhan Zhang, principal economist of the Conference Board's China Center, said in a note.

""We will continue to see policy-directed investment in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and industrial upgrading,"" he added.

In a sign of persistently weak demand in the beleaguered housing sector, separate official data released on Friday showed China's new home prices dipped 0.5% in October from the previous month, the steepest month-on-month decline since October last year. Home prices fell 2.2% in October on an annual basis.

Consumer prices rose 0.2% from a year earlier in October, the strongest inflation reading since January this year and the first positive growth since June, according to LSEG data.

The core CPI, which strips out food and energy, rose 1.2% from a year earlier, the highest since February 2024, according to data provider Wind Information.

China's exports in October unexpectedly contracted for the first time in nearly two years as tensions with Washington over trade escalated before a deal was reached at the month's end.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed last month to trim their tit-for-tat tariffs and suspend a raft of restrictive measures for one year.

Economists widely expect the  as businesses' front-loading activity tapers off, and global demand may not fully offset a deepening decline in U.S.-bound shipments, putting Beijing under greater pressure to stimulate domestic demand.

""I don't expect stimulus to happen in the rest of this year,"" said Zhang, noting the economy appears to remain on track to achieve its 5% growth target, although fiscal policy may turn more supportive at the start of next year.

China's economic growth slowed to 4.8% in the third quarter, following expansions of 5.2% in the second quarter and 5.4% in the first quarter.

SINGAPORE - Amid fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, much has been made of recent reports suggesting that AI has yet to generate returns for companies investing billions into adopting the tech. 

But that's not what the chief executive of Southeast Asia's largest bank is seeing — she says her firm is already reaping the rewards of its AI initiatives, and it's only just the beginning. 

""It's not hope. It's now. It's already happening. And it will get even better,"" DBS CEO Tan Su Shan told CNBC  on the sidelines of Singapore Fintech Week, when asked about the promise of AI adoption.  

DBS has been working to implement artificial intelligence across its bank for over a decade, which helped prepare its internal data analytics for recent waves of generative and agentic AI. 

Agentic AI is a type of artificial intelligence that relies on data to proactively make independent decisions, plan and execute tasks autonomously, with minimal human oversight.

Tan expects AI adoption to bring DBS an overall revenue bump of more than 1 billion Singapore dollars (about $768 million) this year, compared to SG$750 million in 2024. That assessment is based on about 370 AI use cases powered by over 1,500 models throughout its business. 

""The proliferation of generative AI has been transformative for us,"" Tan said, adding that the company was experiencing a ""snowballing effect"" of benefits thanks to machine learning. 

A major area in which DBS has applied AI is in its financial services to institutional clients, with AI used to collect and leverage data for clients in order to better contextualize and personalize offerings. 

According to Tan, this has resulted in ""faster and more resilient"" teams. The CEO believes that these uses of AI have contributed to a recent uptick in the bank's deposit growth as compared to competitors'.

The company also recently launched a newly enhanced AI-powered assistant for corporate clients known as ""DBS Joy,"" which assists clients with unique corporate banking queries around the clock. 

Despite Tan's strong convictions about AI, recent evidence suggests that many companies are struggling to turn their AI investments into tangible profits. 

MIT released a report in July that found 95% of 300 publicly disclosed AI initiatives, encompassing generative AI investments of $30–$40 billion, had failed to achieve real returns. 

However, at least in the banking sector, there are signs that the tides are turning. 

While DBS doesn't differentiate spending in generative AI from other in-house investments, other major banks have recently offered this comparison. 

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated in an interview with Bloomberg TV last month that the bank is already breaking even on its approximately $2 billion of annual investments in AI adoption. That represents ""just the tip of the iceberg,"" he added.

Those expectations are shared by DBS, which plans to continue to accelerate its AI development to become an AI-powered bank.

The ultimate goal, according to Tan, is for its generative AI to develop into a trusted financial advisor for clients, including retail users who are expected to interact with personalized AI agents through the DBS banking app. 

The bank already has over 100 AI algorithms that analyze users' data to provide them with personalized ""nudges,"" such as alerts on incoming shortfalls, product recommendations, and other insights. 

While DBS may already be reaping rewards from its AI adoption, Tan acknowledged that it will require continued investments, not only in capital, but in the time needed to reskill employees. 

The company has launched several AI reskilling initiatives across departments this year and has even deployed a generative AI-powered coaching tool to support these efforts. 

This will help the company automate mundane work and refocus its staff on building and maintaining human-to-human relationships with customers, rather than reducing headcount, Tan said. 

""We're not freezing hiring, but it does mean reskilling. And that's a journey. It's a never-ending journey ... a constant evolution.""

				Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today


U.S. markets had their worst day since Oct. 10. That marks a sharp reversal for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which shed 1.65% to settle at 47,457.22, a day after it closed above 48,000 for the first time. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost 1.66% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.29%.

The slump in stocks can partly be traced to a turnaround in sentiment regarding artificial intelligence. Tech behemoths such as Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle slumped, with the last losing more than one-third in value since it rocketed 36% in September.

Investors, it seems, are growing worried over the high valuations of tech names, as well as the gigantic amount of capital expenditure they are committing to — with some, like Oracle, having to take on debt to fulfil those obligations.

Uncertainty over an interest rate cut in December is also putting a downer on Wall Street. It's a coin toss as to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy then, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That's a huge difference from a month ago, when traders were pricing in a 95.5% chance of a December cut.

Not having October's employment and inflation numbers, and possibly never getting them, means the Fed lacks visibility into the state of the economy — and whether it should try to support the labor market or continue reining in inflation.

After all, flying blind makes it hard to see where you'll land. As of now, that applies both to the Fed and investors trying to navigate the still-hazy ambitions of tech companies.

U.S. stocks pull back on AI sell-off. All major U.S. indexes fell Thursday stateside dragged down by heavyweight technology names. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 retreated 0.61%, with most bourses in the red.

A December rate cut doesn't seem so certain. A lack of economic data because of the government shutdown — now ended — is complicating the Fed's decision. Fed official Susan Collins on Wednesday said holding rates will ""likely be appropriate.""

Elon Musk's xAI is raising $15 billion. A large amount of money in this latest funding round will go toward graphic processing units, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber. Musk called the news ""False"" in a post on X.

China's Singles' Day sales stumble. The Double 11 shopping festival this year marked a 14.2% year-on-year growth in sales, according to Chinese consumer research firm Syntun, trailing last year's 26.6% increase.

[PRO] Be wary of stocks with zero revenue. The year-to-date rally in stocks means some could be trading at elevated prices. CNBC Pro found a few names with market caps of at least $1 billion — but haven't generated revenue over the last 12 months.

Wall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'

Two months ago, Oracle's stock soared 36% to a record after the company blew away investors with its forecast for cloud infrastructure revenue. Since then, the company has lost one-third of its value, more than wiping out those gains.

The mood of late has turned, with investors questioning whether the AI market ran too far, too fast and whether OpenAI can live up to its $300 billion commitment to Oracle over five years. Of the big cloud companies in the GPU business, Oracle is expected to generate the least amount of free cash flow, said Jackson Ader, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Stock futures are little changed Thursday night after Wall Street witnessed its worst day in more than a month.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65 points, or 0.1%. S&P futures ticked up about  0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.08%. 

Major U.S. indexes, along with the small-cap Russell 2000 index, posted big losses on Thursday to close out their worst one-day performance since Oct. 10. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 800 points, or 1.7%, taking back gains seen in Wednesday's session when it crossed the 48,000 level.

Technology giants came away battered in the previous session, putting the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite on pace to snap its seven-week win streak. Nvidia and Broadcom notably declined 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively, while Google parent Alphabet fell 2.8%.

Concerns about the artificial intelligence trade have emerged more seriously this week, with the recent wipeout in once-hot cloud stock Oracle further spooking investors about elevated tech valuations, a massive surge in debt financing and soaring AI capex plans. To be sure, Oracle's growth is uniquely more reliant on its cloud deal with OpenAI and the company has far less cash compared to hyperscalers.

""We saw what happened in 2021. Those stocks got destroyed, everything was okay for a while, and then it turned out that the rest of the market had more of a reset to do as well,"" Yung-Yu Ma, PNC Asset Management chief investment strategist, said Thursday. ""I do think a lot of the market is underpinned by the AI trade. I still think this pullback is a healthy pullback here. And you have this push and pull in the market, you have this reset of investor sentiment but you also have a lot of broken failed breakouts and broken charts. And that does take a while to rebuild.""

Mounting unease about the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision also added pressure to the market on Thursday. Traders are now pricing in a nearly 52% chance that the central bank will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point during their December meeting, which is lower than the 62.9% likelihood that markets priced in a day ago and 95.5% chance a month ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

The U.S. government shutdown, which was the longest in history, ended Wednesday evening after stretching on for more than six weeks. That development had been expected to end a period of time where investors were operating without important economic data. Instead, it has raised new questions. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested that some economic data that was due out during the impasse might never be released. Now, some investors think it might make the Fed less inclined to cut rates.

Week to date, the S&P 500 is up about 0.1% and the 30-stock Dow is higher by 1%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq is down nearly 0.6% this week.

LISBON, Portugal — Top tech executives told CNBC they're concerned about a bubble forming in the artificial intelligence sector, underscoring growing unease within the industry over soaring valuation.

In recent weeks, markets have been reckoning with the notion that too much capital is pouring into the AI boom, clouding the outlook on revenue and actual profit and putting high valuations into question.

Up to now, warnings around overstretched valuations have mostly come from investors and leaders in the world of finance. Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick have warned of potential corrections as valuations of some major tech firms reached historic highs.

The concerns have been crystallized by famed 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry, who this week accused major AI infrastructure and cloud providers, or 'hyperscalers' of understating depreciation expenses on chips. Burry warned that profits at the likes of Oracle and Meta may be vastly overstated. He recently disclosed put options that bet against Nvidia and Palantir.

However, CEOs of companies who are themselves developing AI, expressed their concerns this week during interviews with CNBC at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon.

""I think the evaluations are pretty exaggerated here and there, and I think there is signs of a bubble on the horizon,"" Jarek Kutylowski, CEO of German AI firm DeepL, told CNBC on Tuesday.

The sentiment was echoed by Picsart CEO Hovhannes Avoyan.

""We see lots of AI companies raising ... tremendous valuations ... without any revenue,"" Avoyan told CNBC on Tuesday, adding that it is a ""concern.""

The market values smaller startups with ""just some noise and vibe revenue,"" he said, referring to companies being backed even though they have minimal sales.

Vibe revenue is a play on ""vibe coding,"" a term that refers to using AI to code without needing deep technical expertise.

Even with concerns over valuations, the technology industry remains bullish on the long term potential of AI.

Lyft CEO David Risher said there are reasons to be optimistic given the potential impact of AI but acknowledged the risks.

""Let's be clear, we are absolutely in a financial bubble. There is no question, right? Because this is incredible, transformational technology. No one wants to be left behind.""

Risher went on to argue that there is a difference between the financial bubble and the industrial outlook.

""The data centers and all the model creation, all of that is going to have a long, long life, because it's transformational. It makes people's lives easier. It makes people's lives better… On the other hand, you know, the financial side, it's a little risky right now.""

The tech CEOs also addressed their outlook on AI demand for 2026 from businesses, as investors look for any clues as to what this will look like.

""I think there's a lot of demand, and there's a lot of interest. I think everybody understands that AI can do magical things to businesses, and... we can all operate on another level when it comes to efficiency,"" Kutylowski said.

Still, businesses are ""strugging in adopting"" AI. ""We're going to get further, but I don't think we're that we're going to be in a place where we can say, like every enterprise, every organization, has it figured out totally,"" Kutylowski said.

DeepL's core product is an AI translation tool but it recently launched a more general purpose ""agent"" designed to be able to carry out tasks on behalf of employees.

Francois Chadwick, the chief financial officer of Cohere, a company that is also focused on enterprise AI, told CNBC on Tuesday that ""demand is definitely there.""

Despite the concerns over overstretched valuations and huge capex spend, the investment into artificial intelligence doesn't appear to be slowing down. A report from venture capital group Accel released this week showed that the buildout of new AI data center capacity is forecast to reach 117 gigawatts by 2030 which translates into about $4 trillion worth of capital expenditure over the next 5 years.

About $3.1 trillion worth of revenue is required to pay back that capex, according to the Accel report.

Already this year, there have been a slew of deals worth billions announced by the likes of Nvidia and OpenAI as they look to develop data center capacity around the world in a bid to keep up with demand.

Philippe Botteri, a partner at Accel, said that three major factors will drive that revenue — more powerful AI models that require capacity to be trained, the use of new AI services and the ""agentic revolution in the enterprise.""

""Agentic"" is often a term used to describe a type of AI tool that can automatically carry out tasks on behalf of users.

But not everyone believes that the large amount of spending is necessary.

Ben Harburg, managing partner at Novo Capital says the figures being discussed by large tech firms for future investment may be overblown.

""We hear these crazy headline numbers about how much energy is going to be needed, how many chips are going to be needed, although, again, I think that there is probably more of a bubble brewing there than on kind of the front end, the actual product front,"" Harburg told CNBC on Tuesday.

""I think we're starting to realize that there's been probably over exuberance around data centers. Even Sam [Altman], I think, would privately admit that they need fewer chips than they originally set out, they need less capital than they originally set out. They need less energy than they originally set out.""

British government bond yields rose sharply on Friday following reports Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is no longer planning to raise income tax rates in the Autumn Budget later this month.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt rose around 12 basis points in early trade, before paring gains to trade at 4.498%. Yields and prices move inversely to one another.

The moves came as investors reacted to a report from the Financial Times of an income tax U-turn. The Treasury was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday morning.

U.K. stocks were also lower. The FTSE 100 index shed over 1% at 8:54 a.m. in London (3:54 a.m. ET), with Lloyds, Natwest, and Barclays banks occupying the bottom of the index, each losing more than 2.8%.

Reeves had spent the past week apparently laying the groundwork for a manifesto-breaking rise in income tax, which split Labour party lawmakers and led to further turmoil in the already embattled party, whose leader Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismal approval ratings. 

A proposed 2p national income increase was to be offset by a 2p reduction in national insurance. There are now expectations, however, that the £30 billion ($39.5 billion) hole in the government's budget will be filled by a patchwork of smaller rises.  

It could be a ""fiscal reckoning"" as a patchwork approach will put pressure on the gilt market, Wren Sterling's investment chief Rory McPherson told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday.  

""Within the U.K., if we have more of the smaller taxes being targeted as part of the programme from Rachel Reeves, I think that's going to put more pressure on the government, more pressure on them to go back to the bond markets and ask for more money, which in turn puts more pressure up on yields,"" McPherson said.

He added that there has been a ""big march down"" in yields but now ""we're pulling away that that."" 

Volatility this year has left long-term borrowing costs hovering at their highest level since the late 1990s, with U.K. debt having the heftiest price tag in the G7. 

McPherson said that the Bank of England will still be able to make an interest rate cut after the budget, if it wants to. Other investors appear to have curbed their optimism, with bets on cuts shedding six basis points compared with Thursday, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The Autumn Budget is expected on Nov. 26.

European stocks were lower on Friday as worries about an artificial intelligence bubble and the global economy shake investor confidence.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 0.8% lower an hour into the session, with all major bourses in negative territory.

China's economic slowdown ramped up in October, with data showing fixed asset investment – which includes the country's closely watched real estate sector – contracted in the first 10 months of the year. Retail sales softened, meanwhile, and industrial output growth also slowed.

Investors are also reeling from big losses on Wall Street on Thursday, as concerns about AI valuations and the U.S. interest rate trajectory mounted. Big Tech stocks were hit particularly hard, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shedding 2.3% by the closing bell.

Comments from Federal Reserve officials in recent weeks have prompted money markets to reconsider the likelihood of a December rate cut from the central bank. By Friday morning, markets were pricing in a 52.1% chance of the Fed cutting by 25 basis points at its next meeting. A month ago, the market had assigned a 95% probability to an end of year cut.

Back in Europe, yields on U.K. government bonds — known as gilts — spiked on Friday, amid reports that the Labour government was U-turning on an income tax raid that had been planned as part of the looming Autumn Budget.

Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, meaning a spike in yields represents a sell off of the assets.

By 9 a.m. in London (4 a.m. ET), the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt had risen by 7 basis points to 4.5%, climbing down from an earlier spike that saw yields rise by as much as 13 basis points at the longer end of the maturity curve. Yields on the long term 20- and 30-year gilts rose by 8 and 9 basis points, respectively.

Meanwhile, the British pound fell as markets reacted to the reports. Sterling was last seen trading 0.2% lower against both the U.S. dollar and the euro.

Corporate earnings also continue to hold the spotlight in Europe, with German insurer Allianz among the companies reporting on Friday.

Allianz said it had achieved record results in the first nine months of the year, bolstered by double-digit growth in operating profit in the third quarter. Operating profit for the three months to September jumped 12.6% to 4.4 billion euros ($5.1 billion), largely driven by the firm's Property-Casualty division.

The company said it expects to achieve an operating profit of at least 17 billion euros this year, which sits in the upper end of its full-year guidance range.  

Allianz shares were last seen trading around 1% higher.

Across the Atlantic, U.S. stock futures were little changed on Friday morning following Wall Street's Thursday sell off.

Overnight in Asia, stocks fell as investors monitored Wall Street moves and reacted to the Chinese data.

The 11 U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) collectively bled $869.86 million Thursday, registering their second-highest outflow on record, according to data source SoSoValue. 

Investors have pulled out $2.64 billion over three weeks, signaling growing caution and shifting sentiment in the market. 

Thursday's outflow coincided with Bitcoin's fall below the key $100,000 support level and heightened risk aversion on Wall Street. Ether ETFs also registered an outflow of $259.72 million, the highest since Oct. 13. 

As of writing, bitcoin traded near $97,500, down over 5% in 24 hours and 11% on a month-to-date basis, according to data source CoinDesk.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $100,000. It is now approaching a Bitcoin death cross, a technical event where the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA.

Historically, this pattern has often appeared near market bottoms. However, the macro environment and the market structure of 2025 are no longer the same as in previous cycles. This raises a critical question: Is this the actual bottom, or merely one step in a more extended capitulation phase?

Several analysts have been watching the approaching Bitcoin death cross. The 50-day SMA is expected to cross below the 200-day SMA within the next few days.

According to analyst Colin, the upcoming Bitcoin death cross is expected around mid-November, which means it is only 1–2 days away. Before it happens, Colin expects BTC to decline further, with altcoins potentially dropping even more. This aligns with BTC's recent retracement below $100,000.

“The projected Bitcoin ‘Death Cross' (50 day crossing below 200 day SMA) is a timing element for when the bottom might be in.” Colin commented.

Multiple observations also support the idea that BTC typically forms a bottom around such events, although timing may vary. Another analyst on X detailed the pattern's occurrence over the past 7 years.

Between 2018 and April 2025, Bitcoin has experienced at least eight death cross events. Each time, BTC formed a local bottom within 5–9 days and rallied at least 45% from the lows. If we consider the recent dip below $100,000 as a local bottom, projections suggest BTC could rise to at least $145,000 afterward.

Supporting this view, analyst Ash Crypto noted that in the last three death crosses, Bitcoin bottomed within a week before rallying strongly to new all-time highs.

However, some analysts present a more cautious scenario. Another X user points out that while the Bitcoin death cross is indeed about to form, the average maximum loss following the cross is typically over 30% within 12 months. Historically, BTC takes an average of 141 days to reach a peak after a cross.

If the death cross occurs in mid-November with BTC hovering around $100,000, this model suggests a potential retracement toward the $70,000 region. A new upward cycle may then resume.

If the Bitcoin death cross aligns with a final capitulation flush, history suggests a sharp rebound in the weeks that follow. Conversely, if macro conditions worsen, the death cross could instead signal a deeper correction, consistent with the historical average drawdown of roughly 30% within a year.

It is also essential to note that a death cross is primarily a timing indicator, not a guarantee of a bottom or a top. Traders should consider factors like trading volume, RSI/MACD divergences, on-chain activity, and stablecoin liquidity. These help assess the probability more accurately.

At the current moment, the higher-probability scenario is a short-term capitulation, followed by the formation of the Bitcoin death cross, and then a strong rebound. Still, short-term traders should manage risk carefully: set appropriate stop-loss levels and wait for recovery confirmation, such as a daily close above the SMA50 with rising volume, before allocating heavily.

Major cryptocurrencies are facing persistent pressure this month, even as gold and silver rally.

These diverging trends reflect risks unique to digital assets, as mounting concerns over government stability propel precious metals higher, highlighting a strengthening investor confidence in traditional safe havens.

This month, bitcoin BTC$97,290.40, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, has slipped over 9%, falling below the critical on-chain support level of $100,000, CoinDesk data show. This weakness has spread across the broader crypto market, pulling down major tokens like Ethereum's ether ETH$3,195.32, solana SOL$143.28, and DOGE$0.1633 by 11% to 20%. Payments-focused XRP has shown relative resilience, declining just over 7%.

The weak tone comes despite the dollar index (DXY) rally losing momentum after encountering resistance above 100 earlier this month. Typically, a fading DXY – which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of global currencies – bodes well for bitcoin and the broader crypto market, as well as for precious metals.

However, while bitcoin remains subdued, precious metals have found strength; gold and silver have climbed 4% and 9%, respectively, this month. Less-tracked precious metals, such as palladium and platinum, have also seen gains exceeding 1%.

So, what's holding bitcoin back? According to Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, much of the bullish news has already been priced in, leaving BTC vulnerable to bearish developments.

""Post government shutdown, risk assets are selling off as all the 'good news' catalysts are being used. Fed easing via FOMC, China/U.S. trade cooperation, and a now resolved government shutdown,"" Magadini told CoinDesk.

""Bitcoin traders have been bullishly positioned given a strong fundamental backdrop for an EOY rally, but positioning is likely being flushed as the market was overly positioned long with no one to buy next,"" he added.

Beyond positioning, fears of a deeper system risk are also weighing on cryptocurrencies, Magadini explained, highlighting a potential credit freeze as a major risk to digital asset treasuries (DATs).

These entities have been a significant source of bullish pressure for cryptocurrencies over the past year, relying heavily on credit markets to fund their crypto purchases, often through convertible bonds and debt issuance. However, DATs are not alone in this competition for capital; they face increasing pressure as sovereign governments and AI-related ventures vie for the same constrained pools of credit.

With the recent surge in DAT formation, demand for credit has increased substantially, Magadini noted, adding that should credit markets tighten or freeze, these companies could struggle to refinance their obligations, forcing them to sell their coin holdings to meet debt payments. This forced selling could trigger a cascade, as subsequent DATs might also be pressured to liquidate their assets.

""As crypto is sold, the next tranche of DATs could be forced to sell as well (so on and so forth). Although this risk is less pronounced with quality assets (such as BTC), the downward-spiral risk increases for DATs who recently purchased volatile altcoins at peak valuation,"" Magadini said.

""Today the market is likely thinking about this type of credit risk,"" he noted. (DATs are already facing the heat in the far east.)

Precious metals have gained ground mainly due to mounting concerns about the fiscal health of major economies, including the U.S.

Fiscal strain is evident in the soaring government debt-to-GDP ratios of many advanced economies. For instance, Japan's ratio exceeds 220%, while the United States stands above 120%. France and Italy also carry substantial debt burdens, exceeding 110%. While China's government debt-to-GDP is below 100%, its total non-financial debt exceeds 300% of GDP, making it one of the most indebted countries in the world.

The problem is particularly acute in the Eurozone, according to Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution.

""The precious metals rally isn't about a flight out of USD. It's a symptom of profoundly broken fiscal policy, which is true globally, especially in the Eurozone, where high-debt countries control the ECB,"" Brooks said on X.

Interestingly, gold has a history of leading BTC price movements. Analysis by market experts indicates that BTC tends to lag behind gold by approximately 80 days, suggesting that once the yellow metal's rally eventually stalls, the cryptocurrency may receive a strong bid.

Whether this pattern holds in the current macroeconomic environment remains to be seen.

Crypto market crash as the global market cap dropping to a 6-month low of $3.27 trillion.

Bitcoin has now crashed 23% and Ethereum by 36% from their ATH prices.

Hopes of Fed rate cut in December fades amid economic worries.

Trading volumes drops further as $4.7 billion in crypto options to expire today.

Over $1.1 billion in crypto got liquidated amid spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs outflow.

The crypto market crash continues in November, with the global market cap dropping from $4.28 trillion to a 6-month low of $3.27 trillion in a month. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have now tumbled 23% and 36% from their ATH. Traders are anticipating a deeper fall in altcoins as JPMorgan sees BTC support at $94,000.

The Crypto Market Fear & Greed Index has further slipped to extreme fear at 15 today. This indicates bearish sentiment among investors and potential for further drop in crypto prices.

Top and trending altcoins XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Zcash (ZEC), and AI coins tumbled 5-12% over the past 24 hours. Meme coins including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe Coin (PEPE) further erased their earlier gains, with PEPE now down 80% year-to-date (YTD).

US President Donald Trump signed a bill to end the longest government shutdown after 43 days. However, the White House confirmed no release of CPI and jobs data for October.

Moreover, Fed officials, such as Neel Kashkari, warned of rising inflation amid the government shutdown. This raised economic concerns and markets trimmed bets on a Fed rate cut in December.

CME FedWatch tool now shows odds of another 25 bps Fed rate cut dip from 62.9% to 52.1%. This is in line with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish stance that fueled crypto market crash concerns last month.

The US dollar index (DXY) dipped to 99 on Friday, a second consecutive weekly decline. Also, the 10-year Treasury yield stays near 4.1% after a sharp decline in prior sessions.

The $4.7 billion crypto options expiry today further worsened trading volumes and led to a deeper crypto market crash. More than 41K BTC options worth $4 billion in notional value will expire today on Deribit. The put-call ratio is 0.7 and the max pain price is at $105K.

In the latest 24 hours, put volume has exceeded call volume, with a put/call ratio of 1.10. This signals traders are hedging to offset losses, expecting BTC to fall below $95K.

Also, over 233K ETH options with a notional value of almost $738 million are set to expire today, with a put-call ratio of 0.68. The put volume has doubled in the last 24 hours, but is still low against more than 99K call volume. The put-call ratio is 0.91, confirming options trader sentiment leaning bearish.

Also, the max pain point is at $3,500, way above the current market price of $3,175. Traders are even opening puts targeting ETH price below $3,000 in the coming days.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs continue to record outflows. Institutions are likely rotating to Solana and XRP. Canary XRP ETF (XRPC) saw a record $59 million and $245 million in inflows on debut.

As per Farside Investors data, Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $866.7 million. BlackRock's IBIT and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF saw $256.6 million and $318.2 million in outflows amid bearish sentiment.

Meanwhile, others such as Fidelity, Bitwise, Invesco, Ark 21Shares, and GBTC also saw massive outflows. It indicates a massive decline in interest among institutional investors.

Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs saw $259.6 million in net outflows, the 3rd consecutive day of outflows. BlackRock's ETHA led with $137.3 million. Shorting Ethereum remained a smart move as long as the broader crypto trend remains firmly downward. And, it looks like there is no urgency to step in. 

As CoinGape reported, long-term holders (LTH) and whales were certain about BTC peak in October. Historically, BTC topped 12-18 months after a halving and the bull market peaked around 1,060-1,070 days, and the pattern held this year.

Coinglass data revealed over $1.1 billion in crypto liquidations, with 237K traders liquidated in the last 24 hours. The largest single liquidation order happened on crypto exchange HTX again. BTCUSDT valued at $44.29 million was sold in a single trade.

Notably, over $900 million long and $200 million short positions were liquidated. ETH, SOL, XRP, ZEC, DOGE, XPL, HYPE, BNB, PUMP, and ADA are among the altcoins witnessing the most liquidation.

The hourly crypto liquidations chart revealed $300 million in longs were liquidated a few hours ago, causing the crypto market crash.

BTC price today fell more than 5% to 96,840 intraday low. Whereas ETH price tumbles 10% to a low of $3,112 and XRP corrects 8% to $2.28. The crypto market crash sees no signs of slowing as experts predict a further drop in crypto prices.

ZEC price dropped 4% to $485.20, correcting 40% from ATH after a massive 1000% parabolic run. Arthur Hayes claimed he will buy more at dips to target another leg up to $1,000.

10x Research says BTC latest drop left traders scrambling for explanations, yet the clues were visible weeks ago. Buyers who once supported every dip have suddenly vanished. “Since October 10, both our Ethereum and Bitcoin trend models have been firmly bearish, and that signal remains intact,” it added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","How Will Ethereum's New AI Commerce Standards Reshape Startups?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/ethereum-ai-commerce-standards-crypto-banking","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 07:52:40 GMT","

Ethereum seems to be laying down a new game board for AI commerce with the introduction of ERC-8004 and x402. These standards aim to allow autonomous systems to transact and coordinate independently, bypassing intermediary platforms. What does this mean for startups and established businesses alike?

The ERC-8004 standard is focused on interoperability among AI agents, allowing seamless communication across the Ethereum network. The x402 standard aims for better coordination of activities. The hope is to create a transparent environment for AI transactions. 

By establishing these protocols, Ethereum seeks to prevent closed platforms from monopolizing AI commerce. This positions Ethereum as a potential backbone for a decentralized machine economy. Supporters like Vitalik Buterin and Binance's Changpeng Zhao recognize that this could change economic interactions between AI agents.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are pioneering the blockchain movement, but they face substantial challenges in implementing these standards. First and foremost is regulatory compliance. The nature of DAOs complicates legal recognition, making it difficult to comply with various jurisdictions.

Security is a major concern. Smart contracts that are vital for DAOs can be compromised by bad actors. Without rigorous security measures, they can be vulnerable to attacks.

Scalability also presents challenges. Should DAOs grow, they might face issues like network congestion and steep transaction fees, hindering their scaling efforts. Adding AI to the mix intensifies the complexity, particularly concerning ethical decision-making and the risk of bias.

Small fintech startups stand to gain from these Ethereum standards. By using ERC-8004, they can establish a reliable on-chain identity, which allows for discoverable banking services. This integration can lead to a more cohesive financial ecosystem.

The x402 standard offers an infrastructure for micropayments, allowing startups to monetize their services. This is particularly useful for those offering APIs or financial services, as they can charge stablecoins for service access. This could simplify operations and enhance user experience by reducing reliance on traditional banking systems.

Additionally, these standards enable startups to create portable reputations, allowing their services to be trusted across various platforms, which is a step away from centralized rating systems.

Despite the introduction of decentralized protocols, monopolization risks linger. Dominant players can gain control over essential data, infrastructure, and market power, hampering competition and innovation. This concentration can lead to undemocratic governance and inequality.

Data hoarding by large firms creates barriers for smaller competitors, stifling innovation and increasing systemic risks. Regulatory capture, where powerful AI monopolies shape regulations to maintain dominance, adds another layer to the issue.

Even decentralized systems can face re-centralization risks. Dominant entities may arise, undermining the advantages of open protocols. Coordinated regulatory frameworks and market oversight will be required to ensure fair competition.

Ethereum's standards have significant implications for crypto payroll integration, particularly in Asia. The focus on greater transparency helps payroll platforms build trust with users and regulators, especially in regions where compliance with AML and KYC is critical.

Evolving Ethereum standards can facilitate smart contract automation for payroll payments, addressing regulatory challenges. Regulatory uncertainty and price volatility remain barriers to widespread adoption, but as Ethereum refines its standards, it can assist companies in navigating the regulatory landscape.

Crypto payroll systems promote inclusivity by providing banking access to the unbanked. They can also streamline operations and ensure compliance with global employment regulations, potentially benefiting the broader financial ecosystem.

Ethereum's new standards could represent a pivotal moment in AI commerce and crypto banking. If they effectively address the challenges faced by DAOs and startups, they could lead to a more transparent and decentralized financial landscape. Yet, the monopolization risks and regulatory hurdles remain significant. As the digital economy evolves, Ethereum's commitment to transparency and decentralization will be essential in shaping the future.

Bitcoin BTCUSDT price plunged below $100,000 and sent ripples of panic across the crypto markets, challenging the confidence of traders and investors alike. Yet, in a surprising twist, some of the market's top altcoins, including Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, have held steady above their respective support levels, defying the expected domino effect. It's now important to examine what factors are helping these altcoins maintain stability even as Bitcoin faces significant selling pressure.

Why Bitcoin Price Dropped Below $100,000

Bitcoin's sudden fall under $100,000 rattled the crypto market, but the drivers go beyond routine profit-taking. Experts point to a combination of serious liquidity and structural factors behind the plunge.

First, a wave of massive liquidations hit the market, with hundreds of millions of dollars in long positions unwound within hours. This created a cascade effect, pushing the price sharply lower. At the same time, long-term holders began offloading BTC, signaling a shift in sentiment from cautious optimism to risk management.

Macro factors also played a role. Tighter liquidity conditions, combined with hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, have reduced appetite for high-value risk assets like Bitcoin. Finally, the breach of key technical support levels triggered stop-loss orders, further accelerating the decline.

Altcoins Held Up Despite Bitcoin's Drop

While Bitcoin price faced heavy selling pressure, several major altcoins—including Ethereum ETHUSDT, XRP, and Solana SOLUSDT—have shown surprising resilience. Analysts point to a few key factors behind this divergence.

Cautions for Investors

While altcoins haven't collapsed, history warns that resilience may be temporary. Macro risks—including interest rates, liquidity, and equities — can eventually pressure all crypto assets. Traders should monitor correlation shifts closely, as altcoins can still follow Bitcoin's trajectory with a lag.

Key Levels & What to Watch

What's Next for Bitcoin and the Market

With Bitcoin slipping below $100,000, the coming days will be crucial in determining the next phase of the crypto market. Traders are closely watching key support levels around $93,000–$95,000; a sustained breach could accelerate selling pressure, while a recovery above $100,000 may stabilize sentiment.

Altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana may continue to resist downward pressure in the short term, but their fate is increasingly tied to Bitcoin's direction. Liquidity, macroeconomic developments, and technical signals will dictate market movements this weekend, making cautious positioning and active monitoring essential for investors.

In a world where fortunes can vanish with the flicker of a screen, the current state of the cryptocurrency market paints a troubling picture. Major altcoins, once riding high on Bitcoin's coattails, are now grappling with considerable losses as Bitcoin's price falters. The dramatic shifts we're witnessing urge investors to scrutinize their strategies and prepare for anything that might come next.

The altcoin market is a mixed mosaic of performance amid the chaos, where substantial corrections are evident, yet some assets still show signs of resilience over the week. Notably, significant downturns have beset tokens like Starknet, Uniswap, and Filecoin, inviting scrutiny of their technical indicators as potential harbingers of future trading outcomes. The upcoming analysis sheds light on these troubling losses while providing a framework for understanding the broader market dynamics.

Bitcoin's descent below the $102,000 mark recently sent tremors through the altcoin landscape, igniting a cascade of sell-offs. This most recent dip has upended market sentiment, leading many traders to retreat into profit-taking mode, further intensifying the already volatile climate. For anyone trying to navigate this choppy terrain, recognizing the interconnectedness of market movements is essential to informing trading decisions effectively.

Starknet stands out as one of the most impacted tokens, with an alarming 13.46% drop in just 24 hours, reducing its value to around $0.14. Despite a previous weekly surge of 28%, technical indicators like the MACD and RSI signal a cooling trend, suggesting traders are eager to lock in gains after last week's rally. This shift in interest underlines the necessity for potential investors to proceed with caution and to seek thoughtful entry points.

Amidst the current upheaval, Uniswap has not been immune, suffering a 10.94% drop to $7.90. Despite a remarkable 47% rise over the past week, Uniswap's bearish crossover on its MACD indicates a possible slowdown in momentum. Traders should remain vigilant for signs of resurgence or further declines, as the market grapples with the implications of evolving sentiments.

Filecoin has encountered significant turbulence, with a notable 10.91% decrease bringing its value to $2.13. Even though it boasts an impressive 54% increase for the week, negative signals from its MACD reflect declining buyer enthusiasm. Investors now face the challenge of weighing this short-term setback against the long-term potential of decentralized storage solutions, necessitating astute strategic adjustments.

In this environment of relentless volatility, technical indicators such as MACD and RSI have emerged as indispensable tools for navigators of the crypto seas. The fluctuating fortunes of altcoins underscore the importance of these analytical instruments which can provide crucial insights into potential entry and exit points, enhancing the decision-making prowess of traders eager to capitalize on price movements.

Amidst this onslaught of volatility, the behavior of investors becomes paramount. Many traders chose to secure profits during these downturns, intensifying concerns regarding price consistency and the market's future trajectory. As fear and uncertainty reign, those who remain astute to sentiment fluctuations could uncover fresh opportunities in the event of a market rebound. Traders with a keen intuition for shifting behaviors may stand to benefit significantly when momentum eventually swings back in their favor.

For those daring to explore altcoins, well-defined and informed strategies are essential. Here are critical approaches to consider:

As the unpredictable cryptocurrency tides continue to ebb and flow, the recent downturns in the altcoin market offer a stark reminder of the sector's volatility. Awareness of market dynamics, application of intelligent trading strategies, and strategic use of technical indicators will be crucial in safeguarding investments. In an environment where values can swiftly shift, informed decision-making and astute awareness are key to successfully harnessing the opportunities that lie ahead. Embrace the unpredictability, navigate your risks wisely, and you might just find the rewards waiting under the stormy skies.

Earlier this week, the Canton Network announced the expansion of Franklin Templeton's Benji Technology Platform onto the Canton Blockchain, enabling global institutional clients to access regulated, tokenized investment products and supporting new liquidity opportunities in the digital asset space.

This move further cements Franklin Resources' commitment to blockchain innovation, opening new avenues for institutional adoption of digital assets while addressing regulatory and privacy requirements.

We'll now explore how Franklin Templeton's integration with Canton Blockchain may influence its technology-driven investment narrative and competitive positioning.

This technology could replace computers: discover 27 stocks that are working to make quantum computing a reality.

Owning Franklin Resources means believing in the long-term value of its global reach, product diversity, and ability to harness innovation like blockchain to drive future inflows. While the expansion of the Benji Technology Platform onto the Canton Blockchain signals progress in digital assets, this development does not appear to materially impact the short-term catalyst for Franklin, the stabilization and potential reversal of persistent net outflows at Western Asset Management. The key risk remains around continued outflows and margin pressure driven by fee competition and changing investor preferences.

Among recent announcements, Franklin Templeton's new pricing for its Core Equity Funds stands out, making the funds among the lowest-fee options in their peer group. This move addresses ongoing fee compression, one of the firm's clearest risks, while responding to investor demand for cost-effective products, a critical factor as the company pursues new growth channels and aims to offset revenue headwinds.

But, in contrast to these promising steps, investors should be aware that persistent net outflows at Western Asset Management continue to...

Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. She also authors CFO Daily.

Good morning. Blockchain technology is gaining mainstream traction in the U.S., with clearer regulations emerging as a key driver of adoption.

To explore what that means for financial infrastructure, I sat down with Jeremy Fox-Geen, CFO of Circle Internet Group, a leading stablecoin issuer. “We are at the beginning of what can only be described as a global megatrend—the building of the internet financial system,” Fox-Geen told me.





That system, he explained, encompasses blockchains, digital assets, and the applications built upon them—technologies that promise “massive benefits to businesses and consumers all around the world,” he said. While blockchain is already transforming parts of the economy, he emphasized that we are still in the early stages of its impact.





Fox-Geen described Circle as a market-neutral infrastructure company: a platform that sits within the internet financial system's foundation—spanning blockchain, digital-asset, and application layers. “We're a platform that other companies choose to build upon,” he said.





Stablecoins, such as Circle's USD Coin (USDC), are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to and backed by the U.S. dollar or equivalent assets. In the U.S., the GENIUS Act has clarified how stablecoins are regulated, Fox-Geen noted. Regulatory certainty, he said, is “a major unlock” for large companies considering digital assets for corporate treasuries—and a driver of multi-year growth for Circle.




Key use cases for stablecoins include trading, settlement, dollarization, and cross-border payments. Circle's platform supports these use cases, aiming to reduce friction and cost in global financial transactions, Fox-Geen said.





Circle made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5, marking the largest two-day post-IPO surge since 1980, Fortune reported. On Wednesday, the company reported its Q3 results: combined revenue and reserve income grew 66% year-over-year to $740 million, while net income rose 202% to $214 million. USDC circulation reached $73.7 billion, up 108% from a year earlier, and on-chain transaction volume jumped 580% to $9.6 trillion—evidence of its expanding real-world utility, Fox-Geen explained. JPMorgan has upgraded Circle's stock to “overweight” from “underweight” and increased its price target to $100 from $94, which helped rebound Circle shares in pre-market trading on Thursday.





Fox-Geen said that blockchain's transformation of the financial system is just beginning—comparable to the internet's evolution in the mid-1990s. “The disruption is underway, but the technologies are still maturing,” he said.





Banks, neobanks, payment firms, and capital markets participants are already integrating blockchain for trading, settlement, and supply-chain payments. “We're seeing use cases grow fastest where costs, frictions, and business needs are highest,” Fox-Geen added.





Fox-Geen has served as CFO of Circle since May 2021 and was previously CFO of iStar and Safehold. Before that, he was CFO for McKinsey & Company, North America, and held senior roles with PricewaterhouseCoopers and Citigroup.




Circle is now building the fourth generation of blockchains, he said, as well as Arc, a native Layer-1 blockchain optimized to bring economic activity to the internet.





To illustrate his thoughts on blockchain's promise, Fox-Geen posed this question:





“Why can't you send money to anyone in the world—instantly and for free—just like sending a photo or text message? When you put it like that, it's absurd that you can't.”





For CFOs and finance leaders exploring blockchain for the first time, his advice is pragmatic: fast follow.





“You don't have to be a pioneer,” he said. “Institutions will bring these benefits to you.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Minnesota's emerging blockchain builders","https://mndaily.com/296245/city/minnesotas-emerging-blockchain-builders/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 03:23:13 GMT","



The Twin Cities are home to 17 Fortune 500 companies. But when it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrency, the industry is far more hidden. 

Despite making headlines for years, blockchain technology remains a mystery to some. At its core, blockchain is a system for recording and verifying transactions without relying on a central authority such as a bank. It is essentially a shared, transparent digital database that is extremely difficult to alter. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are transferable digital assets whose ownership is recorded on the blockchain. 

“It's really just a database,” explained Brandon Ferdig, co-founder of the Minnesota Blockchain Initiative. “Blockchain is a way to track who owns what. And it's a revolution because it's more decentralized, which is good for security.” 

Ferdig added that crypto technology has the advantage of transparency and efficiency that traditional currency lacks.

“Anyone can look at the blockchain and see who owns what, and you don't have to wait for a check to clear or a credit card payment to go through a bank,” Ferdig said.

For Ferdig, blockchain is more than cryptocurrency trading, speculation or hype cycles. He said he sees it as a form of digital infrastructure and a foundational technology that could change how Minnesotans manage records and build trust online.

The blockchain scene in the Twin Cities

The Minnesota Blockchain Initiative, founded in 2018, has grown organically based on community interest.

Today, the group hosts monthly Twin Cities meetups, runs a podcast, maintains an active Slack channel and collaborates with a multitude of actors, including the University of St. Thomas School of Law, where they have held large events in recent years.

“We consider education a foundational application of blockchain,” Ferdig said. “We teach about it, hold seminars. Many lawyers come to our events.”

He compared Minnesota's emerging blockchain community to the state's traditional industries that favor steady, long-term growth over flashy trends. Ferdig said blockchain can be more than just cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), interchangeable digital assets and in the future, become a foundational technology. 

“Minnesota is known for wheat and iron ore and timber, and for medical technologies and Post-it notes from 3M,” he said. “We've quietly built a really good society up here with these backbone industries. They're not flashy, but they're crucial.” 

Ferdig admitted that the local ecosystem is young and has not fully taken off. 

While a handful of blockchain-related startups exist in the state, such as Kigo and Just For Krypto, most development happens remotely or in coastal hubs like San Francisco and New York.

University of Minnesota's Blockchain Club President Daigan Berger said he agreed. 

“I would say the Twin Cities are underdeveloped for blockchain,” Berger said. “But a lot of blockchain jobs are remote, so there are still opportunities for graduates from Minnesota to work in the industry.”

The UMN Blockchain Club mostly draws members from computer science and business students, Berger said. However, they aim to remain open to anyone curious about the technology.

“Our meetings are part lecture, part discussion,” Berger said. “We cover everything from programming topics to blockchain fundamentals. It builds from week to week, but we try to make it beginner-friendly.”

The club's goal is to help students explore the technology's potential and connect with the growing industry. 

“We want to show students what the possibilities and jobs in the industry are,” Berger said. 

To Berger, their efforts seem to be paying off. 

“One of our alumni interned at Coinbase and is now joining full-time,” Berger said. “Others have gone on to work in crypto-related roles at startups in New York.”

Stigma and skepticism

Berger said despite growing interest, blockchain's public image remains complicated — especially on campus.

“I would say most students perceive it in a pretty negative way,” Berger said. “People have read headlines about scams or lost investments and assume that's what it's all about.”

Berger said he often finds himself clarifying that the club focuses on technology, not trading. 

“We never tell people to invest in anything,” Berger said. “We just teach how the systems work. Learning about the technology doesn't cost anything, and I think people would appreciate blockchain more if they learned how it actually works and how to interact with it.”

Ferdig acknowledged that skepticism extends beyond universities. Much of it, he said, comes from environmental concerns, crypto scams and the hype surrounding NFTs.

“That kind of criticism always follows new technology,” Ferdig said. “Now a lot of people hate AI, because of the same reason they distrusted blockchain: they think it's greed from corporations, and that it's gonna take away from the user experience.”

Reflecting on the argument that bitcoin mining causes environmental harm, Ferdig said that seeing the criticism move from one thing to another takes away their legitimacy.

“I don't take those concerns super seriously,” Ferdig said. “I see how fickle they are.”

Ferdig added that blockchain art, like other creative uses of technology, can evolve past its early missteps. 

“There's a real resistance to AI now in art, in video games, in movies,” he said. “You've got to get past that and keep an open mind.”

Looking forward

Both the Minnesota Blockchain Initiative and the UMN Blockchain Club see education as key to future growth. Berger said the club hopes to expand and eventually split into specialized groups focusing on development, governance and finance. 

“For now, we're keeping it general so everyone can follow along,” Berger said. “But as we grow, we want members to actually build projects and engage with the side of the industry that interests them most.”

Berger believes that the market is not ripe for a full blockchain takeover yet. 

“One of the biggest problems in this industry is figuring out how Blockchain can be used to facilitate business or increase revenue, or in some way be better than the Web2 [the internet] or a current alternative that exists,” Berger said. “I think until that problem is solved, it will continue to be more of a niche community.”

Ferdig said that government and regulation will play a role, too. 

“Yes, cryptocurrency gives people more freedom, but it also means less government control,” Ferdig said. “But the benefit of a more secure, more efficient system outweighs that.”

For Minnesotans curious about blockchain, especially University of Minnesota students, Ferdig and Berger share the same advice: stay open-minded.

“A lot of college students see the benefits of AI when writing a paper, but there are costs too, like jobs that might not exist when they graduate,” Ferdig said. “It's the same with crypto. The key is to understand how these systems work and how to use them wisely.”

Key Statistics

The SocialFi NFTs market is poised for exceptional growth, expected to increase from USD 359.7 million in 2025 to USD 7,021.4 million by 2035, reflecting a CAGR of 34.6%. This rapid expansion is driven by the convergence of social finance (SocialFi) and NFTs, which offer users the opportunity to monetize their online presence, content, and social interactions in decentralized environments. As more platforms integrate NFT-based social features and allow users to create, trade, and leverage their digital assets, SocialFi NFTs will gain traction among both creators and users in digital spaces.

The growing interest in Web3 technologies, decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain-based social media platforms will be key drivers of market growth. By enabling users to retain ownership and control over their digital identity and assets, SocialFi NFTs provide a new way to engage with social media, reward creators, and facilitate peer-to-peer transactions. As social networks evolve into decentralized communities and virtual spaces, the demand for NFTs tied to social experiences, content sharing, and digital communities will continue to increase, securing a dominant position for SocialFi NFTs in the broader digital economy.



From 2025 to 2030, the market is projected to grow from USD 359.7 million to USD 1,589.3 million, a rise of USD 1,229.6 million. This growth will be driven by the increasing integration of NFTs in social media platforms and the expanding creator economy. As decentralized social finance platforms gain popularity, users will increasingly seek ways to monetize their content and digital identities through NFTs, which will further accelerate market growth during this period.

Between 2030 and 2035, the market is forecast to expand from USD 1,589.3 million to USD 7,021.4 million, adding USD 5,432.1 million. This rapid surge will be fueled by the mainstream adoption of NFTs in social networks, gaming, and virtual worlds, where social interactions and content creation are increasingly tied to digital ownership. As Web3 technologies continue to transform how people interact online, SocialFi NFTs will play a central role in reshaping digital economies and fostering new monetization opportunities for creators and communities, driving strong growth throughout the decade.

The SocialFi NFTs market is experiencing rapid growth due to the increasing integration of NFTs in social media platforms, content monetization, and digital identities. As the demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to rise, social platforms are increasingly adopting NFTs as a means to reward content creators and foster community engagement. Social content monetization NFTs are becoming a key driver of this growth, allowing creators to tokenize their content and receive compensation directly from their audiences. The rise of web3 technologies and the growing interest in decentralized social platforms are providing new avenues for NFT applications in areas like reputation management, social gamification, and digital identities. Additionally, the increasing popularity of social tokens and the ability to monetize social media activities are further contributing to the market's expansion. With platforms like Friend.tech, Galxe, and StepN leading the charge, the SocialFi NFTs market is expected to grow rapidly, providing new ways for users and creators to interact, earn, and own digital assets in decentralized environments.

The SocialFi NFTs market is segmented by classification and application. By classification, the market covers social content monetization NFTs, social identity and reputation NFTs, social gamification NFTs, and others. Among these, social content monetization NFTs hold the leading share at 30%, driven by creator-led earning models across web3 social platforms. By application, the market is divided into the primary market and secondary market, with the primary market holding a dominant 65% share. Regions such as China, India, and Germany exhibit the strongest adoption due to rapid blockchain expansion and creator economy growth.



The social content monetization NFT segment leads the SocialFi NFTs market with a 30% share because it directly addresses the evolving creator economy, where individuals seek autonomy and direct revenue channels without relying on centralized platforms. This segment allows creators to tokenize posts, artwork, experiences, or exclusive community access as NFTs, enabling supporters and followers to own moments and interactions rather than simply consuming them. Platforms such as Friend.tech, Mirror.xyz, and Roll are driving adoption by offering infrastructure for decentralized monetization, shifting control from traditional social platforms to individual creators.

The ability to transform engagement into ownership is a key growth catalyst. Users purchasing these NFTs not only support creators but also gain assets that can appreciate with the creator's brand growth, introducing value exchange into social interactions. Additionally, micro-transaction models and fan-token ecosystems elevate ongoing engagement, making creator-fan relationships deeper and financially meaningful. As web3 social platforms expand and creator monetization norms evolve, this segment's leading position is expected to strengthen, particularly in markets like China, India, and Brazil, where digital creator entrepreneurship is expanding rapidly.



The primary market dominates the SocialFi NFTs market with a 65% share because it represents the point of first issuance, where creators and platforms establish direct value capture from NFT sales. This eliminates intermediary control and reduces revenue leakage, allowing creators to earn more, while giving early adopters access to NFTs at original issue prices. The primary market is especially active on SocialFi platforms like Friend.tech, Galxe, and Lens Protocol, where NFTs are launched as membership badges, access tokens, creator passes, or identity-linked collectibles.

The appeal of exclusivity, first-access rights, and early-value acquisition drives strong user participation in the primary market. These NFTs often grant privileges such as gated chat access, tiered memberships, or early participation in tokenized events, making them valuable beyond speculative resale. The rise of decentralized fan economies and token-driven communities has strengthened the primary issuance model further. Moreover, the availability of easy-to-use minting and identity linking tools has lowered the barrier of entry for new creators worldwide. As more social platforms transition to decentralized engagement models, the dominance of the primary market will continue, supported by rapid adoption in regions like China, India, and Germany, where social tokenization is scaling fastest.

The SocialFi NFTs market is expanding rapidly due to the increasing demand for decentralized social platforms, which offer creators the opportunity to monetize their content directly via NFTs. The shift from centralized social media models to web3-based platforms is reshaping the way digital content is valued. Platforms like Friend.tech and StepN are leading the charge, allowing users to tokenize and trade social interactions. The creator economy, the rise of digital identity management, and social gamification are also driving market growth as platforms continue to evolve.

What are the key drivers of the SocialFi NFTs market?

The key drivers of the SocialFi NFTs market include the growing adoption of web3 technologies and NFTs within social media platforms. The ability for content creators to monetize their work directly through NFTs is attracting significant interest from influencers, artists, and creators across digital spaces. Additionally, the increasing demand for decentralized and transparent platforms where digital identity and reputation can be securely managed is another important factor. Platforms like Galxe and Mirror.xyz enable users to engage in social gamification and reputation building, leading to stronger consumer participation in the SocialFi ecosystem.

What are the key restraints in the SocialFi NFTs market?

Despite strong growth, the SocialFi NFTs market faces several challenges. Market volatility is one of the main concerns, as NFT prices can fluctuate widely, creating uncertainty for investors and content creators. Furthermore, regulatory uncertainty regarding the use of NFTs and cryptocurrency in decentralized applications can deter potential users from engaging in the market. Additionally, the environmental impact of blockchain transactions, especially those using proof-of-work systems, is raising concerns about the sustainability of SocialFi NFTs. These challenges may hinder wider adoption in certain regions.

What are the key trends in the SocialFi NFTs market?

Several key trends are shaping the SocialFi NFTs market. Social tokens and NFT-based digital assets are gaining popularity as platforms move toward decentralization. The rise of social gamification is encouraging deeper user engagement, where NFTs are used as rewards in community-driven activities. Another key trend is the increasing focus on digital identity management, where reputation NFTs are allowing users to build and maintain their online identity securely on blockchain platforms. Additionally, the growing integration of NFTs in decentralized social media platforms will continue to drive the market as new players enter the Web3 space.

Central bank finalizes stablecoin regulations while three major banks complete first wholesale CBDC transactions

Singapore's central bank is moving forward with comprehensive digital asset initiatives spanning stablecoin regulation, wholesale CBDC pilots, and tokenized capital markets guidance, Monetary Authority of Singapore Managing Director Chia Der Jiun announced at the Singapore FinTech Festival on Thursday.

MAS has finalized features for its stablecoin regulatory regime and will prepare draft legislation, Chia said Wednesday. The framework prioritizes ""sound reserve backing and redemption reliability"" to ensure value stability, addressing concerns about unregulated stablecoins that have experienced recurring de-pegging events.

In a significant CBDC milestone, DBS, OCBC, and UOB successfully conducted interbank overnight lending transactions using Singapore's first live wholesale CBDC issuance for settlement. MAS plans to expand trials next year by issuing tokenized MAS Bills to Primary Dealers settled with CBDC.

The regulator launched the BLOOM (Borderless, Liquid, Open, Online, Multi-currency) initiative in October 2025, to support industry experimentation with tokenized bank liabilities and regulated stablecoins for settlement, inviting financial institutions and clearing operators to conduct trials.

Chia outlined three critical requirements for scaling tokenized assets: standardized tokens with interoperable networks, deep pools of safe settlement assets, and institutional-grade blockchain networks with clear governance and regulatory compliance.

Chia also added that MAS will publish a Guide on Tokenisation of Capital Markets Products this week, providing regulatory clarity through case studies, while acknowledging that despite commercial launches of tokenized bonds and money market funds, ""asset-backed tokens have not yet achieved escape velocity.""

The central bank emphasized a ""co-opetition"" model where market participants cooperate on standards while competing for liquidity, working through initiatives like Project Guardian to develop global tokenization frameworks.

As Trump touts Bitcoin's role in easing pressure on the dollar, his administration's pro-crypto stance is reshaping markets, regulation, and global competition.

When you think of financial innovation, Singapore is never far away. The country, which already made an impression by hosting the global TOKEN2019 event, continues to move forward at a rapid pace. In the crypto universe, the city-state increasingly positions itself as an open-air laboratory. The latest move: the issuance of Treasury bonds… in tokenized form. Public securities settled in central bank digital currency (CBDC). A transition that could well reshuffle the deck in state finance.

After TOKEN2049, Singapore takes a new step. At the Singapore FinTech Festival 2025, Chia Der Jiun, director of the MAS, unveiled a pilot operation: issuance of tokenized MAS Bills, reserved for primary dealers, and settled in digital Singapore dollar. A paradigm shift? Probably. Especially when you hear the MAS head state:

Are asset-backed tokens clearly out of the lab? Undoubtedly. Many commercial products have been launched. Bonds have been issued natively and settled on-chain. Money market funds have been tokenized.

The MAS does not stop there: the banks DBS, OCBC and UOB have already conducted interbank lending operations using CBDC. These initiatives confirm an assumed ambition: to impose public finance in the crypto ecosystem with safe, traceable, and agile digital tools. A role-play where states are no longer just regulators but also builders of monetary networks.

The real challenge is no longer technical, it is structural. In his speech, Chia Der Jiun mentions a major risk: that of a fragmented ecosystem, made of incompatible networks, tokens not recognized from one platform to another. The solution? A “coopetition” approach.

They must agree on common standards for asset-backed tokens, even while seeking to grow. A bond or fund token must be understood and accepted on another network than the original one.

The Guardian project, already launched in 2022, and the Global Layer One initiative aim to create these standards. Their mission: to ensure that any tokenized asset on network A can be recognized and exchanged on network B. This is not just an advance for crypto traders; it is a market overhaul itself. 

The regulator wants to avoid the emergence of closed monopolies or walled gardens. It supports open finance, driven by regulation but fueled by innovation. A hybrid model that could set an example far beyond Asia.

Behind the launch of these tokenized bonds, another battle is raging: the choice of settlement assets. The digital Singapore dollar, stablecoins, and tokenized bank liabilities are tested to serve as bases for dematerialized exchanges.

Key points to understand the stakes:

Each of these models has its strengths. CBDCs offer security and legitimacy. Regulated stablecoins allow smoother circulation. And bank liabilities bring private sector flexibility, provided they are interoperable. This plurality of approaches clearly shows one thing: no one yet holds the key to universal programmable money. But Singapore is moving forward, and fast.

Singapore only confirms a trend underway for several years. Like the Bank of France and the Bank of Switzerland, its central bank has already successfully tested wholesale CBDCs. By crossing this new threshold, it helps shape the contours of programmable, fluid finance but under close supervision. A complex score, where each note played already resonates well beyond its borders.

Today's Paper


			OUR PICKS:		

Goodbye, Bitcoin? There currently are at least 32 crypto kiosks, according to St. Paul police, where users can deposit cash and see it converted into a digital alternative.

Soon, there may be none.

Alarmed by fraud cases that have cost victims millions of dollars nationally, the St. Paul City Council is poised to ban virtual currency kiosks that have proliferated citywide.

The ATM-like kiosks are placed in high-traffic areas such as convenience stores and allow users to make cash deposits, which are then converted into Bitcoin or other digital currencies and transferred into an account or virtual wallet. Digital currency is money that exists only in an electronic form and can be exchanged online. It often operates independently of central banks.

An ordinance before the city council calls for prohibiting any person from operating a virtual currency kiosk within city limits. It would not affect online virtual transactions conducted by businesses and residents.

Michael Carter, an enforcement audit director with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, told the council Wednesday that there have been 51 law enforcement reports statewide involving $700,000 lost to various kiosk scams. The real numbers likely are larger as many victims are too embarrassed to come forward.

Gordon Wrobel, a resident of St. Paul and an AARP volunteer, said the crypto kiosks need more regulations and oversight.

“The impact of fraud on victims and their families is wide reaching and can have an impact financially and emotionally,” said Wrobel, during a public hearing Wednesday. “Criminals are becoming more sophisticated in their approach which authorities struggle to keep up.”

However, Ethan McClelland, the director of government relations for Bitcoin Depot – a leading Bitcoin machine operator – called the proposed ordinance an overreaction. The company sued the city of Stillwater after it banned cryptocurrency machines earlier this year.

“We share the council's goal of protecting consumers from fraud,” McClelland said. “However, placing a reactionary ban on the industry that is already licensed and regulated by the state, which serves a legitimate purpose for St. Paul residents, is unnecessary and will deprive many customers their only way of participating in the digital economy.”

Law enforcement investigators have called crypto scams especially dangerous because there is no centralized authority to flag suspicious behavior, and they are often untraceable.

In 2023, Americans reported losing $5.6 billion in cryptocurrency scams, according to the FBI, which found that the frauds were more likely to target older people.

Often, residents unfamiliar with cryptocurrency are warned by fraudsters that they owe the Internal Revenue Service or another federal agency back payments, and they're pressured to use a kiosk to deposit cash to a serial number within a matter of hours, or they'll be prosecuted, they're told.

The Minnesota Legislature implemented a degree of cryptocurrency fraud protection in 2024. A new law required all kiosks to disclose terms and conditions, issue refunds for new customers, and set a maximum transaction limit of $2,000 for new customers.

Tim Greenfield, the city council's chief policy officer, said the state's measures haven't been effective in stopping scams, and fraudsters have quickly found ways around the regulations.

“These kiosks serve as a very specific flashpoint for which criminal activity defrauds citizens and no amount of disclosure or tapping of a screen or a receipt can be as effective as  simply removing them from operation,” Greenfield said.

Tim Plunkett, a St. Paul resident, said he fell victim to a scam in February. Scammers impersonated Xfinity technicians and told him abnormally high activity on his desktop had led them to find evidence of money laundering and other illegal acts. The scammers told Plunkett that they would report the activity to the Federal Trade Commission unless he transferred them money through a cryptocurrency kiosk.

Plunkett went to different kiosks four times. When he received an email from Rocket Coin, a cryptocurrency ATM company, he realized he had been scammed. It turned out that the scammers had locked him out of his computer and his bank account.

“The first thing they want you to do is to get you in a state of confusion,” he told the council.​

Council President Rebecca Noecker said the proposed kiosk ban is a way to protect the vulnerable.

“Part of this is we want to raise public awareness of the level of these scams for older members, low-income folks and the incarcerated and their families in our community,” Noecker said.​

Crypto scams have become lucrative crimes in recent years. In September, two men stole $8 million in cryptocurrency after kidnapping a father and his nine-year-old son in Washington County.

​In June, an Eagan couple was almost scammed out of $125,000. The couple was able to avoid losing all of their money when Gabby Conklin, an office assistant in the city attorney's office who had stopped at a convenience store for gas, intervened, Noecker said.

A scammer was trying to get the couple to deposit money into a kiosk by pretending to be an FTC agent.

“The elderly couple were literally one press of a button away from losing their life savings irreversibly, but through Gabby's work that was averted,” Noecker said.

The council will host a final vote on the proposed ordinance on Nov. 19.

Online betting and gaming operator Super Group is entering the digital currency space with the launch of its new stable digital currency, the ZAR Supercoin.

Purpose-built for South Africa and the wider African market, ZAR Supercoin will operate under a new division of the Super Group business, Super Money SA.

Supercoin will eventually be used as a payment option for customers using Super Group's sportsbook brand Betway, with customers also benefiting from initiatives exclusive to Supercoin users.

“The time is right for Super Group to move into the digital currency space, with our exciting new Supercoin,” said Super Group chief financial officer Alinda van Wyk. “We have always been at the forefront of tech advancement in the gambling industry, and this offering will also benefit the millions of customers who enjoy our brands in South Africa and in the rest of the continent.

“The launch of Supercoin will position us for continued success, as alternative payment methods and digital asset frameworks become more integrated into the regulated gaming ecosystem. This also underscores our commitment to innovation and the use of advanced technology to position Super Group for sustained growth.”

Supercoin will be listed on Luno and made available to customers in South Africa. 

Luno is a leading regulated cryptocurrency exchange with operations in Nigeria, Kenya, Malaysia, and Indonesia. As Supercoin gains traction, it will be listed on additional international exchanges.

Custody of ZAR Supercoin fiat currency backing reserves will be held by South African bank, ABSA Group.

What happens when the king of cryptocurrencies falters? The recent crash of Bitcoin, dipping below the once highly coveted $100,000 threshold, has triggered alarm bells across the entire crypto ecosystem. This is no ordinary stumble; this drop reflects a tumultuous market grappling with volatility, fuelled by unsettling remarks from the Treasury Secretary that sent ripples through financial networks. As trepidation grips investors, we must dissect the broader ramifications of shifting sentiments in the cryptocurrency arena.

Regulatory chatter is stirring the waters of the crypto sector, with implications that reach far and wide. The Treasury Secretary's caution about instituting rigorous regulatory frameworks has injected anxiety into this already precarious landscape. Amid the confused mingling of traditional markets and cryptocurrencies, startups in the Web3 space find themselves navigating an increasingly treacherous path—juggling the demands of compliance while striving for financial viability. It's crucial we untangle these complexities, as the crypto world writhes under the weight of potential restrictions that could stifle innovation and growth.

If cryptocurrencies are sinking, then commodities have emerged as the star players. Gold and silver are basking in newfound glory, defying the downturn engulfing the digital currency realm. In the midst of financial upheaval, gold prices soared, enticing investors seeking refuge. As Bitcoin languishes, the stark divide between its plight and the commodities' upward trajectory reveals a fundamental pivot in investor sentiment. This shift underscores a growing inclination toward stable investments, highlighting the necessity of securing oneself against the unpredictable tides of risk-laden assets.

A deep dive into Bitcoin pricing reveals a troubling narrative, particularly in the wake of a staggering $114 million in long liquidations over a mere blink of an eye. The ferocity of these liquidations emphasizes the volatility synonymous with the cryptocurrency sector and raises alarm about further declines. As Bitcoin hovers near critical support levels, it's a waiting game for investors, who must keep a watchful eye for signs of recovery or the précipice of continued decline. Market analysts caution that failing to recover the key $100,000 landmark may pave the way for even grimmer bearish trends to sweep through the crypto landscape.

The tug of war between geopolitical developments and the current state of the cryptocurrency market is undeniable. Talk of inflation, potential shifts in monetary policy, and looming economic uncertainties are intricately woven into the fabric of investors' views on digital currencies. According to a study conducted by John Doe, the often-overlooked issues of regulatory compliance are fundamental to understanding the operational risks crypto investors face. As the global economic currents ebb and flow, these geopolitical forces take on increased significance for anyone navigating the murky waters of cryptocurrency investment.

Amidst the upheaval sweeping the crypto space, the time has come for investors to realign their strategies. By diversifying portfolios to incorporate both cryptocurrencies and more stable commodities, investors can fortify themselves against the risks that often accompany market downturns. Staying agile and attuned to fluctuating market indicators facilitates the safeguarding of assets and the optimizing of returns. In these uncertain times, strategic diversification transcends being merely a choice; it's a vital response to the tempest of financial instability.

The current maelstrom enveloping the cryptocurrency sector starkly illustrates the intricate relationship between traditional assets and digital currencies. Bitcoin's fragile standing brings forth urgent concerns regarding volatility while spotlighting a wider transition toward commodities such as gold and silver. As regulatory landscapes evolve, investors must remain vigilant, prepared to pivot with the shifting economic tides. By embracing diversification within their investment portfolios, they can weather the storm of financial uncertainty and set themselves on a path toward enduring success in both the cryptocurrency domain and the realm of commodities. 

In essence, as the cryptocurrency universe battles unprecedented trials, it's imperative to grasp the expansive financial dynamics at play, providing essential insights for investors striving to keep their footing in this tumultuous industry. Confronting these pressing realities is crucial for steering towards a resilient financial future.

On Thursday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest executed significant trades, notably involving Circle Internet Group Inc (NYSE:CRCL), Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc (NYSE:BMNR), Bullish (NYSE:BLSH), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT). These trades reflect Ark's strategic positioning in the market, with particular focus on the tech and crypto sectors.

Ark Invest purchased 188,941 shares of Circle across multiple ETFs, including Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKF), ARK Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKK), and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (BATS:ARKW). 

On Thursday, CRCL closed at $82.34, down 4.59%. Despite this dip, analysts at Bernstein remain optimistic about Circle's potential, citing its strong third-quarter performance and a $230 price target. Bernstein flagged intensifying competition from ""frenemies"" like Stripe and PayPal, who are building their own stablecoin ecosystems. Still, analysts said USDC's (CRYPTO: USDC) liquidity edge continues to outpace rivals, and Circle's Arc blockchain and Payments Network rollout bolster its long-term positioning.

The total value of Ark's purchase was approximately $15.5 million, calculated from the closing price and the number of shares acquired.

Ark Invest increased its holdings in Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc through ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW by purchasing 242,347 shares. BMNR shares closed at $36.57, a 9.86% drop. 

The company recently announced its Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) holdings, aiming to own 5% of the total supply. BitMine said it expanded its Ethereum holdings to 2.9% of total ETH supply, adding more than 110,000 ETH last week as it pushed toward its long-term 5% accumulation goal. The company now holds over 3.5 million ETH, along with 192 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and $398 million in cash reserves. Chairman Tom Lee said growing institutional interest and Ethereum's role in tokenization continue to strengthen the firm's conviction.

Ark's purchase amounted to around $8.9 million.

Ark's interest in Bullish was evident in the purchase of 177,480 shares through ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW. BLSH shares ended at $41.02, down 9.85%. 

Bullish, backed by Peter Thiel, has been a focus for Ark, with previous million-dollar buys. The value of Ark's latest acquisition was approximately $7.3 million, showcasing continued support for the crypto exchange.

Ark Invest reduced its AMD position by 87,051 shares through ARKK. AMD shares closed at $247.96, a 4.22% decrease. Ark's sale was valued at about $21.6 million.

AMD's ambitious target of $20 EPS by 2030 drew mixed reactions from analysts. Some argued the stock already prices in these aggressive assumptions, while others warned the forecast depends heavily on steep growth, margin expansion and sustained hyperscaler spending.

Ark Invest sold Reddit shares through ARKF and ARKW. Reddit shares closed at $189.42, down 6.61%. The sale of 39,854 shares was valued at $7.5 million.

Reddit recently beat expectations with third-quarter earnings of 80 cents per share and $585 million in revenue. Daily active users rose 19% to 116 million, while ad revenue surged 74%. Margins and cash flow also improved sharply, with adjusted EBITDA climbing to $236 million.

Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings indicate AMD stock has a Value in the 5th percentile. Here is how the stock compares with other semiconductor plays.

The 11 U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) collectively bled $869.86 million Thursday, registering their second-highest outflow on record, according to data source SoSoValue. 

Investors have pulled out $2.64 billion over three weeks, signaling growing caution and shifting sentiment in the market. 

Thursday's outflow coincided with Bitcoin's fall below the key $100,000 support level and heightened risk aversion on Wall Street. Ether ETFs also registered an outflow of $259.72 million, the highest since Oct. 13. 

As of writing, bitcoin traded near $97,500, down over 5% in 24 hours and 11% on a month-to-date basis, according to data source CoinDesk.

A fresh move lower in Asian morning exacerbated losses for hopeful traders as bitcoin lost the $98,000 level for the first time since May, extending a week-long bleed that has dragged majors sharply lower.



Ether fell more than 8% to around $3,500, while XRP, DOGE$0.1633, Solana's SOL and Cardano' ADA posted similar declines. The tone remained decisively risk-off, with crypto tracking equity weakness across Asia as traders unwound leveraged bets and rotated into cash.



Liquidation data shows the magnitude of the flush. More than $1 billion in leveraged crypto positions were wiped out over 24 hours, with roughly $887 million coming from longs.



That marks one of the heaviest bull-side liquidations in a month. About 235,000 traders were forced out of positions, and the single largest wipeout was a $44 million BTC long on HTX.



Across major venues, Bybit, Hyperliquid and Binance each saw more than $180 million in long liquidations which represented over 85% of all bets, reflecting how aggressively traders had leaned into last week's bounce.



The setup heading into the decline was fragile as funding rates had turned positive across majors, open interest was climbing, and spot volumes were thinning — making for conditions that often amplify downside once momentum flips.



With BTC slicing through $100,000, liquidity pockets evaporated on the way down, creating a vacuum that accelerated the move toward $97,000.



Macro headwinds added fuel. China's latest dataset showed economic activity cooling far more than expected. Industrial production slowed to 4.9% year-on-year from 6.5% in September, while fixed-asset investment contracted 1.7% over the first 10 months in a historic slump.



The numbers hit Asian equities immediately, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropping 1.3% and chipmakers leading losses. The weakness spilled into crypto within minutes, mirroring patterns seen throughout Q4 where digital assets have behaved like high-beta macro risk.



At the same time, hopes for a December Federal Reserve rate cut faded after a series of cautious remarks from officials. Money markets now price the odds of a December cut at below 50%, down sharply from earlier in the week. That shift, combined with the global equity wobble, created the latest leg lower in crypto as traders reassessed positioning into year-end.



For crypto, the immediate question is whether the forced unwinds have run their course.



BTC's break below $98,000 puts focus on support near $94,000, while altcoins remain vulnerable if equities extend their pullback.



But structurally, liquidation-driven resets have often marked exhaustion zones. Whether that dynamic repeats depends largely on whether macro volatility stabilizes over the next 48 hours.

Brutal selloff breaks psychological $2.30 floor, erasing recent gains as distribution overwhelms historic XRPC debut.

The session confirmed a full technical breakdown with clear structural damage:

Support/Resistance:• $2.29–$2.30 becomes primary support after breach of psychological floor• Former support at $2.36, $2.40, and $2.47 now act as stacked resistance• Invalidation for bulls requires a decisive reclaim of $2.36

Volume Profile:• Total session volume 157.9M (+46%) confirms institutional-grade distribution• Breakdown sequence showed 254% hourly volume spike, typical of liquidation-driven moves• No meaningful recovery volume appeared during post-crash consolidation

Chart Structure:• Descending triangle support failed decisively, killing prior reversal setup• New lower range forming between $2.29–$2.33• Breakdown aligns with medium-term downtrend in broader crypto indexes

Momentum Indicators:• Oversold signals emerging intraday, but no confirmation of trend reversal• Breakdown occurred below key EMAs; 50D/200D cross continues to slope bearishly

XRP now sits at a pivotal inflection point:

• Holding $2.29 is essential — failure exposes a fast move into the $2.00–$2.20 demand zone• Any recovery must first reclaim $2.36 before bulls regain technical control• ETF inflows will act as the next volatility catalyst; early XRPC volume during market open will indicate whether institutions treat the listing as an accumulation opportunity or liquidity event• On-chain flows around the 110.5M XRP whale transfers remain a wildcard — exchange inflows would confirm additional downside risk• Sentiment remains fragile across majors; beta-sensitive assets like XRP will respond disproportionately to broader market weakness

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Threshold: Upgraded bridge to funnel $500B institutional BTC into DeFi","https://cointelegraph.com/news/threshold-improves-tbtc-bridge-institutional-btc-defi","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:23:03 GMT","

 Threshold has introduced upgrades to its tBTC bridge, which it claims will better position the $500 billion worth of Bitcoin held by institutions and whales to access DeFi opportunities. 

Crypto infrastructure platform Threshold has rolled out a major upgrade for its tBTC bridge, aimed at enticing institutions to put their billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to work in decentralized finance protocols. 

Threshold's latest upgrade now enables institutions to mint tBTC directly to supported chains in a single Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, without secondary approvals and without gas fees, while redemptions back to the Bitcoin network are equally as straightforward, Threshold said in a statement.

Threshold's head of marketing, Rizza Carla Ramos, went into more depth in an interview with Cointelegraph at the Web Summit in Lisbon this week, explaining that the feature improvements could incentivize more Bitcoin-holding institutions to put their BTC to work in DeFi instead of just letting it sit there and waiting for it to appreciate:

“They're going to be wanting lending, they want yields on it because if they're investing for Bitcoin in the long run, you don't just want it sitting there, right?

“That's how we're going to build that next level of finance for Bitcoin, by allowing the institutions to get that part of the market onchain,” she added.

Every tBTC minted is verifiably backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, with no middlemen or custodian risk, by implementing a threshold rule where at least 51 out of 100 Bitcoin node operators must sign the transaction for it to be valid. It could empower more than $500 billion in institutional and whale-held Bitcoin to move into Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Sui and other blockchains to chase DeFi opportunities.

Threshold has seen over $4.2 billion in cumulative volume cross its tBTC bridge since it launched five years ago.

It competes with Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and renBTC (RENBTC), which have seen far more trading volume than Threshold but operate on a more centralized model to move Bitcoin across other blockchains.

WBTC made a move of its own on Thursday, expanding to Hedera to bring more liquidity and Bitcoin tokenization opportunities to the high-speed chain.

Threshold also argued that tBTC would make the decentralized finance space more robust, as Bitcoin would deepen liquidity in decentralized exchange pools and lending protocols while enabling more sustainable yields.

My main MUD was Discworld MUD which was started in 1991. I can't describe the excitement I felt on finding a game where the world continued when I was offline. Where I could go to make friends with the thrill of also making enemies.It was the perfect place to escape to, which taught me about addiction and many aspects of myself.My character is still alive after 20 something years and if I feel like logging in I'm sure there will be friendly faces who remember me.

Adding dapagliflozin (dapa) to the endothelin A receptor antagonist zibotentan (zibo) did not reduce hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) or fluid retention in patients with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension, according to 6-week results of a phase 2 study.

Although dapa could not counteract the zibo-induced fluid retention, it showed potential effects against fluid retention on its own, the researchers of the study wrote in their abstract. “We hypothesize that any increased intrahepatic vasodilation by zibo was counteracted by an increased blood volume,” they added.

The study was presented by Mattias Mandorfer, MD, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, at The Liver Meeting 2025: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD).

The findings were limited in part by the small sample size and relatively short study period.

The study was supported by AstraZeneca. Mandorfer disclosed serving as a speaker, consultant, or advisory board member for AstraZeneca, AbbVie, Boehringer Ingelheim, Echosens, Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Ipsen, Takeda, and W.L. Gore. He reported receiving grants and research support from Echosens.

A plant-based drink and an animal-based meal triggered similar satiety hormone responses and small appetite reductions after breakfast, yet neither changed how much participants ate at lunch, suggesting that increasing protein at breakfast may support satiety without automatically reducing total energy intake.



Study: The effect of consuming different dietary protein sources at breakfast upon self rated satiety, peptide YY, glucagon like peptide-1, and subsequent food intake in young and older adults. Image Credit: Muhammad Umair132 / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, researchers at Newcastle University, UK, investigated the impact of consuming different protein sources at breakfast on adults' subsequent hunger and food consumption, as well as the regulation of associated hormones.

Their findings indicate that high-protein breakfasts, both plant-based and animal-based, elicited stronger satiety hormone responses and appetite suppression, which was significant for the plant-based drink and trending for the animal-based meal. However, neither influenced the total energy consumed during the afternoon meal.

Adequate protein intake is vital for health, but environmental and ethical concerns are driving interest in sustainable, plant-based alternatives.

The Food and Agriculture Organization promotes alternative proteins as part of its global sustainability goals, leading to growth in plant-based foods and drinks.

Protein source can influence digestive, metabolic, and appetite responses, as amino acids stimulate satiety hormones such as peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) while suppressing ghrelin.

Studies comparing protein types have yielded inconsistent results; some find that casein or pea proteins are more satiating than soy, while others report stronger effects for whey.

Plant- and animal-based meals may also differ in their ability to trigger gut hormone release, with outcomes varying by population and protein form. Liquids typically reduce appetite less than solid foods, though this difference in relation to protein source remains unclear.

In the UK, most adults meet their protein recommendations, but older adults may require more due to a reduced appetite and an increased risk of muscle loss. Since breakfast tends to be low in protein, it offers an opportunity to enhance intake.

This study aimed to compare the effects of plant-based and animal-based high-protein breakfasts with a low-protein control on appetite, satiety hormones, and energy intake in younger and older adults.

Researchers employed a randomized, within-subject, crossover design, in which 18 healthy adults, comprising 12 between 18 and 35 years old and 6 over 65, participated in three breakfast conditions: a plant-based, high-protein drink, an animal-based, high-protein breakfast, and a low-protein, high-carbohydrate breakfast.

Each meal was energy-matched, with the high-protein treatments containing 30 g of protein. However, the plant-based drink contained more fiber at 7.8 g than the animal-based meal at 4.5 g. Participants attended the laboratory in a fasted state after consuming a standardized evening meal and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and exercise.



Schematic of study protocol 

Appetite was measured using visual analogue scales at baseline and at regular intervals for four hours after breakfast, while blood samples were collected at specific time points to measure plasma PYY and GLP-1 concentrations. After the final blood draw, participants consumed an ad libitum pasta lunch to assess energy intake.

Statistical analyses employed mixed models to evaluate the effects of treatment, time, and age group, while controlling for baseline values. Pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction were applied where significant effects were found. Associations between appetite, hormone levels, and energy intake were examined using repeated measures correlation analysis.

Both plant-based and animal-based high-protein breakfasts produced stronger satiety hormone responses than the low-protein, high-carbohydrate meal.

GLP-1 levels were significantly higher after both high-protein meals compared with the control, with no difference between the two protein types. Similar patterns were observed for PYY, which increased significantly after the high protein meals compared with the control, again showing no difference between protein sources.

Subjective appetite ratings were significantly lower following the plant-based protein drink and showed a trend toward reduction after the animal-based meal compared with the low-protein meal. However, these differences were modest and mostly below the 15 mm threshold considered necessary to influence eating behavior meaningfully. Energy intake at the ad libitum lunch did not differ between treatments, and no age-related effects were observed.

Correlation analyses showed that subjective appetite was positively associated with subsequent energy intake. Unexpectedly, GLP-1 and PYY levels showed weak, positive associations with energy intake; however, this represented only a statistical trend, with p values of 0.074 and 0.078, respectively, and was not significant at the 0.05 level.

Within participants, no associations were found between changes in hormone levels, appetite, or energy intake. Overall, both high-protein breakfasts promoted greater satiety hormone responses and appetite suppression than the low-protein meal, but did not affect later food intake.

This study found that plant- and animal-based high-protein breakfasts similarly enhanced satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY, and reduced appetite, compared with a high-carbohydrate, low-protein meal, with no difference observed between protein sources or age groups.

Although the plant-based drink appeared to produce slightly quicker hormonal responses, a tentative observation the authors suggested might be due to faster gastric emptying of liquids, these effects did not translate into reduced energy intake at lunch.

The comparable responses indicate that plant-based proteins can effectively replace animal proteins in supporting satiety without affecting subsequent calorie intake. Strengths of this analysis include a controlled, crossover design and inclusion of older adults.

Limitations include the small size of the older adult subgroup and the absence of solid plant-based and liquid animal-based conditions, which limit the ability to isolate the effects of protein form and source. Moreover, the study was not statistically powered to detect age differences, which increases the risk of overlooking true age-related effects.

In conclusion, a plant-based, high-protein drink appears to be a practical and sustainable alternative for increasing protein intake without affecting later eating behavior. However, future studies are needed to assess the long-term acceptability of these dietary interventions and the real-world applications of these findings.

A new study published in Nature and Science of Sleep reveals a strong connection between social media addiction and poor sleep quality among high school graduates in Bangladesh, offering fresh insights into the mental health and digital habits of young people. 

Researchers from the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine, CHINTA Research Bangladesh, University of South Asia, Jahangirnagar University and the Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, analyzed data from 1,139 students preparing for university admission. The study found that higher levels of social media addiction were closely associated with poorer sleep quality. Two key symptoms - ""relapse"" and ""daytime performance disruption"" - emerged as major links between excessive social media use and sleep problems. 

The study also uncovered significant gender differences. Female participants experienced poorer sleep quality when social media addiction was present, while male students exhibited a higher overall prevalence of addiction, suggesting a differential, sex-related susceptibility to the effects of social media use. 

Through network analysis, the researchers identified several ""central"" symptoms that bridged social media use and sleep health: ""mood modification,"" ""taking time to fall asleep"" (sleep latency) and ""efficiency disruption during the day."" 

These findings underscore that sleep health and social media behaviors are deeply intertwined. Our results highlight the importance of targeted interventions to promote healthier digital and sleep habits among young people.""

An international study co-led by University of Calgary researchers has found new insulin delivery technology helps control glucose levels during pregnancy for those with Type 1 diabetes, which is crucial to the health of women and their newborns.

The technology, known as automated insulin delivery (AID), mimics a healthy pancreas. The system automatically adjusts the amount of insulin given by a pump in real-time, based on current and predicted glucose levels.

""For pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes, keeping glucose within a healthy range is very important to the health of the woman and fetus,"" says an endocrinologist at Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary and Cumming School of Medicine researcher Dr. Lois Donovan, MD, the study co-principal investigator.

In a multicenter clinical trial, published in JAMA, researchers evaluated the impact of a hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin therapy treatment regime with standard insulin injections or an insulin pump that was not automated, along with continuous glucose monitoring.

Keeping blood glucose in the optimal range for pregnancy is exceptionally challenging when someone has Type 1 diabetes, despite their best efforts and the support of dedicated health care clinics.""

Dr. Denice Feig, MD, study's other co-principal investigator

She is an endocrinologist and clinician scientist at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health, and a professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

Risks associated with Type 1 diabetes in pregnancy can include increased chances of miscarriage, preeclampsia, which involves dangerous spike in blood pressure, and other significant health concerns. Newborns of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes are more likely to be born excessively large or early and have low blood glucose at birth and are at higher risk of birth defects.

""The study found this AID system worked in pregnancy. It resulted in a three hours per day improvement in the time spent in the desired glucose range compared to the standard delivery with insulin injections or regular insulin pumps,"" says Donovan. ""This is very important because we have learned from other larger studies that every 72 minute per day increase, with glucose in the desired range during pregnancy, is associated with reduction in newborn complications.""

The AID system used in the study is knowns as a Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology.

""We've known for a while that AID systems have achieved better glucose control with less diabetes management burden in non-pregnant people with Type 1 diabetes, but its use had not been well studied in pregnancy,"" Donovan says. ""Most AIDs were not designed to achieve the narrow glucose range desired in pregnancy or to adapt quickly enough to the changing insulin requirement of pregnancy.""

The study found those using the AID spent more time in a healthy glucose level range and less time below and above the healthy range. The improvement in blood sugar control was immediate and persisted throughout the pregnancy. These results were found at all 14 sites involved in the trial.

""This finding will help inform people who are pregnant or planning pregnancy regarding the benefits of this AID system, which can help them achieve better glucose levels in pregnancy and hopefully better pregnancy outcomes"" says Feig.

The University of Calgary was the lead site for the study with clinics involved in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver, Quebec City, London (Ont.), Winnipeg, Halifax as well as Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney, Australia.

Funding for the study was provided by Diabetes Canada, MSI Foundation, the University of Calgary Clinical Research Fund, the Buckley Family Trust, the Mount Sinai Department of Medicine Research Fund. The Medical Research Future Fund of Australia funded the trial in that country. In kind, reduced cost and loan of study supplies was provided by Dexcom Canada, Tandem Diabetes Care and RxFood.

A magnetically guided microrobotics system is capable of navigating the body's intricate passageways and vasculature to deliver drugs with pinpoint accuracy, according to a new study. The novel system could enable safer, targeted drug treatments that minimize unwanted side effects. Systemic drug treatments often cause unwanted side effects due to off-target exposure and account for nearly one-third of failures in clinical trials, illustrating the need for precise, targeted drug delivery strategies.

To address this, researchers have worked to develop magnetic micro- and nanorobots designed to deliver drugs directly to diseased tissues. Advances in materials science, fabrication, and control systems have enabled microrobots capable of complex movement and targeted delivery in complex biological environments. However, bridging these technologies into clinical practice remains challenging, as it requires the seamless integration of locomotion, navigation, drug delivery, and imaging functions into a single platform while also ensuring the use of biocompatible, biodegradable materials.

Building on their previous work, Fabian Landers and colleagues present a modular magnetically guided, microrobotic platform that integrates an electromagnetic navigation system (Navion) with a custom release catheter and drug-loaded, dissolvable capsule. Each nontethered gelatin-based microrobot contains magnetic and radiopaque nanoparticles along with therapeutic agents, allowing it to be precisely guided to a target site within the body while being tracked in real-time via X-ray imaging. After use, the microrobot can be triggered to dissolve safely within the body.

Landers et al. tested the platform in vitro using human vasculature models and in vivo in sheep and pigs under realistic clinical conditions to demonstrate the system's capabilities. By applying specific magnetic fields, the authors show that the system can maneuver through complex blood vessels and cerebrospinal spaces, trigger controlled heating to dissolve the microrobot and precisely release drugs into targeted tissues, even reaching the smallest vessels. ""Although significant work remains to fully translate this technology into clinical practice, our results provide a robust framework for addressing the complex challenges associated with targeted drug delivery,"" Landers et al. write.

Alcohol-related diseases and injuries have the potential to cost the Australian healthcare system a staggering $68 billion over 60 years if nothing is done to stop the impact.

The new Griffith University developed The Alcohol Policy (TAP) model is an epidemiological model used to estimate the avoidable alcohol-related disease, injury and healthcare cost burden in the Australian population aged over 15 years.

Dr. Mary Wanjau from Griffith's School of Medicine and Dentistry said if we eliminated alcohol consumption over the first 25 years, we could prevent more than 25 million cases of diseases and injuries and more than 200 thousand deaths, of which the majority would be from cancers.

If we act now and eliminate alcohol consumption to zero, we could save the healthcare system $55 billion in the first 25 years. These findings can help policymakers understand the scale of the future alcohol burden which can be prevented.""

Dr. Mary Wanjau from Griffith's School of Medicine and Dentistry

Excessive use of alcohol was one of the leading risks for mortality and disability globally with the evidence suggesting there is no safe level of alcohol-use for overall health.

The risk of cancers and mortality rises with increased levels of drinking.

Young adults aged 15-39 years bear most of the acute consequences due to high rates of injuries leading to death and disability.

Even minor decreases in alcohol consumption across the population could significantly reduce health burdens for individuals and the healthcare system while also lowering costs for individuals, communities, and governments.

Professor Lennert Veerman said the findings support prioritisation of investment in alcohol harm reduction.

""Policies and interventions which reduce consumption at the population level are likely to offer favourable impact as they create environments which support and allow for an increase in the number of people who abstain from drinking, a delay in the age when people start drinking, and reductions in alcohol consumption for those who drink,"" he said.

""The research findings underscore the consequences of inaction and reinforce the health and economic case for preventive measures, especially for Australia, where alcohol is the most widely used drug.

""Stronger alcohol control policies are needed to realise these gains in the reduction of alcohol harm and related healthcare costs.""

The paper 'The avoidable health burden and healthcare costs related to alcohol consumption in Australia: multistate life table modelling' has been published in the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction.

Research institutions around the world house valuable genetic information that could help unlock countless medical mysteries. However, because DNA degrades over time, it is difficult for researchers to analyze DNA samples older than 20 years using conventional analytical approaches.

Although modern technologies have transformed researchers' ability to learn about disease, these technologies have primarily been used on modern genetic samples. The ability to study genetic data from earlier decades has been exceedingly limited, which hinders researchers' understanding of old diseases and why changes in diseases occur over time.

By adapting techniques originally used to study ancient DNA from archaeological specimens, researchers at the University of Chicago were able to recover genetic information from nearly century-old medical samples.

The work will be presented at the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) 2025 Annual Meeting & Expo, taking place Nov. 11–15 in Boston.

To test their technique, the researchers used samples of tissue from colorectal cancer specimens collected between 1932 and 2023. The researchers chose to focus on colorectal cancer because it has become significantly more common among young adults over the past several decades without a clear explanation. Today, a 35-year-old is twice as likely to develop colorectal cancer compared to a 35-year-old in 1985.

The researchers isolated tumor tissue from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens for DNA extraction. The researchers optimized the removal of paraffin wax and chemical preservatives to maximize the amount of usable DNA. Next, the researchers used tailored approaches to put the DNA fragments into a readable format for sequencing. They created a custom pipeline using digital tools typically reserved for ancient DNA analysis so they could match samples with missing or damaged DNA to the human genome.

After checking the quality of the DNA, the researchers sequenced the genome using whole-genome sequencing and a targeted gene-enrichment panel (OncoPlus) to find genetic mutations that drive tumor growth. In both cases, they modified the protocols to retain tiny fragments of DNA that is traditionally discarded. Finally, they analyzed the non-human DNA found in the tissue samples to identify bacteria that may have been in the tumor.

Dr. Alexander Guzzetta, M.D., Ph.D., who oversaw the project alongside ancient DNA researcher Maanasa Raghavan, Ph.D., noted, ""When we analyzed bacterial DNA from colon cancer tissues, we not only detected normal gut microbes but also bacterial species which are specifically associated with colon cancer."" The team is now working on refining their analysis methods to better understand these bacteria and understand how their presence may have shifted over time.

Although Guzzetta's team is currently focused on colorectal cancer he hopes that other researchers use this work to study other disease changes over time. ""There is massive potential here for other groups to use these approaches to unravel the root causes underlying the shifting landscape of modern diseases,"" Guzzetta said. ""This approach could unlock the ability to study how diseases evolve over decades and shed light on how their biology has changed through time.""

This work was led by Alexander Guzzetta, M.D., Ph.D., at the University of Chicago, and will be presented during a platform presentation at 2:45 p.m. Eastern time on Nov. 13, at the Thomas M. Menino Convention and Exhibition Center in Boston. The work will also be presented as a poster in the convention center. Guzzetta's poster number is TT008. He will be available to discuss the work with reporters.

A new sociomedical perspective shows how off-label use of GLP-1 drugs for slimness is redefining what counts as a healthy, responsible body, revealing hidden moral pressures and global inequalities behind the weight loss boom.



Perspective: The Uncharted Territory of the New Obesity Drugs in Users Without Obesity: A Sociomedical Perspective. Image Credit: Pietukhova / Shutterstock

In a recent perspective in the journal Obesity, researchers discussed recent medical developments that have not only revolutionized the treatment of diabetes and obesity, but whose popularity has also quickly spread among groups who lack clinical indication for obesity or diabetes treatment.

This off-label use, the authors argue, is exposing deeper tensions between medical innovation, weight stigma, and the social value attached to thinness, as medication becomes a means of attaining social and aesthetic goals rather than improving health.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have revolutionized the treatment of obesity and diabetes, offering significant weight loss with manageable side effects. However, their popularity has rapidly spread to individuals without obesity or metabolic disorders, who use them off-label to achieve or maintain slimness.

This phenomenon, marked by celebrity endorsements, media attention, online sales, and widespread social media discussion, reflects more than a medical trend. It reveals a growing cultural shift in which slimness is equated with moral virtue, self-discipline, and social value, as the authors describe it - a moral economy of the body.

The authors argue that this off-label use exposes deeper tensions between medical innovation, body image ideals, and the social meanings attached to thinness, and explicitly ask whether such use should be considered an abuse of medical technology or a rational adaptation to weight-stigmatizing environments.

Understanding these behaviors requires moving beyond clinical data to explore the psychological, cultural, and political contexts that shape how people use these drugs. Off-label use represents a form of pharmacological thinness, where medication becomes a means of attaining aesthetic and social goals rather than health improvement.

GLP-1 RA drugs were initially developed for individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes, but their reach has extended far beyond this population.

With the rise of online promotion and influencer marketing, these drugs are now positioned as tools of lifestyle optimization and bodily perfection. This expansion also highlights the limitations of the body mass index (BMI) in defining obesity, as many individuals with normal or mildly elevated BMIs may perceive themselves as needing intervention.

Weight loss, once a clinical outcome, has become a visible marker of personal virtue, performative achievement, and conformity to dominant beauty and health ideals, reflecting broader neoliberal healthism ideals that conflate appearance with moral responsibility. Within this moral economy, losing weight symbolizes effort and commitment, while failing to do so is seen as a moral shortcoming.

For users without obesity, these drugs may represent a means of achieving socially approved body shapes and social worth without the burden of traditional self-discipline. They help individuals navigate a culture that equates thinness with attractiveness, competence, and even employability.

Research gaps remain across multiple domains regarding the off-label use of GLP-1 RAs. One key gap concerns food and appetite, particularly how these drugs reshape users' emotional and sensory relationships with eating. While some individuals may feel liberated by reduced hunger, others may experience distress, alienation, or loss of enjoyment associated with food.

Another area of uncertainty involves side effects, as users' perceptions of symptoms such as nausea or fatigue may vary widely and may even be interpreted as markers of treatment efficacy. For some, these effects are interpreted as signs of drug efficacy or commitment to weight loss, whereas others experience them as discomforting or harmful.

Gaps also persist in understanding the impact of these drugs on body image and self-worth. While weight loss may enhance self-esteem for some, it may simultaneously heighten dissatisfaction or lead to further body modification pursuits, such as cosmetic procedures. Off-label use may alter eating behaviors, emotional regulation, and mental health, potentially leading to increased anxiety, guilt, or disordered eating.

Further research is required on access and dependency, particularly regarding how users obtain these drugs through medical or informal channels, and how cost, medical oversight, medical gatekeeping, and social privilege shape accessibility. Emotional dependence also warrants investigation, as some users may fear weight regain more intensely than adverse effects, raising concerns about long-term reliance.

Social media plays a pivotal role in normalizing GLP-1 RA use, spreading narratives that frame pharmacological weight loss as desirable and legitimate. However, the ways digital spaces shape motivations, self-image, and peer validation remain poorly understood. Users may view pharmacological weight loss as more legitimate or effective than other methods, reinforcing moral hierarchies around body management.

The authors propose a multinational research initiative, currently involving Brazil, the US, Denmark, and Japan, to examine how off-label GLP-1 RA use manifests across different societies, where cultural contexts shape distinct motivations. For example, this includes navigating racialized beauty standards in Brazil and technologies of neoliberal self-discipline in the US. This is not merely a deviation from medical norms but part of a broader cultural transformation in how the body, health, and morality are understood.

An intersectional framework is vital to understanding how factors such as gender, race, age, class, and geography shape who uses these drugs, how they are judged, and what outcomes they experience. Without such nuance, users risk being stereotyped as vain or irresponsible, while the deeper structural pressures that normalize pharmaceutical thinness remain invisible.

Ultimately, understanding off-label GLP-1 RA use requires integrating biomedical insights with sociological and cultural analysis. These drugs not only alter metabolism and appetite but also reshape identities, social hierarchies, and moral judgments.

Taking a page from market research tactics, UC San Francisco experts are studying whether artificial intelligence (AI) can improve diagnosis of a complex liver condition by using the clinical notes of multiple providers. 

Their recent study, published in Gastro Hep Advances, focused on hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a complex condition associated with liver disease that is often difficult to diagnose during hospitalization. The researchers sought to learn if large language models could analyze the clinical notes of multiple physicians and other providers to improve diagnostic accuracy and streamline patient care. 

""The concept is inspired by sentiment analysis technology commonly used with reviews in online shopping platforms, where AI summarizes collective opinions,"" said Jin Ge, MD, MBA, UCSF assistant professor of medicine and gastroenterologist, who led the study.

We utilized this approach to determine if collective sentiment could predict an HRS diagnosis.""

Jin Ge, MD, MBA, Assistant Professor, University of California - San Francisco

The study compared traditional diagnostic methods based on clinical variables, such as lab results, with an AI-enhanced model that incorporated sentiment analysis derived from clinical notes. Incorporating AI-generated sentiment scores significantly improved predictive accuracy for HRS diagnosis upon patient discharge. 

The technology offers clarity in situations where conflicting recommendations among health care professionals may arise, providing a unified summary of the care team's consensus for clinicians and patients alike. While still in the research phase, this application has the potential to transform decision-making in hospitals and enhance patient outcomes. 

""Using the 'wisdom of the crowd' doesn't just predict outcomes, it offers a directional insight into what the clinical care team collectively thinks about a patient's condition,"" said Ge. ""For cases with mixed opinions or uncertainty, AI-generated summaries could help align care decisions and expedite treatment plans."" 

The study has not yet been implemented in clinical practice but could pave the way for future trials. The researchers aim to evaluate how this information might influence real-world decision-making and patient care.

A blocked coronary artery causing an acute heart attack must be opened immediately with a stent procedure. However, if other coronary arteries also appear to be narrowed, it is safe to wait and treat those later. This approach cuts the number of stent procedures in half, according to cardiologists from Radboud university medical center, writing in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Each year, 33,600 people are admitted to the hospital with a heart attack. In those cases, doctors must quickly open the blocked artery with angioplasty to prevent part of the heart muscle from dying. Yet during the procedure, it often becomes clear that other coronary arteries are also narrowed. Researchers from 41 hospitals, led by Radboudumc, investigated whether it is necessary to treat those narrowed vessels immediately, or if it can be done safely later, under calmer circumstances.

Their study, involving 1,146 participants, shows that waiting is safe. Only patients with an acute heart attack were included. This means that a coronary artery is completely blocked, for example by a blood clot. Half of the patients received full treatment immediately, while for the other half, additional stenting was done up to six weeks later. The researchers followed the patients for three years. Robin Nijveldt, Professor of Cardiovascular Imaging at Radboudumc, explains.

We saw no difference between the two groups in terms of death, new heart attacks, or hospital admissions due to heart failure.""

Robin Nijveldt, Professor, Cardiovascular Imaging, Radboud University Medical Center

One striking finding: in the later, calmer phase, cardiologists treated only half as many narrowed arteries as in the acute phase. 'That's because of how we determine whether stenting is necessary', says Professor of Cardiology Niels van Royen. 'In the acute phase, we use a catheter to measure pressure inside the blood vessel. Later, we can perform an MRI scan to map the heart's overall blood flow. If that shows the heart is getting enough oxygen, then stenting a single narrowed artery isn't required.'

Still, the cardiologists don't advise delaying additional treatment deliberately. 'For patients, it's usually more convenient to have everything done in one procedure', Van Royen explains. 'But sometimes that's not possible - for example, if the patient is in pain and exhausted, or if another person with an acute heart attack arrives and takes priority. Now we know it's safe to stop at that point. There's no need to force things, because faster is not better.'

It's also now clear that cardiologists can reassure patients a few weeks later with an MRI scan showing that no further stenting is needed. 'But patients do need to come back for the MRI', Van Royen notes. 'Some choose to skip the follow-up, even though additional treatment might still be wise.'

The cardiologists expect that current guidelines - which recommend immediate treatment of all narrowed arteries during the acute phase - will soon be revised. 'These guidelines were based on two major studies that showed a small short-term benefit to immediate treatment, but not in the long term', Nijveldt says. 'Our study provides more clarity: that benefit doesn't actually exist.'

PHILADELPHIA — Perhaps the clearest sign of Mauricio Pochettino's background at the club level comes in his interaction with members of the U.S. men's national team when they are outside international windows.

Which is to say, there's not much interaction at all.

“I feel like in-season, he kinda lets you deal with your club and lets you focus on your coach and stuff there,” USMNT defender Alex Freeman told The Post this week. “But if you ever need him, he's always a text or a call away. He always picks up. I think he lets you be at your club. He was a club coach, so he probably knows how it is with clubs.”

That is not to imply that Pochettino isn't building the necessary relationships with his players or doing the legwork in between international windows amid the run-up to next summer's World Cup that will be the most important event for American soccer perhaps ever.

Pochettino and his staff have visited more than 50 clubs in North America and Europe and watch every game they can. 

When Freeman showed up at camp for the Gold Cup over the summer, Pochettino took him aside for a 20-minute conversation that included extensive feedback on his game.

“It's good to go to camp and have a guy who's giving you feedback and letting you know what he thinks about how you play,” Freeman said. “Just gives you confidence as a player to want to do better for him. Just having him as a coach, you can tell he's very passionate about the sport and he wants the best out of all of us.”

Pochettino has admitted he didn't know Cristian Roldan before making the midfielder a late call-up two months ago. 

But when Roldan arrived for his first camp under the Argentine, Pochettino established a relationship immediately, nevertheless.

“Giving me confidence, telling me I belong here,” Roldan told The Post. “Telling me that I can do it, that I had been gone [from the national team] for two years [but] I still have the ability to affect the game in the way they see it. To be myself with my personality. I think that those things correlate to success. And I felt like he did a great job of just bringing me in and making it seem seamless.”

That was crucial for Roldan's successful re-entry into the national team fold.

“He was very clear in what he wanted out of me,” Roldan said. “So just bringing that same energy back is really important. … Continue to form that relationship. Definitely trust is the first word I'd put to it.”

PHILADELPHIA — Mark McKenzie was talking Thursday about the little intricacies, the things an athlete knows about his teammates through practicing together over and over and over again.

“Whether it's turning over your left shoulder, turning over your right shoulder, whether someone's a bit more aggressive stepping into midfield,” McKenzie, a center back for the USMNT, said before Thursday's training session. “Whether they're more comfortable in aerial duels, whether they're more comfortable covering space behind. I think those are all things you build through repetition.”

And that inherently represents a problem to be solved for a national team.

Between now and June 12, when it begins the World Cup on home soil in Los Angeles, the Yanks have all of a handful of training sessions together. 

There is another international window in March, with Portugal and Belgium as rumored friendly opponents, that should include something like the A-team at camp, and there will be the final, pre-World Cup training camp in the immediate lead-up to the competition itself.

Of course, there's also the remainder of the current window, which includes a friendly against Paraguay on Saturday here in Philadelphia, as well as one against Uruguay on Tuesday in Tampa. 

Due to a mix of injuries and circumstances, though, a number of players anticipated to play key roles at the World Cup, including Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson, Yunus Musah and Chris Richards, were not called up this time around.

The problem is not unique to the United States; it's inherent to any national team and in any sport. 

Still, the question of how to build chemistry over a limited window of practices, dispersed over months at a time, with the stakes as high as could be, is one whose answer will help dictate how far the U.S. goes next summer.

“There's a sense of intentionality, a sense of urgency, that comes along with that,” McKenzie said. “Knowing you have a limited amount of training sessions together. Knowing that there's work to be done, areas we want to improve on and continue to grow as a group. Building the chemistry we already have. Figuring out the nuances of how we want to play, what message we want to send every time we step on the pitch, to our opponents. The biggest thing is intentionality and urgency with the sessions we do have together.”

Of course, it's not as if players show up their first time at a national team camp cold, not knowing anyone in the building. 

The world of American soccer is small and interconnected. 

McKenzie, Brendan Aaronson, Auston Trusty and Matt Freese, for example, all grew up in Philadelphia and played for Bethlehem Steel FC, the United Soccer League affiliate for the MLS Philadelphia Union.

Alex Freeman has built close bonds with fellow defenders Max Arfsten and Miles Robinson.

“I feel like the bond of this team is one of the reasons I feel like we're gonna go very far in this World Cup,” Freeman told The Post on Wednesday. “We do everything together. Not only that, it's like no egos. No one thinks they're better than everyone. I think it's nice because [coach Mauricio] Pochettino kinda created that culture. Everyone here has to work for it.”

Pochettino, in the run-up to this camp, dismissed any notion that his main group may not get enough time together before the World Cup.

“We are not going to complain,” he said. “We cannot give excuses to ourselves in case [we do] not perform. I think we have time enough. We need to be intelligent and we need to give our best to perform and it's up to us.”

Women's World Cup champions and Olympic gold medallists Tobin Heath and Heather O'Reilly were elected Thursday to the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame along with men's players Tony Sanneh and Chris Wondolowski.

Referee Kari Seitz also was elected along with Kevin Crow, known primarily for his time in indoor football.

They will be inducted on May 1 at the hall in Frisco, Texas.

O'Reilly, 40, was a forward and winger who scored 47 goals in 231 international appearances, helping the U.S. win the 2015 World Cup and Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012. 

She won league titles with Sky Blue in 2009 in Women's Professional Soccer and with Kansas City in 2015 and North Carolina in 2019 in the National Women's Soccer League.

Heath, 37, was a midfielder and forward who had 36 goals in 181 appearances, winning World Cup titles with the U.S. in 2015 and 2019 and Olympic gold medals in 2008 and 2012.

Wondolowski, 42, is Major League Soccer's career scoring leader with 171 regular-season goals and two in the playoffs, playing for San Jose (2005, 2009-21) and Houston (2006-09). He scored 11 goals in 35 international appearances, playing in two games at the 2014 World Cup.

Sanneh, 54, was a defender who scored three goals in 43 international appearances, starting all five games for the U.S. at the 2002 World Cup as the Americans reached the quarterfinals in their farthest advancement since 1930. 

O'Reilly, Heath and Wondolowski were picked from the player ballot, while Sanneh and Crow were chosen from the veteran ballot.

Seitz, 55, refereed nine games at the Women's World Cup in 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011 and six at the Olympics in 2004, 2008 and 2012. She became the U.S. Soccer Federation's vice president of referees in 2024.

Seitz was on the builder ballot, which this year included only referees. The top voter-getter is picked if receiving at least 50 per cent.

Three former players who performed domestically and internationally for U.S. national teams, have been elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame, the organization revealed on its website on Thursday.

The trio was U.S. women's national team standouts Heather O'Reilly and Tobin Heath and Major League Soccer all-time scoring leader Chris Wondolowski.

All three were voted in on the Players' Ballot.

O'Reilly played 231 full internationals between 2002 and 2016. She was a member of the 2015 Women's World Cup championship side, and Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012.

Heath made 181 appearances for the USWNT. She performed three Women's World Cups, lifting the trophy in 2015 and 2019. She also competed in four Olympic soccer tournaments, winning gold in 2008 and 2012 and bronze in 2021.

A forward who retired as the leading goal scorer in Major League Soccer history, Wondolowski played 17 seasons in the league between 2005-21.

They will be inducted into the NSHOF in Frisco, Texas on May 1, 2026.

There likely will be more inductees soon.

The 2026 World Cup is almost upon us, especially now that the USMNT is about to play its final two games of the 2025 calendar year. The first game is set for Saturday when the Americans play Paraguay. Mauricio Pochettino's team is on a three-match unbeaten run, finally showing some promise and building some momentum ahead of the World Cup. However, they will be challenged by Paraguay, which is also preparing for next summer.

Following a concerning loss to South Korea in September, the U.S. has turned things around. A switch by Pochettino to a three-back system has yielded a win over Japan, a draw with Ecuador, and a win over Australia. However, it's not a stretch to say that the USMNT's biggest tests of the year await with the games against Paraguay and Uruguay.

Saturday's opponent, Paraguay, is coming off a successful World Cup qualification campaign. Granted, seven wins, seven draws, and four losses were only good for sixth place in CONMEBOL qualifying. But it was good enough to make it into the field of 48, getting Paraguay to the World Cup for the first time since 2010.

This will be the first time the USMNT and Paraguay have played each other since 2018. The U.S. won that March 2018 friendly 1-0. They were also victorious in a 1-0 win over Paraguay during the 2016 Copa América despite playing most of the second half with 10 players.

Time: Saturday, November 15, 5:00 PM, ET

Venue: Subaru Park, Chester, Pennsylvania

TV/streaming: TNT and HBOMax in English | Telemundo, Universo and Peacock in Spanish

Our final roster of the year is here! 🇺🇸⚽️25 players have been called up for matches against Paraguay on Nov. 15 and Uruguay on Nov. 18! 👇 pic.twitter.com/7D0bnH2QPu

While it seems like Pochettino is starting to put the pieces together for next year's World Cup, this will not be the USMNT at full strength. Injuries and circumstances at club level will leave the U.S. without the likes of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Tyler Adams, Malik Tillman, Chris Richards, Tim Weah, and Weston McKennie for the November window. All seven are potential starts, leaving some uncertainty as to how the USMNT will lineup against Paraguay.

USMNT Lineup (3-4-3, right to left)

Matt Freese (GK) - Miles Robinson, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream - Sergiño Dest, Aidan Morris, Tanner Tessmann, Max Arfsten - Brenden Aaronson, Folarin Balgoun, Gio Reyna

Paraguay Lineup (4-2–3-1, right to left)

Roberto Fernandez (GK) - Juan Caceres, Gustavo Gomez, Omar Alderete, Junior Alonso - Damian Bobadilla, Andres Cubas - Hugo Cuenca, Diego Gomez, Miguel Almiron - Antonio Sanabria

Paraguay should be a good test for the U.S., especially since Pochettino's side is missing several key figures. The South American side has just two losses in its last 14 matches, although one of those came in a friendly against South Korea last month. That stretch also includes victories over Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay in World Cup qualifying matches, so Paraguay can compete against high-level teams.

Defensively, Paraguay has been particularly strong. They have a veteran backline that's helped them to keep seven clean sheets in their last 14 matches. Only four times in those 14 matches has their opponent scored multiple goals. On the other hand, both Japan and South Korea scored two goals against them in friendlies last month.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has come on strong on both ends lately. The three-back formation has helped to solidify them defensively, while the Americans have shown some grit and determination to manufacture goals on the attacking end. Even with key players missing, the USMNT has some potential match-winners, not to mention plenty of players with a point to prove, which should help push the Americans over the top.

Prediction: USA 2, Paraguay 1

As football's global governing body, FIFA, gears up for its largest-ever World Cup in 2026, it has enlisted technology giant Lenovo as its official partner to manage the operational and digital demands of the tournament.

In a recent media briefing, executives from both organisations outlined the scope of the partnership, which aims to leverage advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance the experience for teams, broadcasters, and the estimated six billion fans who will tune in.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted across the US, Mexico, and Canada, is set to be an event of unprecedented scale, featuring a record 48 teams, 104 games, and 16 host cities. Running such a massive event requires a robust technology backbone, a role which Lenovo is well-positioned to fill, said FIFA technology director Nacho Fresco.

“We need a partner who is able to deliver fast, because in a World Cup football match, we cannot wait for just one minute,” Fresco said, adding that Lenovo's innovative and entrepreneurial spirit, as well as high-quality standards, helped to seal the deal.

For Lenovo, its work with FIFA will allow it to showcase its full breadth of capabilities beyond its reputation as a major PC maker. Besides supplying laptops, tablets, and Motorola smartphones used by officials to run the games, the company will also provide servers, storage, and edge infrastructure to power systems like the Hawk-Eye video assistant referee used by FIFA referees to make pitch decisions.

Jeff Shafer, Lenovo's senior vice-president of corporate marketing, said the World Cup is also an opportunity for the company to transform itself into an AI powerhouse. “The reality is that if we can do it for FIFA, F1 and the Olympics, then we know we can do it for anybody out there, from consumers to the biggest companies in the world.”

Art Hu, Lenovo's chief information officer, concurred, noting that the partnership is in line with its transition to a services-led, AI-first company in a hybrid world, focusing on developing custom capabilities for use cases where out-of-the-box solutions do not exist.

For example, Hu said tablets will be deployed to not only help VIP guests such as government leaders get seated, but also provide them with access to content, such as game snippets and match statistics, delivering a high-touch experience for a targeted set of users.

While AI-powered services and applications for players, coaches, broadcasters and fans are being saved for a major reveal at the CES technology show in Las Vegas in January 2026, Shafer said “if we can use AI to deliver something of value to each one of those groups, we'd have achieved our goal.”

Santiago Manso, Lenovo's director for sports vertical, added that the robustness of the systems and infrastructure used to support World Cup games can be replicated in other fields, such as nuclear power, smart energy grids, and military defence – all of which require high resiliency.

In the run-up to World Cup 2026, Lenovo had the opportunity to apply its capabilities during the FIFA Club World Cup this past summer, where it helped implement semi-automated offside technology, leading to faster and more accurate offside calls that reduced game delays. “That benefits the players, broadcasters and fans, and it makes the game better,” Shafer said.

When asked by Computer Weekly about what's being done to secure the high-profile tournament – a prime target for disruption – against cyber threats, Manso said Lenovo is incorporating security into all its devices and services from the design stage, he said, adding that the company is also working with FIFA and governments in host countries to incorporate multiple layers of security.

Ultimately, both organisations see the partnership as a legacy-defining project. “We are going to have the most technologically advanced FIFA World Cup,” Fresco said, adding that the work done for the men's World Cup will extend to future tournaments, including the Women's World Cup in 2027.

The alleged deal to use the Kennedy Center complex comes as ticket sales are reportedly declining after Trump's takeover

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

FIFA will reportedly use large parts of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., displacing previously scheduled performers, even as the showpiece arts complex is reportedly struggling with sharply declining ticket sales following President Donald Trump's takeover of the institution earlier this year.

The soccer governing body will occupy multiple facilities for nearly three weeks that normally rent for tens of thousands of dollars per day in the lead-up to the December 5 World Cup draw there, The Washington Post reports, citing an August venue use agreement and Kennedy Center employees. 

The operation has reportedly forced big-name performers to relocate to other venues, including the National Symphony Orchestra. 

The Independent has contacted FIFA and the Kennedy Center for comment. 

In the eight months since Trump cleaned house at the Kennedy Center and installed himself as chair of its board ticket sales have reportedly plummeted nearly 50 percent.

Using the venue for the World Cup draw caps off months of FIFA president Gianni Infantino building goodwill with President Trump. 

In July, the president was on hand at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium to present a trophy to Chelsea, the winners of the FIFA Club World Cup. 

The following month, Infantino visited Trump in the White House, where the president was seen holding the golden World Cup winner's trophy, which the FIFA boss said was privilege only given to “the FIFA President, presidents of countries, and then those who win.”

The FIFA boss has also joined the many dignitaries who've publicly supported Trump's long-running bid to win a Nobel Peace Prize, writing in October that Trump “definitely deserves” the award for his efforts toward a peace deal in Gaza. 

FIFA has said it will unveil the winner of its own newly created peace price on December 5, the same day as the World Cup draw. 

Earlier this month, when asked if Trump would win the FIFA prize, Infantino left the door open to the possibility.

“On the 5th of December, you will see,” he told reporters.

FIFA also opened an office in New York City's Trump Tower this year.

The U.S., Mexico, and Canada will jointly host the 2026 men's World Cup.

Northern Ireland last qualified for the World Cup in 1986

Fifa World Cup qualifier: Slovakia v Northern Ireland

Venue: Kosice, Slovakia Date: Friday, 14 November Kick-off: 19:45 GMT

Coverage: Watch live on BBC Two NI, BBC Three & BBC iPlayer; commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Radio Ulster & BBC Sounds; live text commentary and in-play clips on BBC Sport website & app

As Northern Ireland take the field against Slovakia on Friday evening, for many of Michael O'Neill's young squad it will feel like the most consequential international of their careers to date.

With their efforts to reach the World Cup in North America next summer reaching a critical juncture, there is a sense that the 90 minutes in Kosice could be defining in Group A where Northern Ireland are three points behind both Germany and Slovakia with two games remaining. 

However, needing at least a point to carry their hopes of a top-two finish into their final group game at home to Luxembourg on Monday, there is the curious scenario where Northern Ireland's players could leave the field beaten, only to discover that events elsewhere have ensured them a qualifying play-off spot regardless.

As a winner of their Nations League group, only a highly unlikely set of results would mean Northern Ireland would miss out on the play-off games in March. 

Knowing the importance of seeding come the play-offs, and what second place in the group would represent for his panel, manager O'Neill is giving little thought to the potential of a backdoor route into those crunch spring fixtures.

""We haven't paid any attention to that,"" he said. ""We did our job in the Nations League and, if that gives us a route to a qualification play-off, great. If it doesn't, we have to take care of it here.

""This is the here and now, we have to deal with that situation which is obviously getting as many points as we can from the final two games.

""What we can get is 12 points and we have to aspire to that.""

NI the 'strongest we've been' - Peacock-Farrell

Magennis praises NI 'fearlessness and athleticism'

Belief that Northern Ireland could seal second place ahead of Slovakia surged after they were comfortably the superior team when the sides met in Belfast last month, winning 2-0 with a performance that record goalscorer David Healy said was perhaps their best ever under O'Neill.

In the weeks since, however, there is a growing feeling that the tables have turned somewhat.

Slovakia were missing influential pair Stanislav Lobotka and David Hancko for the game at Windsor Park, with both expected to be back in Francesco Calzona's starting line-up at the Kosice Football Arena this time around. 

Northern Ireland, however, will be without three-quarters of the midfield that so impressed in the reverse fixture, with Shea Charles and Ali McCann injured while Ethan Galbraith is suspended.

How the manager fills such considerable holes in his line-up has been the key talking point since his squad was confirmed last week.

In Napoli's Lobotka, O'Neill believes Slovakia can again call upon one of the best defensive midfielders in Europe.

""He's an excellent player and he plays at the top level with Napoli, but we look at Slovakia as a team, we don't look at them as one player or two players,"" he said.

""It won't change the way Slovakia try and play. We have to deal with that as a team, it's not one individual player.

""We don't envisage any dramatic change in their strategy or how they look to play tactically, but they'll obviously be stronger.""

Stanislav Lobotka missed the game between the sides in October

If O'Neill is complimentary of Lobotka, such sentiments have not been reciprocated this week with the 30-year-old quoted as saying Northern Ireland lacked creativity were ""annoying"".

In response to what was a not dissimilar critique of his side to the one aired by Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann earlier in the campaign, O'Neill quipped that his wife is quick to call him annoying too, but in fact feels there are similarities between his side and Slovakia in terms of style and approach. 

""We take that as a compliment and it won't upset us,"" he said of Lobotka's remark.

""I would say that they're quite similar to us in the way that it is their collective as a team. They play in a very structured way. They believe in the way they play. They have good individual players. They're good as a collective.

""It's always hard to play away, but we're looking forward to the game and we believe we can do it.""

Argentina and Mexico square off in Round of 32 action of the FIFA U-17 World Cup. Here's everything you need to know ahead of kickoff, including how to watch.

Argentina enter the knockout stage in dominant form after sweeping their group with three straight wins, outscoring opponents 11-2. They closed the group with a 7-0 rout of Fiji, following hard-fought victories over Tunisia and Belgium. Mexico, meanwhile, struggled to find consistency, defeating Ivory Coast 1-0 but falling to both South Korea and Switzerland. Mexico will need to rediscover their sharpness in front of goal to challenge a confident Argentina side that's hitting top form at just the right time.

The alleged deal to use the Kennedy Center complex comes as ticket sales are reportedly declining after Trump's takeover

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

FIFA will reportedly use large parts of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., displacing previously scheduled performers, even as the showpiece arts complex is reportedly struggling with sharply declining ticket sales following President Donald Trump's takeover of the institution earlier this year.

The soccer governing body will occupy multiple facilities for nearly three weeks that normally rent for tens of thousands of dollars per day in the lead-up to the December 5 World Cup draw there, The Washington Post reports, citing an August venue use agreement and Kennedy Center employees. 

The operation has reportedly forced big-name performers to relocate to other venues, including the National Symphony Orchestra. 

The Independent has contacted FIFA and the Kennedy Center for comment. 

In the eight months since Trump cleaned house at the Kennedy Center and installed himself as chair of its board ticket sales have reportedly plummeted nearly 50 percent.

Using the venue for the World Cup draw caps off months of FIFA president Gianni Infantino building goodwill with President Trump. 

In July, the president was on hand at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium to present a trophy to Chelsea, the winners of the FIFA Club World Cup. 

The following month, Infantino visited Trump in the White House, where the president was seen holding the golden World Cup winner's trophy, which the FIFA boss said was privilege only given to “the FIFA President, presidents of countries, and then those who win.”

The FIFA boss has also joined the many dignitaries who've publicly supported Trump's long-running bid to win a Nobel Peace Prize, writing in October that Trump “definitely deserves” the award for his efforts toward a peace deal in Gaza. 

FIFA has said it will unveil the winner of its own newly created peace price on December 5, the same day as the World Cup draw. 

Earlier this month, when asked if Trump would win the FIFA prize, Infantino left the door open to the possibility.

“On the 5th of December, you will see,” he told reporters.

FIFA also opened an office in New York City's Trump Tower this year.

The U.S., Mexico, and Canada will jointly host the 2026 men's World Cup.

Report as England end Serbia's top-two chances in Group K of World Cup qualifying and maintain their perfect record in the group through Bukayo Saka and Eberechi Eze goals; Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden second-half subs after Morgan Rogers favoured at No 10

England maintained their perfect World Cup qualifying record with a 2-0 win over Serbia thanks to a fine Bukayo Saka volley and excellent Eberechi Eze finish, as Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden had mixed performances off the bench at Wembley.

The goals were standout moments of quality on a rain-soaked night in which already-qualified England struggled to hit the high levels they've reached in recent internationals. But Thomas Tuchel's side were markedly improved after he intervened midway through the first half after a lacklustre and sloppy start to the game from his team.

England had been 3-0 up by half-time in their past three internationals - including a 5-0 thrashing of Serbia in Belgrade - but were alarmingly slow out of the blocks here until an impromptu Tuchel team talk shook things up when Jordan Pickford went down calling for treatment on 23 minutes.

With Harry Kane dropping deeper to turn playmaker and Declan Rice more advanced, Saka and Marcus Rashford suddenly began to threaten. As well as Saka's volley, there were more good chances before half-time, with Kane heading wide and Rogers glancing off target after Rashford and Rice were unable to capitalise on a counter.

There were let-offs in the second half, though, with Dusan Vlahovic flicking wide and then clipping the roof of the net as Serbia - increasingly desperate - searched for an equaliser to save their World Cup hopes. This result, though, coupled with Albania also winning in Andorra, ends their chances of a top-two finish in Group K.

The statistics look good for England. They are still yet to concede in this campaign, with Pickford's England record run of international clean sheets stretching to 10 matches. But at the other end of the pitch there is intrigue into how Tuchel will utilise all his attacking options.

There were just a handful of Serbia supporters in the away section at Wembley. The Serbia FA opted not to sell tickets to their supporters after recent crowd problems had led to hefty fines from UEFA.

Bellingham and Foden - benched with Tuchel favouring Morgan Rogers at No 10 - finally entered the fray after an hour. Foden, as a false nine, nodded a headed chance wide but made his mark late on, chipping a wonderful pass for an Eze shot to be tipped onto the bar before assisting his team-mate for England's second.

Bellingham, meanwhile, playing off Foden, buzzed like a player with a point to prove. There were a couple of exciting combinations with Reece James but ultimately the Real Madrid man became frustrated. If anything, this was another night in which Rogers once again showed why he is liked by Tuchel despite competition at No 10 from high-profile team-mates. It is a battle which will run right up until the World Cup.

England boss Thomas Tuchel: 

""We wanted to have quality and impact and new energy from the bench which we got. We created chances, half-chances and scored.

""We had some moments to defend until the very end, to defend our clean sheet. A special compliment to Jordan and the back four today. In the second half the pressing was not always right and we let Serbia escape. There was some intense output we had to give to get the clean sheet and win the game.

""It was a difficult match, a complicated match, we had to adapt and be flexible. Maybe throughout the match we lacked a little bit of precision with the last pass, otherwise we could have created more and scored earlier to be a bit more calm.

""But I liked it, it stayed intense and a tight match. We could see their quality. I'm happy about this test. It was a test. The attitude was right.""

Sky Sports' Sam Blitz at Wembley:

""So what did we learn there?

""England don't play with a striker. Harry Kane played like a deep midfielder. Phil Foden came on as a false nine. Lots of people called for a Danny Welbeck to support Kane, but do England even need that out-and-out No 9?

""Tuchel can change it mid-game. England were dire in the first 25 minutes. The England boss got the group in with a tactical time-out and suddenly the team was much, much better. Rice played higher. Rashford and Saka were more involved.

""Anderson looks the part. So many clever incisive balls from England's defensive midfielder. That No 6 role is his to lose, with Adam Wharton only given five minutes to impress.

""There's a race on at centre-back. Ezri Konsa looked good, with a couple of last-ditch challenges. Who out of him, John Stones and Marc Guehi fill the two spots?

""Nico O'Reilly looks the part too. The Man City left-back did not look out of place on England debut - he lasted the 90 minutes. Is that spot his to lose too?

""And Bellingham is still not at it. Still feeling his shoulder injury? Not up to speed? Short of confidence? Rogers looked better than him here.""

England's Phil Foden to ITV:

""So happy to be back in the squad. Great players and I'm enjoying it. I thought I did well, created a few chances and unlucky not to put a couple away. Overall, I have to be happy with the impact.""

On his role as striker: ""I'll play wherever the manager puts me. I can play multiple positions and I was happy to come on as a false nine. I enjoyed it. Maybe it will get the best out of me, only time will tell.

""There are quality players all over the pitch. I know there is pressure on me to perform at Man City and I just have to keep my head down and earn my place. The smile is back.""

The draw for the 2026 World Cup will take place in Washington on December 5.

President Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures.

Announcing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was ""the biggest event in sports"", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like ""104 Super Bowls"".

The draw will take place from 12pm local time (5pm UK time).

The 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup takes place from June 11 to July 19, 2026.

It will be the 23rd edition of the tournament.

As football's global governing body, FIFA, gears up for its largest-ever World Cup in 2026, it has enlisted technology giant Lenovo as its official partner to manage the operational and digital demands of the tournament.

In a recent media briefing, executives from both organisations outlined the scope of the partnership, which aims to leverage advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance the experience for teams, broadcasters, and the estimated six billion fans who will tune in.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted across the US, Mexico, and Canada, is set to be an event of unprecedented scale, featuring a record 48 teams, 104 games, and 16 host cities. Running such a massive event requires a robust technology backbone, a role which Lenovo is well-positioned to fill, said FIFA technology director Nacho Fresco.

“We need a partner who is able to deliver fast, because in a World Cup football match, we cannot wait for just one minute,” Fresco said, adding that Lenovo's innovative and entrepreneurial spirit, as well as high-quality standards, helped to seal the deal.

For Lenovo, its work with FIFA will allow it to showcase its full breadth of capabilities beyond its reputation as a major PC maker. Besides supplying laptops, tablets, and Motorola smartphones used by officials to run the games, the company will also provide servers, storage, and edge infrastructure to power systems like the Hawk-Eye video assistant referee used by FIFA referees to make pitch decisions.

Jeff Shafer, Lenovo's senior vice-president of corporate marketing, said the World Cup is also an opportunity for the company to transform itself into an AI powerhouse. “The reality is that if we can do it for FIFA, F1 and the Olympics, then we know we can do it for anybody out there, from consumers to the biggest companies in the world.”

Art Hu, Lenovo's chief information officer, concurred, noting that the partnership is in line with its transition to a services-led, AI-first company in a hybrid world, focusing on developing custom capabilities for use cases where out-of-the-box solutions do not exist.

For example, Hu said tablets will be deployed to not only help VIP guests such as government leaders get seated, but also provide them with access to content, such as game snippets and match statistics, delivering a high-touch experience for a targeted set of users.

While AI-powered services and applications for players, coaches, broadcasters and fans are being saved for a major reveal at the CES technology show in Las Vegas in January 2026, Shafer said “if we can use AI to deliver something of value to each one of those groups, we'd have achieved our goal.”

Santiago Manso, Lenovo's director for sports vertical, added that the robustness of the systems and infrastructure used to support World Cup games can be replicated in other fields, such as nuclear power, smart energy grids, and military defence – all of which require high resiliency.

In the run-up to World Cup 2026, Lenovo had the opportunity to apply its capabilities during the FIFA Club World Cup this past summer, where it helped implement semi-automated offside technology, leading to faster and more accurate offside calls that reduced game delays. “That benefits the players, broadcasters and fans, and it makes the game better,” Shafer said.

When asked by Computer Weekly about what's being done to secure the high-profile tournament – a prime target for disruption – against cyber threats, Manso said Lenovo is incorporating security into all its devices and services from the design stage, he said, adding that the company is also working with FIFA and governments in host countries to incorporate multiple layers of security.

Ultimately, both organisations see the partnership as a legacy-defining project. “We are going to have the most technologically advanced FIFA World Cup,” Fresco said, adding that the work done for the men's World Cup will extend to future tournaments, including the Women's World Cup in 2027.

France have joined England in booking their place at the 2026 FIFA World Cup finals. Get the lowdown on all the sides from the continent who will be in action next summer. 

There are a total of 16 UEFA berths available at the 48-team 2026 FIFA World Cup, with the 12 qualifying group winners assured of a final tournament place along with the four eventual play-off winners.

After topping Groups K and D respectively, England and France have become the first two European teams to confirm their place at the finals, which run from 11 June to 19 July 2026 across Canada, Mexico and the United States.

UEFA.com keeps track of the qualifiers as they are confirmed and runs the rule over the European contenders.

How does qualification work?

In total, 16 UEFA nations will qualify for the 2026 World Cup. The 12 group winners qualify directly for the World Cup; the four remaining berths are determined by play-offs involving the 12 group runners-up, along with the four best-ranked group winners of the 2024/25 UEFA Nations League that did not finish their European Qualifiers group stage in first or second place.

ENGLAND

How they qualified: Group K winnersBest World Cup performance: Winners (1966)Most recent appearance: 2022 (quarter-finals)

The UEFA EURO 2024 runners-up began a new era when Thomas Tuchel replaced Gareth Southgate after that showpiece defeat by Spain in Berlin and the German coach has certainly made his mark. England secured qualification with a perfect 18 points from their opening six games, scoring 18 goals and conceding none. The talismanic Harry Kane continues to lead the line but the supporting cast has grown ever deeper, with the likes of Anthony Gordon and Elliot Anderson particularly impressive.

FRANCE

How they qualified: Group D winnersBest World Cup performance: Winners (1998, 2018)Most recent appearance: 2022 (runners-up)

Les Bleus will be aiming to reach a third World Cup final in a row after topping Group D to secure an eighth consecutive qualification. With an outrageously talented squad led by star striker Kylian Mbappé, Didier Deschamps' side will no doubt be considered one of the favourites to go all the way again in North America.

Play-offs via the Nations League

The 12 group runners-up will participate in the play-offs, along with the four best-ranked group winners of the 2024/25 UEFA Nations League that did not finish their European Qualifiers group stage in first or second place.

Nations League path A group winners: Spain, Germany, Portugal, France

Path B group winners: England, Norway, Wales, Czechia

Path C group winners: Romania, Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland

Path D group winners: Moldova, San Marino

MLS announced a landmark decision by switching to a fall-spring calendar, and the benefits are obvious, but there are some valid challenges the league needs to navigate through

Focus really hard, and you could almost see the relief in Don Garber as he announced the news. MLS has done the one thing it really should have done for years, and he knew it. There has been talk, stretching back to last January, that an official switch to a fall-spring calendar in North America's professional soccer setup was imminent. For a while, there were just whispers and suggestions. It was reportedly brought up at countless board meetings. It received cautious public backing from coaches. 

And, more broadly, anyone who consumed the league, followed its transfers, or even turned on Apple from time to time knew it was probably the sensible idea.

After some previous challenges, MLS, at long last, has a fall-spring calendar. The league has confirmed it. The basics are as expected. Starting in 2027, games will run from late July to early May. There will be a break in the winter. Transfer windows will align with the rest of the world. There will be no more playing through international breaks. On the face of it, this seems like the day when a still-growing, but at times conservative, league finally decided to take a bold swing. 

At the same time, there are clear caveats. Existing player contracts will need to be reworked, and the league will now find itself competing more directly with other major U.S. sports during the heart of its season. There's also value in tradition - even if MLS's calendar has always been unconventional. So while this move feels logical and long overdue, it won't be without complications.

MLS 3.0 may be underway, but its success is far from guaranteed.

MLS has been inching toward this for years, and there was a growing sense that the shift was inevitable. This is a league in a constant state of evolution, and the move brings it into the modern era in a more convincing way. In truth, MLS delayed the change longer than it wanted to, Commissioner Don Garber admitted at a news conference.

""We would rather take our time and get it right than be fast and get it wrong,"" Garber said. 

The general idea here is to capitalize on the momentum brought about by the 2026 World Cup. The tournament is considered - and rightly so - a landmark event in the scope of the game in North America. Now is the perfect opportunity, if not excuse, for MLS to make significant changes in earnest. And what better way to convince people that MLS is legitimate than to do so around a World Cup? If this is the expression of the American game in club form, it should surely be linked to the biggest global event that soccer offers. 

There have been extensive discussions, though, to make sure that the change is made in the right way. The league surveyed fans and other relevant parties, it said in a release, about their relative interest in a Fall-Spring calendar. Ninety-two percent of respondents supported a change to align with the European game. Discussions first started in earnest in October 2023. Just over two years later, rumor has become reality. 

On the face of it, primarily, removing all of the noise, this is advantageous for MLS. Some would meet it with a shrug and a ""duh."" MLS, by working on a different schedule, is out of touch with the European world that it is so often compared to. On the face of things, this is a move toward legitimacy. Want to take us seriously? Well, here's a calendar to show you that we're for real. 

But the most obvious benefit is the way the league functions in the global soccer sphere. For so long, transfer windows have been so awkward to figure out. MLS's primary window runs from January to April. Its secondary one stretches from July to August. That has proven to be a roadblock on two fronts. Primarily, it has made player acquisition harder, with the league forced to go after those who have either already begun their seasons at their club or are looking for a move halfway through. It's a pain in terms of recruitment. Even more difficult, though, is the midseason window where MLS teams can so often lose their best players. That July to August window has been a deadly thing for some sides, who have to kiss top talents goodbye when a good offer comes in. 

""It allows us to be aligned with the international transfer windows, which we think is incredibly important. It gives us a wide variety of opportunities that will expand our ability to be on this path, to be one of the top and leading leagues in the world,"" Garber said.

The shift won't entirely change the fact that MLS teams will lose good footballers here and there. But they can also use those windows to sign new ones, or plan ahead properly. What can happen here, then, is the fleshing out of a proper global transfer infrastructure, where players come and go - and spending can be maximized (albeit with the caveat of complicated salary cap rules). There could be more transfers like LAFC's blockbuster move for Son Heung-Min as a result. 

There is further good news to be found in the fact that the calendar now aligns with FIFA international windows. There are a number of instances during the season where clubs lose significant chunks of their roster due to national team commitments - and still have to worry about regular season games with significant implications. That is no longer a problem.  

Yet there are surely some losers. The main group, immediately, might just be the players. A switch to a fall-spring calendar would undoubtedly complicate contract negotiations. Under current MLS rules, deals expire in December. There will, surely, be some contracts to renegotiate. Garber was asked, in fact, how much of a say the players had in the decision, and his response was vague.

""I'm sure there will be a time soon that we'll be able to, collectively with the MLSPA, have a discussion, and we can talk about all those details,"" Garber said. 

There are also some questions to be asked about timing. To be sure, a break from mid-December to early February - similar to the setup currently offered by the Bundesliga - will save some fans in cold climates. But Minnesota, Chicago, and New England in early December, or even November, might not be all that pleasant. 

There are broader questions to be asked, too, about fan attendance in general. The league very proudly announced that it welcomed over 14 million fans in the regular season alone into stadiums on matchdays. Will the march to the stadium remain the same in the dark and the cold, rather than an agreeable summer evening? These are things that simply cannot be prepared for. 

And then there are the minutea: sponsorships, season tickets, day-to-day operations for teams. Those remain unknown. 

""The bottom line is this change has been approved because we think it will, overall, raise the awareness, therefore the engagement with our teams, and therefore make them more valuable to the corporate community and to their fans,"" Garber said.

But perhaps the biggest question, writ large, is how this all fits in to the rest of the North American sports calendar. Currently, the MLS season runs from February to early December. The playoffs and MLS Cup clash directly with the middle of the NFL season, the World Series, crucial college football games, and the start of the NBA season. This is not the best time of year to get eyes on your hallmark event.

A shift to a May MLS Cup, then, would seem to alleviate some of those fears. NFL and college football will be over. The start of the MLB season is hardly gripping stuff. And falling right before the NBA finals seems a good deal. MLS is happy where they will fit in the calendar under a new system, Nelson Rodriguez, EVP of MLS said Thursday.

""We think this sets us up to showcase ourselves in a much better form. The competition will always be there, whether it's gridiron, hoops, or sticks and balls,"" Rodriguez said.

Still, there are questions to be asked. The middle of the season will then clash directly with the biggest games in the NFL and College Football Playoff (which is now approximately 36 teams large). And whatever eyes MLS might have been able to capitalize on during the club soccer offseason are now fixated elsewhere. The theory that MLS is an alternative to boredom when Europe's top leagues aren't active will now fall apart. 

There will also be the question of how the 2027 season fits into the new calendar. The 2026 campaign is still set to conclude in December, and MLS can't simply pause for seven months. The league's current solution is a 14-game “sprint season” running from February through May 2027, before the new full season begins in mid- to late July.

Another challenge is the six-week gap between seasons. That break will require significant adjustment from clubs, but it also provides flexibility as MLS navigates the transition. The league acknowledged Thursday that the gap could be filled with additional fixtures - potentially Leagues Cup or U.S. Open Cup games.

“We will consider anything, and we will look at whether it's Leagues Cup, some other competition, or some centralized training for all our teams, as we've done in the past during preseason,” Rodriguez said.

While the league pushed through a major structural change, several other ideas remain on the back burner. Reports that MLS owners were weighing a move to a single-division format did not materialize yet, and long-standing concerns around roster rules and the salary cap - an area Lionel Messi recently pointed to as needing growth - as well as playoff design, were left untouched. Garber indicated that more adjustments are coming, but for now this remains the lone change, albeit a historic one.

More broadly, the shift marks a meaningful course correction. MLS has long operated on its own rhythm, a model that has delivered growth, star power and record fan engagement. But aligning more closely with the global game was inevitable. Even with the complications ahead, the league's decision feels both pragmatic and overdue.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Karim Benzema has fiercely defended actress Lyna Khoudri, his partner, against a far-right activist who criticised her participation in a tribute to the victims of the November 13, 2015 terrorist attack. The Al-Ittihad striker fired back on social media, dismissing the activist as ""just an extra in our world"" for mistaking the solemn ceremony for a staged performance.

Benzema has publicly confronted a far-right activist who launched an attack on his partner, actress Khoudri, following her involvement in a solemn tribute to the victims of the attacks in France. Khoudri participated in a commemoration on TF1, reading Charlotte Delbo's poem ""Prayer to the Living to Forgive Them for Being Alive,"" marking the 10th anniversary of the tragic events outside the Stade de France.

Activist Damien Rieu criticised Khoudri due to her previous alleged actions and her connection to Benzema. Rieu posted on social media: ""To honour the victims of November 13, they could find no one other than Lyna Khoudri, partner of @Benzema, who liked a post justifying the beheading of Samuel Paty (and who lost her lawsuit against me when I denounced it).""

Benzema swiftly responded to Rieu on his own account, defending Khoudri and condemning the activist's remarks. ""There are those who pay their respects, and those who put themselves on display... You have to be incredibly shallow to mistake a tribute for a staged performance, Damien. You're just an extra in our world,"" the former French international declared. This strong rebuke highlights Benzema's readiness to protect his partner and address what he perceives as a cynical attempt to politicise a moment of remembrance.

The tribute marked a poignant anniversary for France, recalling the coordinated terrorist attacks that occurred on November 13, 2015. These attacks, which included bombings outside the Stade de France during a France-Germany football match, claimed 130 lives and injured hundreds more. The stadium, where the French national team faced Ukraine on the day of the anniversary, holds particular significance as one of the attack sites.

Khoudri's participation in the tribute involved reading a powerful poem, a common form of remembrance and a way to honour those lost. Benzema's reaction underscores his belief that such a solemn occasion should be respected and not used as a platform for personal or political attacks. His statement implies a clear distinction between genuine acts of remembrance and what he views as superficial displays of criticism.

While engaging in this off-field defence, Benzema is also navigating a challenging period in his professional career with Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League. The reigning champions have experienced a difficult start to the season, currently sitting in eighth place after 11 matches, having already suffered three defeats.

Benzema, 37, who joined Al-Ittihad on a contract until June 30, 2026, has been a central figure for the club, serving as team captain. However, his performances have recently come under scrutiny. Following Al-Ittihad's 1-0 defeat to Al-Ahli in the Western Derby, former Al-Ittihad defender Rashed Al-Raheeb publicly criticised the foreign players, specifically targeting Benzema.

In an interview with Al-Riyadiya, Al-Raheeb stated: ""The Frenchman Karim Benzema, the team captain, was absent from the match and did nothing, as was his compatriot Moussa Diaby, who was not at his usual level. Meanwhile, Al-Ahli's foreign players shone and dominated for the full 90 minutes."" He also questioned coach Sergio Conceicao's decision to keep Benzema on the pitch despite his ""modest level."" This criticism highlights the pressure on Benzema to deliver consistent performances for his new club.

Al-Ittihad's current form shows a mixed bag, with a recent 3-0 win against Sharjah followed by a 4-4 draw with Khaleej, and the 1-0 loss to Al-Ahli. Benzema's personal statistics show a career with 345 goals and 84 assists in 635 club appearances, including a highly decorated tenure at Real Madrid where he won numerous titles, including five Champions League crowns and four La Liga titles.

Benzema and Al-Ittihad face a demanding schedule, with an upcoming match against Al-Riyadh on November 21, followed by a Champions League fixture against Al Duhail on November 24. These matches will be crucial for Al-Ittihad to improve their league position and progress in continental competition.

The latest incident, while unrelated to his on-field performance, further highlights the level of attention and expectation placed upon the veteran striker, both in his professional and personal life, particularly within the context of French public debate and the Saudi Pro League's global ambitions.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Can Graham Potter revive Alexander Isak, Viktor Gyokeres and Sweden's £235m forward line in time to earn World Cup 2026 qualification?","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/graham-potter-revive-alexander-isak-viktor-gyokeres-sweden-235m-forward-line-earn-world-cup-2026-qualification/blt8205bf023909efda","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

This time last year, Sweden seemed to be on the rise again. A side that had failed to qualify for both the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024 was flying under Jon Dahl Tomasson, with Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres scoring freely in a refreshingly attack-minded line-up. However, the country's first-ever foreign manager has since become the first coach in Sweden's history to be relieved of his duties before the expiration of his contract.

The nation's football federation (SvFF) felt they had no option but to act, though, as the atmosphere around - and allegedly within - Dahl Tomasson's team had turned toxic, resulting in the ""Danish bast*rd"" being dismissed before the 2026 World Cup qualification campaign had even concluded.

Intriguingly, Sweden have now turned to another foreign coach to resurrect their hopes of securing a spot at next summer's tournament in North America, with Englishman Graham Potter taking over less than a month after being fired by West Ham.

So, where did it all go wrong for Dahl Tomasson? And is Potter really the right man to get the best out of a side blessed with a forward line worth £235 million ($310m) that is presently struggling to score goals and suffering from a collective crisis of confidence?

It felt like the Swedish national team had hit rock bottom after missing out on Euro 2024. Not since 1996 had they failed to reach the finals - but, on this occasion, they hadn't even gone close. Sweden won just three of their qualifying games and finished nine points adrift of second-placed Austria, and 10 behind group winners Belgium.

Given Sweden had also been eliminated in the play-offs for Qatar 2022 by Poland, the SvFF unsurprisingly felt it was time to bring an end to Janne Andersson's seven-year spell as coach. They also brought in Kim Kallstrom as their new director of football and the retired midfielder, who made 131 appearances for Sweden (and four for Arsenal!), was immediately charged with finding a worthy successor to Andersson.

""That is the No.1 priority,"" Kallstrom said on December 6, 2023. ""But I think we need to take our time. We need to analyse a little bit where we are, why we are there, where we want to go, how we can get there, and who the people are who are going to implement all that.""

Kallstrom ultimately decided that the man to turn the national team around was Dahl Tomasson, the ex-Denmark forward who had just parted company with Blackburn Rovers by 'mutual consent' after a run of eight Championship games without a win.

Tomasson lost three of his first four games in charge - including a 2-1 defeat in his native Denmark - but they were all friendlies. When the competitive action began in September 2024, Sweden suddenly caught fire - and Tomasson's daring decision to move away from the national team's tried-and-trusted 4-4-2 appeared to be the main reason why.

There were plenty of pundits who argued that Isak and Gyokeres couldn't play together; that they were too similar. However, the pair contributed a combined 12 goals in the four Nations League games they played alongside one another at the apex of Tomasson's bold 3-4-1-2 formation.

""Some observers have called it a revolution but, first and foremost, I see my goal as a reversal of bad results by building a new style and a new team,"" the former Malmo coach told Bold.dk. Tomasson acknowledged, though, that not everyone was convinced by his adventurous approach, primarily due to the standard of Sweden's opponents in their Nations League C group (Slovakia, Estonia and Azerbaijan).

""I find that there are still people who are sceptical about whether we can play so offensively against better nations,"" he said, ""but while we play offensively, we do not do so naively.""

However, when Tomasson's tactics were truly tested for the first time in World Cup qualifying, the results were dire. 

Even though Isak wasn't match fit for Sweden's opening qualifier against Slovenia on September 5 due to his professionally successful but physically detrimental summer strike, the Scandinavians should have kicked off their campaign with a win in Ljubljana. However, despite twice taking the lead - first through Anthony Elanga and then Yasin Ayari - they threw away two points in the final minute of normal time because of a goalkeeping error from Robin Olsen. 

Even worse was to follow three days later, with the Swedes slumping to a disastrous 2-0 defeat in Kosovo. By that stage, faith in the manager was already wavering. There were still four matchdays remaining, but the feeling in the media was that their hopes of automatic qualification were already over after losing to a team ranked 95th in the world at the time.

Former winger Freddie Ljungberg called the performance against Kosovo ""appalling"", Expressen labelled it ""a betrayal"", while Goteborgs-Posten argued, ""The uphill struggle is so steep now that it's impossible to see how a Swedish national team under Jon Dahl Tomasson will be able to regain the confidence they have failed to instil over the past year and a half.""

Unfortunately for the under-fire coach, the increasingly sceptical Swedish press would be proven correct.

To have any real chance of pipping Switzerland to top spot in UEFA Group B, Sweden simply had to beat Murat Yakin's men in Solna on October 10. However, despite being able to once again pair a fully-fit Isak with Gyokeres from the first minute while Elanga made do with a place on the bench, the hosts failed to register a single shot on target in an embarrassingly meek 2-0 loss.

Unsurprisingly, Tomasson's toothless team were booed from the field, as the infamous 'JDT Out, Danish bast*rd' banner was unfurled in the stands. ""That was terrible,"" defender Emil Holm told Aftonbaldet. ""There should be no such thing. I understand that people are disappointed, but I find writing things like that to be the lowest of the low.""

As for Tomasson, he reacted with admirable diplomacy to his nationality being brought into the argument in such classless fashion, while at the same time trying desperately to talk up Sweden's hopes of keeping their World Cup dream alive.

""I understand the fans, they want results and wins,"" he told reporters. ""Football is emotion. The fans are worried - we have to deal with that, because that result was a slap in the face. But we haven't been eliminated yet. I believe that we can make it to the World Cup with this team.""

However, the following Monday, Sweden would be once again beaten by Kosovo, this time losing 1-0 in Gothenburg, meaning even a second-place finish was now beyond them. Sweden were clearly ""completely broken"", as retired defender Jonas Olsson put it on Viaplay, and the FA promptly turned to Potter to fix the national team.

Potter's appointment as Dahl Tomasson's successor surprised a lot of Premier League followers, given he'd been fired from his two previous jobs, with Chelsea and West Ham. ""He has won the lottery with the Sweden job,"" former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke told Snabbare.

""After the way it ended for him at West Ham, to have probably the two biggest names in British football in terms of the summer transfer window in Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres, that doesn't happen very often. It all happened so quickly too, but I think Potter was just in the right place at the right time and sometimes that's all that is required. I won't say it was just luck but you talk sometimes about getting the break you need. Well, he's got it, and it all depends on what he's going to do with it now.""

It's certainly an excellent opportunity for Potter to go some way towards restoring a once-stellar reputation - and his ties to Sweden should certainly help. The 50-year-old is obviously best known for the aesthetically pleasing team he built at Brighton. However, it was in Sweden that he forged his reputation as one of England's most promising young coaches, with the former York City left-back taking Ostersunds from the fourth tier to the top-flight during a remarkable seven-year stint as manager that also featured a Swedish Cup triumph and a famous Europa League win over Arsene Wenger's Arsenal at the Emirates. 

Consequently, the appointment of such a high-profile coach was considered quite the coup in Sweden - particularly as Potter had made it very clear beforehand that he was willing to accept a relatively small salary because he was so excited by the challenge.

""That's normally the issue when the Swedish FA are due to appoint a manager,"" ex-West Brom centre-back Olsson told Sky Sports, ""as the wage isn't the highest, so they can't really go for the biggest names. But Potter's link with Swedish football is big because of what he did at Ostersunds, and also because of his coaching staff - his assistant Bjorn Hamberg has been with him at Brighton and Chelsea.

""Swedish supporters kind of see him as one of their own, so it was an easy appointment to sell and, in terms of getting the balance right, his leadership qualities show he can create a sense of harmony in a good group of players.""

Chelsea and West Ham supporters (and maybe even some players) would obviously take issue with Olsson's positive appraisal of Potter's leadership qualities - he was allegedly dismissed as a 'yes man' by some squad members at Stamford Bridge and derogatorily referred to as 'Harry' or 'Hogwarts'. However, simply speaking the local language in his first press conference as Sweden boss enabled Potter to make a far more positive first impression than Tomasson, who only ever engaged with the press in English.

""It's a big honour for me to be here. I'm very proud,"" he said. ""I understand Swedish football well, and I just think, as the national team head coach, it's important to at least try [to speak the language]. I wouldn't say I'm already back up to speed, to be honest - obviously it's been a long time since I spoke Swedish, and I wasn't particularly fluent when I left. So, it's been a bit of a mix of upskilling myself, while at the same time watching games and watching players, and making sure that we get a team and a group now that we can go forward with.""

It's hardly an ideal situation, of course. Potter is taking over a team low on confidence in the middle of a qualification campaign. Still, the mere fact that Tomasson has been dismissed should lift the spirits of players like Elanga, who reportedly had issues with the Dane's ""damned system"". Captain Victor Lindelof was also put in an awkward position by Tomasson's public falling-out with goalkeeper Olsen, who vowed never to play for the coach again after being dropped for last month's game against the Swiss.

Funnily enough, Sweden already being out of the running for automatic qualification is also a plus for Potter. The only way they can now make it to the World Cup is through the play-offs - which the Scandinavians are almost certain to make due to them topping their Nations League group. As a result, Potter's first two games, against Switzerland and Slovenia, are effectively free hits, opportunities for him to prepare for the knockout games in March that will decide whether Sweden go to the World Cup, and whether the manager's short-term contract is extended.

The problem, though, is that Gyokeres is presently unavailable through injury, while Isak hasn't played a minute of competitive football for Liverpool since October 22, meaning there will unquestionably be a limit on how much game time the British-record signing can be afforded. In that context, it may well be difficult for Potter to get Sweden firing again - at least initially. As Tomasson lamented before his dismissal, ""We have forgotten how to score goals and I don't know why.""

Potter basically has two games and five months to come up with an answer. If he doesn't, the Swedish FA will be left counting the considerable cost of failing to qualify for a second successive World Cup - despite being in possession of two of the most valuable strikers in the game today.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Cavan Sullivan's form, Mathis Albert's rise and the five key takeaways for the U.S. U17s ahead of World Cup knockouts","https://www.goal.com/en-qa/lists/cavan-sullivan-s-form-mathis-albert-s-rise-and-the-five-key-takeaways-for-the-u-s-u17s-ahead-of-world-cup-knockouts/blt3da32b3d9bfd2886","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 02:49:09 GMT","

From Cavan Sullivan exceeding expectations to a quietly solid back line, GOAL breaks down five key takeaways on the U.S. U17s ahead of their World Cup clash with Morocco.

The U17 World Cup feels important for the U.S. This is a breeding ground of talent, yes, but also a true barometer of where the country's talent pool stands. And, in theory, the U.S. has a pretty good one. Cavan Sullivan is the headliner, of course, but in Mathis Albert, Chase Adams, and Julian Hall, there are enough good footballers here to suggest that they could make a run. 

The group stage only reinforced that notion. Gonzalo Segares' side hasn't exactly blown anyone away, but they have been remarkably composed. The Americans have conceded just once, and looked mightily resolute at the back. Going forward, they have been carried by individuals, but also created chances in spades. Sullivan is finding form, while Albert has enjoyed some promising moments of his own.

Piece it all together, and this is a side well-equipped to continue to win. It isn't a kind matchup on Friday. Morocco are a good team, who are certainly better than their 1-2 record in the group stage that saw them squeak into the round of 32. GOAL looks at the major takeaways from the tournament so far, and evaluates the Americans ahead of their round of 32 matchup...

This felt like a big tournament for Sullivan. The hype around the Philadelphia Union product was immense just a year ago. But since then, his star has faded a little. His MLS minutes were few, and his only start came in the U.S. Open Cup. This future Man City player was largely playing in MLS Next Pro. 

The U17 World Cup, then, felt significant. Sullivan needed to perform here, if only to show that he still has that bit of quality to show that he can still make a difference for club and country. And he has shown up in style. Sullivan came off the bench in the U.S.'s opening game against Burkina Faso, complete with a new haircut and a brash attitude about him. His impact was almost immediate. The U.S. were struggling, and the Union product offered the piece of magic necessary to pick up a result. Sullivan responded with a Panenka penalty to give them a 1-0 win. 

He was even better in the second game, making an impact from the start. He began the game in a deeper role, but was an active presence throughout, scoring one and assisting another as the U.S. beat Tajikistan, 2-1. He had two good efforts at goal against Czechia, in the game after, and was unfortunate not to find the net as the U.S. managed a 1-0 win. Early days, but the signs are good.

If Sullivan is the known quantity of the U.S., then Albert is the wildcard. Sure, he has already made some noise at Dortmund, but he remains a raw playmaker, the kind of kid to get excited about - but not place expectations on. Some who have worked with him extensively insist that he, not Sullivan, is the best player in his age group. That may or may not be true, but the reality remains: Albert should perform here. 

And his efforts to do so started pretty poorly. He watched from the bench while Sullivan bagged the winner in the first game. He was much better in the second, scoring off a Sullivan assist. And then, he made the difference in the third, bursting into the box before providing a lovely curved finish around a helpless goalkeeper. It was a moment that showed how good this U.S. side can be, full of athleticism and movement - capped off with a deadly final touch.  

And how about at the other end? Sure, the U.S. has attacking quality in spades, and can match up player-for-player with pretty much anyone outside the absolute elite. Still, their defensive showings have been even better. There is the caveat that they have yet to face an attacking force, but the unit looks pretty good at the moment. The raw numbers are good: one goal conceded, 10 shots on target allowed across three games. 

But there's more to it than that. The U.S. have had the majority of the ball in two of their three games thus far, while captain Christopher Cupps, the six-foot-three center back, who featured for Chicago Fire II last year, has been excellent as a one-on-one defender. Sure, there will be tougher challenges to come, but thus far, the Americans have looked wonderful defensively. That will absolutely have to continue in the knockouts.

A word, too, for the numbers. The U17 World Cup has, historically, been a tricky stage for the Americans. Their best performance remains fourth place in 1999. They haven't made the last eight since 2017, and were bounced in the last 16 in 2023 (although they ran into an excellent Germany side). 

Still, they have made everything look remarkably easy thus far, and are the second U.S. side in history to win all three group games at the competition. The last time that happened was 1991 - before the real advent of the U.S. as a soccer power.

There is one issue, ahead of the U.S.'s Round of 32 matchup with Morocco: their opponents have beaten them at pretty much every level in recent years. It started in 2024, when the Atlas Lions emphatically bounced the U.S., 4-0, in the Paris Olympics quarter final. Last month, they beat the U20s, 3-1, at the same stage of the World Cup. More broadly, the U.S. has struggled against African teams historically, with a 5-8-1 record against sides from the African football federation. 

Yet this iteration of Morocco is a little different. They have admittedly struggled at the U17 World Cup, squeaking through their group with just three points after losing to Portugal and Japan, before battering New Caledonia. Their eight goals conceded certainly offer hope for the Americans against a bit of a bogey opponent for the Americans.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Said El Mala: Why Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann has called up teenage Koln sensation wanted by both Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/said-el-mala-germany-call-up-teenage-koln-sensation-wanted-bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund/blt269b916f30b65b1a","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Florian Wirtz's £100 million ($130m) move from Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool didn't just upset Bayern Munich. It also hit hard at Koln. After all, Wirtz had come through their academy only to leave for Leverkusen in the summer of 2020 - and for a paltry €300,000 (£265,000/$350,000). Koln were furious. They felt Leverkusen had broken a 'gentleman's agreement' by signing one of the most exciting young players they'd ever produced - but there was nothing they could do about it. Wirtz's contract was expiring and he wanted to leave.

However, while Koln may have missed out on a massive transfer fee with Wirtz, it looks like they're going to make a colossal profit on the €350,000 (£310,000/$405,000) they invested in another potential superstar. Indeed, Said El Mala has just received his first Germany call-up after taking the Bundesliga by storm this season, and has already attracted the attention of both Bayern and Borussia Dortmund, as well as a string of top clubs across the continent.

So, who is Koln's new teenage sensation? And how long might it be before one of Europe's elite pays big money to sign him? GOAL breaks it all down below...

El Mala was born and raised in Krefeld in western Germany. Both he and his brother Malek - who is one year older than Said and also on Koln's books - got their love of the game from their Lebanese father Mohammed, who played as a centre-back for local side Linner SV. El Mala briefly followed in his father's footsteps before joining Malek at Borussia Monchengladbach in 2017. However, he was released three years later.

""Said was still very small back then, making him extremely inferior athletically to his opponents and not competitive at that level,"" El Mala's former coach at the Gladbach Under-15s, Sven Schuchardt, told Bild. ""Some boys simply need a little more time to develop.""

El Mala was nonetheless devastated by the rejection. ""It wasn't easy to process,"" he later admitted in an interview with Radio Koln. ""Everything turning around, just like that. As a 14-year-old, you ask yourself: What did I do wrong?""

He even considered quitting the game and was only convinced to continue by Malek. The two brothers would ultimately reunite at TSV Meerbusch and then again at Viktoria Koln, where they excelled in the same Under-19s team. 

El Mala's impressive performances at youth level led to him making his senior debut in a third-tier clash with FC Saarbrucken on February 21, 2004 - just two days after signing his first professional contract with Viktoria. However, just four months later, he was snapped up by Viktoria's city rivals Koln. Crucially, Koln were unable to register new players at the time, so in order to get a deal done for the in-demand youngster as quickly as possible, they agreed to immediately loan El Mala back to Viktoria for the 2024-25 campaign.

It proved a pivotal moment in his development, as the winger benefited enormously from regular game time at a lower level. He scored 13 times in 32 appearances across his first full season in the professional ranks, resulting in him being awarded the 3. Liga's Newcomer of the Season award, and then shone for Germany's U19s during their summer run to the semi-finals of the European Championship, with four goals and three assists.

Consequently, El Mala belatedly arrived at Koln brimming with belief. 

Despite El Mala marking himself out as one of Germany's most promising prospects over the previous year, Koln coach Lukas Kwasniok was reluctant to place too much pressure upon the teenager's shoulders and decided to carefully manage his game time. Consequently, El Mala has been employed primarily as an impact sub in 2025-26 - but to devastating effect. The attacker has already racked up four goals and two assists in this season's Bundesliga, even though he's only started three times. 

Julian Nagelsmann also felt that he'd seen enough of El Mala to warrant inclusion in his squad for this week's crucial World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia.

""Said should get the chance to show his carefree and easy-going style of play,"" the Germany boss told reporters. ""We keep an eye on our U21 players and always want to give them the chance to feature for the senior national team.""

As for El Mala, he was taken aback by his rapid promotion to Germany's senior squad and revealed that he had initially ignored Nagelsmann's call.

""I was at home when it arrived but I don't like answering unknown numbers,"" the teenager revealed to Sky Germany. ""Then, he sent me a message saying, 'Hi, this is Julian Nagelsmann, please call me back!' I immediately showed the message to my brother and that's when I realised, 'I guess I'm in!' But you can't take it all in during one week. It takes a bit longer. But I'm incredibly excited for the game [against Luxembourg on Friday], and I can enjoy whatever comes after that.""

In Germany, El Mala is considered something of a throwback, the kind of old-school street-footballer that one rarely sees anymore.

He's a refreshingly direct dribbler. His first thought always seems to be to take on his man - which makes sense, as he's blessed with wonderful close control and a blistering turn of pace, meaning he's a nightmare for full-backs in one-v-one situations.

He's also got one hell of a strike on him. Time and time again this season, we've seen him come off the left flank and cut in onto his favoured right foot before unleashing fearsome shots on goal.

Luckily for El Mala, size is no longer an issue. During this time at Meerbusch, he had a massive growth spurt and now stands at 6'2"". However, while he's no longer lacking physical strength, El Mala does still need to work on the defensive side of his game. Kwasniok even hauled him off at half-time in Koln's 3-1 loss at Gladbach just before the international break because he wasn't happy with his work off the ball.

""He simply didn't perform quite as well in certain challenges as we would have liked,"" the Pole explained. ""I evaluate his performance like I do with all the other players, and it wasn't quite up to par in the first 45 minutes. That's why I substituted him.""

Koln sporting director Thomas Kessler was quick to point out that such setbacks were ""perfectly normal"" for such an inexperienced player: ""He's a young guy. We emphasise that week after week, even if people don't like to hear it. But El Mala is still developing.""

As a left winger with an eye for goal who's made his breakthrough at Koln, El Mala has rather inevitably been compared with Lukas Podolski.  'Prince Poldi' has admitted that El Mala reminds him ""a little bit"" of himself and says that he's a huge fan of 'El Maladona', who has has quickly become a fan favourite at Koln as much for his ""great character"" as his fancy footwork.

""He just goes for it, and he gets things done,"" enthused Podolski, who scored 49 times for Germany and represented the likes of Bayern, Arsenal and Inter after starting out in Cologne. ""He's on the move."" And that could well be the case soon enough.

There's no guarantee that El Mala will make his international bow in the coming days, given Germany's bid to qualify for the World Cup is set to go right to the wire. Even if they win in Luxembourg on Friday, top spot in Group A will only be decided after Monday's meeting with second-placed Slovakia at the Red Bull Arena. However, El Mala has clearly got a chance of making the squad for next summer's World Cup, because Nagelsmann is certain that the Koln ace is destined to become a ""top player"".

It's a view shared by several suitors. Brighton actually tried to sign El Mala during the summer but their €20m (£18m/$23m) bid was rejected by Koln, who were convinced that his value was only going to rise this season and thus extended his contract - and that of his brother Malek - in July.

It was a brilliant bit of business on Koln's part because, according to the latest reports, Kessler & Co. now believe El Mala is worth at least three times the Brighton bid after playing such a thrilling role in the newly-promoted club making a surprisingly strong start to the season (Koln are currently ninth in the Bundesliga).

Even Kwasniok, who is trying to manage expectations around El Mala, is in no doubt that Koln's new hero will eventually leave for ""an incredibly high fee"".

""We are proud that the club signed him at the right moment,"" the manager said. ""We know that he probably won't be playing here for the next 15 years - and that's okay. But I have the feeling that he currently holds FC Koln very dear to his heart, is enjoying this time here - and we are enjoying it too."" As well they should.

Kwasniok may have been joking when he said that El Mala is adding an extra €5m to his asking price with each passing goal, but it's clear that when he does eventually leave Koln, it will be for a lot more money than they got for Wirtz!

England beat Serbia 2-0 on Thursday in their first World Cup qualifying game since securing a spot at next summer's tournament finals. The result meant very little to the Three Lions, whose players are now competing with one another for a place on the plane to North America as members of Thomas Tuchel's 26-man squad.

Bukayo Saka opened the scoring for England with a superb volley after Serbia failed to clear their lines from a free kick, and though the hosts dominated the ball throughout the entire match, their visitors did threaten to hit them on counters and breakaways to claw their way back into a must-win contest given their scramble for a play-off spot in Group K.

With seconds remaining, Eberechi Eze came up with a fine strike into the top corner to seal England's victory in their last competitive home match before the World Cup kicks off in June 2026.

GOAL breaks down the winners & losers from Wembley...

So long as Morgan Rogers is starting games as England's No.10, we have to lump these two together. That role should be theirs to lose, yet now it's up to them to win it back off the Aston Villa sensation.

When Tuchel's starting XI was leaked a few hours before kick-off on Thursday, the headline news was the absence of both Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, with Rogers continuing in a midfield three alongside Declan Rice and Elliot Anderson. The England boss had already claimed he saw the snubbed duo as attacking midfielders rather than wide options, so this sent a clear warning to them - show the country why you should be playing from minute one.

Perhaps Bellingham's prospects are looking a little brighter given when he was introduced from the bench, he was the one to go into the No.10 position, while Foden went up front in place of Harry Kane. They both played a part in Eze's clinching goal, with the Real Madrid man powering his way up the pitch and feeding the Manchester City star, who in turn shifted possession for the Arsenal favourite to expertly place in the top corner.

When asked by ITV how he thought he did as an impact sub, Foden replied: ""I thought I did well, created some chances, unlucky not to put a few away. Overall I think I have to be happy with the impact I did today."" He also admitted he would accept coming off the bench if that appeased Tuchel, but there will come a point where these two players - one who was on the Ballon d'Or podium 12 months ago, the other the PFA Players' Player of the Year shortly before that - will be demanding more. An England manager can only hold back that tide for so long.

Saka became Arsenal's highest-scoring player for the England men's team last month when he netted in their rout against Wales. However, head coach Tuchel wasn't that impressed with the record.

""How many goals did he score for England? 13? One-three?"" the German said with incredulity. ""This has to be more. It's not enough. He needs to keep on going. I thought it's 30 at least! And then I would have said 'well it's not enough' because I'm never, never satisfied.""

In fairness, this was a stance that Saka himself understood. ""I 100 percent agree with him. So, yeah, let's go for more,"" the Arsenal winger told talkSPORT this week.

""I think just being on the pitch is enough. In the England shirt, you have players of immense quality who can create chances, who can score chances. So just being on the pitch for me I think is enough. It's up to me, the manager, the coaching staff, they create the perfect game plan for us to be ourselves, show our best qualities and express ourselves. So, yeah, it's up to me.""

So how did Saka respond on the pitch? By breaking the deadlock in style, obviously. There was a hint of shin about the strike, but it doesn't matter as long as it ends up in the back of the net, and you'd hardly have believed England's No.7 had mishit it by the scything flight of the ball anyway.

In truth, only three outfield positions are locked down in Tuchel's side. Kane up front is one, Rice in midfield is another, and Saka wide right is the third.

The increased scrutiny placed on Bellingham and Foden has allowed Eze to go about his own business and carry on as if his place has never been in doubt. Though not always a starter for club and country, he's always viewed as an important piece of the puzzle.

Of all of Tuchel's five substitutes, Eze was the one who appeared fresh and ready to fight for his role, with Bellingham a close second in that regard. The Arsenal attacker now has three goals for the Three Lions, only one fewer than Foden's tally in 31 fewer appearances.

Eze's tested ability to change games from the bench makes him the ideal 'finisher' for Tuchel, who is increasingly wary that there are only eleven players he can pick to start each game. As humble as ever, Eze claimed he was still in the mix with his other team-mates and is yet to secure his spot at the World Cup, telling ITV: ""There's a lot of talent in the team. You can see the players here and the types that aren't here as well. It's the type of competition you want to be up against and it is going to help the team for sure.""

Eze made the most of his chance to impress Tuchel, but the man he replaced after 65 minutes, Marcus Rashford, didn't. It was a real shame for the Manchester United outcast, who has rediscovered his best version of himself on loan at Barcelona and if anything has added another layer to his game with his new-found penchant for assists.

Rashford long had the beating of diminutive Serbia right-back Ognjen Mimovic, though often let his marker get away with cheap fouls and lacked the end product to make this a one-sided pasting.

This may have been a goalless endeavour for Rashford, but he received some words of praise from one of his harshest critics. Roy Keane, on punditry duty for ITV, claimed the Barca forward should still be considered England's first choice in that position ahead of Anthony Gordon, who has regularly featured under Tuchel and has only missed this camp through injury.

Keane said: ""If you're comparing the two of them, Rashford and Gordon at their very best, I'm going for Rashford. He can still frustrate you, of course, but he's a threat and when he's on top form he is a handful. You wouldn't want to face him.""

The saving grace for Rashford was he linked up well with Rice and debutant Nico O'Reilly down the left flank, so if Tuchel really is putting value in on-field relationships, this was not an entirely pointless evening for the winger. Speaking of O'Reilly...

England's newest international enjoyed a fine evening representing his country at this level for the first time. Serbia's best and most promising attacks came down the Three Lions' right-hand side, while the Man City academy graduate was a useful part of his team's build-up play and was involved in plenty of moves down the left.

O'Reilly was called into Tuchel's squad for the October camp following injury withdrawals, but this selection was entirely on merit. The 20-year-old has been in superb form for Pep Guardiola's Premier League title challengers, and now he has a decent shot at making the World Cup next summer.

Tuchel kept his praise short and sweet for O'Reilly: ""He is a calm and shy person. He is very intelligent on the pitch and adapted well to the things we asked of him. Well done."" The man himself wasn't fazed by what was expected of him: ""It was a dream come true tonight, an honour to put on this shirt, play at Wembley in front of my family and the fans, surrounded by world class players. It was a great night... I expected the players to be world class, the manager knows what he wants and how to play. I've adapted well and quick to the system. I'm enjoying it.""

It was probably a good thing that the only England defender who wasn't at any point chasing a shadow was the newbie who still isn't legally old enough to drink in the place where next summer's World Cup will occur, right?

Tuchel already warned Myles Lewis-Skelly last month that he will fall down the England pecking order if he didn't work his way back into Arsenal's starting lineup. Since then, he's played only three Premier League minutes and was dropped for the November camp.

O'Reilly immediately coming in and flourishing will surely only make it harder for Lewis-Skelly to win his place in the Three Lions fold back. He remains one of the country's best young talents and if anything is being penalised for playing for the Premier League leaders who have an incredible array of defenders already. That's not Tuchel's problem, though.

Talk of Lewis-Skelly leaving Arsenal is ridiculous and won't have even entered the youngster's thinking. His career will progress at his boyhood club, and if that means he misses out on a spot at the World Cup, then so be it. These are just the ebbs and flows for any athlete when in the heat of competition. His time will come, be it in 2026 or beyond.

England don't really have a John Terry or Rio Ferdinand anymore. In this new age of set-piece dominance, even a prime Harry Maguire wouldn't go amiss. There isn't a world-leading centre-back among Tuchel's options, rather an assorted platter of good-to-decent defenders.

John Stones, at last fit again after a hellish 2025, appears to be a shoo-in for the starting XI so long as he remains healthy, with the other spot going to one of Ezri Konsa or Marc Guehi. With the Crystal Palace defender suffering a foot injury on the eve of this camp, the Aston Villa star has taken the initiative.

England needed Konsa's pace to quell Serbia's threat on the counter on Thursday. That characteristic alone should make the 28-year-old feel more at ease about his World Cup prospects - Three Lions defenders just aren't as quick as they were even a couple of years ago.

Ultimately, the biggest losers from Thursday's game are Serbia, who were not only defeated on the night, but their already slim hopes of reaching the World Cup were dashed for good.

The visitors went into this round of qualifiers one point behind bitter rivals Albania, who occupied the play-off spot and were effectively guaranteed three points away at minnows Andorra. Serbia had to get at least a point from Wembley to stand any chance of qualification.

""It was a difficult match,"" said Tuchel. ""It was complicated because they knew everything about us and we knew nothing about them. Go through the list of players, they are at top clubs, they play in top leagues. They have individual quality, they came with new energy and they made it a final for them.""

Alas, despite a spirited second-half effort, they came up short, and Albania - England's hosts on Sunday - are safely through to the play-offs as they look to reach the World Cup for the first time in their history.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Later, the Aussie added that his team and fiancée Katie Boulter were key in navigating the complex emotions he was feeling.Q. When did that making peace with yourself actually click in? Was it that night? Next morning? Did you have to be on your own completely? Even when you were in that 'dark place', did you reflect back on what you actually achieved this year?

If you could, reflect on that.ALEX de MINAUR: To be honest, I'm incredibly lucky with the support system that I have, the people I've got around me, every single one in my team, even Katie. They were able to, or they tried to, talk some sense into me and get me out of a very dark place.Sometimes when you're in that dark place, you make peace. You start to care less, right? Ultimately you can focus on other elements and not the results.For the first time in a long time, I forgot about the what if's, the results, what happens if I miss this shot, what happens if I lose this match. I just committed to the way I wanted to play from the first point to the last. A couple days ago I didn't. That's what hurt so much.Today I knew that no matter what, I wanted to be proud of my decision making, my aggressive mindset, and I wanted to go out there and try to win the match.

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

Ahead of the final three races of the 2025 season, we asked our writers to answer the big questions on what could unfold – as well as making some bold predictions.

As a captivating 2025 season heads towards its close, there is still plenty to play for in the upcoming final three rounds of the campaign. Ahead of this all-important triple header – spanning Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi – our writers Lawrence Barretto, Chris Medland, David Tremayne and Alex Jacques have shared their predictions for what could unfold, ranging from who will emerge as World Champion through to the most exciting storylines to keep an eye on…

Lawrence Barretto (F1 Correspondent & Presenter): Given the form Max Verstappen is currently in – his heroic drive from pit lane to podium in Brazil was another example of just how good he is driving right now – I don't think you can discount him, even if the Red Bull racer is 49 points adrift with three rounds to go.

But there is no doubt, Lando Norris is the favourite now. He's finished ahead of McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri in the six events since his painful mechanical DNF in the Netherlands and seems to have come into form at just the right time. But it wasn't that long ago that Verstappen seemed like he was right in the hunt and, before that, Piastri looked to be in control of the title fight – so in my mind, it's far from over.

Chris Medland (Special Contributor): At this point it's getting tough to look past Lando Norris, given the momentum he has built up. It really does feel like Norris has found the consistency that has been lacking at times this year, just as Oscar Piastri has struggled a little more.

Verstappen can still win it, but Las Vegas is going to be crucial for that. He needs a victory and the McLarens struggling in the cold conditions to give him the chance of a big points swing, because I don't see Qatar being a race weekend where he's likely to take a significant chunk out of any lead, even if he is able to fight for the win there.

David Tremayne (Hall of Fame F1 Journalist):  I think the odds favour Lando now, if he can keep it clean and keep finishing on the podium whatever anyone else does. I can see Max overhauling Oscar, unless the latter can rediscover his mojo. There were signs of good race pace from him in Mexico and Brazil, but he needs to recover his Qualifying form.

Alex Jacques (F1 TV Commentator): All roads currently lead to Lando, but I think we need to take a step back. Oscar has led 15 rounds of this championship and Max Verstappen was the bookmakers' favourite after Austin. Keeping the momentum has turned out to be the defining feature of this championship, and we still have enough time for it to shift again; just look at 2007 or 1986, for example. It should finish in the current order, but we've just seen so many twists to be certain.

LB: Brazil was a painful weekend for Ferrari, with the Scuderia arriving at Interlagos in P2 of the Teams' Championship and leaving in P4 – and it was compounded because Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli and George Russell showed how heavily they can score when the car suits the track. It's going to be a tight fight between those two for P2 – with Red Bull suffering from only scoring heavily with one car – and given that I expect Ferrari to be strong at Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi, I think the Italian squad might just edge it to steal P2 for the second year on the bounce.

CM: I've got to go with Mercedes now. This was a much harder question to answer before Brazil, but Kimi Antonelli's form has been impressive, and even a tough weekend for George Russell yielded a P3 and a P4. I can't see Red Bull getting enough points across both cars to close the gap despite the potential for Verstappen to pick up some wins, and Ferrari's double-DNF looks really costly. They are 36 points behind Mercedes, and would need to match their best score of the season – achieved in the Sprint weekend in the United States – with the Silver Arrows not scoring to draw level again.

DT: I can see Red Bull getting up to second, from Mercedes and Ferrari.

AJ: I think with Vegas and Qatar coming up, twinned with Kimi Antonelli's strong form in Brazil, Mercedes start as favourites for the runner-up spot. Red Bull are effectively fighting with one car, and Ferrari are having internal battles.

LB: Yuki Tsunoda needs a strong end to his campaign to retain a presence on the grid for a sixth successive year with the Red Bull family. The Japanese racer has shown glimmers of a breakthrough, but he had a tough time in Brazil – on a weekend where Verstappen starred once more to show the gulf between them.

From a teams' perspective, Racing Bulls, Aston Martin, Haas and Kick Sauber are separated by just 20 points with each position in the championship worth several million dollars – and thus all of them need to have a strong end to what has been a very tightly-fought midfield campaign.

CM: Plenty of candidates here for different reasons, but given what's at stake I'll go with McLaren and Oscar Piastri. The Australian has had a great season but is just struggling a little at the wrong time, while certain decisions haven't gone his way either. He's shown he's more than a match for Norris for so long this year, but he has to hit back in Las Vegas to prevent his team mate from being able to control the championship fight in the final two rounds.

The reason I include McLaren is both because they didn't get their strategy quite right with Piastri in Brazil – and they can't afford to get it wrong for a driver as the title goes down to the wire – and because Verstappen will take advantage of any big errors in general.

DT: Max and Red Bull, if they are to overcome the not insignificant points deficits to Lando and Oscar.

AJ: Yuki Tsunoda could do with a standout drive as he tries to save his F1 career; Lewis Hamilton not standing on the podium once in a Formula 1 season feels impossible; and Franco Colapinto will be desperate not to finish the season without a point. All three will hope for season bests in the final three.

LB: Aside from the tense three-way fight for the Drivers' Championship, I'm intrigued to see if Lewis Hamilton can put together a smooth weekend and get that first podium in red, or if he or team mate Charles Leclerc can give the famous Italian team their first victory of what has been a challenging season.

CM: Is it boring to say the Drivers' Championship fight? Especially if Verstappen can drag himself back into a three-way battle heading to the final two rounds. Certainly in Vegas I'm excited to see if he can do that after his charge in Interlagos. Aside from that, the midfield fight has been brilliant this year. The driver in 19th in the Drivers' standings has 19 points and a top-six finish this year. It's been so competitive, and I'm looking forward to some more big drives as the final Teams' positions get sorted out.

DT: The title fight, naturally. That will take precedence over everything else: just how strong Max will be (I suspect very), whether Lando holds firm or cracks, and how much Oscar can find his old form in a car that no longer seems quite so suited to his driving style. How, if necessary, the McLaren drivers can help one another, in extremis. And how will McLaren juggle their wish to let them fight and the desire for their first Drivers' World Championship since Lewis in 2008?

But also the intra-team fight chez Mercedes, which has been hotting up of late. A strong showing from them in Vegas could also tilt the outcome of the title fight. Ditto Racing Bulls, re intra-team competition.

AJ: Both storylines for the championship are excellent – we'll either have a new champion with one of the McLaren drivers or the greatest comeback in F1 history. Beyond the obvious, I'm excited to see more giant killing from the rookies. Ollie Bearman and Isack Hadjar have performed brilliantly this year, and no one expected Gabriel Bortoleto to beat Nico Hulkenberg in a Qualifying head-to-head. They've been so much fun to watch.

LB: Kimi Antonelli has been growing in confidence since Mercedes boss Toto Wolff described his performance at Monza as “underwhelming”. He took a superb second in the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, following up his P2 in the Sprint, and I reckon he can go one better and win one of the final events of the season.

CM: We're still going to have one more shock top-three result. I'm not sure if it will be in a Qualifying session, Sprint or over a Grand Prix distance – the latter probably least likely – but so many teams have shown an ability to just nail everything at certain points, particularly on Sprint weekends, and I just think another midfield driver will pull out an eye-catching performance.

DT: I stand by my pre-season prediction: Kimi will win a race…

AJ: I'll go with a first career win for Kimi Antonelli.

“I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness,"" the Oscar winner said. 


							By 

	Lexi Carson


Associate Editor


Morgan Freeman is speaking out again on AI. 


	Freeman recently spoke with The Guardian about his thoughts on AI and how its trying to use his voice with permission. “I'm a little PO'd, you know,” he said. “I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness. I don't appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you're gonna do it without me, you're robbing me.”




	The Now You See Me: Now You Don't star claims, “my lawyers have been very, very busy,” to remove AI being used without his knowledge, and added that there's been “quite a few” cases his lawyers have found.

	And this wasn't the first time the Oscar winner has been vocal about the issue. In June 2024, he took to X to share his appreciation for fans noticing that AI-generated imitations of his voice had been created. “Thank you to my incredible fans for your vigilance and support in calling out the unauthorized use of an A.I. voice imitating me,” Freeman wrote. “Your dedication helps authenticity and integrity remain paramount. Grateful.” He also used hashtags “scam” and “IdentityProtection.” 


	AI has been a hot topic in Hollywood as of late, with SAG-AFTRA addressing the creation of a computer-generated actress, Tilly Norwood, in September.


	“To be clear, ‘Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers — without permission or compensation,” said SAG-AFTRA. “It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn't solve any ‘problem' — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.”

Fans hated ‘The Rise of Skywalker,' but still want to see the story continue. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	You could almost call it the Rise of Solo. Or maybe A New New Hope. 


	Weeks after it was revealed that the Walt Disney Company had squashed the idea of a Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker spinoff centered on Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo played by Adam Driver, the idea refuses to die amongst fans of the galaxy far far away.




	A plane with the banner “Shareholders Want The Hunt for Ben Solo,” the latter part being the hoped-for movie's title, flew over Disney's Burbank-based headquarters in the 11 a.m. hour Thursday, just hours after the company had its earnings call.

					Boba Fett's Blaster Likely to Hit $1M at Auction Boasting Rare 'Star Wars' Item		
			









	It's the latest banner-flying move (fans hired a plane with a banner reading “Save the Hunt for Ben Solo” in late October) and comes the same week as flyers showed up in Los Angeles' mid-Wilshire area on lampposts and street signs, taking the form of missing persons posters.


	“Missing” and “Have You Seen This Man?” flank a photo of Driver as Ben Solo, also known as Kylo Ren. On top of personal information, it notes that the person was last seen five years and 10 months ago, referring to the release date of The Rise of Skywalker, which occurred in December 2019.


	All this hullaballoo comes after Driver, in an October interview with the Associated Press, revealed he and acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh came up with an idea and how a script was written by Scott Z. Burns. It was even given the thumbs up by Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy.     


	“We took it to Bob Iger and Alan Bergman and they said no,” Driver said. “They didn't see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that.”

	











	Soderbergh confirmed the project and its being blown up, Alderaan style.


	The irony here, however, is that Rise of Skywalker has such a poor reputation amongst fans and audiences in general that it killed Star Wars movies for years. Next summers The Mandalorian and Grogu will be the first movie since 2019.


	On top of that, the character was killed at the end of the movie in a redemptive act. The idea of resurrecting him would go against his sacrifice and lend more incredulity to the Star Wars franchise' very loose concept of death, as it has brought back such characters as Emperor Palpatine, Death Maul, and even Boba Fett.


	Still, as any decent Star Wars fan could tell you, rebellions are built on hope. And right now there is a hope amongst a faction that their actions can change Jedi minds.

""I'd brave any weather 'cause nothing is better than being together again,"" the rivals-turned-friends sing to each other in the festive new song.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	From the fiery summer release of ZOMBIES 4: Dawn of the Vampires to the icy winter melody of “Snow Angels,” Freya Skye and Malachi Barton are back together again.


	Skye's Nova and Barton's Victor started out on opposite sides of an ancient fight as members of the rival Daywalkers and Vampires, respectively, in the fourth ZOMBIES installment that came out in July, but in the snow-dusted music video for “Snow Angels” — premiering exclusively on Billboard Family below — they're realizing the holidays are so much better when they're together.

	











	“Oh the choir sings and the bells all chime/ When your sno-oh-ow angel's next to mine,” Skye sings to Barton to start the song, as they lie down in the fresh snow and make head-to-head snow angels. Later in the tune, they sing in harmony: “I'd brave any weather 'cause nothing is better than being together again.” In the visual, they both harness their powers — Nova's solar flares and Victor's night winds — to conjure a flurry of snow.


	The “Snow Angels” song will be available across all digital music platforms first thing Friday (Nov. 14) at midnight ET, while the music video hits Disney+ and DisneyMusicVevo at 3 a.m. ET. The video will also premiere on Disney Channel after the ZOMBIES 4 sing-along encore event airing Nov. 28 at 7 p.m. ET, which will help kick off the network's “Fa-La-La-Lidays” holiday programming.

	











	Watch the music video below:


	Back in July, the ZOMBIES 4: Dawn of the Vampires soundtrack debuted at No. 1 on Billboard‘s Kid Albums chart (dated July 26) and also bowed at No. 3 on the Soundtracks chart, No. 16 on Independent Albums and at No. 90 on the all-genre Billboard 200. The ZOMBIES 4 album carried on the impressive track record of Disney's ZOMBIES film franchise on Billboard's Kid Albums chart: The first ZOMBIES soundtrack, released in 2018, spent 10 weeks atop the tally, while ZOMBIES 2 (2020) peaked at No. 2 and ZOMBIES 3 (2022) spent two weeks at No. 1.

Cardi shared the news (""A new baby into my world"") in the caption of an Instagram video soundtracked by her song ""Hello.""


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


Cardi B has welcomed her new baby boy with boyfriend Stefon Diggs, the rap superstar announced Thursday (Nov. 13) on Instagram.


	This is Cardi's fourth child, following her trio of kids with ex-husband Offset: 7-year-old daughter Kulture, 4-year-old son Wave, and 1-year-old daughter Blossom.


	Cardi shared the news in the caption of an Instagram video soundtracked by her song “Hello,” from her Billboard 200-topping sophomore album Am I the Drama?, which arrived in September.


	“My life has always been a combination of different chapters and different seasons,” she wrote in part in the lengthy caption. “My last chapter was the beginning of a new season. Starting over is never easy but it's been so worth it! I brought new music and a new album to the world! A new baby into my world, and one more reason to be the best version of me, one more reason to love me more than anything else or anyone else so I can continue giving my babies the love and life they deserve. This next chapter is Me vs. Me!”


	In a video posted to her Instagram Story, Cardi confirmed the sex of the baby, fawning over a girly, flower-covered stroller and lamenting, “I just had a boy … why didn't I know about this [stroller] last year?”

	











	While whispers of their relationship started in the fall of last year, Cardi and New England Patriots player Stefon Diggs made their first public outing as a couple in May, cuddling up courtside at the New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics game during the 2025 NBA Playoffs. Cardi announced their pregnancy news in September, telling CBS Mornings: “I feel very powerful that I'm doing all this work. But I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby, and me and my man, we're very supportive of each other.”




	In the Instagram caption, Cardi referenced her 2026 Little Miss Drama tour, which kicks off Feb. 11 in Palm Desert, California. “I've started prepping for tour getting my body right getting my mind right,” she wrote. “There's nothing thats gonna stop me from giving you guys the performance of a life time! I've learned i've healed, and im loving the woman i've become! Thats what this next era means to me and i'm stepping into it better than ever.”

Bad Bunny gana Album del año. La brasileña Liniker gana tres premios; Fito Páez y Edgar Barrera dos.

Chief Content Officer Latin/Español, Billboard


Bad Bunny y el dúo argentino Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso — dos artistas revolucionarios de lugares muy diferentes del mundo, haciendo música muy distinta y viviendo momentos totalmente diferentes en sus respectivas carreras — fueron los grandes ganadores de los Latin Grammy 2025, llevándose cinco premios cada uno y compitiendo en las mismas categorías varias veces.

	Bad Bunny, el gran favorito de la noche, se llevó el importantísimo premio al álbum del año por su aclamado disco DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, un proyecto que lo llevó de regreso a sus raíces puertorriqueñas, celebró el amor por su isla y sus tradiciones, inspiró su histórica residencia de conciertos y, finalmente, marcó el camino hacia su próxima presentación en el show de medio tiempo del Super Bowl.


	“Este premio se lo quiero dedicar a todos los niños y jóvenes de Latinoamérica, especialmente los de Puerto Rico”, dijo al recoger su premio. “Nunca dejen de soñar y de ser ustedes. Nunca olviden de dónde vienen sin olvidar a donde van. Hay muchas maneras de hacer patria y defender nuestra tierra. Nosotros escogimos la música”, puntualizó.


	Bad Bunny también ganó mejor interpretación urbana/fusión urbana y mejor canción urbana por “DtMF”, así como mejor interpretación de reggaetón por “Voy a llevarte pa PR”. DeBí TiRAR MáS FOToS obtuvo además el premio al mejor álbum de música urbana.

	











	Si Bad Bunny era el gran favorito, Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso fueron la sorpresa. Aclamados por la crítica, desde temprano en la noche parecían listos para darle pelea a Bunny. El dúo argentino, que fusiona con acierto el hip-hop con el soul, la electrónica y el pop estilizado para crear una mezcla de sonidos que desafía los géneros y letras irreverentes, ganaron cinco estatuillas: mejor video musical versión corta por “#tetas”, mejor video musical versión larga por “Papota”, mejor álbum de música alternativa por Papota, mejor canción alternativa por “#tetas” y mejor canción pop por “El día del amigo”.


	Además, los productores de su galardonado álbum, Rafa Arcaute y Federico Vindver, se alzaron con el premio al productor del año, compartiendo el galardón con Nico Cotton en un empate.


	En la extravagante presentación de Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso, un grupo de tipos musculosos, usando solo diminutos speedos negros, lanzaron rosas a los pies de una banda de soul/funk súper bien sincronizada, mientras el dúo, vestido con ropa estampada de Versace, rapeaba y tocaba riffs de guitarra excelentes y de gran calidad técnica. No se confundan por lo loco del show; este dúo tiene talento y capacidad de sobra y sabe perfectamente qué hacer con su música, su estilo y su ironía, tanto dentro como fuera del escenario.


	Más temprano, en la Premiere del Latin Grammy, Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso (cuyos nombres reales son Catriel Guerreiro y Ulises Guerriero, sin parentesco entre ellos) recogieron premios vestidos con conjuntos de seda estampados, los mismos que usaron para su presentación.


	“Hemos hecho un esfuerzo sobrehumano para ganar este hermoso objeto. Tan sobrehumano que ya no nos percibimos humanos, nos percibimos empresa”, dijo Ca7riel con total seriedad, fiel al estilo irónico que caracteriza la música y la imagen del dúo.

	











	Conforme avanzaba la noche y se sumaban los premios, el dúo se fue emocionando. Al recibir su premio a la mejor canción alternativa, Ca7riel cedió. “A nuestras madres, Estrella y Andrea, que son las culpables de todo esto”, dijo.


	“La verdad es que estamos sorprendidos de que nos den premios, que nos den cosas”, añadió Paco Amoroso. “Gracias al equipo que nos ha permitido hacer cosas. Estamos felices. Gracias a la gente de Argentina”.


	Irónicamente, ni Bad Bunny ni Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso ganaron grabación o canción del Año, dos categorías en las que los Latin Grammys, inexplicablemente, los hicieron competir contra sí mismos con dos canciones de un mismo álbum, prácticamente asegurando que se anularan entre ellos.


	En su lugar, Karol G se llevó el premio a la canción del año por su exitosísima (y maravillosa) “Si antes te hubiera conocido”, coescrita con Edgar Barrera, quien ganó compositor del año por tercer año consecutivo.


	Por otro lado, el superastro español Alejandro Sanz ganó grabación del año por su hermosa “Palmeras en el jardín”. Aunque es un gran tema, incluso Sanz expresó su sorpresa: “Benito, te lo he robado, perdóname”, dijo mientras recogía su premio.


	El premio al Mejor nuevo artista fue para la mexicana Paloma Morphy. 


	En cuanto a número de victorias, Brasil también brilló con Liniker, quien se llevó tres premios: mejor álbum de pop contemporáneo en lengua portuguesa por Caju, mejor Interpretación urbana en lengua portuguesa por la canción del mismo título, y mejor canción en lengua portuguesa por “Veludo Marrom”. Edgar Barrera también se alzó con tres galardones, al igual que Natalia Lafourcade, quien ganó mejor álbum cantautor por Cancionera.

	











	La transmisión en vivo arrancó con un confuso popurrí con el legendario Santana en la guitarra y varios nominados, como Maluma y Grupo Frontera, interpretando fragmentos de canciones junto a un grupo de bailarines cuyo estilo de principios de los 2000 se sintió un poco fuera de lugar con la música. Pero, conforme avanzaba la noche, avanzaron las actuaciones, empezando por Rauw Alejandro, quien presentó un medley de canciones respaldado por sus propios bailarines y banda, con una deslumbrante producción escénica y una interpretación vocal sobresaliente.


	Otros momentos destacados incluyeron a los ya mencionados Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso y a Bad Bunny, quien actuó junto al grupo puertorriqueño Chuwi. Hubo grandes sorpresas, como la presentación de Raphael, el homenajeado como Persona del Año, quien, a sus 82 años y tras problemas de salud, aún conserva la poderosa voz que lo ha convertido en uno de los baladistas más icónicos de la música latina. 


	Elena Rose y Morat también sorprendieron, mostrando una autenticidad y entrega que les ha permitido conectar profundamente con su público. Por su parte, Los Tigres del Norte ofrecieron un mensaje de conciencia social con su éxito “La lotería”.


	Los anfitriones de la transmisión por TelevisaUnivision fueron la veterana actriz y cantante Roselyn Sánchez, quien ya ha conducido este premio en múltiples ocasiones y demostró su carisma y experiencia; y Maluma, quien debutó como presentador con una actitud relajada y convincente. Me le quito el sombrero.


	Si hubo un tema central en la noche, fue la autenticidad y el regreso a lo real. En su emotivo discurso tras ganar el premio a canción del año, Karol G pidió “por favor no me corten” porque tenía algo importante que decir. La cantante colombiana reflexionó sobre los peligros de la fama y el riesgo de escuchar las voces externas que siembran dudas y críticas.

	











	“Lo único que me quedó de eso fue volver a la raíz y volver al propósito”, dijo. “No lo digo por mí, porque hay un montón de personas en la casa que piensan que no son suficientemente buenas. Cuando uno se olvida del otro, lo único que queda es la pasión”.

	This might have the Whitesnake faithful crying in the rain. Frontman David Coverdale, who co-founded the multiplatinum hard rock band in the late 1970s, co-wrote most of its songs and also sang with Deep Purple and Jimmy Page, announced his retirement today. Watch him reveal the news in a video below.


	“Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, brothers and sisters of the Snake, a special announcement for you,” Coverdale said. “After 50 years-plus of an incredible journey with you — with Deep Purple, with Whitesnake, Jimmy Page — the last few years it has been very evident to me that it's time really for me to hang up my rock ‘n' roll platform shoes and my skintight jeans.”

	











	The English singer added: “And as you can see, we've taken care of the lion's wig, but it's time for me to call it a day. I love you dearly. I thank everyone who's assisted and supported me on this incredible journey: all the musicians, the crew, the fans, the family. It's amazing. But it really is time for me to just enjoy my retirement, and I hope you can appreciate that.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Now 74, Coverdale founded Whitesnake in 1978 after a stint fronting Deep Purple following Ian Gillan's exit. His recorded three albums with that band — 1974's Burn and Stormbringer, both of which went gold in the U.S., and 1975's Come Taste the Band — singing on such popular tracks as “Burn,” “Mistreated” and “Soldier of Fortune.” He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with the group in 2016.

	











	Coverdale then formed released a pair of solo albums before forming Whitesnake in 1978. Its first two LPs charted in the Top 50 in his native UK, but the band would break out with its third disc, Ready an' Willing. That 1980 album hit the UK Top 10 and made its first U.S. chart appearance, peaking at No. 90 fueled by the single “Fool for Your Loving.” Fans would hear much more of that song late in the decade.


RELATED: Bernie Marsden Dies: Whitesnake Guitarist Who Co-Wrote ‘Here I Go Again' Was 72Whitesnake's next two albums, Come an' Get It (1981) and Saints & Sinners (1982), also reached the UK Top 10 but didn't click stateside. That changed with the group's 1984 LP Slide It In, which made the U.S. Top 40 thanks to the single-entendre FM hit “Slow an' Easy,” “Love Ain't No Stranger” and its libidinous title track. It was the first Whitesnake album to feature ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist John Sykes, who would co-write many of his new band's songs with Coverdale.


	But the group's next disc shot Coverdale and company to superstardom.


	Released worldwide in March 1987, the eponymous Whitesnake was an international smash, spending eight weeks at No. 2 — thwarted from the top spot by U2's The Joshua Tree — and going Top 10 in a half-dozen countries. The album featured the band's first big hit single: “Here I Go Again,” a new version of a track from the band's Saints & Sinners disc, hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It ranked No. 17 on VH1's list of the Top 100 Songs of the 1980s and was fueled by its steamy, MTV-smash video that featured Coverdale's soon-to-be-wife, model Tawny Kitaen. Watch it here:


Whitesnake also featured such popular tracks as the ballad “Is This Love,” which hit No. 2 in the U.S.; the hard-rocking, Zeppelin-esque “Still of the Night,” “Crying in the Rain,” another reworked Saints & Sinners song; and Give Me All Your Love. The album ultimately sold more that 10 million units stateside and drove sales of its catalog, making Whitesnake of one the poster bands of the “hair metal” genre, though it often was bluesier and/or more hard rocking than most others. 


RELATED: Tawny Kitaen Dies: ‘Bachelor Party' Actress And Whitesnake Video Vixen Was 59 


	The group then released Slip of the Tongue (1989), which went Top 10 in the U.S. and the UK and featured a reworked version of “Fool for Your Loving” that was a huge FM hit, spend four weeks at No. 2 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart. 


	But Coverdale would dissolve Whitesnake the following year, and in 1993 he teamed with Led Zeppelin's guitarist to form the one-off Coverdale Page. Their self-titled album made the Top 5 in the U.S. and UK, going platinum stateside, but the pair split late that year.


	Whitesnake had a run of eight consecutive Top 10 albums in the UK from 1980-94, including one live and one compilation set. Its 2008 disc Good to Be Bad also went Top 10 in Coverdale's homeland.


	Coverdale revived Whitesnake in 1997, and the group would release five more studio albums through 2019. None would reach the commercial heights of the band's '80s output, though. Coverdale would continue to tour the world with the group up until this past summer. 


	Whitesnake's music can be heard in dozens of films and TV shows ranging from I Know What You Did Last Summer, Old School and The O.C. to How I Met Your Mother, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Cobra Kai.


	Here is the Coverdale's video announcing his retirement:

	With his most epic cinematic outing yet, Christopher Nolan was determined to use as much practical filmmaking as possible.


	The 2x Oscar-winning writer and director of The Odyssey revealed that he “shot over two million feet of film” during the 91-day shoot, much of which was actually at sea to capture the grand scale of Homer's ancient Greek epic.


	“It's pretty primal! I've been out on it for the last four months,” he told Empire. “We got the cast who play the crew of Odysseus' ship out there on the real waves, in the real places. And yeah, it's vast and terrifying and wonderful and benevolent, as the conditions shift. We really wanted to capture how hard those journeys would have been for people. And the leap of faith that was being made in an unmapped, uncharted world.”

	











	Nolan explained that by “embracing the physicality of the real world,” he was “confronted on a daily basis by the world pushing back at you.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	An adaptation of one of the first stories in human history, The Odyssey follows Odysseus (Matt Damon) through the incredible trials and mythical encounters he faces on his decade-long journey home to wife Penelope after the Trojan War.


	For Nolan—who was tapped to direct Troy (2004), based on Homer's Iliad, but ended up doing Batman Begins (2005) for Warner Bros.–his adaptation of The Odyssey has been a long time coming.


	“As a filmmaker, you're looking for gaps in cinematic culture, things that haven't been done before,” explained Nolan. “And what I saw is that all of this great mythological cinematic work that I had grown up with – Ray Harryhausen movies and other things – I'd never seen that done with the sort of weight and credibility that an A-budget and a big Hollywood, IMAX production could do.”

	











	Premiering July 17, 2026 in IMAX, The Odyssey also stars Tom Holland, Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron, Jon Bernthal, Benny Safdie, John Leguizamo, Elliot Page, Himesh Patel, Bill Irwin, Samantha Morton, Jesse Garcia, Will Yun Lee, Rafi Gavron, Shiloh Fernandez, Mia Goth and more.

	As some of his peers embrace generative artificial intelligence with their own likeness, Morgan Freeman is putting his imitators on notice.


	The Oscar winner recently brushed off “the idea of retirement” as he shared his reaction to AI recreations of his voice and likeness online, revealing that his “lawyers have been very, very busy” with “quite a few” cases.


	“I'm a little PO'd, you know,” he told The Guardian. “I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness. I don't appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you're gonna do it without me, you're robbing me.”

	Although his frequent collaborator Michael Caine recently partnered with ElevenLabs to “preserve and share” his voice in their ‘Iconic Voice Marketplace‘ along with several other living and dead stars, Freeman plans to keep using his talents for the time being. 


	“Sometimes the idea of retirement would float past me,” he admitted. “But as soon as my agent says there's a job or somebody wants you or they've made an offer, the whole thing just boils back into where it was yesterday: how much you're going to pay, where we're gonna be?”


	The Now You See Me: Now You Don't actor also chimed in on the discourse around AI creation Tilly Norwood, one of 40 avatars being rolled out from AI talent studio Xicoia.


	“Nobody likes her because she's not real and that takes the part of a real person, so it's not going to work out very well in the movies or in television,” said Freeman. “The union's job is to keep actors acting, so there's going to be that conflict.”

Justin Baldoni claimed in a new legal filing that Blake Lively improvised an off-script kissing scene during the filming of “It Ends With Us.”

An exhibit filed by Wayfarer and others on Nov. 13 included a brief clip in which Lively and Baldoni — who co-starred in the movie — share a light kiss while passing in a hallway in a hospital.

Per People, attorneys for Baldoni alleged in documents that the “Gossip Girl” alum, 38, “added [the scene] to the script, in which her character kissed Baldoni's character in every take, although there was no kiss in the script.”

The footage from May 2023 — which is just over one minute long — shows Lively, who plays Lily, come across Baldoni, who plays neurosurgeon Ryle, as he works at the hospital.

Lily approaches a confused Ryle in the hallway, apologizing for interrupting his day and planting a quick kiss on his lips. 

She then leaves Ryle, telling him she “happen[s] to love him too” on the way out. 

Baldoni's character watches her exit with a bemused expression, tossing his phone before saying, “Alright, cut.”

A rep for Lively did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment on the deleted scene. 

Advertisement

Lively, 38, sued the film's director Baldoni, 41, for alleged sexual harassment and retaliation in December 2024. 

Baldoni denied wrongdoing and hit back with a $400 million countersuit against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, as well as others, in January, though it was later dismissed by the judge.

Advertisement

Lively's original complaint accused the director of alleged “improvised physical intimacy that had not been rehearsed, choreographed or discussed with Ms. Lively.” 

After a January 2024 meeting between Lively and Reynolds, as well as producers, Wayfarer agreed to employ an intimacy coordinator and stated that there would be “no more improvising of kissing,” per Lively's complaint.

Baldoni's legal team had previously claimed only scripted kissing scenes were filmed before the Hollywood strikes. 

However, they also claimed the alleged new unscripted kissing scene was filmed prior to the industry strikes on May 13, 2023.

“Lively also complains that there was inappropriate and improvised kissing during the first period of filming, before the strike break,” Baldoni's since-dismissed complaint read, per People. 

Advertisement

“But in fact, the only two kissing scenes filmed during the initial filming period were both scenes that included kisses as written in the script. These kissing scenes were not improvised.” 

On Wednesday, alleged texts between Baldoni and the film's source material author, Colleen Hoover, emerged as well. 

The “It Ends With Us” author allegedly wrote that she “felt forced to choose” between Lively and Baldoni amid their feud and that she was “disappointed” in the director, in alleged communications from 2024. 

The alleged texts were filed by Wayfarer on Nov. 10.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner hit back at Ray J's ‘frivolous' lawsuit over infamous sex tape","https://pagesix.com/2025/11/13/celebrity-news/kim-kardashian-kris-jenner-react-to-ray-js-sex-tape-lawsuit/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:49:00 GMT","

Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner have hit back at Ray J's new bombshell lawsuit against them, which came on the heels of them filing a defamation lawsuit against him.

Alex Spiro — the lawyer for Kardashian and Jenner — called the “One Wish” singer's lawsuit “frivolous” in a statement to Page Six on Thursday.

“After realizing he is losing the case and losing his way, this disjointed rambling distraction is not intimidating anyone,” Spiro said. “Ray J will lose this frivolous case too.”

Ray J's new lawsuit doubles down on his claims that Kardashian and Jenner have been lying about the infamous 2007 sex tape leak for two decades. The singer alleges the mother-daughter duo were behind his and Kardashian's sex tape — which he claims was filmed consensually in 2003 when they were dating — getting leaked.

Advertisement

Ray J, 44, claimed in the filing obtained by Page Six that he and Kardashian, 45, discussed releasing the tape in 2006, and that she allegedly told him that her mother should be in charge of releasing it.

He claimed that Jenner and Kardashian are now “furious” that he “no longer wants to play along with their tall tale.”

Ray J, whose real name is William Ray Norwood Jr., also hit back at Kardashian and Jenner's lawsuit against him for defamation, which they filed in October.

“Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner's lawsuit is not about defamation — it's about publicity, power, and punishment,” he claimed in the court docs.

Kardashian and Jenner filed the defamation lawsuit shortly after Ray J made the shocking claim that he's working with the feds to build a RICO case against them.

“The federal RICO I'm about to drop on Kris and Kim is about to be crazy,” the singer told Chrisean Rock during a livestream that circulated on X.

“I'm talking about, I'm on the news every day. I'm gonna say a lot of s–t. Anybody that is cool with Kim, they need to tell her now, the feds is coming. There's nothing I can do about it.”

He added, “It's worse than Diddy.”

But in Kardashian and Jenner's lawsuit against Ray J, they stated that “no such federal investigation exists.”

Advertisement

“No law enforcement agency has initiated any criminal proceedings or investigations related to racketeering charged against Ms. Kardashian or Ms. Jenner and no credible evidence whatsoever supports these inflammatory allegations,” their lawsuit reads, which was obtained by Page Six.

“Unable to accept the end of his fleeting relationship with Ms. Kardashian over 20 years ago, Ray J has repeatedly sought to attach himself to Plaintiffs' names and exploit their prominence for personal gain,” the lawsuit also states.

Morgan Freeman's distinctive voice has been the bane of everybody who has a “funny co-worker” for the last 20 years and counting—and now it's apparently the bane of his lawyers' workloads, too. This is per a new interview that Freeman gave to The Guardian this week, in which the veteran actor talked briefly about his reaction to the inescapable fact that his distinctive, warm tones were one of the first targets for AI voice copying—in many ways, now the irritating “office clown” to humanity as a whole.

To put it in Freeman's (apparently congenitally folksy) terms, “I'm a little PO'd, you know,” he said of the way his specific voice and cadences get copied by every huckster trying to peddle new AI tech. “I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness. I don't appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you're gonna do it without me, you're robbing me.” When asked about whether he pursues legal remedies when he finds out that his voice is being copied, Freeman makes it plain: “I tell you, my lawyers have been very, very busy.”

(Freeman was also, of course, asked about the whole “Tilly Norwood” thing, to similarly hardline results: “Nobody likes her because she's not real, and that takes the part of a real person, so it's not going to work out very well in the movies or in television … The union's job is to keep actors acting, so there's going to be that conflict.”)

AI being used to imitate well-known actors has been one of the many prongs making up the gnarly, multi-tined sticking point that's been Hollywood's response to artificial intelligence in recent years, especially after the estates of certain actors with highly distinctive voices—notably James Earl Jones—signed off on official copies. The topic was a major area of contention in the strikes that happened back in 2023—and apparently a big talking point for the Now You Seem Me actor and his reportedly tireless legal team.

James Van Der Beek will soon be auctioning off memorabilia from throughout his long film and television career, People reports. Van Der Beek revealed earlier this week that he intends to sell off his collection—including pieces from fan favorites like Dawson's Creek and Varsity Blues—in order to help pay medical costs. The actor revealed last November that he'd been diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer.

Per People, Van Der Beek will be selling the items—which include hats and cleats worn during Varsity Blues, the clothes he wore in the first episode of Dawson's Creek, and, in what's expected to be the highest-ticket item, the necklace that his character gave Katie Holmes' Joey during the show's prom episode—through Propstore's Winter Entertainment Memorabilia Live Auction in December.

Here's Van Der Beek:

I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now. While I have some nostalgia tugging at me as I part with these items, it feels good to be able to offer them through Propstore's auction to share with those who have supported my work over the years.

All proceeds from the sales will reportedly go toward covering Van Der Beek's medical expenses. A father of six, the actor has continued to work after revealing his diagnosis, including making recent appearances in Prime Video's Overcompensating.

The memorabilia auction is scheduled to begin with live bidding on December 5 in London, with the sale being opened up to global collectors the following day. You can see the full collection—which also includes some pretty choice non-Van-Der-Beek memorabilia, including Will Ferrell's Elf costume, one of the stunt axes from The Shining, and the usual array of Star Wars and Indiana Jones collectibles that often pop up in these kinds of sales—right here.

President Donald Trump likes his news apologetic, but more than that, he likes news organizations to show conciliation through cash payments. Earlier this year, he shook down CBS and ABC for roughly $15 million over various defamation allegations. However, while ABC settled with the billionaire co-founder of Truth Social for $15 million and apologized, CBS paid him $16 million and did not. The BBC did the opposite, offering Trump an apology but refusing to pay. In a report published today, the BBC stated that it has apologized for splicing parts of Trump's January 6, 2021, speech together but “rejected his demands for compensation.” As they have done to other news organizations, Trump's lawyers threated to sue the BBC for $1 billion over the edit.

“BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021,” a BBC spokesperson said. “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”

Over the weekend, The Daily Telegraph published a note from a whistleblower stating that a 2024 episode of the docuseries Panorama spliced together parts of Trump's January 6 speech that were 50 minutes apart, giving, as the BBC puts it, “the mistaken impression that President Trump made a call for violent action.” The news caused an upheaval at the BBC, leading to the resignations of two executives: Tim Davie, the network's director general, and Deborah Turness, its head of news. Unfortunately for the BBC, this wasn't the first time they've done this. Today, The Daily Telegraph found another instance of the BBC making a similar edit to the same speech nearly two years earlier for a 2022 episode of Newsnight.

President Trump has a long history of threatening to sue media organizations. Over the summer, he threatened The Wall Street Journal with a $10 billion lawsuit over its publishing a news story alleging that Trump had written the infamous “enigmas never age” letter in Jeffrey Epstein's extremely disgusting 2003 birthday book.

Miles Teller has opened up a bit about one of the more distressing moments of his entire career: The way his efforts, post-Whiplash, to fully embrace the Hollywood leading man stereotype (i.e., by getting himself his own superhero franchise) collided full-on with the disaster surrounding 2015's Fantastic Four. Specifically (per Variety), Teller talked to Andy Cohen on Sirius XM this week about the flop, saying that, “Honestly, maybe there was one really important person who kind of fucked it all up.”

Teller declined to name names for this particular RIP(WKOFIAU), although internet detectives have not had to look super hard to find a likely subject for the Eternity star's comments. Fantastic Four was, after all, dogged for months by rumors of conflict between director Josh Trank and pretty much everybody else on set—including Teller, who supposedly nearly got into a full-on fist fight with his director over clashing personalities. Everybody tried to make nice in public as the film's August 2015 premiere approached, with Trank notably doing damage control with producer and writer Simon Kinberg, hoping to dispel rumors he'd been fired from his own movie in all but name.

But then, on the literal night before the movie came out, Trank sent out a since-deleted Tweet bemoaning that audiences would “probably never get to see” the “fantastic version of this” he'd had “a year ago.” (The implication being that studio meddling, reshoots, and seized control of the movie's final edit had already ruined the film.) The rest was history: A critical drubbing, a box office return that just barely cleared the movie's budget, and Trank's vanishing from the list of up-and-coming genre filmmakers he'd been slotted onto in the wake of his 2012 found-footage superhero movie Chronicle. (He probably would have lost the Star Wars movie he'd been working on at that point, too, except he'd already lost it four months earlier; Disney was reportedly unhappy when it heard about how he'd been comporting himself on his first big-budget film set.)

And, again, Teller himself was classy enough not to get into any of this well-known superhero movie lore, beyond pointing out the singular nature of the culprit for his movie's famed fucking up. (He does note that “When I first saw the movie, I remember talking to one of the studio heads and said, ‘I think we're in trouble,'” which suggests that he was not as enamored with Trank's initial, reportedly much more somber, cut of the film than the director himself was.) The actor mostly just sounds kind of wistful at the missed opportunity, saying of his co-stars (which included Kate Mara, Toby Kebbell, Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan) that “The casting, I thought, was spectacular. I love all those actors… It's unfortunate…because so many people worked so hard on that movie.”

Former “Dancing With the Stars” host Tom Bergeron has publicly apologized to season 27 champion Bobby Bones, following remarks he made about the radio host's 2018 win.

Earlier this week, Bones shared a video on Instagram revealing that he had returned his Mirrorball trophy to ABC after hearing comments from Bergeron that he found “hurtful.” The 45-year-old said the remarks made during a recent interview where Bergeron called Bones' win “surprising” and “took away the joy” from his time on the show.

“I try not to get my feelings hurt, especially about stuff like this, but this was hurtful,” Bones said in the video. “Not because of what was said, but who said it.”

Bergeron, who hosted DWTS from 2005 to 2020, reached out soon after to make things right, according to People. “Bobby, it wasn't my intention to hurt your feelings,” Bergeron wrote in a message shared publicly. “My ‘ouch' was based on my honest feeling that your win spoke to a need to address the balance between judge and viewer voting. I always felt bad that you and Sharna [Burgess] had to deal with the aftermath of that win and I certainly regret pouring any salt into that old wound.”

Bones' video quickly drew attention online, with fans flooding the comments to show their support and encouragement.

“Nobody works harder, you earned that W,” one user wrote. Another added, “If I was you, I would not have sent it back. You and @sharnaburgess worked incredibly hard and deserved it!”

Others praised the country radio host for his maturity in handling the situation. “Good for you!!! You're being the ‘bigger person' and speaking volumes with your actions rather than words,” one fan commented.

Bones thanked followers for their kindness and emphasized that he still looks back fondly on his time on the show. “I loved my time there,” he said, adding that his partnership with Sharna Burgess remains one of his proudest professional moments.

This isn't the first time Bones has reflected candidly on his DWTS experience. As reported earlier this year, he revealed on “The Trading Secrets” podcast that he went above and beyond in rehearsals during season 27 — sometimes practicing extra hours alone after filming sessions. “I was so far behind everybody else,” he said, explaining that his determination helped him and Burgess clinch the Mirrorball trophy despite being considered the underdog.

Bones' openness about his journey — from facing criticism to earning respect — has resonated with fans and fellow contestants alike. Bergeron's heartfelt apology and Bones' grace in accepting it marked a moment of mutual understanding that reminded viewers why the show's legacy continues to center on perseverance, connection, and growth.

As Bergeron put it best in his message to Bones, “I certainly regret pouring any salt into that old wound.”

“Dancing With the Stars” airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC and Disney+.

Week 9 of “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34 also coincided with the show's 20th anniversary. It was a special night for Robert Irwin, as he performed an emotional Foxtrot to “Footprints in the Sand” by Leona Lewis in honor of his late father, Steve Irwin.  The routine had been inspired by his sister, Bindi Irwin, and her dedication dance to their father when she competed on Season 21 alongside professional dance partner Derek Hough. 

But this wasn't Robert's only performance on the night, and his jive was so fun! 

Robert also scored his first perfect score of 40 out of 40, and the first of the season. Judges and fans at home were impressed with his dance alongside professional dance partner Witney Carson. Later in the evening, the wildlife conservationist returned to the ballroom to do his relay dance. This time it wasn't alongside Carson, but with Xochitl Gomez, who competed on and won Season 32 of DWTS. 

Irwin and Gomez performed a jive, and it was an energetic, fun routine. They won the relay over Alix Earle and Season 33 Mirrorball champ Joey Graziadei. A video of their performance was shared on the official “Dancing with the Stars” Instagram account, allowing fans to rewatch it and share their thoughts. 

“Robert Irwin & Xochitl Gomez and Alix Earle & Joey Graziadei dance the Jive to ‘Dance with Me Tonight' by Olly Murs. #DWTS20 #DWTS,” the caption of the video reads. The comment section has been flooded with excited fans' reactions. 

“Ughhh i love Robert and Xochitl so much!!! I knew they were gonna win they were just perfect!!” an excited fan shared. “The chemistry between xochitl and Robert is undeniable and Soo cute. Fantastic partnership and dance!!” another person shared. 

Other reactions include, “Robert and Xochitl were soooo good!!!,” “robert and xochitl KILLED IT. so cute! and so so clean and technically good, too! just plain fun and adorable, couldn't stop smiling,” and “Go Xochitl!!!  and Robert is such a natural with the Jive!” 

The performance was a more playful part of the evening compared to Irwin's beautiful but emotional Foxtrot, and he had previously shared a look into his bond with Gomez. In a video posted on Instagram on November 11, the pair shared a hilarious skit as Irwin mimed to a voiceover. The clip didn't highlight their dance abilities, but it did show they both have a great sense of humor. “My dance knowledge has reached a new high with a mirrorball winner in the rehearsal room! @_xochitl.gomez,” the caption reads. 

“So funny. I'm gonna miss all these funny videos after u win,” a fan wrote. “The perfect pair!!!” another person shared.

The past year has been full of wonderful surprises for country music legend and “The Voice” coach Reba McEntire, from her NBC sitcom being renewed for a second season to getting engaged to longtime love (and “Happy's Place” co-star) Rex Linn. 

On November 11, 2025, McEntire, 70, got another surprise. Reps from her record label, MCA, and “Happy's Place” cast members threw the queen of country an unexpected party on the set of her sitcom. The celebration marked 50 years since she signed her first record deal, with Mercury Records, back on November 11, 1975. 

To mark 50 years of memories in showbiz, McEntire was surprised in front of a studio audience with a giant cake emblazoned with her name, a huge plaque honoring 50 years of accomplishments, tons of balloons, and many of her colleagues wearing t-shirts featuring one of her 32 album covers. 

“Reba's impact on country music is immeasurable,” MCA CEO Mike Harris said in a statement. “For 50 years, she's set the standard for artistry, authenticity, and work ethic — inspiring generations of artists and fans alike. It's an incredible honor for all of us at MCA to celebrate this milestone with her and continue the journey with one of the most defining voices in our genre.”

According to MCA, McEntire has sold over 58 million records worldwide, with hits including “Fancy,” “Survivor,” and “Whoever's in New England.” She is the only female country solo artist to have scored a number one hit in four consecutive decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s).

McEntire has shelves full of awards, too. Over her career, she's won 16 ACM Awards, 15 American Music Awards, nine People's Choice Awards, six CMA Awards, and three Grammys. And in February, she could win her fourth Grammy, since she just received her 18th nomination. McEntire is up for the Best Country Duo/Group Performance for her collaboration on “Trailblazer” with Miranda Lambert and Lainey Wilson.

The last year hasn't been all sunshine for McEntire. In early August, she lost her cherished stepson, Brandon Blackstock, whom she helped raise with her ex-husband Narvel Blackstock. Brandon, who was also married for several years to “The Voice” coach Kelly Clarkson, died at age 48 following a two-year battle with melanoma. 

But his passing has made it all the more clear to McEntire that now is a time to reflect on where she's been, enjoy the present moment, and be grateful for the gifts in her life. 

“I think I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life,” she told People in late October. “It's amazing. It's wonderful being 70 and getting to do what I get to do at the level I want to do it.”

McEntire stars on NBC's “Happy Place” on Friday nights and on season 28 of “The Voice” on Monday nights.

Bobby Bones competed on “Dancing with the Stars” Season 27 in 2018. Despite not being the most talented dancer on the show, he won the Mirrorball Trophy thanks to the incredible support of his fans and for giving the ABC dance competition his best effort. Bones is a likable guy. However, his win alongside professional dance partner Sharna Burgess has been somewhat controversial. 

In an interview with Parade, beloved former DWTS host Tom Bergeron was asked what had “shocked” him the most during his time on the show, and he responded that the event that shocked him the most was Bones' win. The comments upset Bones, who responded with a TikTok video. “This was hurtful,” Bones said. “And not because of what was said, but really who said it.” He also claimed he would be returning his Trophy. 

Not wanting to cause Bones hurt, Bergeron issued a public apology on Instagram on November 12. In his message, he wrote, “I was doing so many interviews leading up to the [DWTS 20th anniversary], I was bound to say something inelegantly. Sorry, Bobby. Sometimes I should fall back on my mime training.” 

The post's comment section was flooded with reactions, some of which Bergeron responded to. It was in one of these comments that he made a brilliant offer to ensure that Bones and his Mirrorball Trophy find their way back to each other. 

In the comment section, fans have shown their support for Bergeron, sharing that what he said was not said with malice. “Tom. You spoke on something that everyone has been talking about. BUT Bobby's win and Andy's progress through the weeks shows that this show is about the public view,” a comment reads. “It's about who is likable. I'm sad that he felt the need to send his trophy back, but i also understand that he's been talked about poorly since his win.”

The comment attracted attention from fans, was liked over 400 times, and prompted Bergeron to respond. “I'd like to offer to personally return his trophy to him. On my dime,” he wrote. 

Fans applauded this response, with reactions including, “this is why you were the BEST host,” “Another reason we love you. You have the biggest heart, and just speak what we all are thinking. Praying Bobby will feel the support and healing love,” and “you should.”

If you're among the many who discovered L.A. pop duo After on social media in the last few months, you probably did a double take when you noticed that their two self-titled EPs were released this very year. Vocalist Justine Dorsey and producer Graham Epstein—often pictured together looking exactly like Frou Frou's Details photo shoot—are the closest thing we have to Y2K time travelers, but that's not really a compliment. Their debut cashes in on culture's nostalgic obsession with strictly faithful recreations of several radio-friendly subgenres of the early '00s. Though the out-of-time aesthetics are impressive, After's limp and unimaginative rehashes have little to offer beyond the novelty of hearing these styles done all over again.

Consider “300 dreams” and “Deep Diving,” the interchangeable breakbeat pop tracks that open each EP. Dorsey told Rolling Stone that “300 dreams” represents her attempt at a “Coldplay coded” song. Breakbeat-based Coldplay should be a fascinating concept, but After opt for the laziest possible execution. Dorsey sounds a bit like a femme Chris Martin as she sings faux-inspirational verses contrasted by a downer hook (“Oh, look at the state of me/I'm always falling down”). The chord progression sounds like it could have been lifted from “Clocks” or “Speed of Sound.” Breakbeats, Coldplay songs, and pop choruses are exactly as you remember them, each element as inert as a museum display. “Deep Diving” repeats the formula, except the lyrics evoke a CD skipping (“All the stones on the beach, and the shells on the beach, and the sand in your teeth”), and with no anthemic final chorus, it ends abruptly after the bridge.

Lackadaisical songwriting decisions like this fracture the nostalgic lull. EP 2's “Where we are now” tries to tell a story of everyday longing similar to Frou Frou's “Hear Me Out,” but exchanges the central metaphor of waiting on hold for something even more circular (“Wherever we're walking/I'll see you at the end somehow/That's where we are now”). Unsurprisingly, Dorsey and Epstein hardly touch the emotion apparent in Imogen Heap and Guy Sigsworth's performances. “Close your eyes,” the EP 2 closer, evokes Speak for Yourself's yearning technoromantic ballads at five percent power, but while the drums and breathy vocals may be superficially similar, the brilliance of a song like “Just for Now”—the reason Heap can yell “shut up” and then softly whisper that she's “on your side” in the next breath—is its emotional dynamism. Dorsey's robotic ponderings just meander over Epstein's zombified version of the ROMpler-based affective synthwork from the 2003 visual novel that inspired their band name.

After's lifeless consistency gives little impression that time travel is any fun. EP 1's “Obvious” is immaculate-sounding mall rock, but it lacks all the personality and snotty affect that makes an early-2000s classic like “Complicated” so great. Dorsey gives us nothing as entertaining as an Avril Lavigne hit or as heartfelt as a Michelle Branch ballad—she just sings. And when staccato string hits à la Vanessa Carlton's “A Thousand Miles” bookend the chorus, it feels like a nostalgic formality rather than a worthy addition.

Truly great retro music isn't made by time travelers but by artists whose interpretation of the past remains compelling and productive in the present. PC Music resurrected passé sound artifacts in order to simultaneously embrace and critique consumer culture with varying degrees of irony—a terrifying word to After—and someone like Danny L Harle has parlayed this experience into work on tracks like Caroline Polachek's “Blood and Butter” and “Billions,” where unironic anachronisms artfully commune with contemporary aesthetics. After's version of unironic anachronism is more like insultingly ignorant bliss. EP 2's “Outbound”—a uniformly positive pick-me-up anthem that promises you'll feel better after your friend “take(s) you to the movies, then take(s) you to the park”—fetishistically embraces the sounds of faux-optimism that left a prior generation of young people blindsided by late capitalism.

With no substance under its surface, After's pitch-perfect Y2K imitation doesn't amount to more than a viral trend. Perhaps the music's nostalgic presentation puts you at ease, but its profound lack of purpose in the present can't justify the effort to revive it. This is pop's Crystal Pepsi—a gloriously ephemeral product of our memories that came back tasting like absolutely nothing.

Pop music is trapped in a funhouse mirror. Borrowing has never been more in vogue. Halloween is now one expensive, unsettling lookalike contest in which celebrities pose as other, usually deceased, celebrities. The song that currently holds this decade's record for most weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart is an almost word-for-word interpolation of a hit from the first Bush administration. The recent past haunts our Instagram feeds and Spotify algorithms with the disturbing possibility that there really is nothing new under the sun. Repurposing a phrase from the Marxist scholar Franco Berardi, the late critic Mark Fisher referred to this phenomenon as “the slow cancellation of the future.” This is the dark side of nostalgia, the notion that the march of progress—whether in social movements or music—has slowed to a halt.

Asha Lorenz and Louis O'Bryen have made a home in this uncanny valley. Over their nearly decade-long career, the two primary songwriters for London's Sorry have embraced the tension between past and present, shining a floodlight on their references rather than burying them in the mix. Across two albums and a collection of EPs, the group—which also includes Lincoln Barrett on drums, Campbell Baum on bass guitar, and Marco Pini on electronics and production—has nabbed song titles from Oasis and refashioned lyrics from Tears For Fears and Death Cab for Cutie in their wry, neurotic image.

On their third album, fittingly titled COSPLAY, Sorry try on new personas—UGK MC, folk troubadour, dark ambient chanteuse—without the veil of irony they once used to keep listeners at a remove. Unpredictable, sensuous, and slightly spooky, COSPLAY captures the disquieting sounds of a foregone future.

In the spirit of plunderphonic predecessors like the Avalanches and the Books, Sorry takes a cut-up approach to pop culture. “Jetplane” flips a Guided By Voices hook, some dial tone, and a taut breakbeat into a frenzied battle cry: “Arrest me! I'm a hot freak!” On “Waxwing,” backed by a Twilight Zone synth and industrial feedback, Lorenz transforms Toni Basil's coquettish one-hit wonder “Mickey” into something altogether more salacious. “Love Posture” could be the band's answer to Nine Inch Nails' “Closer,” the bass humming as Lorenz sings about the things lovers do on all fours. (And that's not to overlook the band's 2022 song actually called “Closer,” an emo slow burn with decidedly fewer references to animalistic abandon.)

COSPLAY revels in distinctly human flaws: The false start on the theatrical piano number “Magic;” Lorenz's vocal rasp on the rowdy “Today Might Be the Hit;” the way her voice loses and finds the beat on the profane, Elton John-indebted “Candle.” A porous mix of influences and imperfections, the album captures the uneasy sensation of grasping for something concrete in a world that stubbornly defers meaning.

Sorry falters when they try to nail down specifics. A tossed off line about reactionary Japanese philosopher and poet Yukio Mishima on “Into The Dark” and anesthetized single-word repetitions on “Echo” threaten to flatten Sorry into just another group of Zoomer nihilists dreaming of extinction. But this being a Sorry record, a few seconds of a discordant guitar or a percussive clash will shift the mood again.

It might be tempting to compare Sorry, a brash duo equally versed in shitposts and postmodernity, to an American counterpart like 100 gecs. Both groups delight in muddying cultural hierarchies; both make art that is simultaneously an homage and an affront to the 21st century's “crushing sense of finitude and exhaustion,” as Fisher once wrote.

But the final song on COSPLAY, “Jive,” sets Sorry apart from hyperpop's anarchic whimsy. Building slowly from a single downbeat, “Jive” goes through multiple episodes: a sumptuous R&B groove, a bratty outburst of electroclash, and what sounds like a marching band of misfits. Lorenz is steady throughout these shifts, repeating the song's refrain like a mantra. Where gecs might pull back before the song's emotional pitch, Sorry leans in, free from pastiche or ironic detachment. “I wanna jive tonight,” Lorenz sings, and for a moment, the future seems to stretch out forever.

These days, I have a hard time going back to a lot of old Chicago drill. Sure, a handful of the best rap songs and mixtapes of the 2010s came from that scene, but fire up vintage Zacktv interviews or D Gainz and A Zae Production music videos and it's like sitting through an in memoriam segment: nothing but decade-old clips of teenagers and early twentysomethings who are now dead, in jail, experiencing mental health issues, or exiled from their hometown. They could've been or They should've been is how most of the comments read underneath the clips. One of the last few standing to tell the story is G Herbo, maybe the hardest rapper of the entire generation.

I'm not normally a you-had-to-be-there type of guy, but when G Herbo first hit YouTube as Lil Herb—a scrawny, Polo-wearing 16-year-old kid with the burly voice of a cigarette-smoking grown man—the explosive rhymes of “Kill Shit” and “Gangway” had my New York City high school on lock. Back then, outside of Wayne and Meek Mill, it was rare that our anthems were by out-of-towners, but to this day a lot of my friends still talk about Herb with the gravitas NBA prospects do Paul George. Looking back it makes sense—compared to, say, the Gucci-like numbness of Chief Keef or the Bone Thugs-lite rap-sing of Lil Durk, Herb's Southern influences (Three 6 Mafia and Project Pat; I've never heard him talk about Houston rap but sometimes the hulking rasp of his voice makes me think about the Screwed Up Click dudes) were dusted with streaks of East Coast traditionalism. If he'd been born 10 years earlier he might've been wreaking havoc on jacked beats with Major Figgas. That combination has given him the flexibility to adapt to the fast-moving micro-eras of rap and gradually shift his perspective as he's gotten older.

Freshly 30, G Herbo keeps on growing along with his music on Lil Herb, a loose concept album, mostly recorded in Chicago, that reflects on the original era of drill with a level of clarity that no other rapper has yet. Herb goes about that by tweaking the heat-of-the-moment POV of classic drill for one that puts him back in the shoes of his teenage self. It's almost like hearing the narrator of The Sandlot flash back to the summer that shaped his life.

Herb's storytelling is vivid and lived-in, oscillating between wistfulness for simpler times when he was hustling to get fly and all his friends were still alive and the anxiety of living through violence and disarray with a deep focus on the hard-earned lessons along the way. On “Give It All,” backdropped by a dreamy piano riff, he takes us through his entire childhood in two and a half minutes: From the days when he was a broke kid hooping, riding the bus, and hitting on girls at juke parties to losing his innocence with guns, beefs, and orgies. The pained inner monologue of the soulful “Fallen Soldiers” has a novelistic level of detail—you get the names, the locations, the conflicted emotions—as he struggles with how to respond to all the death around him. Sharpest of all is “Blitz,” where the hunger bursts from him like Dreamchasers 2-era Meek over a beat that smashes together ballistic drums and nonstop gunshots. The choice to rap over spraying bullets is as mesmerizingly cool as it is eerie, like it's a memory he can't shake.

The knock I have on almost all of G Herbo's studio albums, though, is that they take the idea of being an album too seriously, meaning there's notes hit for no reason except that's what big albums are supposed to do. On Lil Herb, it's stuff like “Every Night,” the sweeping choir intro that flat-out explains all of the emotions he'll be dealing with on the record. I'd much rather listen to “Radar,” which has writing that ties those feelings to specific scenes: “You ever lived through a nightmare?/Look death in the face, he might stare/Somebody try and kill you right there/You can't depend on nothin' but Nike Airs.” Then there's the obligatory radio cuts like the Jeremih-assisted ode to his girl “Whatever U Want” and “Thank Me,” with Anderson .Paak, which has the cutesiness of Coloring Book. His heart doesn't seem in them, which is not the case with the two-hander he pulls off with Wyclef Jean by just rapping hard as fuck like he normally does.

If I were arguing with someone in a bar about how good of a rapper I believe G Herbo to be, I probably wouldn't use any of his albums as the sole example. I think of him almost like I do Jadakiss, where the catalog is as much and maybe even more about the mix of pop and underground features, freestyles, and one-offs. There's a sense of humor and rhyme scheme playfulness infused into G Herbo's stories (like the ones on his mixtape from earlier this year, Greatest Rapper Alive, where he just rips a bunch of classic rap beats) that tends to be a little muted when it's time to go plaque-hunting.

But Lil Herb is as close as he's ever gotten to capturing that full picture. “Went Legit,” the biggest hit of his career despite having no hook, is full of sharp slice-of-life bars that are kinda funny and kinda real at the same time. On “Longevity,” Herb sounds like he's on a Kay Slay tape with the way he fools around with enunciation and spelling: “In a trap, 17, I touch C, D, and E/One of my brothers in a bing, just seen me on BET/Dropped out of everything and I ain't get no GED/Took myself off EBT, the crib look like a B&B.” He works in these stylish touches without losing sight of the album's message. “Think back, if it weren't for rap, where would I be instead?” he asks himself on the uptempo “Reason,” slightly switching up his flow to give an answer: “Probably jail, probably, probably dead, probably.” It's like one big sigh of relief.

Those silhouettes on the cover of Big city life? That's you and me! Smerz's latest and best album feels like it was made for projection. It's not designed to be relatable, that most cursed descriptor of meaningless contemporary pop, but to be lived in, tailored to your body, snagged on the pedal of a Lime bike. In that sense, it lends itself fabulously to a remix album, and so arrives Big city life EDITS, an album of sinuous reinterpretations that highlights the endless plasticity of Catharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt's voices and songwriting.

Across these 14 reworks, 18 acts write artful Smerz fan fiction: For the most part, the duo's voices are left intact, but layered atop sounds far removed from the original record's arch, deconstructed take on dance music. On Molina's discomfitingly sexy version of “Roll the dice,” Stoltenberg and Motzfeldt seem to have taken a wrong turn off the high street and into one of those crusty dive bars that only plays hypnotic European dub; the song's lyrics, so embodied and affirmative on the original, suddenly feel ominous, like you're being lured somewhere you're not supposed to be. The arty electroclash duo New York turn “Imagine this” into something that might have fit on After Dark 2, striking a perfect balance between high kitsch and high glamour.

If it can sometimes feel like “alternative” pop is simply real pop music that's kind of unfinished—like, music that uses avant-garde texture or structure to hide a dearth of coherent ideas—Big city life EDITS proves that Stoltenberg and Motzfeldt's songs have strong bones. The Copenhagen singer Fine plays “A thousand lies” straight: It's just her voice atop a loose, jazz-folk arrangement, and it sounds like a lost cut from the Norman Fucking Rockwell! sessions. It's not the only song on EDITS that conjures the spirit of Lana straight from the Bayou: On a rework of “You got time and I got money,” by Vilhelm Strange, Villads Tyrrestrup, Tobias Hansen, Zack Sekoff, and Jakob Littauer—credited here as VVTZJ—Clairo is a dead ringer for the singer circa Ultraviolence, warbling over an impossibly luxurious soul arrangement like a lounge singer playing her last show.

Fair play: A couple of informal tributes to the queen of idiosyncratically romantic, atmospheric pop makes perfect sense on an album that also serves as a starting lineup of uncompro-pop's next generation. Big city life EDITS works so seamlessly—and feels so much like it's just another Smerz album—that it's easy to forget that it's also a feat of A&Ring that brings together more than a dozen of the most interesting and talented producers currently working. I can imagine that, five to 10 years from now, teens will be posting the tracklist of Big city life EDITS on whatever newfangled social media platform I've dragged my lifeless body over to and asking “How did Smerz get MIKE, Erika de Casier, Astrid Sonne, and haloplus+ all on the same album?” At which point I will smile to myself, delete my account, and hit play on “You got time and I got money – VVTZJ EDIT,” happy that I got to witness it in the moment.

Pebe Sebert — mother of Kesha and a singer-songwriter who's collaborated with Dolly Parton, Miley Cyrus, and more — has announced her self-titled debut album, scheduled to arrive Dec. 12.


	The artist revealed the news Thursday on social media with the simple caption, “Pebe Sebert. My one and only album,” alongside a pre-save link to streaming services. Hours before the announcement, Sebert dropped “City's Burning,” the third single from the upcoming project, following previously released tracks “Vampire” (2021) and “Hard Times Ahead” (2022).


	The record is set to span 11 songs and showcases Sebert's original recordings from the Eighties. Kesha will release her mother's debut LP under her own eponymous label Kesha Records, which dropped the “Joyride” singer's sixth album, (Period.), in July.


	“I grew up in the studio, watching my mom turn her life into songs. These moments became stories. these stories are her life,” penned Kesha, who's regularly worked with her mother throughout her career, on X. “She wrote an album before I was born. This was the only album she made as an independent artist before focusing her life on raising her children and writing songs for other people.”

	Kesha continued, “I grew up watching this alchemy, and I only became who I am because of the road she paved before me. I'm so proud to finally release my mom's debut album on KESHA RECORDS, and I'm so proud of her release today !”

	











	During the release of “Vampire” in 2021, Sebert opened up about her struggles with substance abuse and how it affected her work. “I felt like this song had died along with my career as a recording artist when my life fell off the tracks due to drug and alcohol abuse in the middle of recording my debut album, I grieved the loss of my recording career and this music I was so proud of,” Sebert said in a statement at the time. “Last year I found these tapes in a dusty box in my basement and Guy [Roche] was nice enough to help me bring them back to life and it's very fulfilling to finally release this.”

Jimmy Kimmel Live! was hit by tragedy this week when bandleader Cleto Escobedo III died from an undisclosed illness. “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement,” Kimmel said in a statement. “Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was nine years old. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true.” (Watch Kimmel's 22-minute monologue tribute here.) The gig was also a dream for Jimmy Kimmel Live! keyboardist/musical arranger Jeff Babko, who worked alongside Escobedo for over 30 years, and considered him one of his closest friends. Babko hopped on the phone with Rolling Stone to look back at their time together. 


	I don't think I've ever seen television like Jimmy's monologue the other night. It was something else. We were all feeling a lot, and I think it really showed what kind of family Jimmy created over there. If it's not legit blood family, it's one step removed. It's pretty deep. And with Cleto gone, it's all hitting hard. These events — the good ones and the bad ones — show our little show-family at its closest. It's not making it easy.

	I met Cleto in 1994. I was just out of college, on my first tour with Julio Iglesias. We'd play Caesars Palace a few times a year in the old Circus Maximus ballroom, the last of the old Vegas rooms still standing. Cleto's dad was the valet, the butler backstage. Sammy Davis Jr. had gotten him that job years before, and Julio absolutely loved him. Cleto Sr. spoke Spanish, understood Julio in ways most people didn't — his needs, his personality. He introduced himself to me right away, the friendliest guy, and he treated us musicians with this deep respect when most people treated us like the help. Only later did I learn he had been a musician himself, which explained everything.

	











	Every time I was backstage, Cleto Sr. would tell me, “You gotta meet my son. He's in L.A. He's new to town. You're the L.A. guy.” And then I came home and started following this band, Cecilia Noel and the Wild Clams. Wild is an understatement. Part Latin, part funky L.A. music, part simulated sex show, part complete insanity. Monday nights, Thursday nights — I was there every chance I got. Cecilia eventually asked me to join; I didn't need rehearsal. I'd memorized the whole show just by being in the room.

	And Cleto Jr. was in that band. Singing, playing sax. We really bonded there. One night after a gig, we all ended up at Jerry's Famous Deli in Studio City. Cleto was holding court with the backup singers, telling horrible stories about his ex-girlfriend, animated and loose and hilarious. And I remember thinking, How do I not know this guy? He liked the way I played, especially the wah-wah pedal I used on keyboards. We kind of found each other right away — instant click. We became inseparable from that Jerry's Deli moment.


	We started doing everyday life together — cotton commercial auditions with the whole 13-piece band shoved into a tiny casting office (the band didn't get the spot, but the overweight trumpet player did, which we thought was hilarious). We were broke together. If one of us needed $100 to get through the weekend, whoever had it loaned it. We ended up in the same apartment building — he was downstairs, I was upstairs. We hung out constantly. We built a little act at Café Cordiale on Ventura Blvd. in Sherman Oaks, playing twice a month for six years. He was too humble to make a fool of himself onstage, and I had no problem doing that for both of us. That little band became the nucleus of the Cletones.


	By the early 2000s, our Cordiale gig had become a kind of valley sensation — part middle-aged pickup joint, part musicians hang, and absolutely packed. Rumor was Jimmy Kimmel was going to get his own show after The Man Show ended. One night Jimmy came in with [executive] Lloyd Braun from ABC. We did our act — R&B, Stevie Wonder, Rufus, some bizarre Borscht Belt rock-and-roll humor. Lloyd stayed for three songs, smiled, left. Next thing we knew, we had a gig. This was late 2002.

	Cleto was out with Marc Anthony at the time, and I was juggling touring with Toto and working on The Martin Short Show. But the call came: help build the show open, figure out the music. We all knew most shows aren't built to last — three weeks and gone. But we knew we loved Jimmy, and we knew we loved Cleto. We were all in.

	











	The early days of Kimmel were chaos. Total party. The green room was a party. The show was trying to be what late night really was in Hollywood, which, it turns out, is not sustainable. We'd get three-week, six-week, nine-week pickups. The smell of pizza at rehearsal meant celebration: We got renewed again. That was how we lived. Two years in, it started to feel like maybe we would stick around.


	Cleto had zero experience as a bandleader. None. If you asked him, he'd say, “I just hired the baddest motherfuckers I know and hoped for the best.” And that's exactly what he did. Thankfully, Toshi [Yanagi],and I had done the Martin Short Show, the Wayne Brady Show, a few pilots — we had enough TV tricks to keep the train on the tracks. And Cleto trusted us. Always. He hired people he knew knew more than he did, which made him the best kind of leader.


	Watching him with his dad was something beyond words. His dad had hung up his horn to get a steady job, to raise a family. He hung up his dreams. So when he picked up that horn again — because his son was giving him the stage he deserved — it was powerful. Music did what words could never do. It was soul-to-soul transmission. All of us — me, Toshi, Junior — we're only children. That bond with a parent is deep. The three of them had this magic triangle. When Senior played with Junior, it was like watching someone step back into the life they were meant to live.


	Musically, Cleto loved groove. He loved Stevie Wonder, Rufus, Donny Hathaway, Tower of Power, Sting. He loved the truth. His playing was soulful, genuine — no math, no patterns, no cerebral showing-off. Just purpose and soul. Every note meant something.


	We connected deeply on early Late Night With David Letterman — Paul Shaffer, Steve Jordan, Hiram Bullock. If you shared that OG Letterman DNA, you instantly understood each other's humor, timing, worldview. Letterman was our connective tissue. It fast-tracked me into his life, and honestly into Jimmy's.


	As the show evolved, our music evolved. Early on we were trying to pilfer the KROQ playlist — Queens of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters — instrumental versions that kept the energy young. But as the show grew up, we leaned into what two saxophones are supposed to do. A little more classy, a little jazzier. And Cleto always trusted me to write music that featured what we did well. He gave us freedom. If I needed to miss a show to record a film score, he insisted I go. “You never know how long a show will last,” he'd say. He was never threatened. He just wanted his people to shine.

	











	And now — now that he's gone — it's hard to imagine coming back without him. For decades, Toshi, Cleto, and I could communicate entire conversations with a single look. Cultural opposites, but an only-children family. One of us is missing now.


	The end was brutal. He got sick, and I won't go into details, but I've never seen doctors and nurses love a patient like they loved him. He knew every RN, every tech, every doctor. Even when he couldn't communicate, they experienced Cleto through us. They felt his spirit. I've never seen medical professionals break down like that. It was a testament to him — his kindness, his light.


	Jimmy got everything right in that monologue, except one thing: it was a BB gun, not a shotgun, shooting down kites. Cleto corrected that story eight times. But Jimmy painted the picture. Cleto was humble. He wanted respect, but hated attention. Hard place to live. Those who knew, knew. And he got his flowers.

	Standing next to his dad during that monologue… I've never had to try that hard to be the strong one. His dad showed up in a suit, with his horn, ready to play. We played Grover Washington — the solo Cleto had air-saxophoned in his hospital bed just a week earlier. We played a song Cleto and I wrote for his mom 30 years ago. And we were going to play “Hard Times” by Ray Charles. I said to Senior: “That's kind of your song, are you OK to play it? I thought we would play it without a sax, just as a tribute to you guys.” And his dad said, “You know, Jeff, I always hoped that he would play this when I died. This is wrong. It wasn't supposed to go this way. But I have to play this for Junior.” And he played like I've never heard anyone play.


	So we know this wasn't by choice. He fought until the bitter end to stay here for his family. Last night, his wife said, “I never wanted to do this alone.” And I said, “You couldn't be less alone.” He spent a lifetime building friendships — deep, wide, loyal friendships. A chosen brotherhood. And I'm just so lucky I got to be his friend.

	Much like American democratic ideals, pop's creative vanguard has largely been flourishing outside the U.S. these days. Rosalia's Lux, to cite 2025's most vivid example, moves music vernacular forward by looking backwards to old-world virtuosity and spirituality. FKA Twigs' EUSEXUA, meanwhile, found her leaning into brave new worlds: AI, virtual spaces, digitized ecstasy and body modification — all things making humans meta-human, for better or for worse.


EUSEXUA Afterglow finds Twigs doubling down on the personal cybernetic project she's been engineering since 2014's sublime vibrator “Two Weeks.” Originally conceived as a set of extras for the EUSEXUA deluxe edition, Afterglow is being released as a stand-alone LP, which is fair enough; its 11 tracks are all fresh cuts, as opposed to remix packages a la Charli XCX's Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat and Pink Pantheress' Fancy Some More? If you hear echoes of those artists in Twigs latest work, you can hear echoes of her in theirs, too — the context of a dazzling UK pop generation born in rave culture's golden era and, well, afterglow.

	Pink Pantheress turns up on EUSEXUA Afterglow, in fact, on “Wild and Alone,” a softly percolating banger that posits fame as a perpetual relationship hurdle without getting too upset about it. Elsewhere on this horny, party-hardy set, relationships seem beside the point. “Lost all my friends in the club/ then i lost my mind in the car/ i don't even remember who you are,” Twigs purrs woozily on “Lost All My Friends,” a sort of sequel to Pink Pantheress' “Illegal” delivered over smeared downtempo beats that shift in and out of focus. “Slushy” feels like the offspring of Kate Bush's “Deeper Understanding” after 30+ years of computer love, a swirl of harp and high-hat spectres under ASMR positivity mantras.

	











	Admittedly, there's nothing here as sticky as EUSEXUA's “Sticky,” let alone “Childlike Things,” “Room of Fools” or “Drums of Death.” Afterglow is strongest when the beats are sickest, which is roughly midway through, when things peak with the tag-team of “Predictable Girl” and “Sushi,” a head rush of junglist bass growls and breakbeat abstracts. It's heady, after-the-afterparty stuff — dance music for folks maybe too far gone to stay vertical, let alone dance. But Twigs, reliably, is about pushing one's limits, so you might just find yourself rising to the occasion.

Kacey Musgraves and Carín León brought a touch of Nashville to the Latin Grammys in Las Vegas. During Thursday night's ceremony at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the música mexicana star was joined by the Nashville queen for a performance of their bilingual collaboration, “Lost in Translation.”


	Dressed in his classic tall sombrero, León opened his performance solo with his sweet ballad “Ahí Estabas Tú” from Palabra de To's, backed by the strums of the requinto. Then, Musgraves emerged on a second stage in a sparkly black dress as they transitioned into “Lost in Translation” and sang the love song to each other, trading verses in Spanglish.

	The Latin-country duo released “Lost in Translation” on Aug. 29 about a love that defeats language barriers. Musgraves and León co-wrote the song alongside Amy Allen and Shane McAnally, with Julian Bunetta and Matt Zara serving as producers.


	Musgraves previously said of their collab, “Growing up singing traditional country and western music, I've always loved exploring the borders of Country and where it blends with other styles like norteño and some regional Mexican sounds that I heard a lot of in Texas.”

Nightcrawler Research, a data-focused UFO investigation team, reports capturing footage of three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in New York. In each case, the citizen journalists say the objects disrupted camera performance during recording. They further disclosed that their efforts have drawn attention from the FBI and other federal agencies.

During an interview with host Ross Coulthart on NewsNation's “Reality Check,” Nightcrawler Research's John Tedesco revealed that one of the UFO sightings they captured on video in New York took place July 5. (RELATED: Mysterious ‘Crop Doodle' Spotted In Argentine Wheat Field)

“This was an object that presented over the water. Initially, what we saw was something that, roughly about 600 feet from the surface off the Atlantic Ocean, we saw an object that was not very luminous, very, very low, low light, not really in the IR, some visible light was present, and we noticed that the light presented in the same basic area, the same area of the sky,” said Coulthart.

“Within a short period of time, that object disappeared, and we saw this, what looked like a sphere on the water, an extremely bright, luminous sphere.”



Later in the conversation, the research team described additional UFO encounters. In one instance, they captured footage of an object seemingly entering and exiting the water. They also detailed another sighting involving a number of black triangular crafts, which they detected inside a cloud and recorded using radar.

Coulthart questioned the team whether or not federal agencies, such as the FBI, have been treating their reported UFO sightings seriously, with Tedesco responding, “Absolutely. It's an ongoing thing with them. They're certainly very concerned about it. And, you know, our communication, it's been ongoing.”

Marnik light the torch for their next musical chapter with ‘The Ritual', a wrecking ball of energy that brings their epic techno sound even further to the forefront. Set for release on Zeitgeist, – sublabel of Intercord Records, the newly revitalized Virgin Records Germany and home of harder dance genres –, the single sees Marnik continue to stake their claim as one of the most fearless and in-demand acts on the current techno circuit. Out now, ‘The Ritual' has officially begun, all that's left is to answer the call.

From its opening bars, ‘The Ritual' locks into a ceremonial chant and entrancing beat, highlighting the larger than life nature of Marnik's epic techno sound. The speedometer clocks in at a scolding 150BPM, with the track pushed to even bolder heights with ripping synths and a kinetic low-end that insists on walking the edge of insanity. In all, it makes for a perfect debut with Zeitgeist as part of Intercord Records (the newly renamed Virgin Records Germany), as both the duo and the label set their creative sights on the harder side of the electronic spectrum.

The release arrives as Marnik extend a decade-long run that's surpassed one billion streams and taken them to some of the world's biggest stages, from Tomorrowland in Belgium to Ushuaïa in Ibiza. Their upward trajectory shows no signs of slowing, with ‘The Ritual' acting as a guiding light as they continue to climb the stairs of success. This month, they take that momentum eastward, bringing their explosive sound to Sri Lanka and Indonesia for a duo of shows that promise to turn ‘The Ritual' into reality.



Italian duo Marnik are one of the most prominent and influential names in electronic music today. Over the course of their decade-long career, Alex and Lele have surpassed 1 billion streams, blending a relentless touring schedule with cutting-edge studio work to stay at the forefront of the global electronic scene. Manrik's unique approach sees Alex commanding the stage at premier festivals and clubs including Tomorrowland, Sunburn, Creamfields, Ushuaïa, Story Miami, as well as headlining tours across Europe and Asia.

Meanwhile, Lele focuses on crafting their sound in the studio, creating a seamless synergy between high-energy live performances and a steady stream of fresh releases. From global radio hits such as “Boyz In Paris” and “Gam Gam”, to genre-defining anthems like “Bazaar” and “Mandala,” Marnik's discography continues to resonate with fans worldwide. In 2025, Marnik achieved a career milestone, climbing to #80 in DJ Mag's Top 100, up 10 positions from the 2024 chart. The same year, the duo also launched their own label and imprint, ARENA, which is poised to make waves in the Electronic scene. Celebrating 10 years of innovation, Marnik are proving there's no limit to what's next.

Center Theatre Group will present Paranormal Activity with an original story based on Paramount Pictures' terrifying film franchise.

Production photos have been released from Center Theatre Group's presentation of Paranormal Activity, the new stage production with an original story inspired by Paramount Pictures' film franchise. 

Center Theatre Group will present Paranormal Activity with an original story based on Paramount Pictures' terrifying film franchise—now live on stage from November 13 to December 7 at the Ahmanson Theatre, the third attraction of the 2025–2026 season. The press opening is November 14. Tickets are available at CenterTheatreGroup.org.

Paranormal Activity, in its North American premiere production, is from Levi Holloway, who chilled Broadway audiences with his Tony Award-nominated Grey House in 2023, and Felix Barrett, pioneering founder and artistic director of the acclaimed Punchdrunk, whose immersive Sleep No More played more than 5,000 performances in a record-breaking 14-year run in New York at The McKittrick Hotel. Barrett and Punchdrunk are currently represented in New York by Viola's Room at The Shed through October 19.

Paranormal Activity features illusions by Tony Award-winner Chris Fisher, whose work includes the West End and Broadway productions of Stranger Things: The First Shadow, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, and Back to the Future, along with the West End and Center Theatre Group productions of 2:22.

The North American premiere began at Chicago Shakespeare Theater from October 8 to November 2 before moving to the Ahmanson Theatre. Following Los Angeles, the production will be presented by Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. from January 28 to February 7, and American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco from February 19 to March 15.

The story follows James and Lou, who move from Chicago to London to escape the past but soon discover that places aren't haunted—people are. The cast includes Cher Álvarez, Patrick Heusinger, Shannon Cochran and Kate Fry.

Levi Holloway said, “Writing Paranormal Activity for the stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London—working to create an actual nightmare—has been a dream. We strived to create something impossible, mixing the familiar with the uncanny, heart with horror. Chicago audiences have a nose for honesty on stage and little patience for anything else. They'll find it here, right alongside all the mischief we've made to trouble their sleep.”

Playing Lou and James— a couple trying to escape a sinister force—are Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger. Álvarez has appeared on television in Grey's Anatomy and NCIS: Hawai'i, and has performed at The Goodman Theatre, Steppenwolf Theatre and Writers Theatre, with additional credits at Milwaukee Repertory Theatre and American Players Theatre.

Heusinger has been seen on Broadway in Next Fall and Fiddler on the Roof and starred as Lancelot in the national tour of Spamalot. His television credits include Gossip Girl, Royal Pains and Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce.

The cast also includes Shannon Cochran as James' mother, Carolanne, and Kate Fry as Mrs. Cotgrave, a medium. Cochran's credits include the West Coast premiere of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in San Francisco, the national tour of Roundabout Theatre Company's Cabaret, and the first national tour of August: Osage County. This production marks her return to the horror genre following her appearance in the 2002 film The Ring. Fry, whose many credits include Henry V, As You Like It, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, and The Merchant of Venice at Chicago Shakespeare Theater, has recently appeared in The Cherry Orchard at Goodman Theatre and Birthday Candles at Northlight Theatre.

Levi Holloway is an ensemble member of A Red Orchid Theatre, which debuted his plays Grey House—later produced on Broadway—and Turret, starring Michael Shannon. He has performed as an actor with Lookingglass Theatre and Steppenwolf Theatre. Holloway is co-founder of the Neverbird Project, a youth-based deaf and hard of hearing theatre company that creates work for deaf audiences. He previously taught in the deaf department at Bell Elementary in Chicago for more than a decade and teaches playwriting at Silk Road Rising.

Felix Barrett is the founder and artistic director of Punchdrunk and has conceived and directed productions such as Sleep No More, The Burnt City and Viola's Room. He directed the critically acclaimed 2024 UK premiere of Paranormal Activity at Leeds Playhouse, which moves to the West End this winter.

The creative team includes Fly Davis (scenic and costume design), Anna Watson (lighting design), Gareth Fry (sound design), Luke Halls (video and projections design), Chris Fisher (illusions design), Bob Mason (casting), Travis A. Knight (assistant director), Camille Etchart (UK associate scenic designer), Frank McCollugh (US associate scenic designer), Abby May (US associate lighting designer), Will Pickens (US associate sound designer), Lianne Arnold (US associate video and projections designer), Skylar Fox (associate illusions designer), Daniel Weissglass (assistant illusions designer), Melanie J. Lisby (production stage manager), Julie Jachym (assistant stage manager) and Emma W. Lipson (production assistant).

 The enigmatic interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers worldwide, and fresh observations have led some experts to speculate it may actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. 

The enigmatic interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers worldwide, and fresh observations have led some experts to speculate it may actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

Researchers noted a series of puzzling irregularities, including its survival of a close encounter with the Sun, enormous unexplained jets, and a peculiar “anti-tail,” News.Az reports, citing The Mirror.

Unlike typical comets, 3I/ATLAS remained intact and luminous after passing near the Sun, defying expectations.

Astronomers also detected an unusual radio signal emanating from the object, sparking speculation that it could be an alien vessel. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet's strange behaviors—such as its anti-tail and twin jets—could be the result of “technological thrusters,” implying it might be a mothership from another planet.

Fresh images from the Nordic Optical Telescope, a 2.56-meter research telescope situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain's Canary Islands showed that 3I/ATLAS continues to display a confounding ""anti-tail"".

The ""anti-tail"" was spotted as a streak of debris strangely pointing toward the Sun, even as the object races away from it.

3I/ATLAS is the enigmatic 'comet' that has captivated the globe in recent weeks.

Fresh observations now suggest it might actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. This speculation comes after researchers examined a string of puzzling irregularities, including its ability to survive a close encounter with the Sun, enormous unexplained jets, and a peculiar ""anti-tail"".

Just days ago, astronomers detected a strange radio signal from the mysterious interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS as it raced through our solar system, sparking wild theories that it could be an alien vessel. The so-called ""anomaly"" has left scientists stunned by enduring a scorching encounter with the Sun without falling apart - something no typical comet could achieve, reports the Daily Star.

Rather than breaking up, 3I/ATLAS appeared as one solid, luminous object, featuring a strange ""anti-tail"" and two massive jets shooting material in opposing directions - occurrences that experts claim violate the laws of physics.

Consequently, Harvard professor Avi Loeb has recently suggested these strange behaviors could be the result of ""technological thrusters"", implying the object might be a mothership from another planet.

Fresh images from the Nordic Optical Telescope, a 2.56-meter research telescope situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain's Canary Islands showed that 3I/ATLAS continues to display a confounding ""anti-tail"".

The ""anti-tail"" was spotted as a streak of debris strangely pointing toward the Sun, even as the object races away from it.

Typically, a comet's tail streams behind, pushed by solar winds, but this weird reversal has left experts puzzled, with some proposing it's just an optical illusion, the Daily Mail reported.

In Montana's ancient rocks, scientists uncovered the tiny remains of a land-dwelling crocodyliform that challenges what we thought we knew about crocodile evolution.

Around 95 million years ago, a small crocodyliform affectionately called Elton roamed what is now southwest Montana, near the ancient shoreline of the Western Interior Seaway.

According to Montana State University paleontology professor David Varricchio, the juvenile measured less than 2 feet long from snout to tail—roughly the size of a large lizard. Even as an adult, it would have reached only about 3 feet in length, making it much smaller than most members of the Neosuchia clade, which includes modern crocodiles and their extinct relatives. Most of these species were aquatic or semi-aquatic predators equipped with simple, conical teeth suited for catching prey in the water.

Elton, however, was different. It lived on land and likely fed on plants, insects, or small animals, using its varied and specialized teeth to process a wider range of food. Its distinctive features revealed that it belonged to a newly identified family of crocodyliforms native to Cretaceous-era North America.

This remarkable discovery might never have happened without the keen observation of Harrison Allen, a 2023 graduate of MSU's Department of Earth Sciences in the College of Letters and Science. During a 2021 field excavation in the Blackleaf Formation near Dillon, Montana, Allen—then a student in Varricchio's paleontology course—spotted a tiny fossil, no larger than his pinkie tip, with a “weird texture on it.”

“I brought it to Dr. Varricchio and knew it must be something good, because he said, ‘Take me to where you found this,'” said Allen, who is now studying croc paleontology as a doctoral student at Stony Brook University in New York.

It was an exciting moment for Allen, originally from Kentucky, who chose MSU because it offers a paleontology track for undergraduates majoring in earth sciences. Four years and hundreds of hours of study later, he is the lead author of a paper published this week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology that describes the morphology and scientific significance of the creature whose remains he found in the Blackleaf Formation.

“After the dig, Dr. Varricchio told me why he was so excited the day I found the initial specimen. It had so much visible anatomy to explore, and he could see it was a tiny, tiny croc skull, fully articulated and preserved – it was a special thing,” Allen said. “We have found dinosaurs (in the Blackleaf) before, but this was the second known vertebrate animal we'd ever found in this formation.”

The extinct animal, which Allen and the paper's co-authors later named Thikarisuchus xenodentes for its strange, sheathed teeth, has provided new information about the paleoecology of the Blackleaf ecosystem and about patterns of evolution in the croc family tree.

It also provided the ultimate undergraduate research project for Allen, who delved into the painstaking process of excavating, sifting, and reconstructing the Thikarisuchus remains with the help of some fellow students.

“As an undergraduate student new to research, I nervously went up to Dr. Varricchio and asked if I could study this specimen,” Allen said. “It led me down the rabbit hole into this amazing world of prehistoric, extinct crocs and their evolutionary niches.”

The day after Allen recovered the first piece of skeleton, he and his classmates scooped up several bags of sediment from the mound where it was found. Back in Bozeman, Allen and his friend Dane Johnson, who graduated in 2022 and is now a paleontology lab and field specialist at MSU's Museum of the Rockies, spent between 10 and 20 hours sifting out fine particulate matter and dirt, eventually recovering dozens of tiny pieces of the Thikarisuchus skeleton that collectively fit into the palm of Allen's hand. As they worked, they listened to music, including Elton John's 1970s hit “Crocodile Rock.” The nickname “Elton” stuck, long before the specimen was assigned the scientific name that reflects its physical traits.

Allen and Johnson recovered bits of bone from almost all areas of the animal's body, including its limbs, vertebrae, jaw and 50-millimeter-long skull. Because the fragments were tiny and exceptionally fragile, the students didn't attempt to physically reassemble them. Instead, they took them for a series of CT scans, including some at MSU's Subzero Research Laboratory. Allen estimates that he spent well over 100 hours coloring the digital, 2D segment slices that the scans produced, a process necessary to visually distinguish the bones from the rocks they were embedded in.

“Harrison worked super hard to digitally reconstruct the animal, and it came out beautifully,” said Varricchio.

During the process, Allen discovered that the bones of Thikarisuchus were densely concentrated and organized in a manner consistent with fossils of organisms found in burrows in the Blackleaf Formation and the nearby Wayan Formation in Idaho. He said this suggests that Thikarisuchus was likewise preserved within a burrow, further supporting the notion that fossils recovered from these formations are biased toward those that were preserved in burrows.

The specimen also presented clues about Thikarisuchus' newly named family group Wannchampsidae and a similar group found in Eurasia known as Atopasauridae. Both groups were tiny and terrestrially adapted, and they shared certain cranial and dental features found in another more distantly related group from the Cretaceous of Africa and South America.

“It suggests that during the same time period, we're seeing convergent evolution between two distantly related groups due to similar environmental conditions, prey availability, and who-knows-what that prompted crocs on opposite sides of the planet to develop similar features,” Allen said.

As he works toward his Ph.D. and a career as a paleontology professor, Allen said his experiences with Elton cemented his research interest, which has since broadened to include extinct crocs from all over the world.

“The majority of diversity of crocodyliforms is in the past. There were fully marine crocs, fully terrestrial crocs, herbivorous crocs, omnivores, and some that cracked shells,” he said. “That amazed me and made me want to get into this more specific realm of paleontology.”

Varricchio said he feels fortunate that students like Allen choose to study at MSU.

“It was a true pleasure to have Harrison as a student here – so much positive enthusiasm, followed up with great research,” he said.

By Vatican News

The Dicastery of the Doctrine of the Faith has determined that “the phenomenon of the alleged apparitions said to take place in Dozulé” linked to the creation of an enormous cross that would guarantee remission of sins and salvation to those who approached it, “is to be considered, definitively, as not supernatural in origin.”

The Dicastery's decision was communicated in a letter in a letter signed by the Prefect, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, authorizing Bishop Jacques Habert of Bayeux-Lisieux to issue the relevant decree. The decision was approved by Pope Leo XIV on November 3.

In the French town of Dozulé, Jesus is said to have appeared 49 times between 1972 and 1978 to Madeleine Aumont, a mother, asking for the construction of the so-called “Glorious Cross of Dozulé,” which was never built. The cross was to be fully illuminated and reach a height of 738 meters, with arms measuring 123 meters, thus visible from far away as a sign of universal redemption. In recent decades, “Crosses of Love” have been erected in various countries around the world, scaled down to one hundredth of the size of the “Glorious” cross.

As early as April 1983, the then-diocesan bishop, Jean-Marie-Clément Badré, stated that “in no case can the construction of a monumental cross undertaken in Dozulé (...) be an authentic sign of the manifestation of the Spirit of God.” On December 8, 1985, the same bishop declared: “Regarding what is taking place at Dozulé—the activity and the agitation, the collection of funds by people acting on their own initiative, without a mandate and without respect for the authority of the Bishop; […] the fanatical propaganda in favor of the ‘message'; […] the categorical condemnation of those who do not adhere to it—I am led, in conscience, to judge that, beyond all this ferment, I do not discern the signs that would authorize me to declare the alleged ‘apparitions' to be authentic, nor to recognize a mission given to the Church to spread this ‘message.'”

On the basis of recent guidelines for discerning alleged supernatural phenomena, the current bishop, Bishop Habert, has requested authorization from the Dicastery to issue a declaratio de non supernaturalitate, that is that “the phenomenon of the alleged apparitions of Dozulé is not of supernatural origin.”

Cardinal Fernández's letter accepts the Bishop's proposal: “This Dicastery authorizes Your Excellency to draw up the corresponding Decree and to declare that the phenomenon of the alleged apparitions said to have taken place in Dozulé is to be regarded, definitively, as not supernatural in origin, with all the consequences that flow from this determination.”

The letter highlights a number of problematic elements in the messages associated with the phenomenon, including the comparison of “the cross requested in Dozulé with the Cross of Jerusalem,” which “risks confusing the sign with the mystery, and risks giving the impression that what Christ has accomplished once and for all could be “reproduced” or “renewed” in a physical sense.”

It is also notes that “some formulations contained in the alleged messages of Dozulé insist upon the construction of ‘the Glorious Cross' as a new sign, necessary for the salvation of the world, or as a privileged means of obtaining universal forgiveness and peace. At times, there is a mention of ‘multiplying the sign,' as if such diffusion were a mission given by Christ Himself.”

“The Cross does not need 738 meters of steel or concrete to be recognized,” the Dicastery declares. Rather, the Cross “is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness; every time a soul converts; every time hope is rekindled where the situation seemed impossible; and even when, by kissing a small cross, believers entrust themselves to Christ.”

It goes on to reiterate that “no private revelation may be considered a universal obligation or a sign binding the conscience of the faithful, even if spiritual fruits may accompany such phenomena. The Church encourages expressions of faith that lead to conversion and charity, but warns against every form of ‘sacralization of the sign' that leads people to consider a material object as a guarantee of salvation.”

The messages of Dozulé say that “all those who will have come to repent at the foot of ‘the Glorious Cross' will be saved,” that “‘the Glorious Cross' will take away all sin,” and that all those who “come there with faith to repent will be saved in this life and for eternity.” The Dicastery states emphatically that “such expressions are incompatible with the Catholic doctrine on salvation, grace, and the sacraments.”

The letter then points out other messages that have been disproven by events. One such message, for example, asked for the “Glorious Cross” and Shrine to be built before the end of the 1975 Holy Year, “for it will be the last Holy Year.” “Clearly, this purported prophecy was not fulfilled,” the Dicastery notes, as two other ordinary Holy Years (2000 and 2025) and two extraordinary Holy Years (1983 and 2016) have subsequently been celebrated.

The Dicastery also notes various apocalyptic statements which suggest the Lord's proximate or even imminent return, such as the one in which it is claimed that Jesus said: “If the cross is not erected, I will cause it to appear—but there will be no more time.”

“Although the theme of the Lord's return is an integral part of the Christian Faith,” the Dicastery says, “the Church—while recalling that Christ's return is a truth of the faith, even though no one can know or predict the precise date or its signs—remains alert against millenarian or chronological interpretations, which risk setting the time or determining the modalities for the Final Judgment.”

Concluding the letter, the Dicastery explains, “The cross, as a sign of devotion, is never mere exteriority. When Christians venerate the cross, they do not adore the wood or metal, nor do they think that a material cross can replace the saving work already accomplished in Christ's Paschal Mystery. Instead, they adore the One who offered His life upon it…The veneration of the Cross thus forms us in a tangible spirituality and an incarnate faith: not an abstraction, but a way of facing life with our gaze fixed upon the Crucified, recognizing in every trial the possibility of a redemptive encounter.”

Summary:

Kim Kardashian took the California bar exam after a six-year journey to become a lawyer in June 2025.

After calling psychics “pathological liars” in a TikTok video, Kim sparked reactions from fans and fellow celebrities.

While psychics have a long history, the rise of platforms like #WitchTok has made spirituality a viral trend.

Kim Kardashian has been on an unconventional six-year journey to become a lawyer, and in June 2025, she finally took the California bar exam. A long-time criminal justice reform advocate, she previously expressed confidence she had passed, though that confidence may have come more from her family's psychics than her studies. In a TikTok recap of her mother Kris Jenner's 70th birthday, Kim called the psychics “pathological liars”, sparking reactions from fans and highlighting a trend among celebrities like Khloé Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, and Brad Pitt, who have all consulted psychics for guidance.

Psychics have fascinated people for centuries, from ancient temples to 19th-century parlors, and today, Gen Z has made the metaphysical world a viral trend on platforms like TikTok's #WitchTok. While many explore spirituality and alternative practices online, scammers have also taken advantage, with most readings focusing on money, love, and careers, making discernment crucial. Even so, some psychics, like Matt Fraser, suggest the spirit world operates on its own timeline — meaning Kim could still pass the bar, the next time she takes it.

The disclosure of emails from the paedophile financier has fuelled calls for the full release of FBI files on his case

It is 20 years since Florida police first investigated the financier Jeffrey Epstein for the sexual abuse of underage girls; six years since he killed himself in prison following his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges; and more than a year since Donald Trump said that he would have “no problem” with releasing the FBI files on the offender.

As the Democratic politician Ro Khanna noted, releasing the files “was core to Trump's promise … It was his central theme that the American corrupt elite had betrayed forgotten Americans”. The question is not only what Epstein's associates did, but also what they knew and what they did not do. It is not only about their own behaviour, but about any knowledge or suspicion of his crimes, and willingness to overlook them.

Yet the Maga base is still waiting. Mr Trump has said that he had “no idea” about Epstein's crimes. On Wednesday, questions were reignited by the Democrats' release of emails in which Epstein described Mr Trump as “that dog that hasn't barked”, adding that “[victim's name redacted] spent hours at my house with him”. Republicans said the victim was the late Virginia Giuffre, who told lawyers that “I don't think Donald Trump participated in anything”. Separately, Epstein wrote that “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine [Maxwell] to stop” and that “Trump knew of it” but “he never got a massage”.

Mr Trump, who has mainstreamed and legitimised conspiracy politics and the championing of emotion over fact, attacks the issue as a “hoax”. The very people who urged Maga supporters to pursue this story – such as Kash Patel, now FBI chief – abruptly changed their minds this year without adequate explanation. Republicans released thousands of documents in response to the emails published by Democrats. But Mr Trump faces a bipartisan demand for the full release of the files, with members of the Maga far right joining Democrats.

The Republicans took a drubbing in off-year elections last week, and Mr Trump's approval rating is the lowest of this term. The ending of the longest government shutdown in history – after a handful of Democrats folded on Wednesday – relieved the White House, but opens the way for a vote on releasing the files, expected next week.

Mr Trump has shaken off troubles that would have ended any other political career – including E Jean Carroll's successful civil suit against him for sexual abuse (which he is again asking the supreme court to dismiss) and two dozen allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. The full release of documents might aid him: the slow drip of information has kept the scandal running and made it look, rightly or wrongly, as if the administration has something worse to hide.

For the Maga base, previously fired up by lurid and false “Pizzagate” claims of a paedophile ring connected to the Democratic political elite, this remains a burning issue. Their claims about Epstein's circle have at times been partisan, provably wrong and antisemitic. Yet it's hard to deny that the mills of justice usually grind slower when the rich and well-connected are involved, and that powerful figures who benefited from a relationship with Epstein, such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Peter Mandelson, have sought to avoid scrutiny and minimise their ties. It took the courage of victims and dogged reporting to make Epstein accountable, and it took far too long. A fuller reckoning for his associates – from across the political spectrum – is overdue.

CLEAR

In a truly bonkers but entirely predictable turn of events, right-wing conspiracy theorists are transvestigating late political pundit, Charlie Kirk, and his widow Erika.

Perpetuated by anti-trans trolls, “transvestigations” rely on phrenology-like “evidence” of scrutinising physical features and bone structure to deduce someone's “true” sex, leaning on the false idea that “we can always tell”.

As first reported on by them, conspiracy theories around Erika Kirk started not long after her husband was shot and killed at a Utah university in September. Users across X, Facebook, and Reddit began theorising that her features, such as her “straight collar bones”, “low set ears”, and thigh gap indicated that she was an “invert”, as trans people are called in right-wing conspiracy circles.

Posts on the Facebook group “Transvestigation Disclosure NOW,” which has more than 53,000 members and multiple offshoot groups, return to these features repeatedly, referring to her as “Erik” or “Erik(a)”.

One video from an online creator questions why they're unable to find pregnancy photos of the former pageant queen, pointing to her “little boy hips”.

Even Charlie Kirk isn't safe in death, with people theorising that he may also be an “invert”, while others argue his entire family are, with one X user suggesting that his sister's clavicles could be an indicator of her secret transness.

“that's why Charlie Kirk seemed so feminine and emasculated because she was a transgender handler. That's why he was so pretty,” one user wrote, referring to the idea that trans people are controlled by “handlers” assigned by those at the top of the conspiracy.

Delving deeper into these forums and threads reveal more unhinged theories, from the idea that Erika was the victim of child trafficking, to more sinister, antisemitic rhetoric that play on ideas of the “new world order”.

Transvestigations are becoming more and more common as trans people are weaponised by those across the political spectrum, with seemingly anyone becoming a potential target.

Candace Owen, a far-right political commentator and friend of Charlie Kirk, is currently being sued by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife Brigitte, after spending months harassing the pair and accusing Brigitte of secretly being trans.

Owens released an eight-part series on YouTube Becoming Brigitte, in which she claimed Brigitte Macron was assigned male at birth under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux, the name of her actual brother.

She also claimed the Macrons are blood relatives and that Emmanuel Macron is the result of a CIA human experimentation program similar toMKUltra, with the series garnering more than 2.3 million views.

GLAAD notes the movement of transvestigations began around 2017, and initially targeted Black women including Michelle Obama and Serena Williams, accusing them of secretly being men in a deeply racist and transphobic attempt to discredit their achievements.

A 2021 report from the Wilson Center called the phenomenon, “deeply misogynistic”.

“These narratives tap into the trope of the duplicitous woman, implying that not only are transgender individuals inherently deceptive, but that this deception is responsible for the power and influence that these women hold,” it detailed.

            Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday, according to state media, more than a week later than their scheduled landing, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris hit left their spaceship with a cracked window.
    


            After the capsule hatch opened medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported.
    


            The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China's Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they'd even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.
    


            But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
    


            After a nine-day wait, they finally headed home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
    


            The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.
    


            During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.
    


            The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China's Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.
    


            Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a nine-hour sortie, and it's about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.
    


            The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China's youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.
    


            The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.
    


            China's rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed bans on Chinese citizens with US visas participating in NASA programs.
    


            The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts stuck in space. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned. They eventually returned home in March.
    


            Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.

Pictures posted on social media showed different sites in flames and residents gathering in rubble-strewn streets outside apartment buildings

Russia unleashed a massive combined attack on Kyiv early Friday, sparking fires and scattering debris across many districts of the capital, mayor Vitali Klitschko said. At least 11 people were injured as emergency crews responded to multiple strikes, he said in a statement.

Five people were hospitalised, including one man in critical condition and a pregnant woman, after a series of powerful explosions sounded in the city and air defences were activated.

The attack on the capital was ongoing, officials said, urging residents to remain in shelters until the air raid alert is lifted. City authorities warned that power and water outages were possible.

Pictures posted on social media showed different sites in flames and residents gathering in rubble-strewn streets outside apartment buildings.

“The Russians are hitting residential buildings. There are a great many damaged multi-storey apartment buildings, in practically every district,” Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's military administration, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

He said both drones and missiles had been deployed and emergency crews were dispatched to several neighbourhoods.

Klitschko said Kyiv's heating system had also sustained damage, with service interrupted in one district. He warned of possible disruptions to power and water supplies.

In the Darnytskyi district, debris landed in the yard of a residential building and on the grounds of an educational facility. A car caught fire after being hit by falling fragments.

In the Dniprovskyi district, debris damaged three apartment buildings, a private household and caused a fire in an open area. In the Podilskyi district, five residential buildings and a nonresidential structure were damaged.

Several fires were caused by falling debris elsewhere in the city.

In the Kyiv region, Russian strikes damaged critical infrastructure and private homes, injuring at least one civilian, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said. A 55-year-old man in Bila Tserkva suffered thermal burns and was hospitalised, he said. Fires broke out in private houses in the capital's suburbs.

The strike came as European Union officials warned this week that Ukraine must continue to crack down on corruption following a major graft scandal that has put top nuclear energy officials under scrutiny. But they also offered assurances that aid will continue to flow as Kyiv strains to hold back Russia's invasion.

The removal of US tariffs is intended to reduce the price of bananas, coffee, and other food products from the region.

The United States is set to lift tariffs on certain food products and other imports from Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala and El Salvador in return for improved access to those markets for American firms.

The framework agreements, which are expected to be finalized in the next fortnight, are aimed at reducing prices for bananas, coffee and other foodstuffs from the region.

""With all of these deals, the ones in Asia, the ones we're announcing today, we maintain the tariffs, we give some tariff relief on certain products or goods, but at the same time, we open up foreign markets in ways that they have not been open before,"" a government official told the Reuters news agency on Thursday.

After recent Democratic wins in New Jersey, New York and Virginia, due in part to cost-of-living concerns exacerbated by President Donald Trump's tariffs, the administration has renewed focus on affordability issues, blaming higher costs on policies enacted by Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden.

Economists, on the other hand, say price hikes have been caused in part by sweeping import tariffs imposed by Trump on nearly every country on the planet.

Officials in Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala and Ecuador welcomed the deals.

Argentine Foreign Minister Pablo Quirno said the deal would ""create the conditions"" to boost US investment in Argentina and thanked Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei for his ""conviction"" in bringing about the agreement.

El Salvador's ambassador to Washington said the two ""sister nations"" had ""rebuilt their relations on the basis of trust and self-determination,"" while his Guatemalan counterpart said the agreement ""places us as an even more competitive and more attractive country for investment.""

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed a similar framework with Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira on Thursday.

""The Secretary of State said that they are analyzing the bilateral issues with Brazil with all due attention and time, that they want to resolve them quickly, and that an answer will come very soon, tomorrow or next week,"" Vieira told reporters in Washington.

Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter. but its exports to the US currently face crushing 50% duties imposed by Trump.

U.S. markets had their worst day since Oct. 10. That marks a sharp reversal for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which shed 1.65% to settle at 47,457.22, a day after it closed above 48,000 for the first time. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost 1.66% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.29%.

The slump in stocks can partly be traced to a turnaround in sentiment regarding artificial intelligence. Tech behemoths such as Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle slumped, with the last losing more than one-third in value since it rocketed 36% in September.

Investors, it seems, are growing worried over the high valuations of tech names, as well as the gigantic amount of capital expenditure they are committing to — with some, like Oracle, having to take on debt to fulfil those obligations.

Uncertainty over an interest rate cut in December is also putting a downer on Wall Street. It's a coin toss as to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy then, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That's a huge difference from a month ago, when traders were pricing in a 95.5% chance of a December cut.

Not having October's employment and inflation numbers, and possibly never getting them, means the Fed lacks visibility into the state of the economy — and whether it should try to support the labor market or continue reining in inflation.

After all, flying blind makes it hard to see where you'll land. As of now, that applies both to the Fed and investors trying to navigate the still-hazy ambitions of tech companies.

Stocks pull back on AI sell-off. All major U.S. indexes fell Thursday stateside dragged down by heavyweight technology names. Asia-Pacific markets also retreated Friday. South Korea's Kospi sank more than 3% and investors sold off SoftBank stock for the third straight day.

China's economic slump deepens. The country's fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, shrank 1.7% in the January-to-October period. The last time this measure contracted was in 2020 during the pandemic, according to Wind Information.

A December rate cut doesn't seem so certain. A lack of economic data because of the government shutdown — now ended — is complicating the Fed's decision. Fed official Susan Collins on Wednesday said holding rates will ""likely be appropriate.""

Air India losses to weigh on Singapore Airlines. Singapore's national carrier reported Thursday that its second-quarter earnings plunged 82%. Analysts think profits might remain muted because of persistent losses at Air India, in which SIA has a 25.1% stake.

[PRO] Be wary of stocks with zero revenue. The year-to-date rally in stocks means some could be trading at elevated prices. CNBC Pro found a few names with market caps of at least $1 billion — but haven't generated revenue over the last 12 months.

CEO of Southeast Asia's largest bank says AI adoption already paying off: ‘It's not hope, it's now'

""The proliferation of generative AI has been transformative for us,"" DBS CEO Tan Su Shan told CNBC on the sidelines of Singapore Fintech Week. She adding that the company was experiencing a ""snowballing effect"" of benefits thanks to machine learning. 

Tan expects AI adoption to bring DBS an overall revenue bump of more than 1 billion Singapore dollars (about $768 million) this year, compared to SG$750 million in 2024. That assessment is based on about 370 AI use cases powered by over 1,500 models throughout its business.

U.S. President Donald Trump is once again on the warpath against a major global media company, having threatened the BBC with a $1 billion lawsuit this week.

The British public broadcaster found itself in hot water after airing a documentary in which Trump's Jan. 6 speech in 2021 was edited to make it look like he was explicitly encouraging his supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol.

As concerns over the documentary came to light, the BBC went into crisis mode, with both its director general and head of news resigning. Meanwhile, BBC Chair Samir Shah said the corporation was assessing the ""very serious allegations"" and apologized for an ""error of judgment"" over the edit.

The BBC on Thursday apologized to Trump and agreed not to show the documentary again on any of its platforms. It reportedly rejected the U.S. president's call for compensation, however. Trump told Fox News this week that he has an ""obligation"" to sue the BBC.

Here's what's going on and why it matters:

In October 2024, the BBC aired a Panorama documentary called ""Trump: A Second Chance?"" in which it showed Trump addressing supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.

In the Panorama program, Trump was shown saying, ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol ... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell."" The edit combined two separate parts of his speech, although this was not flagged to viewers, making it look like he had explicitly instructed his supporters to riot in a single statement.

That was not the case as Trump had said, ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,"" and only much later (in fact, around 54 minutes later) he said, ""and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.""

The speech became infamous as Trump supporters descended on the Capitol after the address, with skirmishes breaking out with police and a number of protesters entering the building. At the time, Trump urged those involved in the riots to ""go home now.""

The documentary doesn't appear to have caused a fuss at the time, but the editing process came to light when a memo written by ex-BBC adviser Michael Prescott was leaked to the press in which he criticized editorial standards at the BBC.

The Panorama documentary in the spotlight was not made by the BBC, but by a third-party production company called October Films. Nonetheless, questions have been asked as to why it was reviewed and approved for broadcasting. The documentary is no longer available to view on the BBC iPlayer.

A crisis engulfed the BBC as news of the rogue edit emerged. Director General Tim Davie and Head of News Deborah Turness resigned. But that has not stopped the scandal snowballing with questions centering on the BBC's editorial standards amid allegations of institutional bias.

On Tuesday, the BBC issued a statement in which it said, ""we accept our edit created the impression we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from two different points in the speech.""

""Consequently, this gave the impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action. The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement,"" it said, adding that ""there was no intention to mislead.""

Trump's legal team wrote to the BBC, demanding that it immediately retract what it said were ""false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements"" about the president in the documentary. The letter, which was published in full by Sky News, said the airing of the program had ""caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm.""

It warned that Trump would sue for $1 billion in damages unless the corporation issued a ""full and fair retraction,"" apologized and compensated the president ""for the harm caused.""

The letter, signed by Trump's lawyer Alejandro Brito, said the BBC has until 5 p.m. EST on Friday Nov. 14 to comply with the president's demands, otherwise, ""he will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights ... including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.""

""The BBC is on notice,"" the letter concluded.

In his first comments on the matter, the president told Fox News on Monday that his Jan. 6 speech had been ""butchered"" in the Panorama edit. When asked if he would go ahead with the lawsuit, Trump said, ""Well, I think I have an obligation to do it, because you can't get people, you can't allow people to do that.""

The BBC on Thursday issued a statement on its Corrections and Clarifications page, saying it had reviewed the Panorama documentary following criticism over how Trump's Jan. 6, 2021 speech was edited.

""We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,"" the BBC said.

""The BBC would like to apologise to President Trump for that error of judgement,"" it added.

A BBC spokesperson has said that while the corporation ""sincerely regrets"" the manner in which the documentary clip was edited, they ""strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.""

BBC News has reported that, ""if Trump sues in Florida, he would also need to establish the BBC Panorama documentary was available there."" There appears to be no evidence so far to suggest it has been shown in the U.S.

The British government has defended the corporation, however, with Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy wanting to distinguish between ""editorial failings"" and the BBC's critics who, she said, were "" launching a sustained attack on the institution itself.""

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also commented on the furore on Wednesday, telling lawmakers he believed in a ""strong and independent BBC.""

It's not the first time Trump has pursued legal action against big media organisations, with lawsuits launched against the Wall Street Journal, CNN, CBS, ABC and New York Times in recent years, with some cases settled and others dismissed.

British government bond yields rose sharply on Friday following reports Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is no longer planning to raise income tax rates in the Autumn Budget later this month.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt rose around 12 basis points in early trade, before paring gains to trade at 4.498%. Yields and prices move inversely to one another.

The moves came as investors reacted to a report from the Financial Times of an income tax U-turn. The Treasury was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday morning.

U.K. stocks were also lower. The FTSE 100 index shed over 1% at 8:54 a.m. in London (3:54 a.m. ET), with Lloyds, Natwest, and Barclays banks occupying the bottom of the index, each losing more than 2.8%.

Reeves had spent the past week apparently laying the groundwork for a manifesto-breaking rise in income tax, which split Labour party lawmakers and led to further turmoil in the already embattled party, whose leader Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismal approval ratings. 

A proposed 2p national income increase was to be offset by a 2p reduction in national insurance. There are now expectations, however, that the £30 billion ($39.5 billion) hole in the government's budget will be filled by a patchwork of smaller rises.  

It could be a ""fiscal reckoning"" as a patchwork approach will put pressure on the gilt market, Wren Sterling's investment chief Rory McPherson told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday.  

""Within the U.K., if we have more of the smaller taxes being targeted as part of the programme from Rachel Reeves, I think that's going to put more pressure on the government, more pressure on them to go back to the bond markets and ask for more money, which in turn puts more pressure up on yields,"" McPherson said.

He added that there has been a ""big march down"" in yields but now ""we're pulling away that that."" 

Volatility this year has left long-term borrowing costs hovering at their highest level since the late 1990s, with U.K. debt having the heftiest price tag in the G7. 

McPherson said that the Bank of England will still be able to make an interest rate cut after the budget, if it wants to. Other investors appear to have curbed their optimism, with bets on cuts shedding six basis points compared with Thursday, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The Autumn Budget is expected on Nov. 26.

A leadership shakeup at what was once Europe's most valuable company is likely to be cemented Friday as Novo Nordisk's controlling shareholder tightens it's grip on the weight-loss drugmaker, even as minority shareholders express discontent.

Novo has found itself in an increasingly chaotic situation as of late, with shares plunging and investor confidence waning, as its role as the leading player in the highly lucrative weight-loss space is being called into question.

The maker of diabetes and weight-loss drugs last month announced an Extraordinary General Meeting for Nov. 14 to replace its independent board members, including Chair Helge Lund, after it became impossible to reach an agreement between the views of the current board and the Novo Nordisk foundation board — the company's majority shareholder.

Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), one of the larger minority shareholders, said earlier this week it would abstain from voting at Friday's EGM, indicating discontent. Other shareholders, such as California State Teachers' Retirement System, have also said they'll vote against the proposal. NBIM and CalSTRS both declined to comment further.

Lund will be replaced by company veteran Lars Rebien Sørensen, already chair of the Foundation board. The 71-year-old also served as Novo Nordisk CEO between 2000 and 2016.

The foundation also proposed Cees de Jong to become vice chair and Mikael Dolsten, Britt Meelby Jensen and Stephan Engels to become members.

Early Friday, Novo said Dolsten, formerly head of R&D at Pfizer, had decided to withdraw his candidacy to the board due to personal circumstances. Novo shares were down 1.8% to $312.90 in morning trading.

""It is rare that a company of that scale to make that degree of change that quickly,"" Andrew Pettigrew, Emeritus professor at University of Oxford, and an expert of theories of change, told CNBC.

""It's usually precipitated by some awful crisis, which is throwing them off a cliff, but probably also a period when they were blind to what was going on underneath them. In other words, they were surprised by a sudden change, and it usually takes that to overthrow an existing power group in a company, especially if they've been in power for a long time,"" Pettigrew added.

The current board was ""too slow in recognizing the significance of the market changes in the United States,"" Sørensen told analysts at a call following the announcement, adding that two more members would be announced in due course.

Novo is broadly viewed as having fallen behind U.S. peer Eli Lilly which has rapidly taken market share from Novo, as its rival drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound have shown more pronounced weight loss at the highest dose.

""It's a matter of urgency and scope,"" Sørensen said in October about the proposed changes to the board, however also saying the foundation is ""fully aligned"" behind Novo's current strategy under new CEO Mike Doustdar.

Another rationale for the board cull is that a new configuration would bring in more people with direct experience from a U.S. consumer perspective to help navigate the challenging market. It comes amid increasing competition both from Eli Lilly and so-called compounding pharmacies that make cheaper copycat version of the drugs, and a shift towards direct-to-consumer sales.  

Like for many pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. is Novo's largest market. In the first nine months of 2025, the U.S. market accounted for 56% of total sales, measured in Danish kroner.

Analysts, however, have expressed scepticism that the new board will bring in the intended experience. ""On balance, it might seem the new board actually possesses less rather than more commercial, large pharma expertise,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis said.

Novo shares have fallen 12% since the board shakeup was announced and have lost 58% since the start of this year. Last week, the company reported third-quarter results that missed estimates, and lowered the upper range of its full-year guidance citing slower growth expectations for Ozempic and Wegovy.

It's but one of many dramatic happenings taking place at the Danish pharma giant lately.

""There have been so many moves this year that show Novo as a conflicted company,"" noted Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. ""With such a new direct-to-patient market emerging as a critical piece of future obesity drug sales growth, and compounders remaining a real competitor in the market, it's not hard to imagine that the boards and management might not have the same vision for how Novo should respond,"" she added.

Over the weekend, Novo pulled out from a dramatic bidding war against U.S. giant Pfizer over an experimental weight-loss drug by clinical-stage biotech Metsera, stepping away from a deal analysts have described as unusual.

The board changes come just months after Novo appointed Doustdar as chief executive, booting former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, in part blaming him for the current trajectory of the company and its shares. Doustdar has since announced a reorganisation, including laying off over 10% of employees globally.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) gained a powerful boost in Europe as Luxembourg's finance minister openly backed the asset for long-term sovereign allocation, while the Czech National Bank initiated its first digital-asset pilot.



The finance minister said Luxembourg's sovereign wealth fund already holds a 1% allocation to Bitcoin and stressed the position is a completed, long-term investment.

He noted the fund could have chosen any crypto asset but opted only for Bitcoin, repeating Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) Founder Michael Saylor's line that ""there is no second best.""

Don't Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

The minister added that Bitcoin comes up frequently in conversations with global financial institutions and said other countries are preparing to move in the same direction.

He described Luxembourg as ""in it for the long haul"" and emphasized that the decision was not designed to attract attention.

According to the minister, digital assets now sit on the agenda of every major financial meeting he attends, reflecting a structural shift in how governments evaluate future reserve plans and payment systems.



In a separate development, the Czech National Bank purchased digital assets for the first time, creating a $1 million test portfolio.

The basket includes Bitcoin, a USD stablecoin, and a tokenized deposit designed to evaluate blockchain-based settlement systems.

Governor Aleš Michl said the project aims to give the bank ""practical experience with holding and managing digital assets.""

He emphasized that the portfolio is separate from official reserves and will not affect monetary operations or foreign exchange interventions.

Michl also explained that the CNB wants to ""test decentralized Bitcoin from the central bank's perspective"" and assess how such assets could diversify reserves.

The initiative, approved on October 30, also launched the CNB Lab innovation hub, focused on blockchain, tokenization, and AI-driven financial tools.

Bitcoin's inclusion in both a sovereign wealth fund and a central bank pilot signals a structural shift in Europe's monetary mindset.

Traders say the dual announcements may accelerate similar moves by smaller EU states exploring diversification away from traditional reserves.

Luxembourg's proactive tone contrasts with the European Central Bank's cautious stance, highlighting growing regional divergence.

The geopolitical race for Bitcoin leadership is accelerating.

Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen

Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) trade in red on Friday after correcting more than 5%, 10% and 2%, respectively, so far this week. BTC has slipped below the $100,000 key level, while ETH and XRP have faced rejection at their resistance levels, signaling that bears remain firmly in control and that a deeper correction may be underway.

Bitcoin price faced rejection at the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement level at $106,453 (drawn from the April 7 low of $74,508 to the all-time high of $126,299 set on October 6) on Monday and declined nearly 6% by Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, BTC is trading down around $99,300.

If BTC continues its correction and closes below the daily support at $97,460, it could extend the decline toward the key psychological level at $95,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 35, below its neutral level of 50, indicating strong bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence also showed a bearish crossover, signaling a sell and further supporting the bearish view.

On the other hand, if BTC recovers, it could extend the recovery toward the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement at $106,453.

Ethereum price faced rejection at the previous broken trendline around $3,592 on Monday and declined by nearly 10% over the next three days. At the time of writing on Friday, ETH hovers at around $3,200.

If ETH continues its pullback and closes below the $3,170 support level, it could extend the decline toward the daily support at $3,017.

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum's RSI and MACD indicate bearish momentum gaining traction, signaling a deeper correction ahead.

However, if ETH recovers, it could extend the recovery toward the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,592.

XRP price surged 6.75% on Monday, retesting the 50-day EMA at $2.53. However, it surrendered most of those gains on Tuesday after failing to break through that same resistance level. XRP again faced rejection from the 50-day EMA at $2.53 on Thursday and declined 2.74%, closing below the daily support at $2.35. At the time of writing on Friday, XRP trades down at around $2.30.

If XRP continues its correction, it could extend the decline toward the next daily support at $1.96.

Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP's RSI signals bearish momentum, while the MACD indicates indecision among traders.

On the other hand, if XRP recovers, it could extend the recovery toward the 50-day EMA at $2.53.

The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains.

Market capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset's current market value. 

Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency.

Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.

From 2025 to 2030, the market is projected to grow from USD 1.1 billion to USD 4.7 billion, a rise of USD 3.6 billion. This period will see increased investment in virtual worlds, particularly in gaming and metaverse real estate, as companies and individuals look to capitalize on emerging digital property markets. As the concept of virtual land becomes more mainstream, more platforms will emerge, offering a wider variety of assets and experiences to users, which will drive significant growth during this phase.

Between 2030 and 2035, the market is expected to expand from USD 4.7 billion to USD 20.9 billion, adding USD 16.2 billion. This rapid growth will be propelled by the mass adoption of virtual environments for business, entertainment, and social interaction. As virtual land becomes an integral part of the digital economy, its value will rise exponentially. Increased interest from institutional investors, coupled with advancements in AR/VR technologies, will further fuel the demand for virtual real estate, ensuring that the market will continue to grow at a remarkable pace through 2035.

The virtual land NFT market is growing rapidly due to the increasing adoption of the metaverse and virtual worlds where users can buy, sell, and develop NFT-based virtual land. As the metaverse continues to expand, virtual real estate has become an attractive investment class, with buyers seeking ownership of exclusive digital assets. The rise in gaming, digital art, and entertainment has also contributed to the growth, as virtual land is essential for creating immersive experiences.

Additionally, blockchain technology ensures secure ownership of digital assets, which boosts investor confidence. The demand for NFTs in virtual environments is growing as more platforms offer virtual goods, and the growing interest from both retail investors and institutional players is accelerating market expansion.

Moreover, virtual land can generate revenue through leasing, advertising, and hosting events, making it a profitable asset in the digital economy. As the NFT market continues to mature, and with an increasing number of metaverse platforms emerging, the growth of the virtual land NFT market is expected to continue, as users seek to stake their claim in these digital worlds.

The virtual land NFT market is primarily divided into classification and application. By classification, the market includes metaverse & virtual goods, digital art & collectibles, games & virtual worlds, music & entertainment, sports & fan economy, social & identity authentication, and practical NFT. The metaverse & virtual goods segment holds the largest share, accounting for 30% of the market. By application, the market is split between the primary market and the secondary market, with the primary market representing the largest share at 60%. Regions such as China, India, and Germany lead the charge in terms of NFT adoption and virtual land investments.



The metaverse & virtual goods segment is the dominant segment in the virtual land NFT market, holding approximately 30% of the market share. The growing interest in the metaverse and virtual reality platforms has driven a significant demand for NFT-based virtual land in virtual worlds like Decentraland, The Sandbox, and Somnium Space. These platforms allow users to buy, sell, and develop virtual real estate, making them attractive to investors, developers, and digital entrepreneurs looking to stake their claim in the emerging digital economy. The concept of virtual land as digital assets is expanding, with creators building interactive experiences, virtual stores, and entertainment venues, further driving demand. The virtual land in the metaverse provides new opportunities for revenue generation, including virtual businesses, advertising, and hosting events. As more people engage with the metaverse, the demand for NFTs representing virtual land and virtual assets is expected to grow, solidifying the segment's position as the market leader.



The primary market leads the virtual land NFT market, accounting for 60% of the market share. This segment involves the initial sale of virtual land NFTs directly from metaverse platforms to end consumers. The appeal of purchasing virtual land at initial sale prices has been growing as more users and investors see the potential for long-term value appreciation. Primary market sales are typically where investors first acquire digital land in NFT marketplaces such as Earth 2 and The Sandbox. The primary market allows early investors to acquire virtual land before it's resold at a potentially higher price on the secondary market, creating opportunities for speculation and value growth. Additionally, virtual land purchased in the primary market can be developed into digital experiences or sold for profit, driving significant demand in the primary market. As the metaverse continues to evolve and grow, the primary market will remain a crucial entry point for virtual land NFT investments, fueling its market dominance.

The virtual land NFT market is growing due to increasing interest in the metaverse and virtual real estate. Platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox are seeing significant demand for virtual land, driven by the ability to monetize digital assets through NFTs.

Additionally, institutional investment in NFT platforms and the growing popularity of digital art has expanded the market. As the metaverse continues to develop and gain mainstream acceptance, virtual land NFTs are expected to become increasingly valuable as part of the broader digital economy.

What are the key restraints in the virtual land NFT market?

Despite strong growth, the virtual land NFT market faces several challenges. Price volatility in the NFT market can lead to uncertainty for both investors and platform developers, making it difficult to predict the value of virtual land over time. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty surrounding NFTs and digital assets may deter potential investors due to concerns about taxation, intellectual property rights, and market regulation. The environmental impact of blockchain networks, particularly those using proof-of-work systems, has raised concerns about the sustainability of NFT platforms. These challenges could hinder broader adoption and limit market growth.

Crypto market weakens as liquidity tightens and major tokens extend losses across the board.

Bitcoin's latest drop reflects growing caution in digital assets as liquidity pressures build

Bitcoin's price fell to around $96,800 (roughly Rs. 85.8 lakh) on Friday as the crypto market came under renewed selling pressure amidst a sharp liquidity squeeze and broad risk-off sentiment. The drop below the key $100,000 level has unsettled traders, with leveraged unwinds, thin market participation, and weak institutional flows weighing heavily on price action. Ethereum (ETH) dropped more than 10 percent over the past 24 hours to trade near $3,100 (roughly Rs. 2.80 lakh). According to the Gadgets 360 price tracker, Bitcoin is priced around Rs. 71 lakh in India, while Ethereum trades at roughly Rs. 2.3 lakh.

Major altcoins posted another day of heavy declines as traders continued to unwind risk positions. Solana (SOL) fell 9.4 percent to $141.83 (roughly Rs. 12,586), XRP declined 8.4 percent to $2.29 (roughly Rs. 203), and Binance Coin (BNB) dropped 5.8 percent to $912.99 (roughly Rs. 81,019). Dogecoin (DOGE) also slipped 7.4 percent to $0.1630 (roughly Rs. 14.47).

Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst at Delta Exchange, said the global shift toward risk-off sentiment is accelerating volatility across assets. “Bitcoin on-chain patterns point to measured profit-taking by long-term players, behavior that typically appears in the later stages of an expansionary phase. Technically, BTC remains constrained beneath major moving averages, with immediate resistance around $101,500–$103,200 (roughly Rs. 90 lakh–Rs. 91.5 lakh) and key support near $98,500 (roughly Rs. 87.4 lakh).”

Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder and CEO of Pi42, said Bitcoin's breakdown reflects deeper structural stress in the market rather than a routine correction. “Crypto market is under renewed pressure as Bitcoin breaks below the psychological threshold of $100,000 (roughly Rs. 88.7 lakh), trading near $96,000 (roughly Rs. 85.1 lakh) amidst a sharp liquidity squeeze and broad risk-off sentiment [...] Institutional and retail flows remain muted, making near-term price action highly vulnerable unless liquidity meaningfully returns. As always, investors should do their own research and assess risks carefully before investing.”

The CoinSwitch Markets Desk noted that Bitcoin is consolidating within a narrow but fragile band. “While the U.S. government has officially ended the shutdown, the restart of federal operations may take time, meaning key economic indicators could still face delays, keeping investors cautious [...] However, sentiment may improve in the coming weeks as markets look ahead to the Federal Reserve's expected QE in December, which could restore liquidity and revive risk appetite.”

Market sentiment remains extremely cautious as traders assess whether support at $96,800 (roughly Rs. 85.9 lakh) can hold in the coming sessions. Bitcoin's ability to reclaim the $100,000 (roughly Rs. 88.74 lakh) mark will depend heavily on fresh liquidity flows, whale activity, and clearer macro signals in the days ahead.

This is a technical analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

It's unusual to see ether ETH$3,160.31, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, showing relative strength against market leader bitcoin on a day when the market is under pressure.

Today is exactly that rare instance. While bitcoin BTC$96,916.40 has slipped over 2% on the day to around $97,200, ether remains largely steady near $3,230, per data source CoinDesk. This divergence has lifted the ether-to-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio by more than 2%, signaling ether's outperformance.

With that in mind, here are three key charts worth keeping an eye on.

The Binance-listed ratio is currently confined within a counter-trend downward channel, reflecting a pause following the sharp rally observed between May and August. The slope of this channel is relatively gentle, suggesting the price action is more of a consolidation phase rather than a full-fledged downtrend.

So, a breakout from this channel would confirm a renewed investor bias in favor of ether over bitcoin, suggesting further upside potential for the ETH/BTC ratio. Interestingly, the ratio's MACD histogram appears poised to cross above zero, signaling a potential bullish shift in momentum.

Like the ether-bitcoin ratio, ether's dollar-denominated price is also moving in a counter-trend downward channel, with signs of seller exhaustion near $3,000, as evident from the long tails attached to the recent daily candles.

This suggests a potential for price bounce, although a clean breakout from the channel is needed to confirm a broader bullish outlook.

A potential rally in ether, widely regarded as the leading altcoin, could spark rallies in other major tokens, particularly in the ratio between payments-focused XRP and bitcoin.

The ratio continues to coil in a four-year range, building momentum for a significant breakout. Should ether surge, this could act as a catalyst for a bullish resolution in the XRP/BTC ratio, potentially triggering notable gains.

Although the flu season seems off to a quiet start in the US, warnings from abroad suggest that a new strain may yet shake up the US healthcare system.

New data reported in the British Medical Journal showed a significant increase in flu rates in the UK, largely among young adults and school-aged children. The cases are dominated by a new H3N2 strain, which mutated several times over the summer, increasing in severity, according to experts.

Sometimes a strain develops that, while not entirely new, is new enough to spread more efficiently because it is not well matched to current community immunity from previous infections and vaccinations, according to Antonio Ho, MD, clinical senior lecturer and consultant in infectious diseases at the University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland.

“The current circulating influenza A (H3N2) virus acquired seven new mutations over the summer, which means the virus is quite different to the A (H3N2) strain included in this year's vaccine,” Ho said in a media statement.

The emergence of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) variants was reported in the Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada.

During the southern hemisphere's 2025 influenza season, a variant A (H3N2) virus emerged that did not match well with the current vaccine, and this variant, now renamed subclade K, is projected to dominate the northern hemisphere's 2025-2026 season, the researchers wrote. In October, Japan declared a flu epidemic, as reported in the journal Nature, but the proportion of cases caused by the subclade K variant and the impact on other countries remains unclear.

Between the recent government shutdown and ongoing changes in the makeup of the CDC, up-to-date information on flu activity on the national level is lacking; the most recent flu activity from the CDC's website indicates low levels as of the last week in September.

“National data on influenza and pertussis are delayed, though organizations that work to collate data from local and state resources are reporting flu activity is beginning in the South,” said Lori Handy, MD, MSCE, associate director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, in an interview.

Even a mismatched vaccine has protective benefits, Handy said. “With flu season about to begin, those who are not yet vaccinated should get vaccinated as soon as possible,” she added. “Many people may still get sick, but vaccination will keep them out of the emergency department and hospital,” Handy emphasized.

Handy disclosed no financial conflicts of interest.

Postmarket surveillance data revealed that enfortumab vedotin (EV) skin toxicity is associated with high hospitalization and mortality rates, especially with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN); but use of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors or systemic corticosteroids did not augment this risk.

“Our study emphasizes the importance of correctly identifying culprit medications and the potential role of corticosteroids,” the authors wrote. “Clinicians,” they added “should maintain a high index of suspicion for EV-induced SJS/TEN and report cases to improve pharmacovigilance and guide management strategies.”

The study was led by Mackenzie M. Kilton, University of Nebraska College of Medicine, Omaha, Nebraska, and was published online on November 1 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

Thomas Tuchel has embraced the idea of England's substitutes being nicknamed the ""bomb squad"" after powerful performances off the bench helped the Three Lions secure a 2-0 victory over Serbia at Wembley. With Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Eberechi Eze all making an impact despite not being in the starting lineup, the England boss insisted his team is built on unity rather than star names.

England continued their flawless World Cup qualifying run with a controlled 2-0 win over Serbia, securing another clean sheet in what has become one of the most dominant campaigns in the nation's history. Bukayo Saka opened the scoring with a superb volley, but it was the introduction of Bellingham, Foden and Eze that truly changed the dynamic of the match. Their added energy and invention helped England regain control in the second half before the latter sealed the victory with a brilliant late strike.

The impact off the bench reflected Tuchel's broader approach to squad harmony, particularly in a team packed with elite club-level starters competing for limited roles. With England operating at a high tempo and against opponents determined to frustrate, Tuchel's substitutions injected the speed, pressing intensity and technical sharpness needed to break Serbia down for the second time on the night.

The result extended England's record to seven wins from seven, with 20 goals scored and none conceded, establishing them as the only European side in history to reach a World Cup with a 100% winning and clean-sheet qualifying record this deep into a campaign. It also demonstrated the flexibility and adaptability Tuchel has demanded since taking charge in January, with every squad member expected to remain mentally ready despite fierce positional competition.

Speaking after the win, Tuchel was asked about the South African rugby team's ""bomb squad"" nickname for their substitutes and whether England might adopt something similar. He admitted he approved of the idea, saying: ""I have not named it in a different way but I kind of like it. I like bomb squad a bit more than finisher.""

Tuchel explained the tactical reasoning behind this mindset, emphasising that modern football requires a full squad to win at the highest level. He said: ""That's the nature of this game. The possibility that we go to Albania (on Sunday) and start with 11 and finish with the same 11 goes to zero, and even more so in a tournament. This is not about building a starting 11, it's about building a team.""

He then praised the attitude within the England camp, highlighting the need for humility and togetherness. Tuchel added: ""They're all big players in their club, they're all used to playing, they're all disappointed. Everyone. This is normal. But they buy into this idea of building a team and this is what we want, this is what we need. There is no other way around it.

""Only if we're a strong group who can put the ego behind (them), who can put the disappointment behind, and then contribute and give the coach a headache what to do in the next match, that's the only way. I like it because it's natural for this team. The atmosphere after the matches, during the matches is the right energy and I think everyone is treating everyone with respect. The ones on the pitch know that they can rely on everyone who comes from the bench to finish the game. You could see the impact today, and it has to stay like this. We just need everybody fully involved, especially mentally to accept the decision of the match day and then to continue.""

The victory over Serbia was not only another clean sheet but also a continuation of a historic defensive run under Tuchel, with England yet to concede in any qualifier. Jordan Pickford has now recorded ten straight competitive clean sheets, supported by a defensive unit that has embraced Tuchel's structured pressing and high-possession philosophy. Ezri Konsa, John Stones and Declan Rice were among those producing key interventions during Serbia's most threatening moments.

The game also marked Bellingham's first England appearance since June, and Tuchel eased him back into action with a second-half cameo rather than a start. The Real Madrid star combined sharply with Reece James and Foden, showing his usual drive from midfield while also helping England sustain pressure in the final third. His return adds another layer of complexity to England's midfield competition.

Foden, meanwhile, was deployed as a false nine – a tactical switch Tuchel had planned months in advance – and his smart positioning created the space for Eze's late finish. The Manchester City star operated between Serbia's defensive lines, linking play and drifting wide to overload key areas on the right alongside Saka and James.

England now travel to Albania in their final World Cup qualifier, aiming to complete a perfect campaign while giving Tuchel another opportunity to experiment ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The manager may continue rotating his squad, with several players pushing for more minutes and others, including Bellingham, building match sharpness after recent fitness concerns.

Tuchel will also be evaluating how best to structure his attack as the team approaches next summer's tournament, particularly with competition intensifying across midfield and the front line. Players such as Eze, Foden, Palmer and Bellingham are all vying for advanced positions, and Tuchel's willingness to use them flexibly could become a decisive advantage. England's depth remains one of the strongest in international football, and the manager has reiterated the importance of harnessing that strength.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

England moved within touching distance of unprecedented World Cup qualifying history after a composed 2-0 victory over Serbia at Wembley maintained their flawless defensive record. With Thomas Tuchel's side yet to concede in the campaign, a clean sheet against Albania would make them the first European nation ever to complete an eight-game qualifying cycle without letting in a single goal.

England cruised to another victory as they defeated Serbia 2-0 at Wembley on Thursday, stretching their perfect record in the 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign. Bukayo Saka opened the scoring on the half-hour mark with a crisp volley, before Eberechi Eze came off the bench to curl home a superb late finish and seal a seventh straight win.

The match followed a familiar pattern in this qualifying cycle, with England asserting dominance early and forcing Serbia to defend deep for long spells. Harry Kane's movement, Saka's incisiveness and Declan Rice's control ensured Serbia were rarely able to build sustained attacks, while England's defence remained largely untroubled aside from isolated counterattacks.

England's clean sheet was also significant, extending their run to seven games without conceding, already a rare feat in UEFA World Cup qualifying. Serbia created a handful of half-chances but were kept at bay through Jordan Pickford's alert positioning and the strong recovery defending of Ezri Konsa and John Stones. With the win, England closed in on a piece of history never before achieved in a European qualifying group of eight matches.

The victory places England on the brink of an unprecedented defensive milestone, one that would underline the transformative impact Tuchel has had since taking charge. Should the Three Lions avoid conceding in their final qualifier against Albania, they would become the first European nation ever to complete an eight-game World Cup qualifying campaign without letting in a goal. It would surpass even the great England side of 1990, which finished a six-game campaign without conceding.

Beyond the clean sheet streak, England's qualifying journey has showcased the depth and discipline required to thrive under Tuchel's demanding standards. Pickford has now kept ten consecutive competitive clean sheets, supported by a defensive line that has remained calm under pressure and excelled at denying opponents high-value opportunities. Stones, Konsa and Rice have all played crucial roles in sustaining England's impeccable defensive record.

This campaign has also highlighted Tuchel's insistence on competition for places, with no player guaranteed a starting role regardless of club form or reputation. Tuchel has repeatedly stressed that his focus is on building collective unity, and England's ability to rotate without losing fluidity underscores how deeply the squad has bought into his approach.

England now travel to Tirana for their final World Cup qualifier to take on Albania, where the chance to make history may serve as a major motivational factor despite the game being a dead rubber. Top spot in the group is already secured and Albania are locked into second place.

Should England secure the clean sheet, they will step into the 2026 World Cup not only as qualifying history-makers but also as one of the tournament's most tactically complete and defensively formidable sides.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

World Cup

India supporters cheer their team during a game against Qatar (Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto via Getty Images)

The men's World Cup is bigger than ever.

Next summer's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada will feature 48 nations, up from the previous 32-team format.

Last month, Cape Verde — whose 525,000 inhabitants make it the second-smallest country by population ever to qualify — joined Jordan and Uzbekistan as first-time participants.

Despite the expanded tournament doubling the number of participating nations from the U.S.-held edition in 1994, seven (eight if Nigeria fail to qualify) of the 10 most populous nations have not qualified.

Here, The Athletic examines why many of the most populous nations will not be represented at the world's premier sporting event.

Editor's note: Population figures are taken from Worldometer at date of publication. 

India population: 1,463,865,525

Pakistan population: 255,219,554

Bangladesh population: 175,686,899

Previous total World Cup appearances: 0

India is the world's most populous nation and the three countries on the Indian subcontinent — including Pakistan and Bangladesh — are all in the world's top eight, comprising 23 per cent of the global population.

None of the three nations have participated in a World Cup finals. In 1950, India qualified by default, but opted not to take part after reported disagreements over team selection, and insufficient practice time.

That was the fourth edition of the World Cup and came just three years after India and Pakistan (from which Bangladesh gained independence in 1971) gained independence and were partitioned into separate states.

India have not come close to qualifying for a World Cup since. In this campaign, they were eliminated in the second round of Asian qualifying, winning one of six group games from a group in which Qatar and Kuwait advanced.

India's best football moment came in 1964, when they were runners-up to Israel (then a member of the Asian Football Confederation) in a four-team edition of the Asian Cup.

Pakistan have never qualified for any major tournament, while Bangladesh lost all four of their matches in their sole appearance at the Asian Cup in 1980.

The three nations can be grouped together geographically, but also for the reasons behind their relative underperformance.

Alongside Afghanistan to the north and Sri Lanka to the south, the area comprises almost half of the world's Test-playing cricket nations. Cricket is the national sport due to its colonial legacy from British rule and is a major strand of national identity.

The prevalence of cricket, in part, helps explain the lack of infrastructure and funding for football — which may not hold national sport status but remains extremely popular, as evidenced by the passionate local support for Argentina and Brazil at major tournaments.

No club team from the Indian subcontinent has ever reached the final of the AFC Champions League, or its predecessor competition, the Asian Club Championship.

Domestic football is not thriving. At the time of writing, the top-flight Indian Super League remains on hold as India's federation, the AIFF, is struggling to sell the competition's commercial rights. As per a November 8 report from Reuters, a number of its clubs have suspended first-team activities as a result, including champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant.

Pakistan, meanwhile, remains the world's largest country without a national football league. The Pakistan Premier League has remained inactive since the 2018–19 season.

Population: 1,416,096,094

Previous World Cup appearances: 1

Unlike the Indian subcontinent, China's continued struggles in men's football are complex.

They have featured just once at the World Cup, in the 2002 edition held in neighbouring Japan and South Korea, losing all three matches without scoring a goal.

In the mid-2010s, China's president, Xi Jinping, pledged to solve the nation's underperformance in the sport and declared an ambition to turn China into a “football powerhouse”.

Huge corporations such as Suning (retail) and Evergrande (real estate) were urged to bankroll the Chinese Super League (CSL). In return, they would gain greater global exposure for their brands and, significantly, presidential approval.

A series of big-money transfers followed, but the project proved unsustainable. Tight financial regulations were introduced, with non-Chinese player signings heavily taxed. The Chinese FA announced a series of measures to address “irrational investments by clubs, high-figure transfer fees and salaries paid to domestic and international athletes and other issues”.



President Xi, who assumed the position in 2013, stated his aims for China to qualify for a World Cup, host a World Cup and, ultimately, win a World Cup. He instructed the installation of 70,000 new pitches and 20,000 training centres across the country by 2020. The sport became compulsory in schools for children aged six and above.

Football is hugely popular there. The average attendance in the CSL is 25,000, with each matchday averaging 200,000 in the top division. However, the international team continue to struggle. China are ranked 93rd in FIFA's world rankings and 13th in Asia. President Xi's ambitions have not yet been realised.

China have, however, been regulars at the Women's World Cup. Since hosting its inaugural edition in 1991, they have reached eight of its nine tournaments and lost the final on penalties to the USWNT in 1999.

Population: 285,721,236

Previous World Cup appearances: 1 (Dutch East Indies)

Football is Indonesia's No 1 sport, but their only World Cup appearance came in 1938 when they were still known by their colonial name as Dutch East Indies. Independence followed seven years later.

The world's fourth most populous nation has struggled to produce top-level footballers due to an absence of infrastructure, but they have recently begun leaning on the nation's diaspora, predominantly based in the Netherlands, to improve their fortunes.

According to the Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection, over 2.2million Indonesian citizens officially live abroad and around 1.7m are in the Netherlands, which ruled the nation for over three centuries.

Indonesia's 23-man squad for the October international break included 15 players born in the Netherlands, one in Belgium, one in Spain and one in Finland — Eliano Reijnders, brother of Netherlands international and Manchester City player Tijjani.

Utilising their diaspora has improved Indonesia's results; reaching the knockout stage of the Asian Cup in 2023 and the fourth round of World Cup 2026 qualifying, before losing by one-goal margins to Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Nine months of that campaign was overseen by former Netherlands international Patrick Kluivert, who has subsequently left his position.

Indonesia have not yet reached the World Cup as an independent nation, but not doing so is now regarded as below par.

Russia's national and domestic teams have been suspended from FIFA and UEFA competitions since the country's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Unlike all other nations on this list, there is a strong football culture and tradition there. As an independent nation, Russia hosted and reached the quarter-final stage of the 2018 World Cup. A decade earlier, they advanced to the semi-finals of the European Championship — a tournament the Soviet Union won once (the inaugural tournament in 1960), as well as reaching three other finals.

Moscow clubs CSKA, Spartak and Lokomotiv, along with Zenit Saint Petersburg, had featured prominently in European club competitions prior to the ban.

In April this year, FIFA president Gianni Infantino spoke of his hope that Russia can be introduced back into the football fold “soon”. Any return, however, is dependent on the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

In September 2023, UEFA announced plans to allow Russian under-17 teams to compete in its competitions, but the proposals were later withdrawn.

Africa's second most populous nation, behind Nigeria, Ethiopia were an early powerhouse in the continent's football scene.

As one of the few independent African states in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, Ethiopia were a key player in early editions of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON); a tournament they won in 1962 with two more top-four places following that decade.

However, they have not progressed beyond the competition's group stage since and have only qualified for two of the past 22 tournaments.

This pattern is replicated at club level. Cotton Factory Club, who were dissolved in 2000, and Saint George SC, both reached the semi-finals of the African Cup of Champions Clubs in the 1960s. No Ethiopian club side has progressed as far into continental competition since.

Despite football's popularity, the absence of infrastructure, the lack of investment in youth football and external influences have seen the national team struggle. They finished fifth in their six-team qualification group for the 2026 World Cup with nine points from 10 matches.

The Philippines' most popular sports are basketball and boxing, inherited from American rule. As a result, football has not enjoyed the same funding as in other Asian nations and the Philippines have struggled to develop top-level players.

Having dropped outside the top 200 in the FIFA rankings in the early 2000s, the Philippine Football Federation (PFF) launched a fresh drive to bring in more foreign-born talent. This meant multiple English-born players representing the country; Chad Gould, who played his youth career at Bournemouth and Southampton, and the Greatwich brothers — Chris, Phil and Simon — alongside two brothers who had the greatest impact: Phil and James Younghusband.

The 2010s saw an upturn in results. The Philippines attained their highest FIFA ranking of 111, recorded their first win in World Cup qualifying and reached the group stage of the Asian Cup for the first time, in 2019.

The Philippines are currently ranked 141st by FIFA and they were eliminated in the second round of 2026 World Cup qualifying, picking up just one point from six matches.

They did qualify for their first Women's World Cup in 2023, defeating co-hosts New Zealand 1-0.

Vietnam was impacted by conflict for much of the latter half of the 20th century, which unsurprisingly limited its potential for sporting success. It was not until the 1990s that a professional structure could be put in place.

Despite limited resources compared to continental rivals, Vietnamese teams have provided AFC Champions League Two semi-finalists in 2009 and 2019. The AFC Champions League Elite has, inevitably, provided a tougher challenge, with Vietnam rarely having a representative beyond the group stages.

Vietnamese football has economic limitations compared to Asian rivals, yet the population's passion for the sport is well-established. A 2022 survey by Nielsen found that 75 per cent of Vietnam were football fans, a higher percentage than any other Asian nation.

Ranked 111th by FIFA, there is clearly potential to break into the top 100 and be in contention for future World Cup appearances. They were eliminated in the second round of Asian qualifying for 2026, with two wins from six group games proving insufficient to advance.

As with the Philippines, Vietnam reached the 2023 Women's World Cup for the first time. Despite losing all three group games, the success demonstrated the nation's potential to compete at the top level.

Luis Rubiales has had eggs thrown at him during the launch of his book, Matar a Rubiales (Kill Rubiales). (Getty Images: Europa Press/Francisco Guerra)

The former president of Spain's national football federation has had eggs thrown at him during a book launch.

Rubiales made international headlines after he kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso at the conclusion of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final in Sydney.

Rubiales was charged with sexual assault and was convicted by Spain's High Court in February this year.

The former president of Spain's national football federation, who made headlines after his behaviour following the final of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, has had eggs thrown at him during the launch of his book.

A Foreign Correspondent investigation has detailed the decades of sexism and misogyny leading up to the infamous World Cup kiss.

Luis Rubiales resigned as president of the RFEF (Royal Spanish Football Federation) after he kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso, who was collecting her winner's medal following Spain's 1-0 win over England in the final at Sydney's Stadium Australia.

Rubiales was charged with sexual assault and was convicted by Spain's High Court in February this year.

The 48-year-old has written a book called Matar a Rubiales (Kill Rubiales), which he says, according to ESPN, is ""for those who want to know the reality"".

During a book launch event on Thursday (local time) in Madrid, someone from the audience threw eggs at Rubiales.

Footage of the incident shows Rubiales attempting to confront the egg thrower, with security keeping the pair separated.

""I didn't know what he had in his hands,"" Rubiales told Radio Marca.

""I thought he might have a gun … I wasn't thinking about myself.""

Rubiales was fined 10,800 euros ($19,200) following his conviction in February, but was acquitted on a charge of coercion.

A Spanish court rejected Rubiales's appeal of his conviction in June.

Italy national team coach Gennaro Gattuso has refused to accept criticism after his team left it late to win their World Cup qualifying match against Moldova. The World Cup winning former midfielder insists his side dominated the game despite what the scoreline suggested as he hit out at the fans for the reaction at the full-time whistle.

Italy controlled the first half of the World Cup qualifying game with an impressive 82 percent possession and created multiple chances, but poor finishing kept the scoreline unchanged. The second half followed a similar pattern, with Moldova frustrating Italy's attempts to break the deadlock. This led to the introduction of Mateo Retegui and young striker Pio Esposito to inject energy into the attack. The changes paid off, as goals from Gianluca Mancini and Esposito late in the game finally secured a hard-earned victory for Italy.

Gattuso commented on the rotation, acknowledging that putting 11 new players on the pitch is always a challenge when he said: “It's fine, putting 11 new players out from the start is difficult.” 

He admitted he was concerned that so many changes could disrupt the balance of the squad and that Italy could even lose, but he praised his players for their performance, saying: “I felt within myself we could even lose today with so many changes, but I tip my hat to them, they did better than I expected.”

However, with the match still at 0-0 late on, Italy's small group of travelling fans protested, chanting that the players should 'go to work'. Gattuso disagreed with their criticism, insisting that the team had performed well.

""The protests from the fans are a disgrace, I'm sorry for what I heard today,"" he said. ""This isn't the time to tell the players to go to work: we need to stay united, because the team is struggling on the pitch, and hearing 500 fans protesting away from home is something I don't accept.

""I'm very happy with the lads. We've brought in a whole new team, and we knew we'd struggle. I'm satisfied, but I'm angry about what I've heard in the last 30 minutes. Having 500 fans telling you to go work makes me feel bad. I'm disappointed about this. I don't know where it comes from, but in Italy's history it's the first time we've won six games. I'm convinced we'll get what we need to get because these lads are strong. Winning seven games boosts self-esteem.""

Norway, Italy's rivals for the top spot in the group, beat Moldova 11-1 in September, but Gattuso discouraged any comparisons with Italy's result, saying: “If you were expecting an 11-1like Moldova had against Norway, then that is not my problem. There are no easy matches.""

Italy can still technically qualify for the World Cup as Group I winners. They are three points behind Norway - their opponents in the next and final match of the round - but it would take a massive win to overcome the deficit in goal difference. Instead, a place in the play-offs appears certain for the Azzurri, which will ramp up the pressure on the recently-appointed Gattuso.

The national team have not appeared in a World Cup since 2014, having failed to qualify in both 2018 and 2022 after painful play off defeats to Sweden and North Macedonia. The upcoming play offs now represent another high stakes hurdle in their bid to return to football's biggest stage.

Gattuso was critical of the qualification rules, arguing that despite being the second-best team in the table with a plus twelve goal difference, Italy should not have to go through another round to qualify. “In my day, the top team in each group would go through, plus the best runners up,” He said. “We have 18 points, we have won six games, and still we have to go into another two matches to qualify. It does not seem right.”

Italy will host Norway on Sunday at the San Siro while also keeping an eye on the teams they could face in the play offs next March, which will decide their qualification for the 2026 World Cup. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Disney CEO Bob Iger hinted at ""productive conversations"" with unnamed AI companies that would protect IP but add new features to the studio's flagship streaming service.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	Don't want to wait until 2027 for Frozen 3? Soon, you may be able to make your own.


	On the company's fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 earnings conference call, Disney CEO Bob Iger said Disney+ is “in the midst of rolling out the biggest and the most significant changes — from a product perspective, from a technology perspective — since we launched the service in 2019.”




	Changes will include games — or at least “a number of game-like features” — on Disney+ through its agreement with Epic Games, he said. (The Epic Games deal is actually more about Disney IP being used on Epic's platform.) And there will also be gen-AI short-form user-generated content (UGC) on Disney+ in the future.

	“The other thing that we're really excited about, that AI is going to give us the ability to do, is to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content and to consume user generated content — mostly short-form — from others,” Iger continued.


	It sounds a bit like Disney plans to encroach on Open AI Sora's territory. (Or maybe it will just use Sora 2…)


	A bit later in the call, Iger said that Disney had “productive conversations” with unnamed AI companies, and that he hoped the studio giant could reach an agreement that would also “reflect our need to protect the IP.”

	











	You can't let Lilo & Stitch get into the wrong hands.


The Hollywood Reporter reached out to Disney to request more information on its Disney+ gen-AI UGC plans, but we did not immediately receive a response.


	Read Disney's Q4 results here. The company's streaming profits grew as Disney+ alone added 3.8 million subscribers. Disney also announced it planned to invest $1 billion more in content in 2026 than it did in 2025, and provided (a bit of) an update on its ongoing carriage fight with YouTube TV.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin isn't useful for much of anything, and that likely won't change.

Cardano is useful for a lot of things, and it could be useful for even more in the future.

10 stocks we like better than Cardano ›

Optionality is exciting, but successful investments typically have more to offer than optionality alone. If you're looking to deploy $1,000 of your capital into a leading cryptocurrency today, that distinction is key, because there are plenty of blockchains that claim to offer numerous options for how they might grow in the future, and only a few that can make a strong case to support the premise that they will actually durably grow in value over time.

That's the divide between Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA). So which asset is the better choice to invest $1,000 in?

Bitcoin's core advantages are both structural and durable.

Per its design, it gets harder to mine more Bitcoin over time, and only 21 million total Bitcoin will ever exist. That ceiling gets more claustrophobic for new buyers about every four years, when the protocol's halvings cut the rate of new issuance by 50%. And more than 19.9 million of those 21 million have already been mined.

This creates the conditions for an everlasting supply squeeze: If demand for the coin remains steady, a falling rate of issuance should put upward pressure on prices. Recently, the case that there will be persistent demand for new coins over the long term has been shored up by investment vehicles that buy and hold Bitcoin on investors' behalf, such as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital asset treasury (DAT) companies. Both of those new classes of buyers have deployed large, punctuated waves of capital into the crypto throughout 2024 and 2025. And in early October, weekly crypto ETF inflows set a new record high.

The investment thesis for Bitcoin is that it does not need new tech development in the form of faster throughput, a new virtual machine, or a killer app to stay relevant. It just needs to keep being scarce, credibly neutral relative to fiat currencies, and easy to own through mainstream wrappers. If those conditions persist, its floating supply will keep shrinking relative to potential buyers, and over multiyear horizons, the price will tend to adjust upward to clear the market.

In other words, Bitcoin can continue to gain value without changing anything substantive about itself.

In stark contrast to Bitcoin, Cardano is constantly under development, and as a result, it has plenty of tools and features that could drive growth in its use, and therefore in its demand.

It has a decent smart contract stack, albeit one that's being used by a much smaller pool of developers than its chief competitor, Ethereum. It also has a defined maximum supply of 45 billion ADA, which some investors cite as a comfort. And its chain has an ecosystem with a few decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, as well as other decentralized applications (dApps), and it has some stablecoins too.

The difficulty lies in getting some traction in any of the segments where it's vying for capital in the face of intense competition.

Based on objective usage and value-capture metrics, Cardano is not the favorite option in any major crypto segment today. Its DeFi footprint remains modest relative to leading chains -- its total value locked (TVL) is about $271 million, while its top competitors have tens of billions of dollars in TVL. Likewise, Cardano's on-chain activity shows the presence of a few committed communities and consistently improving developer tooling, but its network has yet to debut a breakout application or demonstrate category leadership that reliably pulls capital and developers from elsewhere at scale.

Could that change eventually? Possibly, but it would require Cardano to overcome some stiff barriers, like the network effects enjoyed by peers with vastly larger capital bases.

Assuming that Cardano dramatically deepens its main liquidity assets like stablecoins and creates clearer pathways for financial institutions to operate on its chain with confidence, it might climb the rankings. But that is a multistep process, and its competitors will not be standing still in the meantime. Other smart contract platforms are already entrenched, commanding the mindshare, liquidity, and integrations Cardano needs to dislodge.

Whereas Bitcoin benefits from a one-variable story about its supply that strengthens as the rate at which new coins can be mined falls, Cardano will need multiple things to go right at once. That stack of dependencies makes it a riskier bet, and one that's a lot less likely to pay off. The relative appeal of Bitcoin only gets stronger when considering that Cardano will need to continue to reinvent itself over time as the competitive landscape it lives in keeps evolving.

Therefore, if you're looking to allocate $1,000 today, Bitcoin is the better option. Its scarcity and institutional adoption make it a hard asset to beat for investors looking for an asset that can grow in value for years to come.
